Saison 5 Episode 7
"The Silence"

8
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,607
We should have gone to Toscana

9
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,997
Instead of seeing this stupid play.

10
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,534
Janice is my best friend.

11
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,300
This is her only son.

12
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,533
I think it was very
nice of him to invite us.

13
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,368
He's usually a very private person.

14
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,939
I'm not going
to go find him afterwards.

15
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,704
- And tell him what a brilliant director he is.
- Yes, you are.

16
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,000
Why do people invite
anybody to anything ?

17
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,567
- I have no idea.
- Two, please.

18
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,400
Let's go home, Masha !

19
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:14,300
- I'm staying here tonight.
- Masha, let's go !

20
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,133
The baby must be hungry.

21
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,965
Nonsense. Matryona will feed him.

22
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,834
It's a shame. Three nights
now without his mother.

23
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:24,067
You are becoming tiresome.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,410
In the old days, at least you'd philosophize,

25
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,427
But now it's always home
and by, home and baby.

26
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,067
That's all I ever hear from you.

27
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,666
- Let's go, Masha !
- Go yourself !

28
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,200
What is going on ?

29
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,133
I'll try.

30
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,300
- Peter ?
- Shut !

31
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,712
- Will you come home tomorrow ?
- Yes, tomorrow !

32
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,868
Stop bothering me !

33
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,675
What's this for, Mama ?

34
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,300
- Pyotor asked us
- Peter ?

35
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,812
Asked us...

36
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,579
There's something wrong with my husband.

37
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:58,094
- Please, shh !
- He,...

38
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,595
Oh, did he ask us to make up
a bed for him in kostya's room ?

39
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,427
- Talk to me !
- Yeah.

40
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,453
Old people are like children.

41
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:10,033
Well, I'm going. Goodbye, Masha.

42
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,534
- Goodbye, mother.

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,199
- Peter !
- Oh my God.

44
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,834
No !

45
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:19,430
What should we do ?

46
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,713
What's wrong ?

47
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:16,530
Hello ?

48
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,434
Hello.

49
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,400
Who is this ?

50
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,767
Who is this ?

51
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:30,708
Where is my wife ?

52
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,801
And where is my daughter ?

53
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:55,667
Hello ?

54
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,067
Nate, it's Maggie.

55
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:00,417
Are you okay ? What's wrong ?

56
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:04,767
I'm sorry to bother you.

57
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,400
I didn't know who else to call.

58
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,452
That's okay. What's going on ?

59
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,868
- Who is it ?
- Oh, God.

60
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:20,434
David, I can't find
the sports section.

61
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:25,156
- Have you seen it anywhere ?
- No.

62
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,767
The delivery guy probably
forgot to put it in again.

63
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,527
- He stinks. Then I'm out of here.

64
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,071
I'm gonna be late for Roger's.

65
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:36,033
That's fine. I have everything
under control here.

66
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,396
<i>-  Hand it over !
- You know...</i>

67
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,965
I hope you've been noticing how
much I've been watching my temper.

68
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,203
I am really trying to be patient,

69
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,234
- But those boys are not easy.
- Yes, I know they're not easy.

70
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:50,029
And if I forget you
remind me once a day.

71
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,167
Would you listen to him ? He's
just a sweet little kid, basically.

72
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,019
Yeah, I guess so.

73
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:05,974
oh yeah yeah !

74
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,752
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:17,575
Durrell, what the
hell are you doing now ?

76
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,437
- Watching TV !
- David, turn that off !

77
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,033
I can't find the remote. I
can never find the remote !

78
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,103
Where did you find those ?

79
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,932
Those tapes were in a locked box
underneath pile of old Ralph Lauren sheets

80
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,701
- Underneath our bed.
- Then you know where I found them.

81
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,655
Durrell, from now on when
something is in a locked box

82
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,617
Underneath a pile of old
sheets, that means it's private.

83
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,983
Fine.

84
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,157
Great.

85
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,327
Can we get ready for school ?

86
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,834
- We're gonna be really late again.
- Shit. I mean, shoot.

87
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:59,806
Get dressed, you guys. Come on. Now.

88
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,006
Let's go !

89
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,580
That went well.

90
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,831
Hey, Kirsten, are
you coming to doc's tonight ?

91
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,638
Yeah, baby ! I was going to my parent's,

92
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,968
But thank god, my mom
has a staph infection.

93
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,300
- Hey, johnny, you coming ?
- Yeah, baby.

94
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,303
How about it, Claire ?

95
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:24,334
Hang on, I just have
to finish this one thing.

96
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,300
There.

97
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:32,310
Yeah, a bunch of us are
going to doc's after work.

98
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,868
The bar inhe mall ? Doc hannigan's ?

99
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,534
That's just 'cause
it's the closest place,

100
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,634
And they have pitchers.
Everyone from work goes there.

101
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,220
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

102
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,968
Come on, Claire. You think
your shit don't stink ?

103
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,100
No, I think my shit stinks.

104
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,525
Great. So you coming then ?

105
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,782
Maybe another time.

106
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,602
Okay, fine. I guess we'll just
have to talk about you all night.

107
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,149
Yeah, baby.

108
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,280
There's something
nice about being alone.

109
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,868
It's like finally I can just relax.

110
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,282
I made George the focus of my life.

111
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:18,868
First when we got married, and
then even more so when he got sick.

112
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:20,809
It's just not healthy, right ?

113
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,534
One person's "healthy"
is another person's "sick. "

114
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,037
Some women have to make someone
else the focus of their life

115
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:28,200
Or they lose their minds.

116
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:30,176
No judgments.

117
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:35,467
It's an exciting time for me. There's
a world out there I've been missing.

118
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,857
- Are you managing to keep yourself busy ?
- Am I ever.

119
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,790
There are so many cultural
events in this city

120
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,008
I've always wanted to participate in.

121
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,200
Last week, I learned all about
cabbala at the skirball center.

122
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:51,067
And dutton's in brentwood is having a
jay mcinerney reading the day after next.

123
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,334
- Now who's that ?
- He's the guy who wrote "bright lights, big city. "

124
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,767
I knew his old coke dealer. Sweet guy.

125
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,999
It's the 20th anniversary of that book.

126
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:01,868
I figured it was time
for me to finally read it.

127
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:06,176
Oh, Victoria, you get together
is tomorrow night already-

128
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,634
Don't worry, everyone's invited.

129
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:12,735
Do you need anything ? I could
bring my famous potato salad.

130
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,133
That's sweet, but please don't worry.

131
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,285
Everything's taken care of.

132
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,729
So it's between this one and this one.

133
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,667
Which one do you like better ?

134
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:28,285
- I like this one.
- Yeah ?

135
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:30,571
- But
- This one's nice too.

136
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,500
Exactly !

137
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,501
Oh, they're both great.

138
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,885
Excuse me. Thanks.

139
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,328
Hello ?

140
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,203
Yes.

141
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:48,570
Yes.

142
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,007
Okay.

143
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,988
Okay.

144
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,000
Sure.

145
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,627
Thanks.

146
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,791
So have you decided ?

147
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,528
I'll come back sometime.

148
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,606
I didn't have this
appointment in the books.

149
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,482
Maggie called me in
the middle of the night.

150
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,601
The deceased is a friend
of hers from church.

151
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:29,608
- Maggie is a quaker ?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:34,567
- George was a quaker ?
- No no. She converted when she got married.

153
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:37,026
What exactly are quakers ?

154
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,234
They're very peaceful...

155
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,862
Yeah well, everyone knows that.

156
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:46,238
- Have you seen Rico ?
- He said he had something important to do.

157
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,400
I'll be right in.

158
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,267
Hello ?

159
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:54,698
Obviously these
are not the results we expected.

160
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,302
But there's no reason
to assume the worst.

161
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,514
The blood test was positive,

162
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,257
Which indicates potentially that the
baby may have some sort of disorder

163
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,926
Like what ?

164
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:09,067
Such as down's or Spina Bifida.

165
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,457
However, this test is
extremely inconclusive.

166
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:16,055
Over 95% of babies who test positive
have neither of these two things.

167
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,153
So what's the point of it then ?

168
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:20,501
To get more information.

169
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,290
Given these results I recommend
we do an amniocentesis.

170
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:26,618
I didn't even want to take the stupid
test. Everyone said it would be fine.

171
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:30,090
I want to schedule the amnio
for as soon as possible.

172
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,501
- No need to panic yet.
- Yeah, right.

173
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,194
Hey. What are you doing home ?

175
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,072
I made up a story and got
off of work for a few hours

176
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,856
"Cause" I knew it was your day off.

177
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:50,039
Day off, right. I went grocery
shopping, cleaned up the kitchen

178
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:53,396
And I'm the middle of my fourth load
of laundry. It's been a real party.

179
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,567
You don't look busy now.

180
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,434
This is my first chance to
get a breath. I'm reading.

181
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,434
- Rico ?
- Yeah ?

182
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:04,403
- What are you doing ?
- Trying to relax you.

183
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,728
I can relax myself.

184
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:11,088
As long as you're here you can take
out your stuff in the back closet

185
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,499
Like you said you would three days ago.

186
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh.

187
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,191
Sure.

188
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:26,300
I don't know why you wouldn't
go out with those people.

189
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,400
Sometimes you think you're
better than everyone else.

190
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,300
- hopefully I am.
- Well, you're not.

191
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:33,978
Anyway, I'm exhausted.

192
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:37,567
I had no idea doing nothing
all day could be so tiring.

193
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,851
When I was your age I had so much energy.

194
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,060
Besides, I want to try
to do some work tonight.

195
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,192
Oh, what are you working on now ?

196
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,578
Actually, nothing. I am totally dry.

197
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,675
I haven't even been to my desk in weeks,

198
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,710
Because every time I
sit down and try to think

199
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,411
Of how I want to express
myself I just come up empty.

200
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,601
It's like this giant abyss

201
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,504
With total, like, stillness.

202
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:08,767
It's kind of the loneliest
feeling in the entire world.

203
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,176
Oh.

204
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:17,701
Well, uh, you'd better
hurry up and change.

205
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:20,122
Dinner will be ready soon.

206
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,945
Those stupid telemarketers !

207
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,999
You know, I'm gonna become more involved

208
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:29,286
In those organizations
that get them outlawed.

209
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:31,340
Hello !

210
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,443
Oh, hello, George.

211
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,440
"Come over tonight" ?

212
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,617
No.

213
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,300
I don't see why this

214
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:41,980
Fine. I'm very busy,

215
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:44,324
But I'll try and stop
by tomorrow afternoon.

216
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,498
I'm sorry, George. I can't chat now.

217
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,767
Okay. Bye.

218
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,324
- Is he okay ?
- I'm sure he's fine.

219
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,707
Whatever's going on with him
I'm not gonna get sucked into it.

220
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,083
- I have my own life now.
- Maybe he's just lonely.

221
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,694
You seem a lot more
sympathetic to him now

222
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:06,347
Than you did when he was living here.

223
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,200
It's always easier to be nice to people

224
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:11,372
When you don't have to see them.

225
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,366
You don't even know what a integer is.

226
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,716
I do so.

227
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,810
* yada yada yada *

228
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,614
* yada yada yada... *

229
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,401
I mean, I have a basic
idea of what an integer is.

230
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:28,495
Integers are numbers...

231
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,269
* blah blah blah... *

232
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,767
- Am I in trouble ?
- Of course not.

233
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,635
But maybe you should listen to
your music in the other room.

234
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,734
I'll just stay here and be quiet.

235
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, where were we ?

236
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,582
- Integers-
- David ?

237
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,270
I thought you said you
were gonna be quiet.

238
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,562
- I think something's burning.
- Fuck !

239
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,334
All right, it was
wrong of me to say that.

240
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:57,578
We don't use language like that.

241
00:14:57,686 --> 00:15:00,194
- Can I get that ?
- Of course, durrell, you live here now.

242
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,885
You don't have to ask
if you can get the phone.

243
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,067
Hello ?

244
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,167
Oh, hey.

245
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:11,534
It's your lover.

246
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,100
Do I have a lover ?

247
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:16,217
From now on you can just say it's Keith.

248
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,004
- Yes, master.
- Durrell, I told you I don't like that joke.

249
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:21,918
- Give me my discman !
- Ouch ! You're hurting me !

250
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:25,303
Both of you, out of here,
now ! Just get out of this room !

251
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,696
- You boy !
- You half a man.

252
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:30,000
- Hello.
- Hey.

253
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:31,834
I'm not gonna make it for dinner.

254
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:33,599
Sissy and the kids are in town.

255
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:35,500
I've got to take them
to Geoffrey's in Malibu.

256
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:38,307
- Well, lah-Di-Dah ! - What's
that supposed to mean ?

257
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,406
You know what ? Nothing. I'm just
in the middle of five things here.

258
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:45,638
You have fun you know
and I'll see you later.

259
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,467
I hate you, you pig.

260
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,738
You smell like cow manure.

261
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:02,296
What are you doing ?

262
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,515
I was just cleaning things up.

263
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,975
You were reading my private stuff.

264
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,766
I thought we had rules about
other people's private stuff !

265
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,501
She suffered from
of self-Esteem issues, dr. Benett ?

266
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,276
Yes, a lot of those
stem from her childhood traumas.

267
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,557
But some stem from the size
of her nose and her weak chin.

268
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,881
Those are the ones i
can do something about.

269
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,576
Are you pleased with the results ?

270
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:31,013
I am, but mary's going
to be the real judge

271
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,834
When she looks into the
mirror for first time tonight.

272
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:47,158
Oh, you didn't tell me what time
i need to get off work tomorrow.

273
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,133
Just come home whenever you want.

274
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:54,519
No, I mean did you hear what time
we're supposed to go in for the...

275
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,078
The amnio.

276
00:16:56,144 --> 00:17:00,510
I've been thinking I don't really
think the amnio's such a good idea.

277
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:05,267
Well, melnick seemed to think it was.

278
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:06,938
She acted like we had to have it.

279
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,858
no no, she said the
results were very inconclusive.

280
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:14,346
I think we should just move on
and try not to think about it.

281
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,374
But I thought we decided
that we were gonna-

282
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,754
No, I didn't decide anything.

283
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,334
I don't want an amnio.

284
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,801
You know, they can cause miscarriage.

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,767
- What are we gonna do ?
- Well, we wait for later, ultrasound,

286
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:31,064
And then we get more information.

287
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,538
But if there's a problem
we should know about it now.

288
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,229
Why ?

289
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:40,252
- So that we can take care of it.
- What does that mean ?

290
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,214
- You know what that means.
- I don't want to get rid of this baby.

291
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:45,242
And I'm not going to no matter what.

292
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,233
If we find out there's a problem,
we'll deal with that then.

293
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,901
- Okay, if that's how you feel.
- Yeah, that's how I feel.

294
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:58,834
Is it how you feel ?

295
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,434
I don't know.

296
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,834
So what's the big deal ?

297
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,411
Durrell's in some assembly and
he didn't invite us. So what ?

298
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,947
So we're his parents, keith.

299
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:25,435
We're supposed to go
see him in school things.

300
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:28,266
What did he say when you asked
him why he didn't invite us ?

301
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,773
Uh, he just mumbled
something about killing us

302
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,102
If we tried to go to it.

303
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,734
Well, maybe we should
listen to him and not go.

304
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,646
i couldn't sleep all night

305
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,327
Thinking about having all
this porn in the house.

306
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:46,369
Shit !

307
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:49,332
Just help me, you asshole.

308
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,125
okay.

309
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,890
What's his reason for not
wanting us to go to the assembly ?

310
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,947
This one we're keeping.

311
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,834
Do you think it's because we're
gay and he's ashamed of us ?

312
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,731
He's not the one that's
ashamed about us being gay.

313
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,595
This is not about being
gay, it's about porn.

314
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,163
It's probably something as simple

315
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,529
As he doesn't want us there
to see him forget his lines

316
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:16,679
And get that dumbass look that kids
get on their face in those things.

317
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,703
Maybe.

318
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,698
We better get going. We've
got other huge bag in the back.

319
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,303
Federico...

320
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,069
Can you tell me if this
mayonnaise has gone bad ?

321
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:42,590
All mayonnaise smells bad to me.

322
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,267
Making your potato salad, huh ?

323
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,717
What's the big occasion ?

324
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:56,801
I'm going to a
party tonight-

325
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,280
At victoria adams's house.

326
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:03,407
- She was in "more for me. "
- Oh yeah, I saw that show once or twice.

327
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,172
- It seemed sort of stupid.
- She's a friend of mine.

328
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,767
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:16,247
So, uh, how are things with you now ?

330
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,580
Now that you're, you know, single ?

331
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,012
They're wonderful.

332
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:26,050
I've been to a lot of interesting
cultural events lately.

333
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,548
In fact, if you want to,

334
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:31,754
You could come to a jay mcinerney
reading with me tomorrow.

335
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,426
Oh... I'll take a pass.

336
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:36,721
I've got be with vanessa and the kids.

337
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,901
I understand.

338
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,534
Do you think this has too much dill ?

339
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,764
You must be very happy now
that you're back with vanessa.

340
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,590
Vanessa's a very forgiving woman.

341
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:57,318
Actually, she isn't.

342
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,782
She never wants to sleep with me.

343
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,379
No matter what I do or say
i can't get her to look at me

344
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,083
With that same hunger she used to have.

345
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,562
It's so painful.

346
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,735
The most horrible part
is when I look at her,

347
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,134
I still get so fucking hard.

348
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:14,566
You know, masturbating can
relieve some of the tension.

349
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,275
There were long periods
in my marriage to nathaniel

350
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,533
When he was constantly masturbating.

351
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:20,862
I want passion !

352
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,764
I want my wife to want me so
bad that every time I walk by

353
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:25,862
She wants to squeeze
my ass and grab my-

354
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:27,195
Federico ?

355
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:31,383
Uh, yeah.

356
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,017
Too much dill.

357
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,026
Hmm...

358
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:40,346
So finally I say to
these guys at the next table,

359
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,299
"Look, here's the line and here's you. "

360
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,435
Hey !

361
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,299
- Oh, hey, ted.
- Hey.

362
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,411
Oh, marianne, you think I can get
those asbestos documents later today ?

363
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,388
- Oh, yeah, sure. Is 5:00 okay ?
- Yeah, baby.

364
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:02,491
That's great. What is that ?

365
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,571
Oh, it's nothing.

366
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:07,609
- I'm ted, by the way. We haven't met.
- Claire.

367
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,961
Yeah, ted's the lowest-Paid
lawyer in the office,

368
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,400
So you don't have to suck up
to him as much as the rest.

369
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:16,712
You guys looked like you
were having fun last night.

370
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,707
Marianne, were those guys at the
next table trying to pick you up ?

371
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,238
Yeah, baby.

372
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:25,486
- Are you gonna go tonight ?
- I'm gonna try and make it.

373
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,913
Later !

374
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:30,801
- Bye, ted.
- Later.

375
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:59,048
Oh, hey. It's me.

376
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,400
Do you want to have lunch ?

377
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:37,382
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late, darling.

378
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,883
But I was just in the middle
of all this paperwork.

379
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,884
Yeah, so I see.

380
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:47,795
Okay okay.
Cat's out of the bag.

381
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,672
- What do you think of him ?
- Did you see his ass ?

382
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:52,569
No, I didn't.

383
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:55,396
- Who is this person ?
- Oh, he's this brilliant therapist

384
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,161
Who studied with gareth feinberg.

385
00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:00,194
Actually, you know what ? I think
you met him once a long time ago.

386
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,105
Anyways, so we ran into each other
at a party a couple of weeks ago.

387
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:06,494
And, you know, one
thing led to the other.

388
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:08,907
- You know how that is.
- No, not really.

389
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:11,654
Come on, don't judge me, dear.

390
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,161
God, I wonder if anybody else saw us.

391
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,752
What's the big deal ? Don't
you and olivier have rules

392
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,330
Like you and dad did ?

393
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:21,832
Oh, if only olivier were
that emotionally mature.

394
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,626
No, he has some very antiquated
ideas about relationships.

395
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:28,513
Yeah, well, people are strange.

396
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:34,292
Darling, let's try and have
some nice girl time, shall we ?

397
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,081
Isn't that why you called ?

398
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,447
Yeah, I guess so.

399
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:44,344
So, I've been thinking this baby is
going to wreak havoc on your body.

400
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:47,447
Let me give you the number of
this brilliant gyrotonic trainer

401
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,630
Who will just change your life.

402
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,776
I can't wait.

403
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,128
So that's the end of the walk-Through.

404
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:58,541
Don't worry about tomorrow. We
will take care of everything.

405
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:01,250
Uh, one more thing-

406
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,738
There isn't going to be another
funeral in the other room ?

407
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:06,311
No, of course not.

408
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:10,682
I can assure you you won't hear anything
During your silent centering time.

409
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,100
Except a few grumbling
tummies, I suppose.

410
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,851
Oh, mrs. Burns, if you
wouldn't mind signing

411
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,593
Some of those forms I told you about...

412
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,300
Of course.

413
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:30,715
"Silent centering time" ?

414
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,588
Silent worship.

415
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:36,710
We believe that god is within all of us.

416
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:38,696
If we get together and are silent

417
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,367
Hopefully we each hear
something from god.

418
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:45,184
What if you don't ?

419
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,569
You make something up.

420
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,968
At least I do.

421
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,612
How do you-

422
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:56,634
How do you know god's not
telling you what to make up ?

423
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,734
Nate, is something wrong ?

424
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,640
Are you sure
you don't want anything ?

425
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,311
I had an enormous sandwich for lunch.

426
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:10,133
Oh, okay.

427
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:17,682
You didn't happen to read Paul krugman's
editorial this morning, did you ?

428
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:20,405
He had this marvelous
take on bush-

429
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,701
George, why did you want to see me ?

430
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:30,194
This, uh, period of being alone

431
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,086
Has been very difficult for me, ruth.

432
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,447
Well, I've been doing
a lot of thinking-

433
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,710
I'm not getting back together with you.

434
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,274
I know that.

435
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,931
I just wanted to talk to
you about getting a divorce.

436
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:47,602
Well, of course that's what I want too.

437
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,738
Apparently, we just have
to live for six months

438
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:55,025
In separate residences,
then file some papers.

439
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,776
I think we should get a quicker divorce.

440
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:01,842
I've been doing some research,

441
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,968
And if one of us flies to,
say, haiti for the weekend

442
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,950
We can take care of
this thing a lot sooner.

443
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:10,992
- Is this really necessary ?
- I think it will be healthier

444
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:14,659
For our psyches if we
just, you know, move on.

445
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:19,601
You want to fly to haiti for a
quickie divorce just for our psyches ?

446
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:25,926
Ruth...

447
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,133
I'm engaged.

448
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:33,490
Her name is joy solomon.

449
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:36,668
I met her at a tea at
dean kekalos's house.

450
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,245
She's a women's studies
professor, visiting this semester.

451
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,767
We were both raised in missouri.

452
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,377
I guess I should have expected this.

453
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:51,086
Boy, I am some fool all right.

454
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:54,865
Listen, I know how this
must sound to you, but...

455
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:59,767
I'm in love.

456
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,100
I think I should go.

457
00:28:04,837 --> 00:28:07,076
Do you want to talk about your feelings ?

458
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:11,300
Strangely enough, i
don't think I have any.

459
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,579
Goodbye, george.

460
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,255
First off, the chances are that everything's

461
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:26,156
going to be okay with this baby.

462
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,237
But even if it's not...

463
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,067
It could still be okay.

464
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:37,033
How can you of all people say that ?

465
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,634
When the doctors first told
me that jesse was sick...

466
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:48,334
I was so scared.

467
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,843
We had to give him all these shots

468
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,960
That made him scream.

469
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:57,734
And then there were all
the useless operations.

470
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:00,260
But, nate...

471
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:04,030
All the horrible things don't
take away from what he gave me.

472
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:10,367
the first
time that jesse laughed ?

473
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:13,847
He used to...

474
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:17,697
He used to get so excited
to look at the moon.

475
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:20,340
He was only two,

476
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,932
But he was a person.

477
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,801
An amazing person.

478
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,124
And he was here such a short time,

479
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,758
I feel just incredibly lucky that

480
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:38,199
I got to know him.

481
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:41,300
It made me a bigger person.

482
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:44,852
And that's something all children do.

483
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,317
You guys don't want your parents
going to school things, right ?

484
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,566
Not really. Mom always tries to get
the teachers to validate her parenting.

485
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:01,584
And dad always slobbers over mr.
Janetti, the guy who teaches shop.

486
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:02,847
I knew I was right.

487
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:06,242
David thinks that we should go to
durrell's assembly against his will.

488
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:08,392
- But you agree with me ?
- Absolutely.

489
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,819
It sounds like durrell is trying
to assert his individual identity.

490
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,237
At least for now.

491
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,481
Gradually he'll come to
have some familial identity.

492
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,242
The important thing is not to force it.

493
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,983
Let him initiate at his own pace.

494
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,167
I've got write these
things down for david.

495
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,406
Oh, don't worry. I'll do it.

496
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:27,634
Oh, um... thanks.

497
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,871
All right, kirsten,
meet me at the elevator.

498
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:33,420
- First, I have to go potty.
- Yeah, baby.

499
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,796
Hey, johnny, you coming ?

500
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,561
Yeah, baby. But I'll meet you there.

501
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:42,645
- Uh, johnny ?
- Hey, have a good night, claire.

502
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:46,655
Oh, I was wondering, are
you guys going to doc's ?

503
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:00,683
Ruth !

504
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,415
I'm so glad you could make it.

505
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:09,425
I really want you to
meet my friend mitchell.

506
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,228
And what is this ?

507
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:14,298
- It's nothing. I just-
- Your famous potato salad.

508
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,866
Now I remember.

509
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:19,932
I told you not to bring
anything, you devil.

510
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:21,608
Here.

511
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:25,321
Let's just put it here
with everything else.

512
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,054
- It's too big.
- Nonsense.

513
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,951
Let's just push this stuff aside.

514
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,129
There.

515
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,326
Perfect.

516
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,110
Now start mingling.

517
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:39,622
No one's gonna bite you.

518
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:43,067
Well, maybe if you're
lucky someone will.

519
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:58,556
You know, I'm really not
drawn to mechanical animals.

520
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:02,683
Me neither. I'm actually not really
drawn to live animals.

521
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,143
So are you seeing anyone ?

522
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:11,242
Oh, I was living with
this guy for a while.

523
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,843
What happened ?

524
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,838
Uh, we broke up.

525
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,861
And now I hear he's left town.

526
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:20,157
Probably to go to some
overpriced loony bin.

527
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:23,534
He's kind of a nutjob.

528
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,044
I don't know why I just said that.

529
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,036
He's a great guy.

530
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,519
He's really unique.

531
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,790
And the whole
thing was just-

532
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:37,249
I don't think I was
ready for something real,

533
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,845
Like something with challenges.

534
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,647
And he was in a different place than me.

535
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,945
- He's a little older.
- I'm seeing an older guy.

536
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:46,427
Actually, he's just
a year and half older.

537
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,238
Really ? What's he do ?

538
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,685
Lawyer.

539
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,951
Yeah.

540
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:55,782
From the office.

541
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,090
We're trying to keep it quiet.

542
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:59,778
Oh my god. Who is he ?

543
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,209
What ? Ted ?

544
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,502
I've never seen you two together.

545
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,850
Oh, well, we're trying
to be cool about it.

546
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,004
I mean it's still sort of new.

547
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:16,838
See we hooked up at hong fu's
birthday party in november,

548
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:19,262
Then we didn't talk for like a month.

549
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,169
Then we were both here
a couple of weeks ago

550
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:24,197
And ended up fooling around
in the guys' bathroom.

551
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,586
It's really rank in there.

552
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,954
So now you're dating ?

553
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:32,178
I think we will be soon.

554
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:34,109
We just need to take
it to that next place

555
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:37,589
As soon as he deals with
some of his intimacy issues.

556
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:41,521
Sure. I get it.

557
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,285
I really should watch more sitcoms.

558
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,777
I keep meaning to, but i
never know when they're on.

559
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:52,173
I just did a spot on the new
jennifer love hewitt show.

560
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:54,608
Sweet girl.

561
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:02,061
Well, uh, mitchell...

562
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:05,072
Yeah.

563
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:15,267
Ruth !

564
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:18,933
You look so forlorn
standing here all alone.

565
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:24,092
Let's circle and see if we can
find some nice quirky guy for you.

566
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:25,999
Thanks, cindy. But I don't think so.

567
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:29,168
- Oh, come on, ruth. It'll be fun.
- No, it won't be fun.

568
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:31,216
I am seven million years old.

569
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,804
And I have this emptiness
that won't go away.

570
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:36,134
I've gone everywhere
and I've done everything.

571
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,340
I even went to the
stupid skirball center.

572
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,377
And I am still all alone.

573
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:43,440
Everyone else gets to find
someone just like that.

574
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,620
So I'm done. That's it !

575
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:48,059
I just want to be left alone so
i can shrivel up in peace. Please !

576
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:51,157
Okay.

577
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,724
Thanks.

578
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,264
Yeah, baby !

579
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,283
- Yeah, baby !
- Yeah, baby !

580
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:33,634
- Claire !
- Oh, hey.

581
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:36,808
- I've been doing some research on you.
- Oh, really ?

582
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,706
Yeah, I heard you're, like,
this amazing artist,

583
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:42,213
Had a show and everything.
That's pretty impressive.

584
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,213
Oh, I think you have me
confused with someone else.

585
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:48,551
Really ? I don't think so.

586
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:57,077
So what are you, like, some guy who
always knew he wanted to be a lawyer ?

587
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,856
To tell you the truth, it was
just the easiest path for me.

588
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,771
I like being a lawyer.

589
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,818
It's just one part of my life though.

590
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:09,466
Sounds interesting.

591
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:11,692
If you're really interested,

592
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,640
Maybe some time I could
show you the other parts.

593
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:20,222
I should be getting back to the table.

594
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:23,100
Do you want to join us ?

595
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,653
I should get back to my friends.

596
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,043
I don't care what those
two freaks of nature said.

597
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,818
I am going to this assembly
tomorrow, and that's that.

598
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:39,165
- Why ?
- Because it's important.

599
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:41,142
Kids should look out into the audience

600
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,616
And have someone rooting for them.

601
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,536
You know when I was in seventh grade
i was a sailor in "anything goes. "

602
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:48,902
I know. You bring it up once a week.

603
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:53,545
well, my mother
came but my father didn't.

604
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:55,606
- Why not ?
- Plane crash.

605
00:36:55,644 --> 00:36:58,564
He had to deal with a
whole family that died.

606
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,874
We had this ritual in my family

607
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:03,343
That whenever one of us
was in a thing at school

608
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:07,010
We would always go to marie
callender's for boston cream pie after.

609
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:09,465
I hate boston cream pie.

610
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,001
anyway, we went without
him but it wasn't the same.

611
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,465
I still say tate and enzo have a point.

612
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:18,686
- Of course you do.
- What's that supposed to mean ?

613
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,710
Keith, you'll seize on anything

614
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,583
Not to be a parent to these two kids.

615
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,451
- You're barely here.
- I have to work.

616
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,353
When you are here, you
hardly talk to them.

617
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,480
I'm not allowed to.
You made sure of that.

618
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,268
I just don't want you to yell at them.

619
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,550
That doesn't mean you
have to avoid them.

620
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,498
This whole thing sucks.
I'm doing this all alone

621
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:38,869
Without getting any credit
for being a single parent.

622
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,437
Fine. Then you can go
by yourself tomorrow

623
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,386
Because I think it's
the wrong thing to do.

624
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:46,038
Don't you feel anything
for these poor kids ?

625
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:48,921
- Don't you have a soul ?
- Of course I have a soul.

626
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:51,113
That's a terrible thing
to say about your partner.

627
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:55,104
Yeah, well, it's a terrible
thing to feel about your partner.

628
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:24,851
That was amazing.

629
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:27,306
That's nice, sweetie.

630
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,654
That's okay.

631
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:47,222
You don't have to do that.

632
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:50,038
What do you mean ?

633
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:54,419
- Don't you wanna come ?
- No. I'm good.

634
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,000
Okay.

635
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:15,935
So now my mother is fucking this guy
once a week after his gestalt seminar.

636
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,287
Don't you thin she's depressing ?

637
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:19,869
Not really.

638
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,851
What's depressing is her
being with some asshole

639
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,189
Who pontificates about art all the time.

640
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:27,879
I think it's great your
mother's having a good time.

641
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,981
What about penelope ?

642
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,085
Who's penelope ?

643
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:38,282
A name for the baby if it's a girl.

644
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:42,441
I don't really feel like talking
about baby names right now.

645
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:46,567
Well, is there something
you want to talk about ?

646
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:50,037
Yes ! I hate the name penelope.
Penelope's pretentious.

647
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:52,009
"Penelope thinks she's
so great when she's not. "

648
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:54,614
I don't even know anybody
who'd want a penelope.

649
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,506
You're really mad at me, aren't you ?

650
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,197
oh, spare me.

651
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:01,995
You want me to go to a doctor, make sure
everything's all right with the baby.

652
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,239
And if it isn't, you want me to kill it ?

653
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,924
Jesus, you don't have
to put it that way.

654
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:07,638
- Well ?
- Yes, that's what I want.

655
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:11,506
And I don't see what's wrong with that.
We can try again.

656
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:17,497
I was just talking with maggie, And
she was telling me how difficult it is

657
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:21,347
And how many sacrifices she had
to make when her child was sick.

658
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:23,849
How many financial problems she
and her husband ended up having.

659
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:26,891
And just how fucking hard it is.

660
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,657
Did she regret having him ?

661
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:32,633
- Look, that is not the point.
- Why not ?

662
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,378
Because you and I aren't Maggie,
she's better than we are.

663
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,106
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean ?

664
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:40,024
And what about maya ? Bringing
a sick child into the house

665
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:42,409
Would be very difficult
for her. It's not fair.

666
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,987
I mean, did you ever think of her ?

667
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:48,024
I think maya would love
whoever this child is.

668
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,930
- She's a very loving person.
- Oh, unlike me ?

669
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:42,184
- Brenda ! Yoo-Hoo !
- Oh, shit !

670
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,334
Brenda, honey !

671
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:49,234
Honey ! Didn't you hear me ?

672
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,300
Oh. God, no. Sorry.

673
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,334
Oh, well, don't mind me.

674
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:55,834
I'm just dropping this
off. It's for the baby.

675
00:41:56,588 --> 00:42:00,534
You just popped in unexpectedly
to drop off an expensive gift ?

676
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,160
Uh, well, olivier was
asking some questions

677
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:06,996
About how come lunch took so long.

678
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:08,601
I see.

679
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,907
Oh, I need you to cover for me, honey,

680
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,738
Just in case he calls you
in one of his drunken rages.

681
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,044
Well, why don't we just open this up

682
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:21,934
So you can tell me why
the baby won't like it ?

683
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:26,570
Honey ?

684
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,351
I'm really glad you decided
to come. It means a lot to me.

685
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:41,863
Yeah, well, I've always wanted to see

686
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,294
The musical celebration
of, uh, "biodiversity. "

687
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,266
Now remember if you see
durrell look in our direction

688
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:49,901
Just scrunch down.

689
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:51,759
What do you mean ?

690
00:42:51,787 --> 00:42:53,947
I didn't tell him we
were going to be here.

691
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:56,891
- Why not ?
- Because I'm scared of him.

692
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:00,351
I thought the whole point of this
was to give him emotional support.

693
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,731
We are. He just doesn't know it.

694
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:04,901
Let's keep it that
way. Ooh, it's starting.

695
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:19,318
* we are plants, we are animals *

696
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:24,365
* we are people and
we share this planet. *

697
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,248
Oh, really, darling. I don't
see what the big deal is.

698
00:43:27,443 --> 00:43:29,298
Thanks, mom. That
makes me feel a lot better.

699
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,734
Oh well, all couples have
these kinds of disagreements.

700
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:36,068
You think I didn't want
to abort you and Billy ?

701
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,842
But your father talked
me out of it both times

702
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:42,091
And the rest is history.

703
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,239
Honey, the most important thing
is that you and Nate are a team.

704
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:49,014
You have to see each other
as allies not as enemies.

705
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,451
Well, how do I do that ?

706
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:53,751
Well, honestly, by looking
at it from his side.

707
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:56,868
- Do you really think he has a point ?
- Actually, I do.

708
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,155
I mean, life is so fucking
hard even when it's easy.

709
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:03,601
So why not try and make it
less challenging if we can ?

710
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,972
I, I understand.

711
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:12,423
No, I can hold.

712
00:44:15,878 --> 00:44:18,244
Is someone there ?

713
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:21,615
Hello ?

714
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:28,028
- How can I help you ?
- I'm not sure.

715
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:31,193
I was supposed to go to a
Jay Mcinerney book signing,

716
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:33,535
But I some how when I got it he car

717
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:35,399
I drove over here and looked
you up in the directory.

718
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:37,632
And now here I am.

719
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,975
I'm Ruth,

720
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,013
George Sibley's wife.

721
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:46,721
You're Joy Solomon, his fiancee, right ?

722
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:50,909
No, I'm still here.

723
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:53,300
But I think I need to call you back.

724
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:04,213
* but if I mine too much it'll
cause water pollution and such... *

725
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:16,220
* I am an elm tree, don't overplant me *

726
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:20,767
* I need to be surrounded
by other trees *

727
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:26,702
* or else I'll die of
dutch elm disease... *

728
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:36,032
* I am a coral reef... *

729
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,760
* blow, Gabriel, blow *

730
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,900
* blow, Gabriel, blow *

731
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:46,200
* I've been a sinner,
I've been a scamp *

732
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:48,623
* but now I'm willing to trim my lamp *

733
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,133
* so, blow, Gabriel *

734
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:53,661
* blow ! *

735
00:45:57,253 --> 00:46:00,609
- David.
- Oh, sorry.

736
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:03,567
Why did you even have a bomb shelter ?

737
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,999
That's not the point. The point
is he barricaded himself down there

738
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,368
Looking like some kind of mountain man.

739
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:11,871
When they finally pulled him out
and put him in the mental hospital,

740
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,185
Well, that's when the
really crazy stuff began.

741
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,457
Please, stop.

742
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:17,373
Please, just...

743
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:21,400
I knew he seemed a little
too good to be true.

744
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,334
But I didn't care.

745
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,067
I was just so happy to meet someone

746
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:27,200
Who said he wouldn't
mind having children.

747
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:30,200
Oh my god ! Children ?

748
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:34,400
George means well I suppose, but he's
not exactly great father material.

749
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:36,133
What do you mean ?

750
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,467
I cagive you his son
kyle's phone number.

751
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:41,734
He's sweet, but scarred for life.

752
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,734
Maybe it's not in here.

753
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,601
I can just call with it later.

754
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:51,467
You seem...

755
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:55,454
How do I know you're not
just some crazy person ?

756
00:46:55,724 --> 00:46:57,534
Do I look like a crazy person ?

757
00:46:57,908 --> 00:46:59,200
A little.

758
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:04,634
I'm trying to protect someone like
I wish someone had protected me.

759
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,601
Well, maybe none of this is really true.

760
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:09,501
Maybe you're just some
bitter angry psychopath.

761
00:47:09,562 --> 00:47:11,801
I am not angry !

762
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,934
Oh !

763
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,567
Did you tell her how you feel ?

764
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:38,334
Yeah. Yeah.

765
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,623
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

766
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,005
- Hey.
- Hey.

767
00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:51,304
Hi, Brenda.

768
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:52,934
Hello, Maggie.

769
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:57,968
Well, I guess I will take my seat.

770
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:07,133
It's sort of a bad time,
but I can talk for a second.

771
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:08,934
What's up ?

772
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:14,429
I came here to say that...

773
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,930
I felt I'd been a bit stubborn.

774
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:19,901
That somehow this whole thing
has come down to a choice

775
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:22,267
Between my marriage and this child.

776
00:48:22,378 --> 00:48:25,208
And it seemed reckless
to risk my marriage...

777
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:28,601
Over taking some stupid test.

778
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:30,667
Great.

779
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:34,567
But now that I'm standing
here looking at you...

780
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:39,868
We've been so separate

781
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,567
For a long time.

782
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,633
It's like we're together,
but we're not together.

783
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:48,586
And ve been thinking that it's me.

784
00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:52,102
That it's my fears or my hormones.

785
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:55,055
But I think that it's you.

786
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:56,958
It's us.

787
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:03,603
- Listen, Bren
No, don't touch me.

788
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,235
- Can we- ?
- Don't.

789
00:49:05,717 --> 00:49:07,337
How can I make you feel better ?
What do you want me to do ?

790
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:09,286
Oh, god ! Just do what you want !

791
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:12,028
For once in your life,
just do what you want.

792
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:13,748
Not what you think people want

793
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,779
Or what you should do.

794
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:18,539
"Cause" I don't give a fuck anymore.

795
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,206
Just- Would
you wait ?

796
00:49:33,326 --> 00:49:34,667
Oh, hey.

797
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:35,769
Hey.

798
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:44,968
Sorry. Excuse me.

799
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:46,334
Oh, sure.

800
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:01,803
You know, I was an artist
before I started working here.

801
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,334
Yeah.

802
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:07,098
- What ?
- I was in art school, I mean.

803
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:10,501
But I dropped out
"cause" I was sick of it.

804
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:13,601
And I thought I would have
more time to just create.

805
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:16,433
Except I've been a little uninspired,

806
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,705
So I haven't really been
doing much of anything.

807
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:20,531
And now it sort of feels
like maybe that's over,

808
00:50:20,636 --> 00:50:22,503
Which is kind of scary because

809
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:25,397
that's how I've always defined myself.

810
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:28,400
But then again, maybe it's kind
of freeing in a strange way.

811
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,376
Anyway, that's to answer
your question from last night.

812
00:50:34,585 --> 00:50:36,446
Oh, I'm glad you told me.

813
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:39,622
- Why ?
- I don't know.

814
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:47,149
I don't know what Kirsten
told you about anything.

815
00:50:47,695 --> 00:50:49,632
- She hasn't told me anything.
- About what ?

816
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,957
- Anything.
- Oh.

817
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,028
Well, she and I had sex once

818
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:57,857
And we made out once, and that was that.

819
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,467
I just wanted to make that clear.

820
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,634
So now I have and...

821
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,464
I'll go now.

822
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:24,968
You're home again ?

823
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:26,968
Yeah.

824
00:51:27,324 --> 00:51:29,367
I just came home for lunch.

825
00:51:30,928 --> 00:51:32,312
You ?

826
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:34,634
Lunch.

827
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:38,839
Good.

828
00:51:44,388 --> 00:51:46,367
I'm not gonna try to
make love to you again,

829
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:48,134
If that's what you're afraid of.

830
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:53,868
What's... what's going on here ?

831
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:56,262
I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm eating a tuna salad.

832
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,421
No, I mean with us. I
thought we were back together.

833
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:00,953
We are.

834
00:52:01,176 --> 00:52:03,200
Then what about sex ?

835
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,672
- What about it ? You got some last night.
- You didn't.

836
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:09,478
You got what you wanted. You're
back in your house with your kids.

837
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,159
What's the big fucking deal ?

838
00:52:12,557 --> 00:52:13,834
Wow.

839
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:18,167
Well, you obviously still hate me.

840
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:26,133
Why did you do this ?

841
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,254
Huh ?

842
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:30,634
Why did you ask me to move back in ?

843
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:44,458
- My goodness, what the...
- Ruth !

844
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:48,028
When did you start locking this door ?

845
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,133
George, I'm busy right now ! Go away !

846
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,793
What gives you the right to
say those things to my fiancee ?

847
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,020
It's none of your business !

848
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:59,028
It was my business when I had
to clean up your goddamned mess !

849
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:01,267
Please, I want to be alone right now !

850
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,067
You don't want to live with me !

851
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,801
You don't want to let me go !

852
00:53:04,868 --> 00:53:07,801
- What the hell do you want ?
- I don't know !

853
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:10,517
I'm completely out of
control, doing crazy things !

854
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:13,934
And missing my Jay MCinerney
reading at Dutton's in Brentwood !

855
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,413
Maybe I need help of some kind !

856
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:18,231
All I know is I hate you
and I wish you would leave !

857
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:21,634
Come back here !

858
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:23,167

860
00:53:25,897 --> 00:53:28,467
Durrell, you know we don't
use language like that.

861
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:31,742
And that was in my private
Kenneth Cole shoebox.

862
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,601
You know what I said about
people's private things.

863
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:36,467
Yeah.

864
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:41,739
Well, was I okay ?

865
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,909
Are you kidding ? You were
an incredible elm tree.

866
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,934
I totally believed you.

867
00:53:51,254 --> 00:53:53,501
Hey, what about me ?

868
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,767
Don't you want to know what I thought ?

00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,178
You were amazing.

870
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:05,252

some pie at Marie Callender's.

871
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:08,662

- Yeah, that's true.

872
00:54:09,544 --> 00:54:12,041
Well, go get Anthony, and tell him
to turn off that horrible music.

else. Anywhere you want.
