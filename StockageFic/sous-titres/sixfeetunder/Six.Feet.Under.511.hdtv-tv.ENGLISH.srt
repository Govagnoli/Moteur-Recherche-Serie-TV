Saison 5 Episode 11
"Static"

8
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:27,634
Are you still sure you wanna do it ?

9
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,267
Really ?

10
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:33,734
Are you ?

11
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,067
I brought the thing.

12
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,501
Then, yeah.

13
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:46,943
Okay.

14
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,234
Thank you.

00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,901
<i>... In a dark blue honda accord</i>

16
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,133
<i>Last seen heading
south on the 101.</i>

17
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:15,627
<i>According to officials,
the abduction took place ?</i>

18
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:18,285
<i>This morning around
6:50 at a school bus stop</i>

19
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,151
<i>Where eyewitnesses say that a tall
caucasian man in a hooded sweatshirt</i>

20
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,234
<i>Forced six-Year-Old
colleen platt into the car.</i>

21
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,364
Keith ?

22
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,640
- Keith ? !
- Hi.

23
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,300
Hi, could you go get Keith
and tell him that I need him ?

24
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,801
He and Durrell went to
go get some doughnuts.

25
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,223
They'll be right back.

26
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,303
Whose idea was that to get doughnuts ?

27
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,051
Durrell's.

28
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,300
Are you sick ?

29
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,033
No, I'm just waking up.

30
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,261
My face came off last night.

31
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,053
What ?

32
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,473
What did you just say ?

33
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,997
My face keeps coming
off when I go to bed.

34
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,241
Wake me up !

35
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,685
<i>... body of young Sarah Davis</i>

36
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:01,900
<i>Was recovered last
night in Fontana.</i>

37
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:03,937
<i>Authorities had been
searching in that case</i>

38
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,767
<i>For what eyewitnesses had claimed
was a dark-Blue nissan maxima.</i>

39
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:10,701
<i>But now they are saying the
two incidents are related.</i>

40
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,501
<i>Weather forecast...</i>

41
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,534
- Keith ?
- Hey.

42
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,267
I'm gonna take the boys to school.

43
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,634
Oh, okay. Thanks for...

44
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,901
Letting me sleep.

45
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,701
Hey, have you heard about the,

46
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,771
They think this guy's on
the loose or something ?

47
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,235
Or did I just dream that ?

48
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,681
No, I just saw it on
the news downstairs.

49
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,253
- Walk the boys into school ?
- Sure.

50
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,734
Are you all right ?

51
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,274
I just had a hard time waking up.

52
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,004
I'm all right. It was just
a bad dream like people have.

53
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,890
- Are you sure ?
- Yeah.

54
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:07,038
Look, it's been almost
six weeks since...

55
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,860
You know.

56
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:14,803
It's time, right, for me
to get it together ?

57
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:19,756
It's time when you feel that it's time.

58
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,530
I'll call you when I drop the boys off.

59
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:26,028
All right, thanks.

60
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,445
- Thanks for breakfast.
- Anytime.

61
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,767
- What's this ?
- It's Maya's medical history.

62
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,729
Oh. Where did you find it ?

63
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,069
It slipped between the
files in the second file box.

64
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,167
It was on the bottom underneath.

65
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,989
And I got the directions to
the pediatrician's new office.

66
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,806
- They're in there on the top.
- You're amazing.

67
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,362
You want me to come
with ? To the doctors ?

68
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:07,948
God, I don't know.

69
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,976
No, you know, I think it'll be
better If the hand-Off is

70
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,106
Just Ruth and me and Maya.

71
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,580
Thanks, though.

72
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:19,559
It'll be good to have
her back in the house.

73
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,133
Yeah yeah, it will.

74
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,947
Ow !

75
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,878
Can I ?

76
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,045
Sure.

77
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,763
Foot.

78
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:36,822
Somebody wants out.

79
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,230
Two more months.

80
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:41,667
Wow.

81
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,514
I'm not drunk.

82
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,960
It seems like you are.

83
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:57,312
I'm not.

84
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,585
Claire, you fell asleep
at your desk this morning

85
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,089
Twice. And I can smell it.

86
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,872
- You can't smell vodka.
- I can.

87
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,909
Anyway, you're being
a little fucking bitch.

88
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:14,388
All right, Claire,
we're all really sorry

89
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,430
- That your brother died.
- Really ?

90
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,788
Yeah, really.

91
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,311
But you've been drunk or high at work

92
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:24,044
Like every day this week and
it's starting to scare people.

93
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,239
I mean, I've told them all
to give you a break, but

94
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:29,605
Well, this doesn't feel like
much of a fuckin' break, Kirsten.

95
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,116
Being followed into the bathroom and

96
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:34,486
Lectured at by some schoolteacher.

97
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:37,023
Just go home for the day
and sleep it off, okay ?

98
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,934
I won't tell.

99
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:40,929
- You won't tell ?
- No.

100
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,909
- Who won't you tell ?
- Human resources.

101
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,548
- There's no one to fuckin' tell
- I'll tell human resources !

102
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,263
God damn it ! Go ! Tell, tell, tell !

103
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,936
Okay, okay ! I am wicked pissed !

104
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,670
You are gonna be so fired !

105
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:54,726
Yeah, well, I'm fucking Ted.

106
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:59,430
- No way.
- Way.

107
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,260
- Marianne and Johnny...
- Didn't want to hurt your feelings.

108
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,868
Sorry.

109
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,498
God. Way.

110
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,243
Just... belongings.

111
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:26,631
- And I need you to file that for me.
- Okay.

112
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:29,178
- I think that I have everything.
- Yeah, you have everything.

113
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,508
- Come on.
- Good.

114
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,280
You're all doing really
important work here

115
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:39,651
And I'm sorry if I fucked
it up for anybody.

116
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,208
Why don't you just shut
up for a few seconds, okay ?

117
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,521
- Where are we going home ?
- No, I don't wanna go home.

118
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,659
Oh, we're going home.

119
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,857
- Everyone you know is gonna die.
- Claire come on, .

120
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,624
Let's go.

121
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,243
And that little Kirsten
is a fucking bitch !

122
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,567
Can you make him look whole again

123
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,473
For when the people come ?

124
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,322
I already have a call in to the company

125
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,634
That provides us with prosthetic limbs

126
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,646
Designed expressly for this purpose.

127
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,093
We want him to look like, you know,

128
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,844
Who he was as a person.

129
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,467
Not like

130
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,536
People should see more than
just what happened to him.

131
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,962
He'll look very natural.

132
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:21,954
I promise. And complete.

133
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,475
Thank you.

134
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,955
Can you stand him up and
make him walk around too ?

135
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,801
Oh, Holly, please
don't start that again.

136
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,743
Can make him maybe like
talk and tell everybody

137
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,127
It's all good and it's
really no problem to be dead ?

138
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,901
Maybe just stick your hand up
inside his head and, you know,

139
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,456
"Everything's fine ! Everything's fine !

140
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,002
Freedom, freedom, freedom !"

141
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,691
If you dress Paul up in that uniform

142
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:43,482
- Holly, stop it !
- No, mom.

143
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,469
And put fake arms and legs on him and
make it looked like it all worked out

144
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,660
- What's so wrong with that ?
- It's not real !

145
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:52,758
I don't care what's real ! I
don't wanna see him like that !

146
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,451
Are we gonna tell the people who come
to the funeral he killed himself too.

147
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,320
- Are we ?
- No.

148
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:00,877
With a drug that people
use to put dogs to sleep ?

149
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,894
Is that how you want your
brother to be remembered ?

150
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,623
I said no.

151
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,805
He gave himself a
hypodermic of pentobarbital.

152
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,772
We don't know how he got a hold of it.

153
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,011
I think maybe a night nurse.

154
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,973
They're so understaffed
over there right now

155
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,111
They're taking anybody.

156
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,764
I don't know why you always
Have to rub people's faces in it.

158
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,567
It is such a violent impulse.

159
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,166
Should we have tubes put in her ears ?

160
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,496
No.

161
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,894
It's a whole surgical procedure

162
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,701
Under general anesthetic
to put those tubes in.

163
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:42,278
She gets these ear
infections so often lately.

164
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,045
It doesn't seem right.

165
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:47,541
Well, we can ask the
doctor if he'd put on

166
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,430
A prophylactic dose of
antibiotics for a few months.

167
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,375
- See if that would help.
-  They do that ?

168
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,566
Oh, more and more.

169
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,373
Because, you know, those
tubes fall out when kids play.

170
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,000
How do you know all this ?

171
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,062
I...

172
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,797
I joined an online pediatric news group

173
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:07,701
A couple of weeks ago
just to keep up, you know ?

174
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,394
Whatever.

175
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,534
We'll, we'll ask the doctor.

176
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,067
Thank you for coming
with us this morning.

177
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,161
My pleasure.

178
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:33,182
And for being a friend lately.

179
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,734
I'm glad I can help.

180
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't want to let her go,
George. I don't.

181
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,100
I know.

182
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,076
- Thank you, mr. Diaz.
- Of course.

183
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,195
We'll see you tomorrow
a little before 2:00.

184
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:57,195
Hey, I'm sorry I blew up in there.

185
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,869
I feel like I'm going
kind of crazy lately.

186
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,561
I know how you feel.

187
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,074
I miss him so much.

188
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,580
He was the only brother
I'll ever have, you know ?

189
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,601
I'll never have another brother.

190
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,986
Yeah. Believe me, it wasn't a problem.

191
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,948
Thank you.

192
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,377
David ?

193
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,458
What ?

194
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,212
Hey, I know this must
be a hard time for you.

195
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,067
It's hard for me too.

196
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,484
- I'm sure it is.
- But even so

197
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,834
So at some point we're gonna have to..

198
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,181
Sit down and talk about the future

199
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,319
Of the business.

200
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,541
I agree.

201
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,103
- Does it have to be today ?
- No

202
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,243
Obviously not.

203
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:57,726
All right, then.

204
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,331
Then I do feel like I need to
know when it's gonna happen.

205
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,739
It's been more than a
month since Nate died

206
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:05,257
And we still haven't even talked at all

207
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:06,798
About what we're gonna
do with the business.

208
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:09,205
Look, Rico, I don't...

209
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,536
Know when I'm going to be able to.

210
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,727
- I'm sorry.
- It's just, you know,

211
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:19,225
I got , I got a family
I'm trying to think about.

212
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,462
So do I.

213
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:26,660
I have a fucking husband,
Rico. I have two children.

214
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,307
When are you gonna realize I'm
human being just like you, when ?

215
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,180
When ?

216
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,062
"Support our troops" ?

217
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,834
What a bunch of bullshit !

218
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,587
Miss, I don't know what
you want me to do.

219
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,317
Why don't you try driving something
That doesn't require so much

220
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:49,437
Gas for starters.
If you're so fucking concerned ?

221
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,166
Let's go inside. Sorry.

222
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,928
Yeah, we wouldn't want to offend anybody

223
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,240
- While they're supporting our troops !
- Claire, shut up !

224
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:58,067
Dozens of fucking iraqis
are still dying every day !

225
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,951
The whole world hates us for
going in there in the first place.

226
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,855
And terrorists are still
gonna be blowing shit up

227
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,954
In this country for the next 100 years.

228
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,453
And the best thing she can
think to do about it is put...

229
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,130
- Take her inside !
- A sticker on that enormous shit box !

230
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,826
Wait. I am, I am so, so sorry.

231
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,407
They still bring the wounded
soldiers back at night

232
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,056
So the press can't even
film it and nobody sees !

233
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,191
American soldiers are still
being fucked up everyday

234
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,175
And they don't even tell us !

235
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:28,619
And it's all so you can put
gas in this enormous fucking car

236
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,154
To keep everybody feeling
really fucking american !

237
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:35,062
Claire, shut the hell
up ! Her brother just died !

238
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,542
Damn it !

239
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,579
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,350
- I am so sorry, Mrs. Duncan.
- You should be.

241
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,881
- She will not be here tomorrow.
- I should hope not !

242
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,097
- She seems like she's on drugs.
- She usually is.

243
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,734
Bye-Bye. Thank you.

244
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,537
What ?

245
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,998
- So when can we talk about it ?
- Are you fucking serious ?

246
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,114
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I am.

247
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,847
I need to know when
you think you'll be ready

248
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:10,966
- To have this conversation.
- Okay, here.

249
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,603
- Here are my keys.
- Oh, David.

250
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:15,372
No, you want the whole fucking
business, Rico ? It's yours.

251
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,812
I just want to hear
what your plans are.

252
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,757
-No, it's yours ! It's all yours !

253
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,200
There we had our talk.

254
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,086
No one's returned a call
to my phone in weeks.

255
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:37,061
I called Brenda twice,

256
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,391
Maggie several times.

257
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,566
I guess no one returns calls anymore.

258
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,179
I've never waited this long
for a doctor my entire life.

259
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:55,740
It's like this in my
neurologist's office.

260
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,106
They overbook.

261
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:02,467
It's so rude.

262
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,969
- Oh, God, sorry I'm late.
- Mommy !

263
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:09,911
Hey, my sunflower !

264
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:12,685
How are you ?

265
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,516
You got a sore ear ? Let me look.

266
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,924
- The doctor hasn't been in yet ?
- No.

267
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,616
But they told us it'll be very soon.

268
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,556
It's been an extremely long wait.

269
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,728
Yeah, we're kinda
getting used to that now.

270
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,770
Did you bring her things, her clothes ?

271
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,998
- They're all in the car.
- Great.

272
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,827
- Brenda.
- What ?

273
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:40,768
I think Maya should stay with us.

274
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,786
- Oh, really ?
- Yes, I do because

275
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,405
- Maybe this isn't the time.
- Well, she's not going to.

276
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,635
You're gonna be very
busy once the baby comes.

277
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,998
You don't know what it's
like with a new-born.

278
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,693
No, but I think I'll figure it out.

279
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,192
She'll probably end up staying
with us when the baby comes anyway.

280
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,863
No, she won't. I have
Billy staying with me

281
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,673
- So we will be fine.
- Billy ?

282
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:00,507
Yeah.

283
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,048
I'm not sure that's
the best environment.

284
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:03,994
I'm not sure I care
what you think, Ruth.

285
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,978
- I'll go wait in the car.
- Oh, look. Come on, stay.

286
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:09,840
No.

287
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:11,954
I'm sorry, can we
please just not make this

288
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:14,438
Any harder than it has
to be for Maya's sake ?

289
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,649
There are too many people
in this room already.

290
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm gonna go. Yes.

291
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:33,878
You are about to have a brand-new baby.

292
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,026
How is this any of
your business, George ?

293
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,133
Any ?

294
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,050
She's all Ruth has right now.

295
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,626
She's all Ruth has.

296
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,551
Whereas you've got your anger,
your self-pity and your spite.

297
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,455
Are you really gonna make Maya
pay for the rest of her life

298
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,050
Because I fucked somebody else and died ?

299
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,368
She's better off with my
mom, Brenda, and you know it.

300
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,451
Dr. Westin will be with
you in just a few minutes.

301
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,162
- Sorry for the wait.
- Wait ?

302
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,530
What's that ?

303
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,763
Okay, keep her.

304
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:31,894
Drink.

305
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:44,491
There.

306
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,936
Give me my keys.

307
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,900
- Where do you wanna go ?
- Ted

308
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,629
Give me my fucking keys !

309
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,537
I'm not gonna let you drive
messed up like this so just.

310
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,533
What ?

311
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,268
What's so funny ?

312
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,993
Nothing. I just never thought
I'd know a guy named Ted.

313
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:05,881
- It's such a '70s name.
- Funny.

314
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,379
Now give me my keys.

315
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,285
- No.
- Oh, God.

316
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,842
Fuck ! Okay.

317
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,592
I don't want you here.

318
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,518
I don't even like you.

319
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:34,822
You are a fascist republican asshole.

320
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,480
And the fact that I ever even
liked you in the first place

321
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:41,163
Is total proof that I am totally
fucked up about my life !

322
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,879
So will you please just go

323
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,152
And leave me alone ?

324
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,306
You look really stupid right now.

325
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:56,038
Go, you fucking freak ! Get out !

326
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:05,419
I'll bring back your keys tomorrow.

327
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:49,489
You know what your big mistake was ?

328
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,435
You should have married Billy.

329
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:54,613
- That's not even funny.
- Come on, brenda, he's your soul mate.

330
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:58,899
All I ever was, all anybody's ever
been, is a substitute for Billy.

331
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:02,149
That would be so easy for you
to believe that, wouldn't it ?

332
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,072
It's not your fault. You
were raised to be impaired.

333
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,899
You were grown wrong like one
of those square watermelons

334
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:10,422
They cultivate in Japan.

335
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,362
Don't laugh and miss the sorrow of it.

336
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:15,146
I love Billy as my brother.
That is natural

337
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:16,976
And it's right.

338
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,000
Just because you're incapable
of having any real feelings about

339
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,671
any human being unless
you're fucking them.

340
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:24,459
Brenda, listen to me. Pack up
your stuff, take Billy and go.

341
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,382
You can be together. Go someplace
far away like, you know,

342
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:29,655
Nova Scotia.
Tell people you're married

343
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,290
They'll never know.
You'll live together,

344
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,775
you can love each other, you can fuck.

345
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,947
I am so glad you're dead.

346
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,966
Brenda, I am pretty sure that Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver

347
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,487
Are brother and sister
and they're making it work.

348
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,621
Just shut the fuck up.

349
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,906
I'm just saying you only get one life.

350
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,025
There's no God, no rules, no judgments

351
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,351
Except for those you accept
or create for yourself.

352
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,255
And once it's over, it's over.

353
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,218
Dreamless sleep forever and ever.

354
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:01,366
So why not be happy while you're here ?

355
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,988
Really.

356
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,741
Why not ?

357
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:12,373
So then he came back inside,
threw the keys at me and left.

358
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:14,819
So does that mean he quit ?

359
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,651
- No, nobody's quitting.
- Why'd you give him the keys ?

360
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,251
We were fighting.
I was...

361
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:23,067
It happens sometimes
when people work together.

362
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,200
- Eat some salad.
- I had some.

363
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,079
- You did not.
- I had a cucumber.

364
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:29,516
- Rico does...
- What ?

365
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,886
He does kind of have a right to
ask for a sit-Down, doesn't he ?

366
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,480
He

367
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:37,400
- Yeah, Keith, he has a right.
- He is your partner.

368
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:40,488
I know he is. And I'm not
denying him any right.

369
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:42,799
- He just wants to have a conversation.
- I know.

370
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:46,236
I just need some time to sort
things out before we talk about it.

371
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,110
Could you take my side on this, please ?

372
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,672
- I 'm taking your side
- It doesn't feel that way

373
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,301
I'm taking your side by trying to help
you get some perspective about this.

374
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:56,923
My brother's dead, Keith ! I don't
need anymore fucking perspective !

375
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:00,235
I just need to be loved !

376
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,674
Oh, shit.

377
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,284
This keeps fucking happening. I can't

378
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,202
- Go to your room.
- Why ?

379
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,089
Because I told you to.
Go to your room.

380
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,362
- I'll eat some more salad.
- Get out !

381
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,635
Come on.

382
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:29,513
David, you have to try and relax.

383
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,882
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

384
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:36,712
It's been on the
market for six months.

385
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,677
- Vanessa.
- It's been reduced twice.

386
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:40,921
Vanessa, I know this place.

387
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,880
I don't wanna buy it. It's chuck
weingarden's old funeral home.

388
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:45,705
He always had water
trouble in the basement.

389
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,530
Maybe he's fixed it to sell it.

390
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:48,724
Or...

391
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,973
He's selling it because
he knows he can't fix it

392
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,494
Without tearing the whole place down.

393
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:54,936
You'd have to see it to
find out, wouldn't you ?

394
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,148
Rico, our lives should
be ours to win or lose,

395
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,897
Not the Fishers.
Our lives should be ours.

396
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:04,494
Oh, don't spill that. Here.

397
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:07,109
100.1.

398
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:09,266
It's higher than it was before.

399
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,185
Doctor said the fever might
last through the night.

400
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,494
Sometimes the antibiotics
take a while to kick in.

401
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,608
She's rubbing her ear
like it still hurts her.

402
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,088
Ruth, she's getting better.

403
00:25:25,302 --> 00:25:27,363
Don't worry.

404
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,531
We could raise her, couldn't we ?

405
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,054
Um... well,

406
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:39,932
We're a little old,

407
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:43,237
But yeah, sure.

408
00:25:43,537 --> 00:25:47,063
- We could.
- I think we could too.

409
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,523
It seems right somehow.

410
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,994
Can you get us a cold
towel for her forehead ?

411
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,914
Yeah, I'll be right back.

412
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:07,456
Thanks, mom.

413
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:10,660
I wouldn't want anyone else
to take care of her but you.

414
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:13,559
I love her so much.

415
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,846
I know you do.

416
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:22,462
When I see you touch her forehead
like that, I can feel it on mine

417
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:25,144
When I was little

418
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,958
In this same room late at
night sitting by the bed.

419
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:33,407
Before Claire, before David.

420
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:38,862
When it was just dad and you and me.
And everything was gonna be all right.

421
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,894
My poor sick little girl.

422
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:52,251
I used to think that I'd
have more people in my life

423
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:54,303
As time went on.

424
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,912
It doesn't work that way.

425
00:26:58,494 --> 00:26:59,884
Yeah.

426
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,799
I'm starting to realize that.

427
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,659
It's almost like as we get older,

428
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:09,729
The number of people that
completely get us shrinks.

429
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,959
Right.

430
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,001
Until we become so honed by...

431
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:18,434
Our experiences and...

432
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,799
Time and...

433
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,612
Nobody else understands.

434
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:32,687
Yeah.

435
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,889
That sounds about right.

436
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:38,886
Be sure to tell the baby that.

437
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:43,252
First thing right when it comes out.

438
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:28,463
Why did you have to die ?

439
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,078
It really sucks.

440
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,989
Everything's unraveling
since you're gone.

441
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,618
That's not true.

442
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,163
It feels that way.

443
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,365
I miss you.

444
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:55,374
I miss you so fucking much !

445
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:59,139
I miss you too.

446
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:04,487
You know how I always used
to tell you you weren't dad

447
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,285
After dad died ?

448
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,801
Yeah.

449
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,435
It was such a waste of
time thinking that way.

450
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,027
No, it's just part of how
you dealt with it, that's all.

451
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:18,178
- It kept you from missing dad so much.
- No, it kept me from ever knowing you

452
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,502
Like as much as I really could have.

453
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:24,785
And now you are so
completely fucking gone !

454
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,869
- It's... It's just-
- Claire.

455
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,704
What ? ! It sucks !

456
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:31,751
Stop listening to the static.

457
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:33,869
What the fuck does that mean ?

458
00:29:33,953 --> 00:29:37,667
Nothing. It just means that everything
in the world is like this...

459
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:39,655
Transmission

460
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,630
Making its way across the dark.

461
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:46,696
But everything. Death, life, everything,

462
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:50,001
It's all completely
suffused with static.

463
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,809
You know ?

464
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:03,208
But if you listen to the static
too much, it fucks you up.

465
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:08,934
Are you high ?

466
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,963
I am actually, yeah. I'm quite high.

467
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,278
You are ?

468
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,194
What the fuck was that ?

469
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,123
I don't know.

470
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:27,471
- Nate, what is that ?
- I don't know.

471
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,170
You know everything about
the entire fucking universe,

472
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,616
But you don't know what's out
there right now, in the dark ?

473
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,954
Claire, you have to get out of here.

474
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,724
Nate ? Nate !

475
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:43,522
Fuck !

476
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:53,367
- Hey.
- Hi.

477
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,010
I thought you went to bed.

478
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,503
I can't.

479
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:01,015
She's doing somersaults,

480
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,681
Playing on a drum set.

481
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,329
Boom-Ba-Doom-Boom-Boom.

482
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:14,690
Can I feel ?

483
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:16,517
Yeah, sure.

484
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:26,259
I love your baby.

485
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:29,193
Thank you.

486
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:34,289
I'm gonna kind of miss
having her inside me.

487
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,280
But it'll be really
nice to get my body back.

488
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,237
I think you look beautiful.

489
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:44,378
I do. I've known you
ever since I was born. And...

490
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:48,223
I think you look more
perfect to me now than ever.

491
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,928
- Come on.
- What ?

492
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:51,810
All right, fine. I'll shut up.

493
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,125
What'd you do that for ?

494
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:05,641
Because I wanted to.

495
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:16,730
I love you.

496
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,431
I don't really even
know what I mean by that.

497
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:27,924
I love you so much.

498
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:33,816
I love you too.

499
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:42,464
No-Ho-Ho-Ho.

500
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,952
Can I hold you ?

501
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:52,187
Of course you can.

502
00:33:02,928 --> 00:33:04,600
It's okay. It's okay.

503
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:07,060
It's okay.

504
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,938
You wanna touch it ?

505
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,248
I want you to.

506
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,332
Do you wanna ?

507
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:30,708
Okay.

508
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:46,393
That's what your penis would
look like if you were a boy.

509
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:52,215
I was thinking the same thing.

510
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:46,891
"Your fabled gemini optimism
Can be tempered with wisdom

511
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:49,168
And still survive.

512
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,360
Greet news from long lost
friends with suspicion.

513
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:56,149
You have more enemies than you think."

514
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,985
Okay. Let's read grandpa's.

515
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:04,144
"Aries, think about what you say,
Before you speak."

516
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,957
- Claire's not in the coach house.
- So ?

517
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,440
She probably stayed at-

518
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,149
What's his name ? Tom's.

519
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,853
Ted. She's not answering her cell phone.

520
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,515
Well, it's not even 8:00.

521
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,371
They're young. They sleep.

522
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,829
And they don't call back.

523
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,589
George, I missed saying goodbye
to my son. I'm not going to miss...

524
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,284
- Ruth...
- I want to know where my daughter is !

525
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:33,749
- If you go out for recess

526
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:37,251
You stay on the school
grounds. You don't wander off.

527
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,829
And I'll be waiting outside the
principal's office inside the building

528
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,993
To pick you up at the end
of the day, you got it ?

529
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:45,566
- We get it. Let's go.
- Boys ! Come here.

530
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:52,138
I am sorry I got upset and used
bad language at dinner last night.

531
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,805
- That was not right.
- Can we make pizza tonight ?

532
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,796
Sure.

533
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,209
I, um...

534
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:07,777
I just miss your uncle Nate
a lot right now, you guys.

535
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:10,157
A lot.

536
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:14,415
And... And it's been harder than
I thought it would be to move on.

537
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:16,636
We're gonna be late.

538
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:20,941
Okay, you're right.
Good boy, go ahead.

539
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,622
Have a good day !

540
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:39,744
- Excuse me ! Did you see that ?
- What ?

541
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,603
I think that might be the dark
blue nissan they're looking for.

542
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,359
The guy who's murdering children.

543
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,429
That car's not blue, it's black.

544
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,368
Sorry.

545
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:55,908
My mistake.

546
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:08,275
You're sure you wa me to move out ?

547
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:11,237
It's not like a rejection or anything.

548
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:14,321
- I know that.
- Maya will need a room.

549
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,317
You've got a whole life to get back to.

550
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:19,448
I get all that, I do, I just...

551
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:22,458
I mean, do you think you're
gonna be okay when the baby comes ?

552
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:24,838
No.

553
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,936
- Not at all.
- So...

554
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:30,212
Billy, I'm not saying that when the baby
comes You won't be here 18 hours a day.

555
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,523
I'm just saying that...

556
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,194
I gotta get my fucking
shit together. And...

557
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:39,091
We need the space.

558
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:45,401
- So, when are you gonna pick her up ?
- This afternoon.

559
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,204
Why the fuck did I tell
them they could keep her ?

560
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,133
Don't beat yourself up, just
go get her. She's your daughter.

561
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:56,453
You're the best mother she could have.

562
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,992
All right.

563
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,753
I'm gonna go pack my shit up.

564
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,711
Shit !

565
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,992
Oh, finally.

566
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,622
Stop.

567
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:48,006
What the fuck ? !

568
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,706
- I'm not dead !
- I'm sorry, I thought-

569
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,189
- I'm sorry. I'm a funeral director...
- Kill me !

570
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,346
Kill me, whoever the fuck you are !
Kill me ! I wanted to die. Please !

571
00:38:57,365 --> 00:39:00,027
- This is not happening.
- Kill me, you motherfucker !

572
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:03,158
I can't live like this. I
don't want to fucking be here !

573
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:05,135
This is not fucking happening !

574
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,055
Okay, maybe it isn't.

575
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:13,839
But that doesn't mean you're
not totally fuckin' alone.

576
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,304
You're gonna die, David. Just like Nate,

577
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:19,205
Just like your dad, just like everybody.

578
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:22,520
I am aware of the reality of death.

579
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:25,576
- I work with it every day.
- And you're scared.

580
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:28,802
You're more scared now than
you've ever been in your life.

581
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:31,876
You thought you knew what fear was when
Jake poured gas all over your head.

582
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,173
But this...

583
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,301
This simple unavoidable fact

584
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:38,141
That you're alive and alone,

585
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,883
And then someday

586
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,845
You'll be dead. Gone.

587
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:45,836
- Stop it.
- You'll never see Keith after that.

588
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,329
- You'll never see your boys.
- Shut up !

589
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,873
So where are you gonna go ?

590
00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:03,488
I don't know.

591
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:07,713
Just away.

592
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,873
I'll find another job somewhere.

593
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:13,111
Why ?

594
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,985
Because you're okay now.
Everything's fine.

595
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:19,399
I'm not necessary. I'm not.

596
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:26,995
And when were you gonna
tell me that you were leaving ?

597
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:31,286
I would have called you
whenever I got there.

598
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,943
Wherever I end up.

599
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:39,441
But you, you've got family here.

600
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,291
No, Daddy, I don't have family here.

601
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,962
I have some people that I've ruined

602
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:47,455
And that I've ruined myself in front of.

603
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:51,056
- That's all I have.
- What the hell's that supposed to mean ?

604
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:53,896
Do you remember anything, Daddy ?

605
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:55,929
I mean, do you wake up every morning

606
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,727
Totally blank ? Just empty ?

607
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,154
You left us !

608
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,661
You left me and brian

609
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,014
With mom when she was so fucked up

610
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,722
And you don't even say goodbye ?

611
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,901
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

612
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:14,352
That's the way life is, right ?

613
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,539
I mean, you ruin things, you walk away.

614
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,389
You go somewhere else
until it's ruined-

615
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,535
Maggie, it's not true.

616
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:23,596
We all try to do our best-

617
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,328
I am so sick of pretending
everything's okay

618
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:29,014
Just so that you like me. I hate you !

619
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:31,164
I hate that you dragged
me into this world

620
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,704
And you left me here !

621
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,159
Just let me go !

622
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,211
Why did we leave school early ?

623
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:58,746
I rented some movies and
got the stuff to make pizza.

624
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:01,173
I was missing you guys.

625
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:03,384
Did something happen to Keith ?

626
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,530
No.

627
00:42:04,577 --> 00:42:07,201
Then why are we going home ? For real.

628
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:10,906
I just wanted to spend some
time with you, is that all right ?

629
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:12,215
Whatever.

630
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,122
Just gonna have to call somebody
to get my math homework for me.

631
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,568
- Do you want to go back to school ?
- I didn't say that.

632
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:21,751
Because I can turn around and take
you back if you'd like it so much.

633
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,934
Answer me, do you want
to go back to school ?

634
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:25,521
No !

635
00:42:28,018 --> 00:42:30,591
I just wanted to see you. I thought
you'd be happy to get out of school.

636
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,169
I'm sorry if I ruined your day.

637
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:38,173
David, I just found the guy downstairs,

638
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:40,319
Totally not ready for the viewing.

639
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:44,684
I am here all alone. It would be a real
treat to know where the fuck you are.

640
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,328
Call me.

641
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:58,845
Mr. Diaz ?

642
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,197
Yes, Mrs. Duncan, I'll be right out.

643
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:03,896
Okay.

644
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:06,464
Hey, Vanessa.

645
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,117
Listen, if you can get out of work early

646
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:11,859
I could really use your help.

647
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:15,075
Yeah. Yeah, now. I know.

648
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,112
J... Just come if you can.

649
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,013
I will owe you forever,
I will take you to water grill.

650
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,379
Could you just come ? Bye-Bye.

651
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,763
- You get a hold of you ?
- Yeah, thanks.

652
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,150
- I'll give you 800.
- What ?

653
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:43,873
That's like nothing.
I mean, it's a Cadillac.

654
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:47,244
I know what it is.
I'm buying it for parts.

655
00:43:48,465 --> 00:43:49,587
1,500.

656
00:43:49,615 --> 00:43:51,526
- Seven.
- You just said eight.

657
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:55,192
I know, but you're making it
very hard to do you a favor.

658
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:59,000
You should be thinking how lucky
you are to be alive, young lady,

659
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:02,310
Instead of trying to jack up
the price on a totaled car.

660
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:08,236
- 950.
- Done.

661
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:09,809
Come on, boys, roll her over.

662
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:11,630
Get her out of here.

663
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:32,053
Get the chains on over.

664
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,848
Hey.

665
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:46,966
Can I join you ?

666
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:49,334
I guess.

667
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:02,271
- You work here ?
- No, my husband does. I'm helping out.

668
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:06,461
I'm vanessa.

669
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:08,597
Holly.

670
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:11,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:45:15,634 --> 00:45:18,815
We are living in, like,

672
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,567
The unluckiest time ever.

673
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,400
I know it feels that way sometimes.

674
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:29,025
I mean, I grew up thinking I was born

675
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:32,734
In the time when there
was the internet, you know ?

676
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:36,734
And the fall of communism. And the gap.

677
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,753
Turns out my time is when there's like

678
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:45,631
9/11, a bunch of wars

679
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,100
And the end of everything.

680
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:52,434
What ?

681
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,400
Do you have kids ?

682
00:45:57,372 --> 00:45:58,687
No.

683
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:03,945
I was just thinking that I love my kids.

684
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:06,133
And I know it's a hard time,

685
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:09,114
But I still feel like there's
a lot of good in this world.

686
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,851
And I feel like there's
a lot of beautiful things

687
00:46:11,898 --> 00:46:14,634
And I'm glad that my kids
get to live to see them.

688
00:46:16,227 --> 00:46:19,100
- My brother's dead.
- I know.

689
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,400
I'm sorry.

690
00:46:22,377 --> 00:46:25,114
- I'm sure he was a good man.
- He was fine.

691
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,241
That's all he needed to be.

692
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:31,434
That's all anyone needs to be, is fine.

693
00:46:31,762 --> 00:46:34,300
They shouldn't have to get destroyed.

694
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,934
You're right.

695
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:47,720
Did you pack her things ?

696
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:50,868
Not exactly.

697
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:55,692
I called an hour ago.

698
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,302
- You told her I called, right ?
- Yeah.

699
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:01,565
George told me... He told me that
you were feeling like

700
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:04,316
You needed to have her
back again, but I think...

701
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:07,170
She's been so happy here.

702
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:09,801
Okay, george, could you
please take Maya upstairs

703
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:11,868
And pack her things ?

704
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,987
Or do I have to call the police ?

705
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,485
Oh, Brenda ! Call the police ?

706
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,194
It's all right. Come on, up we go.

707
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:23,954
Hey, we'll go wash your doll. Come on.

708
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:27,992
Why are you doing this ?

709
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,208
All I am doing is
taking my daughter home.

710
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:31,959
After you left her here
like a bag of garbage.

711
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:34,612
I left her with you because
it was the most responsible

712
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,095
- Thing I could think of doing.
- Responsible ?

713
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,189
I never left my children.
I never left them for a second !

714
00:47:39,217 --> 00:47:40,297
I wouldn't ! I couldn't !

715
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:42,701
Nate fucked maggie the
night before he died.

716
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:47,136
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is true, Ruth.

717
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:49,225
It's as true as anything you know.

718
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:52,300
And I needed some time to work
through my anger about that

719
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:54,906
Before I could be a good mother
to that little girl, who I love.

720
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:58,488
I love as much as my own
baby and who I am taking home.

721
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:04,056
Oh my god.

722
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,192
- Oh my gosh !
- Sit down.

723
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:08,065
- What's happening ?
- Your water is breaking.

724
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,807
No ! No, it can't. It's too early.

725
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:13,835
Just sit down. I'll
get you to the hospital.

726
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:15,765
Maya can stay here with George.

727
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:16,784
No.

728
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,641
Oh, shit !

729
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:35,553
This movie's gay.

730
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:40,121
What is gay, Durrell ?

731
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:43,012
Really, what is gay ?

732
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:45,299
Movies with no talking.

733
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,360
Is the pizza ready ?

734
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,651
Almost, I just put it
underneath the broiler

735
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,379
To melt the cheese a little more.

736
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:59,629
- Stay right there.
- Who is it ?

737
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:01,234
I don't know.

738
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:03,990
Hello ?

739
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:05,986
Who's there ?

740
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:12,277
No ! Don't ! No, please !
Please don't kill him !

741
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,098
They're gonna die anyway !

742
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:18,558
- Something's burning !
- Something's burning !

743
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:20,619
- What ?
- The pizza's burning !

744
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,648
- What's the matter with you ?
- Nothing's the matter with me, Durrell.

745
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,107
- Don't talk to me that way !
- What did we do ?

746
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:28,553
You didn't do anything !
Not everything is about you !

747
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,314
What the hell is going on in here !

748
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:33,384
Anthony, come with me. Jesus Christ.

749
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:41,614
So, your mom came right over.

750
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:44,619
She helped everyone get seated.

751
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:46,267
She even talked to people afterwards.

752
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:48,379
The whole nine yards.

753
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,666
Was it sad ?

754
00:49:50,797 --> 00:49:52,961
Yeah, it was.

755
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:54,680
But it felt good.

756
00:49:54,746 --> 00:49:57,295
You know, to be there
for people. It did.

757
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,497
I called the realtor.

758
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,684
I'm gonna go see that
place tomorrow at noon

759
00:50:05,825 --> 00:50:07,933
If you want to come.

760
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:24,746
Are they asleep ?

761
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:26,872
Almost.

762
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:40,253
David, you got to...

763
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:44,450
I don't know.

764
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,356
I know.

765
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:50,248
It isn't good for the boys
to be around you like this.

766
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:53,501
I know. I know.

767
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:59,473
I feel like...

768
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,032
What ?

769
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:07,367
Keith, I feel like
my face is coming off.

770
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,445
I keep trying to hold it on,

771
00:51:12,473 --> 00:51:14,638
But I can't. It keeps coming off.

772
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,000
What's underneath is just...

773
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:26,666
I don't want the boys to go away.

774
00:51:27,173 --> 00:51:29,934
I have no intention of
sending the boys anywhere.

775
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:33,000
Good.

776
00:51:33,229 --> 00:51:36,100
But I do think that you should
go away for a little while.

777
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,717
Till you...

778
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,567
Until you get better.

779
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:46,102
The boys are scared to be
around you right now, David.

780
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:49,760
They don't even want to be
in the same room with you.

781
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:58,400
It's not good.

782
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:29,383
Fuck.

783
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:42,768
Is my baby okay ? Tell me,
is my baby gonna be okay ?

784
00:52:42,899 --> 00:52:45,400
Just keep pushing. Just keep pushing.

785
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,504
Fuck !
