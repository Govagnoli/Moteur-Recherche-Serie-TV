1
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:45,148
So I say to this guy, "I can't do anything
unless you give me an order number.

2
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,553
And I don't appreciate your taking that
tone of voice with me. "

3
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:50,509
He says he doesn't have
an order number.

4
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:53,789
And I say, "Well, you should always
write down the order number. "

5
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,511
Then he gets all pissy.

6
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,757
Says he wants to speak to the person
he ordered the Astoria floor lamp from.

7
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:04,237
And I say, "Well, do you
remember his or her... "

8
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,828
Right, you know? "... name?"

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,871
And he says, "Of course not. "

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,869
And I say, "Then I'm sorry,
I can't help you. "

11
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,193
He says this isn't the first time
he had a problem ordering from us.

12
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,553
Last Christmas he bought a CD holder,
and it arrived all broken.

13
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:21,434
When we told him, "Send it back"...

14
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,319
...he couldn't because he'd thrown
away the box it came in.

15
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:31,200
So I say... I say, "Boo-hoo, mister.
Ain't you got it bad. "

16
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:33,759
And he says, "I wanna talk
to your supervisor. "

17
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:36,320
And I say, "Of course
you can talk to him...

18
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:40,518
...but unfortunately, his hours
are only 8:30... "

19
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:09,361
So now the wife's in jail, according
to the cousin who arranged the funeral.

20
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,167
I bet he was abusing her. Maybe he had
some sick sexual thing he made her do.

21
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:16,441
Please, stop.

22
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:21,726
And you're wrong. All she told
the police was that he was boring.

23
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:25,126
That's it? That's all she said?

24
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,724
- The sick part is, I understand it.
- I do too.

25
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:37,724
- Sometimes I'm boring.
- I am too.

26
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,045
I should be at both intakes
with you this morning...

27
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,292
...but you'll have to do
the casket meeting...

28
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,453
...because I'm really backed up
down here.

29
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:51,367
David, maybe we need to think about
finding a replacement for Rico.

30
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:56,692
Why? We're doing just fine without him.
It's saving money, thank you very much.

31
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,373
Is there something you'd like to say
about my work?

32
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,376
Look, you do a great job...

33
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,048
...when it comes to people
who had peaceful farewells.

34
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,854
But the big reconstructions,
you're out of your league.

35
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,012
I see, so those who can't do, criticize?

36
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:12,257
We've got a body
that's a page-one rewrite.

37
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,295
We got two more coming in
from that nightclub fire in Valencia.

38
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,500
- How bad was that fire?
- Well, this is where they ended up.

39
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:19,976
Maybe the families want...

40
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:23,334
Open caskets. They already
put in the requests.

41
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,057
- I'll put an ad in the paper today.
- It's taken care of.

42
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:29,415
I've scheduled some interviews
for this afternoon.

43
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,697
As you can see from my r'esum'e,
I've had the good fortune to study...

44
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:38,579
...under a variety
of gifted restorative artists.

45
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:42,023
Oh, you worked over at Hope Valley.
I've known P.T. For years.

46
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,455
Look, that lawsuit about
the unembalmed arm was not my fault.

47
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:54,186
I took the fall for some bitch that was
supposed to cover me for leaving early.

48
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,823
Sometimes I wake up
with a feeling of panic...

49
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,384
...like my heart's gonna beat
right out of my chest.

50
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,344
You know what I'm talking about. But
after I spend a few extra hours in bed...

51
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,783
...and do my chanting,
the dark time usually passes.

52
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,666
I know it sounds funny,
but the first time I embalmed someone...

53
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,181
...it felt like I was coming home.

54
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:17,623
I just knew that this is
what I was meant to do.

55
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:19,591
That doesn't sound funny at all.

56
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,387
There's something very intimate about it.

57
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:27,145
I'm the last person on earth
who gets to know these people.

58
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:32,665
Anyway, I guess I take
what I do very seriously.

59
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,473
Well, I have no further questions.

60
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,952
Me neither. Thanks for coming in,
Angela. We'll be in touch.

61
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,751
Great.

62
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:45,994
It was very nice to meet you.

63
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,751
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,750
Okay.

65
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,397
I'll wait an hour before I call her.

66
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,669
We don't wanna look desperate.

67
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,792
Just find out if she can start tomorrow.

68
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,283
David,

69
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,319
David!

70
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:41,557
David!

71
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,759
Why are you standing there like that?

72
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,763
I was thinking.

73
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:53,442
Isn't a person allowed to think?

74
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:10,087
You're gonna wish you'd
gotten high with me.

75
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,681
I told you, I'm never getting high again.

76
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,610
Oh, doesn't Billy look great?

77
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:17,561
So handsome and confident.

78
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,129
Yo, Billy!

79
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:24,689
Would you excuse me for one moment?
Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it.

80
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:28,683
Thank God you're here. My mouth
is really dry, and is my breath bad?

81
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:30,010
No, it's fine.

82
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,128
So truth. Is this show good,
or is it just pretentious bullshit?

83
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,804
There're so many people,
it's hard to see the pictures.

84
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,815
This is Billy's best work ever,
very disturbing.

85
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:43,967
- Really?
- I'm so proud of you, God!

86
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,407
Why is my mother here?

87
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,098
Oh, God.

88
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,928
I invited her as part of my ongoing
campaign to get her to like me.

89
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,614
I didn't think she'd actually turn up.

90
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,609
You know that some stranger
just rubbed my ass?

91
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:07,532
Isn't this fabulous?
Oh, Billy, darling.

92
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,853
Thanks, Mom.

93
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:18,172
You can't keep him to yourself
all the time.

94
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:25,015
Okay, no offense, but your family
is fucked up beyond comprehension.

95
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,295
She's completely tanked.

96
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,700
I brought someone.
I hope that's okay.

97
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,215
- Hey, Nikolai.
- Hello, Nate, how are you?

98
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:35,099
- This is Brenda.
- Good evening.

99
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,617
- Hello, dear.
- It's good to see you, Mrs. Fisher.

100
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:42,821
- Where's Hiram?
- He's visiting his son in Portland.

101
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:47,904
I'm serious, darling,
this new stuff is really visceral.

102
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,907
Not at all left-brained like your father.

103
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,623
Yeah. Hey, so where is Dad?

104
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,301
Oh, honey, Bern sends his regrets.
He's just heartsick.

105
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,820
Unfortunately, he's treating
one of his patients...

106
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:05,787
...who's undergoing a complete
psychotic break at the moment.

107
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,822
That always seems to happen whenever
there's something important in my life.

108
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:13,628
I guess that's just typical Bernard...
I'm sorry, Bernard Chenowith behavior.

109
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,505
Pretentious dick.

110
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:18,672
Now, you just hush.

111
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,630
I thought this would be paintings.

112
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,507
I could take photographs.

113
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,513
That doesn't mean they'd be any good.

114
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:30,868
Mrs. Fisher, I've never seen you
having this much fun.

115
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,708
Oh, no, no, no, it's great.

116
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,306
I am having fun just watching you.

117
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:42,477
Hey, Mr. Seattle co-op hippie boy.

118
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,033
Oh, Margaret Chenowith. Who are you?

119
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,112
- Ruth Fisher.
- Nate's mother.

120
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,151
That explains why
you're looking at me...

121
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,396
...like I just took a giant dump
on your lawn.

122
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,790
If I knew you were
putting on a show tonight...

123
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,191
...I would've bought tickets
for all my friends.

124
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,234
Goody, there's Dr. Feinberg.

125
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,961
- Hi.
- What is he doing here?

126
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,476
I invited him.

127
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:07,638
Gareth Feinberg, the guy
who wrote the book?

128
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah, he wrote
Charlotte-fucking-Light and Dark,

129
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,633
He's a fucking evil dead fish
of a fucking Nazi fuck.

130
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:18,280
Darling, try not to act so adolescent.
It only makes you look bad.

131
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,443
As opposed to being drunk
and slobbering all over my boyfriend...

132
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:24,239
...who, by the way,
is completely not interested.

133
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:26,401
Isn't this fun?

134
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:29,240
Billy, Billy, Billy.

135
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:33,122
It's quite powerful stuff.
It's... It's potent.

136
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,241
That's a word Dr. Feinberg
likes to use a lot.

137
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:41,646
Brenda, I see a lot of you
in these photographs.

138
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:44,604
Hello, Gareth.

139
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:47,204
Margaret.

140
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,643
Does this have a theme?

141
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,806
I know you like your things
to have a theme.

142
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,640
Mother, nothing is more tedious than
when you look for meaning in my work.

143
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,490
I don't need your fucking approval.

144
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,202
Excuse me.

145
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:10,807
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Yeah, it is.

146
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,850
He's good.

147
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:15,614
Yeah, he is really good.

148
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,208
I only wish he'd believe that.

149
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,893
This one's got real attitude.

150
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,051
- Oh, my God.
- The light's spectacular.

151
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:38,653
Brenda, that is a picture
of me urinating on a wall.

152
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,814
- I realize that.
- Hey, what do you think?

153
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:42,572
So now you're stalking me?

154
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,458
No, I just saw you one day
when I was taking pictures...

155
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,333
...so I followed you.
- You were just out taking pictures?

156
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,215
You live in Venice! There's no reason
for you to be in my neighborhood.

157
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,218
You think the world revolves around you.

158
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:57,897
Bren, would you tell him, please,
this isn't about him?

159
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,931
It's what Billy does.

160
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:06,532
He takes pictures of people
when they're off guard.

161
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:10,292
- He's got a talent. It's art.
- No, it's fucked!

162
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:18,420
Thanks a lot.

163
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,217
Look. That's your son
pissing against a wall.

164
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,736
So I should let him humiliate me
whenever he wants?

165
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,138
Oh, God, Nate, don't make this
about you.

166
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:42,944
Why the fuck not? This is about me.
You make enough stuff all about you.

167
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,663
So what? There's a picture
of you pissing on a wall.

168
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:48,987
Who got hurt? Who died?

169
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,545
You don't think I have a right
to not be spied upon?

170
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,868
You're talking to someone
who was spied on her whole life.

171
00:12:56,071 --> 00:13:00,782
God, Billy is severely fucked up, Bren.
I don't like being stalked by a psycho.

172
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:05,862
Billy is not psychotic. He has a disease.
He's fine when he takes his meds.

173
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,541
Yeah, well, when the fuck is that?

174
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,271
Look, has he ever done anything weird?

175
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:21,675
Yeah, he's bipolar.
His whole life he's been weird.

176
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:26,030
Has he ever done anything dangerous?

177
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:30,515
Oh, God. Nate, no.

178
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:37,632
The only person Billy would ever
be a threat to is himself.

179
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,517
- Has he ever tried to...?
- Yes.

180
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,828
When I was 18.

181
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,358
I went to Europe for three months.

182
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:54,839
It was this big reward for me
winning a scholarship to Yale.

183
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:59,277
When I got back to L.A.,
my mother was at the airport.

184
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:02,361
She told me that Billy
had committed suicide.

185
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:08,719
My whole life just collapsed
in on itself in that moment.

186
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:15,403
Of course, she meant to say that Billy
had tried to commit suicide.

187
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:20,323
She was drunk,
or else it was a Freudian slip.

188
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,079
You never went to Yale.

189
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,642
Billy was in a hospital in Pasadena.

190
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:32,881
I took some classes at UCLA
in the spring.

191
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:36,839
Then in the fall, he was diagnosed
manic-depressive...

192
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,801
...which kicks in in adolescence...

193
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,081
...so it probably had nothing to do
with me getting the scholarship.

194
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,885
I can't believe they pressured you into
sacrificing your life for your brother.

195
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,651
Nobody pressured me.

196
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:52,280
I wanted to stay.

197
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:02,681
- Morning.
- Morning. Pee on any walls lately?

198
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:05,123
Shut up.

199
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,566
So, Mom, what's with you and Nikolai?

200
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,448
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:16,167
And Dave, what'd you do last night?

202
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,775
Nothing.

203
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:20,490
Saturday night, what happened to that...?

204
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:24,649
Person you're seeing?

205
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:28,092
That person is no longer in the picture.

206
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,493
Sorry to hear it.

207
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,053
What about you?

208
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,655
- You dating anybody?
- No.

209
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,295
If you are, you don't need
to hide him from us like we're lepers.

210
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:44,290
I'm not dating anyone. I've just been
hanging out a lot with somebody.

211
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,061
Who is this person?

212
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:51,213
Nobody.

213
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:56,172
David, I'm ready to go to church.

214
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,733
Thanks, guys.

215
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:08,858
- Hey, Joey, the kid's ready,
- So am I,

216
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,860
This is the most terrifying
shower scene since Psycho.

217
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,501
That football game used to make
this obnoxious noise...

218
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,982
...when you scored a touchdown.

219
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,068
Do you wanna show me how to play it?

220
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,859
No.

221
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:40,304
You know, there's this...
There's this little kid next door...

222
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,068
...and the only toy he's got...

223
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,150
...is this stupid Mousetrap game
from when his mom was a kid.

224
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:50,462
Maybe, you know, he'd want
some of these.

225
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:05,592
It's a beautiful day. Why would you
waste your Sunday in here watching TV?

226
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,870
What are you doing?

227
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:19,349
I thought that Tony Rechner next door
might want some of these.

228
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,750
Just keep your hands off them.

229
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,150
She doesn't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

230
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,278
Come on, I wanna show you
something funny. Come on.

231
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:51,678
Come on.

232
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,078
We're going on a field trip?

233
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,724
This is like the first day of school.

234
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:03,392
I am so excited.

235
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,722
Oh, and I just wanna apologize
in advance...

236
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,393
...because I had calamari
last night for dinner.

237
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,200
- What do you mean?
- Let's just say this is one time...

238
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:16,479
...where the strong smell of
formaldehyde really comes in handy.

239
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,164
So then I said, "I don't care
if you have a low sperm count.

240
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,280
I mean, I'll just shove a turkey baster
up there if I have to. "

241
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:31,007
I mean, I wanna have a child
before I turn 40. That's fair, right?

242
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,608
Hello, everyone.

243
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:37,201
Hi. How was church?
Nate told me you're a deacon.

244
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,970
That's adorable.

245
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,003
I see you've made yourself at home.

246
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:52,130
Angela doesn't like to feel constrained.

247
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,324
Well, you know, my glands
go double-time.

248
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,925
I find if I wear too much while I work,
I get all pitted.

249
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:11,252
Angela, we're sort of used to a more
professional appearance around here.

250
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:14,969
Give me a break, David,
they're just nipples.

251
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,532
I mean, we've all seen them.
We've all touched them.

252
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:21,333
We've all sucked on them. It's not like
this guy will be lying in the casket...

253
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,008
...and people will be saying, "Oh, my
God, the embalmer's nipples were hard. "

254
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:28,131
They'll be saying, "How did they put
his face back together...

255
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,411
...after he went through
the goddamn windshield?"

256
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,418
I told Father Jack I'd help
with the food distribution downtown.

257
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,533
I just wanted to make sure
that your first day was going okay.

258
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:42,972
Well, thanks. I'm all gassy,
but that's not your fault.

259
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,773
Angela had calamari last night.

260
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:50,815
Boy, he's a barrel of laughs.

261
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,783
It's hard when a new person
comes into a situation,

262
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:59,016
It throws everything off balance.

263
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,817
Bren, I am not threatened
by your boyfriend.

264
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:07,496
Oh, yeah? Your behavior consistently
communicates otherwise.

265
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,935
You want the picture
out of the show, fine.

266
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:15,463
But don't spout psychobabble at me
like fucking Margaret and Bernard.

267
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,823
- You're, like, becoming them.
- Fuck you!

268
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:21,259
You know what you did was wrong.
That's why you didn't show it to me.

269
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:25,422
- Why are you making it such a big deal?
- Because I love him!

270
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:33,629
You're fucking with my life, Billy,
and it's not fair.

271
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,259
You have to stop.

272
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:39,340
- Or what?
- Goddamn it, Billy, what is it with you?

273
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,703
You like fucking with my brain
like Feinberg?

274
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,148
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

275
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,032
Can I get you anything else?

276
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:07,312
I can always use a good blowjob.

277
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:13,670
Hey, do I get my fucking lunch or not?

278
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:20,309
- I'm going to get a drink of water.
- Yeah, sure.

279
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:25,514
Melinda Daner, Mark Whitman...

280
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,557
...Darryl Heinz, Keith Charles.

281
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,231
Okay, well, just tell them we'll meet them
at the usual corner on Tuesday. Okay.

282
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,592
- Hi, Tracy.
- Oh, hi, David.

283
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,831
- How have you been?
- Fine.

284
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,680
I love your new hair.

285
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,917
What are you working on?

286
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:51,153
St. Stephen's is sending over
some volunteers to help out next week.

287
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:53,753
Someone told me that you
used to go to St. Stephen's.

288
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:57,161
Not that I've been asking around
about you. It just came up naturally.

289
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:59,879
So did you? Go there, I mean.

290
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,722
- Yeah, just for a few months last year.
- They're a very progressive church.

291
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,877
Yes, they are.

292
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:14,719
The guy who took these
is a total psycho.

293
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,119
It's good.

294
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:27,119
Well, we should probably get going
if we wanna see that movie.

295
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,648
I should probably get home
and check on my mom.

296
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,411
I'm sure she's doing fine.

297
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:39,724
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,968
It's not like I was dying
to see a movie.

299
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,812
That's not what I'm talking about.

300
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:49,928
I'm sorry...

301
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,851
...about what happened between us.

302
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:57,213
I never meant for those assholes
to write shit on your car.

303
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:00,569
I shouldn't have told Andy about us.

304
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:05,890
I was just being stupid. That was me
being really, really, really stupid...

305
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,329
...and I'm sorry.

306
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:17,169
Well, thank you.

307
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,859
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this.

308
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:40,451
All I'm saying is,
I sat around last week...

309
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,858
...in that stupid getup
you wanted me to wear...

310
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:47,454
...and had to say all this, you know,
"Daddy this" and "Daddy that" bullshit.

311
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,543
When I tell you I keep reading articles
about having this one-hour orgasm...

312
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:55,414
...well, the least you could do
is try to help me have one.

313
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,018
I'm sorry men can't have it.

314
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,534
Since you guys get everything else
on the planet...

315
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,782
...it seems like a fair tradeoff.

316
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:03,385
Fine.

317
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,942
Goodbye.

318
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:11,981
You know, Angela, my brother
likes a certain decorum...

319
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:14,702
...when you're working
with someone's loved one.

320
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:16,979
Yeah?

321
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:19,749
Well, the personal calls are
probably a little uncool.

322
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,786
Oh, right, got it.

323
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,743
I won't do it when he's around.

324
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,427
Hello.

325
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,109
Hey.

326
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:34,989
Really?

327
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,660
Why don't you want me to come over?

328
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:40,865
Damn it, Brenda, you always do this.
You're shutting me out.

329
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:43,871
Look, the pissing thing is
no longer an issue, I swear.

330
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:46,872
Look, maybe you'd feel better
if I came over.

331
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:50,544
All right, fine, whatever. Fine.

332
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,709
- Girlfriend trouble?
- Not really trouble.

333
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,392
Tell me what the fight was about,
and I'll tell you what to say to fix it.

334
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:02,314
I mean, trust me, this is my thing.

335
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,990
We didn't have a fight.

336
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:08,588
She just pulls away from me
at the weirdest times.

337
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,593
Well, maybe she senses that
you're pulling away...

338
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,949
...so she just does it first.

339
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,036
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

340
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,636
Shoot. I guess this means
I can't ask about the pissing?

341
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,078
Because I had an ex who wanted to pee
on me, and I wasn't grossed out.

342
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,200
I mean, I just thought it was
kind of silly. But that's me.

343
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:54,756
Thank you for taking me to
the art gallery last night.

344
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:56,922
I thought you hated those pictures.

345
00:25:57,126 --> 00:26:01,199
No, no, it's just that I don't
like them, that's all.

346
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,724
But it was nice to be
spending time with you.

347
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:08,358
I mean, outside of working together.

348
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,085
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?

349
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:15,878
- Is that like a date?
- Of course not.

350
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:20,163
Good, I pick you up
tomorrow night, 8:00.

351
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:27,482
I don't wanna go, okay?
Just stop asking me.

352
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:30,603
Okay, fine. I was only inviting you
to be nice.

353
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:34,088
Nobody even wants you there because
you've been acting so weird lately.

354
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,884
Gabe?

355
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,125
- We have to be someplace.
- Get lost, Morticia.

356
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:42,763
Shut up, peanut-testicle.

357
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:47,092
Fuck off, the both of you.

358
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:50,492
What's his problem?

359
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:54,974
Nothing. He wants me to go to this party
tomorrow. I'm just not in the mood.

360
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:57,608
We can do something if you want.

361
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:02,368
Actually, I gotta go to Barstow tomorrow
and spend the night at my dad's.

362
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:07,369
I gotta ask him for money for my mom.
Not that he's gonna give it to me, but...

363
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,217
Well, do you want company?

364
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:13,728
Claire, you don't have
to keep taking care of me.

365
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,890
I'm not.

366
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,660
I just like hanging out.

367
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,933
We could just go for the drive.
Then you go see your dad...

368
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,459
...and I'll stay in some, like, creepy motel
and read a Stephen King book.

369
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,172
Okay.

370
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:33,578
Meet me after fifth period
tomorrow by the gym.

371
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,426
Oh, this is just what I need today.

372
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,224
I see this is payback time
for my missing your opening.

373
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,382
Just shut up!

374
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:26,989
Both of you, for once,
just shut your fucking mouths.

375
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:29,826
All that comes out of you
is garbage, garbage, garbage!

376
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:31,704
Okay.

377
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:35,223
Good, we have a dialogue.

378
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:40,707
- Where did you get this?
- From his office.

379
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,907
It's all the data Feinberg has
on Brenda. It's all destroyed.

380
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:46,709
He can go to where he came from
before he fucked her up.

381
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:51,307
You're off the hook. Obviously, this has
nothing to do with you missing his show.

382
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:54,349
Don't fucking talk about me
like I'm not here!

383
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,952
Even though I'm not
and never have been.

384
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:58,909
Son, what's wrong? Just tell us.

385
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,675
There's nothing wrong with me.

386
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:03,950
I didn't sell my daughter to some smug,
star-fucking psychiatrist...

387
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:06,626
...so he could pick her apart
like a goddamn cadaver...

388
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,076
...and turn her into shit and garbage
just like everything you touch!

389
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,230
- Billy, sweetheart...
- You bitch!

390
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:16,268
You're the fucking nurse. You wanna tie
us up, lock us in a room, leave us to die.

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,909
Well, you're the one that should die,
you and him!

392
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,992
You don't get to touch the children.

393
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,635
I refuse to be an audience for this.

394
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:38,801
Oh, boy. You can juice her, but you
better let me take care of that skin.

395
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:42,913
This guy has a really sinewy neck.

396
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:45,998
Sinewy. I love saying that word,
don't you?

397
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:48,921
- I don't know.
- I went out with this guy once...

398
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:52,323
...he had a really sinewy neck.
He was a total animal in bed.

399
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:55,644
I mean, the things he could do
with his tongue.

400
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:59,641
He thought he was God's gift to women.
I guess in that one respect he was.

401
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:03,847
- So do you like sinewy necks, David?
- I never really thought about it.

402
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:06,119
Hey, I'm just trying to figure out
your type.

403
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,240
Believe me, I can tell you're single.

404
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:11,521
And I know about a million people
I can set you up with.

405
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,449
So, what kind of guys do you like?

406
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,402
What makes you think that I like men?

407
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,688
Oh, please, let's not play that game.

408
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,725
- I think we should fire her.
- I'm thinking the same thing.

409
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:25,526
- Has she made a lot of mistakes?
- No.

410
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:27,609
She's a little hard to take.

411
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,043
She's a lot hard to take.

412
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:32,767
Sometimes people are hard to take...

413
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:36,171
...but only because the first side they
present is annoying or aggressive...

414
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:39,013
...because they're nervous.

415
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:41,007
After you spend some time
with them...

416
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,685
...you realize maybe there's another side
to them that's worth knowing.

417
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:51,492
Or not. I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

418
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:55,929
Sorry I'm late.

419
00:30:56,137 --> 00:31:00,131
By the way, I won't be here for dinner
tomorrow, so everyone's on their own.

420
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:04,127
Actually, I'm going to be volunteering
with the food distribution.

421
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,854
Well, that leaves you and me, Claire.
You wanna go to the Apple Pan?

422
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:12,770
Can't. I have to do
this astronomy overnight thing...

423
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,814
...at the observatory for school.
- I didn't hear about this.

424
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:18,740
I told you.
You probably weren't listening.

425
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,979
That's the type of thing I would listen to.

426
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:26,093
David and Nate did it
when they went to Bonaventure.

427
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:29,454
David, you did this?

428
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:32,939
- Yeah, I had to.
- You too, Nate?

429
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:36,256
Back then we thought
Pluto was a planet.

430
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:39,821
- When did Pluto stop being a planet?
- A few months ago.

431
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,421
Well, I suppose it's okay for you to go.

432
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:49,861
Luckily, Gareth isn't going
to press charges.

433
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:54,663
But I did promise him that steps
would be taken to remedy the situation.

434
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,746
I wish I'd been there to see
the look on Feinberg's face.

435
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,257
I'm sure he started with
his whole blinking thing.

436
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:03,347
Brenda, we have a serious problem.

437
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,027
Okay, I'll talk to Billy's doctor, see if
he needs to be on different medication.

438
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,943
We were thinking of something
a little more involved.

439
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,621
Your mother and I feel that he needs
to go away for intensive therapy.

440
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:20,148
There's a very good facility in Colorado.

441
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,308
You wanna put Billy in an institution?

442
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:25,784
Oh, please, let's not turn this
into a 1950s B-movie.

443
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:29,070
This place is run
by excellent psychiatric specialists...

444
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:34,223
...who may have some creative solution
to help Billy.

445
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,866
You wanna give him shock treatment.

446
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:40,670
Darling, really, this dramatic streak,
aren't you a little old for it?

447
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,505
And just for the record, electroconvulsive
therapy's had a real resurgence...

448
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:47,071
...in the last 10 years
with very impressive results.

449
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,273
- You can't do this.
- We think it's best.

450
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:51,195
It certainly makes your lives easier.

451
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:55,317
God forbid Billy should embarrass you in
front of your stupid celebrity friends.

452
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,026
Unfortunately, he's an adult
which means you can't...

453
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:01,157
...have him committed
unless he does something dangerous.

454
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,714
Darling?

455
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:08,396
We were thinking if you talked to him,
explained how it would help him...

456
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,236
Fuck you both.
You're out of your minds.

457
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:22,920
Hi, I'm Angela. You must be Ruth.

458
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,513
Yes.

459
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:34,153
I spilled some beet salad
on someone's wig...

460
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:36,720
...so David said I should eat up here.

461
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,318
I got the stains out.

462
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:44,163
Everyone in my family gets cancer,
so I know tons about taking care of wigs.

463
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,476
Is that yours? The hair, I mean.

464
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,359
As far as I know.

465
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,160
It's beautiful.

466
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,404
Thank you.

467
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,283
I don't wanna be one
of those menopausal women...

468
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:03,641
...that goes all dykey
with the butch haircut.

469
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,684
So Nate says that
you're dating a hairdresser.

470
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,927
That is so lucky.

471
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:16,323
If he's good, I'd love to know
if he can do anything with this mop.

472
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,491
Does your boyfriend come around?

473
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:22,571
He's not exactly my boyfriend.

474
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:25,571
Oh, come on, you're blushing.

475
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,686
Must be pretty serious. Is it?

476
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:31,567
Is it serious, or is it just hot sex?

477
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:38,732
I'm really not in the mood
to discuss my personal life.

478
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:03,380
You have one new message,

479
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,979
Hey, it's me,

480
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,979
Look, it's better if I just go by myself,

481
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:11,457
You should probably just
not worry about it, okay?

482
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:16,295
Thank you for trying to... To...

483
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:19,575
Look, just... Thank you,

484
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:23,571
So that's... That's it, I guess,

485
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,534
Goodbye, Claire,

486
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,059
This is disgusting.
You have crap in here from the '80s.

487
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,259
Billy, I'll get a plumber, somebody
who actually knows what they're doing.

488
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,536
Would you look at me?
I'd really like to talk to you.

489
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:49,746
I take it you spoke to Mom and Dad.

490
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:54,297
Look, I don't know what
happened that day.

491
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,898
You know, I was on new meds.
They weren't working.

492
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:59,384
It wasn't my fault.

493
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,506
But don't worry. I've already been
to my doctor and changed my dosage.

494
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,986
And I already feel more even.

495
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,980
Billy, I need to know if I should be
worried about you.

496
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,942
You shouldn't.

497
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,709
I swear.

498
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,474
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

499
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:53,273
My God, you could eat off this skin.

500
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,516
Angela does her job perfectly.

501
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,190
What about the hairs in her mole?
Rico would've never left those there.

502
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,914
Angela had a long philosophical debate
about it...

503
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,717
...and decided the nieces would wanna
remember her exactly how she was.

504
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:11,675
I'd like to know the meaning of this.

505
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:14,472
Nikolai is picking me up
to go to dinner...

506
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:17,197
...and I was planning to serve him
sherry beforehand.

507
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,759
I wanted to use the goblets I got
from my cousin Hannah's trip to Dresden.

508
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:24,115
Now I can't because someone broke this
and hoped I wouldn't notice it.

509
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:26,599
- Which one of you did this?
- It wasn't me.

510
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:28,875
Well, it wasn't me.

511
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:36,519
- It was Angela.
- Oh, it was definitely Angela.

512
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:44,926
Hi.

513
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:47,084
David. What are you doing here?

514
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:49,603
I volunteer with these guys
a couple times a week.

515
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,881
Oh, I just started.

516
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:55,043
- You need some help?
- Yeah, sure.

517
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:12,362
David. David!

518
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:14,810
- David.
- I'm dying.

519
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:20,293
No, you can't, not before we
make love one last time.

520
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:23,927
Okay.

521
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,410
I thought you were gonna help.

522
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,413
- So how've you been?
- Good. You?

523
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:34,766
I'm okay.

524
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:38,813
I've driven by hundreds of times,
but I never knew this place existed.

525
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,489
Is best restaurant in all of Los Angeles,
and not outrageous prices too.

526
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:50,937
- Lotte, Irina.
- What a surprise this is.

527
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,937
You usually do not come in
on Tuesday night.

528
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,971
- Well, I...
- Can we join you?

529
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,410
Please.

530
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,133
Maybe another time.

531
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,935
No, no, she says it's okay.

532
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:08,691
So you must be Nicky's special friend
we all keep hearing about.

533
00:39:08,902 --> 00:39:10,779
You must be thinking of someone else.

534
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:15,221
No. You lost your husband.
You work for Nicky.

535
00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:17,414
You used to fix dead people.

536
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:20,422
Oh, I suppose that is me.

537
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,299
This is Ruth.

538
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:28,183
So that guy I saw you with
at the club, is that a serious thing?

539
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:30,297
Eddie?

540
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:34,621
Not really. Not yet.

541
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:37,739
Those drugs I saw you taking,
is that a serious thing?

542
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:43,739
No, no. I just tried them once.
I don't think I'll be trying them again.

543
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,427
I'm glad to hear you say that.

544
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,824
You know what that shit
has done to my sister.

545
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:51,385
It can seriously fuck up your life, David.

546
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,625
I'd hate to see that happen.

547
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,822
It was stupid, I know. I was just...

548
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,145
You know, Rico left.
It was just Nate and me.

549
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:05,991
Not that it's an excuse.

550
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,941
What's up with that kid
I saw you with at the club?

551
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,428
Let's just say it was
a learning experience.

552
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:16,627
Everyone else has gone home. I don't
know what you two are waiting for.

553
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,348
David, this isn't one
of your regular shifts.

554
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:23,833
Is there any special reason
you showed up here tonight?

555
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:26,105
No.

556
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:29,311
Oh, well...

557
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,034
Well, good night, you two.

558
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:36,307
Good night.

559
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:41,149
You hungry?

560
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,553
I'm always hungry.

561
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:19,439
You fucking bitch!

562
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:24,435
I would like to tear your heart out
like you have torn out mine.

563
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:29,000
There's supposed to be a picture
of Nate peeing on a wall.

564
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:32,080
- I see it.
- I don't.

565
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,763
Four from the left.

566
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,764
Oh, my God.

567
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,845
What'd your mom say
when she saw that?

568
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:42,563
She was kind of horrified, I think.

569
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,566
How is your mom?

570
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:49,446
She's dating. It's weird.

571
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,447
- Why?
- Because she's my mother.

572
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,118
She's not supposed to date.

573
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:59,322
People should be with people.

574
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:04,601
Yeah, sometimes people are
just too stupid to know it.

575
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:13,404
How's your taco?

576
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,008
Disgusting.

577
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,172
I had no idea about you and Nikolai.

578
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:28,450
For six years, every Saturday night,
I cook for him dinner.

579
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:32,536
And then he take me
to a $2.50 movie on Fairfax.

580
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:35,245
Then you come along,
and he stop calling.

581
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:41,170
I have to see every goddamn film
this Freddie Prinze Jr. Does...

582
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,847
...and what do I have to show for it?

583
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,738
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,852
Do you want to marry Nicky or not?

585
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,458
Marriage is the last thing
I would ever want again.

586
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:59,456
Maybe I have an amusing flirtation
with Nikolai...

587
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,136
...but he scares me.

588
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:04,778
Best of all, I have this job...

589
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,373
...something I never would have
predicted for myself.

590
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,176
And I love it...

591
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:12,693
...because it's mine.

592
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:23,463
And I would never do anything
to jeopardize that...

593
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:27,776
...which means I should probably just
finish dinner with Nikolai...

594
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:30,820
...and go home.

595
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,459
Thank you. I've had the best time
coming to this funny restaurant...

596
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:42,627
...and having you yell at me
in the bathroom.

597
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,066
Do you realize the whole time
we were going out...

598
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:54,229
...I was never in your bedroom at night?
- Well...

599
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,752
...you're here now, aren't you?

600
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,071
Whoa, this is not the David I know.

601
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:15,027
Maybe this is the real me.

602
00:44:15,675 --> 00:44:17,666
- I'm not sure we should...
- Why not?

603
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,992
Well, I'm kind of seeing somebody
right now.

604
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:22,346
- I don't care.
- Well, I do.

605
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,952
Come on, David!

606
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:30,395
Why'd you come up here,
if you weren't into something happening?

607
00:44:30,597 --> 00:44:34,386
To talk to you, to see how you
were doing, to be friends.

608
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:38,956
- I don't wanna be friends. I wanna fuck.
- Well, I'm not into that.

609
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,352
Can't we just have sex?
It doesn't have to mean anything.

610
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,672
It's getting late.

611
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,156
I should just go.

612
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:53,954
You take care of yourself.

613
00:45:10,004 --> 00:45:11,995
Claire, what are you doing here?

614
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:15,641
I thought David and I covered for you,
so you could be out having fun.

615
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:18,356
What's wrong?

616
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:22,594
Shit, there's this really big hole
in my sock.

617
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:31,562
- Maybe Gabe just wanted to be alone.
- I know.

618
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:35,281
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

619
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,759
It's just...

620
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:42,158
...he needs me.

621
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:47,605
For the first time in my life, I felt
important, like someone needed me...

622
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,609
...you know, like, not just like some
annoying extra person...

623
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:53,770
...just lumped in with everyone else.

624
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:56,807
No one's ever needed me.

625
00:45:57,012 --> 00:45:58,810
I need you.

626
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:00,969
Right.

627
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,126
I felt this really intense connection.

628
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:13,054
Now it's just gone.

629
00:46:14,215 --> 00:46:16,571
And I want it back.

630
00:46:19,296 --> 00:46:21,605
I want him back.

631
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:24,694
Is there something wrong with me?

632
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:28,208
Is there something about me that makes
me deserve something like this?

633
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,817
Deserve what?

634
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:34,615
Just feeling really close to someone
then having them just disappear...

635
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:37,572
...like I mean nothing.

636
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:42,657
Claire, Gabe just went to visit
his father for a day.

637
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:48,054
I think you're talking about Dad.

638
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,816
Look, we never talk about him.

639
00:46:53,022 --> 00:46:55,490
And that's okay, if that's what you want.

640
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:59,173
But at some point you're gonna
have to deal with how you feel.

641
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:02,613
Oh, God, can't I just get upset...

642
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:06,658
...without having to focus on
what's really making me upset?

643
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:10,703
Well, it worked for me for 34 years.

644
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:14,061
Hey.

645
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:20,897
Hey, who's this?

646
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:22,825
Jim. Who's this?

647
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:26,225
Steve, So, what do you look like?

648
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:30,626
I'm 6'2", 190 pounds.
I'm a professional boxer.

649
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:34,902
- Yeah? What's your dick like?
- Nine and a half inches, uncut.

650
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:38,625
- So, what are you looking for?
- A nasty top to fuck my brains out,

651
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,106
Found him. Now, get on your knees
and suck my cock, boy.

652
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,145
Oh, fuck, Yes, sir, Oh, yes,

653
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,945
I don't care what time it is,
I need to be with someone,

654
00:47:49,192 --> 00:47:51,911
Someone, that's comforting.

655
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:54,786
Okay, I wanna talk to you.

656
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,825
If this is about Billy, I can't.

657
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:03,312
I've done nothing but talk about Billy
for two days.

658
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:10,788
Well, what's happening with him?

659
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,392
Look...

660
00:48:19,437 --> 00:48:22,668
...I know this is really hard for you.

661
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,512
I've had some time to calm down
about the picture...

662
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:30,758
...so you can just spill your guts
to me, okay?

663
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,998
I promise not to make it about me.

664
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,593
I'm too tired.

665
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:44,471
You know what?

666
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:49,793
I love you, and I need you.

667
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:54,402
And it's okay for you to need me too.
I want you to need me.

668
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:04,200
I'm doing the best I can.

669
00:49:26,608 --> 00:49:29,203
Rough night, stud?

670
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:32,609
You're fired.

671
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,011
Fuck.

672
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,321
Yoo-hoo, Brenda!

673
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:47,365
Brenda, I know you're home.
Your car's out front.

674
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:52,010
I don't know what's so strange about
a spontaneous brunch. I think it's fun.

675
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:54,683
It's weird.

676
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,523
You don't do things like this.

677
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:00,532
You pay people to do things like this.

678
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,726
- Oh, hello, Nate.
- Hey.

679
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:05,574
Now I see why you're so upset
that I'm here.

680
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:11,126
My mother's come over to see
if I talked Billy into committing himself.

681
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:15,529
She just loves saying that. It makes her
father and I sound more like monsters.

682
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:17,887
Well, I didn't do it, and I'm not going to.

683
00:50:18,137 --> 00:50:20,413
Goddamn it!

684
00:50:21,658 --> 00:50:25,697
I asked for chives,
and they give me this veggie crap.

685
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,210
Brenda...

686
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,896
...there's something
you don't know about Billy.

687
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:40,336
Oh, here we go.

688
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:47,135
You know when you were
in Europe that summer?

689
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:51,621
Billy didn't try to kill himself.

690
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,335
What?

691
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:58,423
Your father and I had gotten back from
a conference to find our house on fire.

692
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,620
It started right below the family room.

693
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,895
Remember, we had it redone
when you were away?

694
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,665
Yeah, but Billy was...

695
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:08,619
I went to visit him in the hospital.
He was there all summer.

696
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:12,297
Your father and I put him there.
We had no choice.

697
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:15,744
That fire wasn't accidental, Brenda.
He was making a bomb.

698
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:19,861
This is getting really fucking desperate.
What, now Billy's the Unabomber?

699
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:24,944
He had written things. Ugly, violent
things about your father and me...

700
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:28,664
...about you. He was dangerous.

701
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:34,222
You let me believe for all these years
that Billy tried to kill himself.

702
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:38,385
We were only trying
to protect you, honey.

703
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:43,032
Get out of my house.

704
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:46,669
Get out of my house,
you fucking lunatic!

705
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:53,950
- It's a wonder I'm even alive.
- Hello?

706
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:58,067
- You're like fucking Medea!
- Dave, this is a really bad time.

707
00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:02,233
You know what the really
sick thing is, Mother?

708
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:06,274
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

709
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:08,074
Brenda.

710
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,552
- Brenda, hang on.
- I'll call you later, Nate...

711
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,475
...when that asshole's out of my house.

712
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:14,907
Dave, I gotta go.

713
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:18,676
What, you fired her already?

714
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:20,948
Oh, for chrissake.

715
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:24,273
You should've lined up somebody.
Why are you whispering?

716
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:27,750
I'm hiding up here
until she finishes Mrs. Sarno.

717
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,560
So which of those other people
did you like best?

718
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,910
Look, let's not make
any quick decisions.

719
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,471
I guess I could probably live
with the panic-attack guy.

720
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,478
I've got a better idea,

721
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:43,554
Hey, Rico.

722
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:45,716
Bad time?

723
00:52:45,923 --> 00:52:47,800
No, everyone's at lunch
except me and Pam.

724
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,836
You're one of the Fishers, aren't you?

725
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:58,756
Cigarette break.
But I gotta be back in 10...

726
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:02,241
...because I told Gilardi I'd have
this one done when he got back.

727
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:07,435
The subscriber you've called
is outside the service...

728
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:47,927
Oh, great. Fucking hell.

729
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,488
Here, let me help you.

730
00:53:57,295 --> 00:53:58,933
Shit.

731
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:04,568
I don't know why I brought
so much stuff here.

732
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:07,575
I guess I'm just a nester.

733
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:14,330
I should've told you
that I broke the goblet.

734
00:54:14,578 --> 00:54:19,653
- It was a gift from my cousin.
- Yeah, trip to Dresden. I heard.

735
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:23,935
I don't know why I didn't just tell you.

736
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,377
It's totally unlike me.
I usually just say whatever I'm thinking.

737
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,411
I noticed.

738
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,573
But I saw that broken glass...

739
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:38,900
...and I just was overcome
with this feeling that it was...

740
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:42,379
...better to just ignore it...

741
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:47,578
...just pretend that it didn't happen.
I get that feeling...

742
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,014
...from all of you here.

743
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:53,302
Everyone is so fragile...

744
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:56,781
...and can't bear to hear anything.

745
00:54:57,225 --> 00:54:58,658
Is that everything?

746
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:03,144
I mean, all I did was try
to fix David up with this guy...

747
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:06,060
...and I thought he was gonna kill me.
I never met anyone...

748
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:09,498
...who was so uptight about being gay.

749
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:15,264
Thanks.

750
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:21,539
You know something?

751
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:26,984
I never worked in a funeral home
that was this depressing.

752
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,507
Tell me you're happier here, and I'll go.

753
00:55:37,712 --> 00:55:42,309
It's not perfect. These body farms
are a fucking assembly line.

754
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,107
And I've got like 12 idiots
breathing down my neck.

755
00:55:45,394 --> 00:55:47,954
At Fisher & Sons you only get
two of those at the most.

756
00:55:48,154 --> 00:55:49,906
And Gilardi lied to me.

757
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,913
My hours are nothing
like he said they'd be.

758
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:58,065
And the work here is not even
as challenging, you know?

759
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,793
Nate...

760
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:06,475
...it was Kroehner who burned down
the house across the street.

761
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,997
Gilardi's told people that he's not done
trying to drive you guys out of business.

762
00:56:11,238 --> 00:56:13,911
Does that mean it doesn't make sense
for you to come back?

763
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:16,838
No, but if I do, you have to match
what I'm making here...

764
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,752
...plus guarantee me flexible hours
for picking up Julio...

765
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,916
...and helping when the baby comes.
- Done.

766
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,549
And if I do decide to come back...

767
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,513
...it's not for good.

768
00:56:30,601 --> 00:56:32,718
I'm never gonna become a partner, am I?

769
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:36,762
I can't offer you that...

770
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:40,956
...unless you wanna marry Claire.

771
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:44,760
No, thank you.

772
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:48,315
Okay, I can start in a couple of days.

773
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:52,683
Thank you. That makes me very happy,
and it will make David very happy.

774
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:58,319
Yeah. Hey, I heard there's some picture
of you in a gallery peeing.

775
00:56:58,526 --> 00:57:00,562
Is that true?

776
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:05,282
I just wanted to get Gabe's father's
number, so I could talk to him.

777
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:08,998
Well, why would Gabe's stepfather
know where Gabe was?

778
00:57:09,248 --> 00:57:12,285
No, his father, the one
who lives in Barstow.

779
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:16,921
Yeah, Gabe's father died
when he was 4.

780
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,286
Yeah.

781
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,329
Oh, if you should run into Gabe...

782
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:28,888
...would you tell him I really don't
appreciate his staying out all night?

783
00:57:34,532 --> 00:57:38,003
So that's... That's it, I guess,

784
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:41,731
Goodbye, Claire,

785
00:57:41,934 --> 00:57:43,970
Mrs. Dimas?

786
00:57:44,414 --> 00:57:47,691
Mrs. Dimas? Mrs. Dimas?

787
00:57:50,984 --> 00:58:24,939
