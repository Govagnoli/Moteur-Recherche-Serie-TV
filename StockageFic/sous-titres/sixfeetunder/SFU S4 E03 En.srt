1
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,598
OK, Ashley, your turn. Pick someone.

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,830
- "Gupta, Sandeep."
- No Indian people.

3
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,758
We'll get in trouble. We should stop doing this.

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,156
How about Mr and Mrs Gerald Gurvitz?

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,395
- Yes, do them.
- OK.

6
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,030
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, is Gerald there?</i>

7
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,834
- What time is it? Who is this?
- He'll know.

8
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,391
Honey, wake up. Something's wrong.

9
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,999
- May I ask what this is regarding?
- Tell him he left his underwear here.

10
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,676
- Excuse me?
- What is it?

11
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,553
- Hang up!
- Put it on speaker!

12
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,630
There's a woman on the phone and she says
that you left your underwear at her house.

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,673
- That's... That's not possible.
- God damn it, Gerald!

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,757
I could kill you, Gerry. What did you do?

15
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,473
Better hang up, Ashley. I'm dying!

16
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,391
- Jesus.
- What is it?

17
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Just kids. I'm gonna call the police.
I've got caller ID, you little idiots.

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,679
Kaitlin?

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,276
My God.

20
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,788
Kaitlin, are you OK?

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,308
Oh, my God! Mrs Stolte!

22
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,511
- Kaitlin! Kaitlin!
- Mrs Stolte...

23
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,988
I am so, so sorry.

24
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,438
- Cancer?
- Yes.

25
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,471
Yes, cancer.

26
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,592
I'm here. I'm here for you.

27
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,679
OK, better. But use "we're here",
not "I'm here". You're not their friend.

28
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,475
Easy on the touching. Even funeral directors
have to beware of transference.

29
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,036
David, you are, quite simply put,
the best I've ever worked with.

30
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,350
Arthur, I'm the only one
you've ever worked with.

31
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,394
OK.

32
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,908
This one's all you.

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,757
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,311
Something youthful, something white.

35
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,670
Perhaps white with her favourite colour.

36
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,633
- Her favourite colour is light blue.
- I thought it was purple.

37
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,959
It used to be purple.
This year it changed to light blue. Sky blue.

38
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,114
She's only 14.

39
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,429
That is so young.

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,074
It is. It is so young.

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,476
Might I suggest white
with a periwinkle silk lining?

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,516
Periwinkle is sort of in-between purple
and light blue. I think she might like that.

43
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,028
She would like that. That's good.

44
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,799
OK, that's all we need for now.

45
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,876
I'll send photos over later.

46
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,559
We didn't know we had to bring photos.

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,068
Of course not. How could you?

48
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,270
I'll see you out.

49
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,034
Claire, could you come get this?

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,273
- Nice.
- People collect those.

51
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,871
- It's kind of racist.
- That's why I put it up there back in the '60s.

52
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,515
Put it with all the other things
in that pile over there.

53
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,916
Did you start making piles in your room yet?

54
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,953
I still have to go through some old piles,
then I'll make some new ones.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,393
I've made a schedule for the garage sale.
With a plan in place, we'll be free to deviate.

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,151
As long as we're free to deviate.

57
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,155
So are we just selling our stuff
to make room for George

58
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,033
or will he get rid of some of his stuff, too?

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,392
Like perhaps his Tupperware thing full of shit.
Sorry. What are we calling it?

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,591
We're not calling it anything. It's long gone.

61
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,518
There are a lot of things that aren't even mine.

62
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,159
Like that Mammy cookie jar. That comes from
your father's side. A lot of stuff needs to go.

63
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,751
I'd prefer it if people could just come upstairs
and, like, bid on my entire room.

64
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,749
I'm sure Nate has a few things
he probably doesn't need to have around.

65
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,237
- Monkey.
- Monkey.

66
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,435
I'm crazy about the new Range Rovers.
You can't drive an SUV with a straight face.

67
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,838
- I don't see another way. Not a minivan.
- Oh, no, fuck that.

68
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,709
Hey, there's that poor guy
whose wife drowned.

69
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,230
I know, that is so sad.

70
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,271
He's hot though?

71
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,919
- Hey.
- Hi.

72
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,951
Hi. How are you two?

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,152
-We're fine, thank you.
- You're Nate, right?

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,919
- I'm Madeline.
- Madeline, hi.

75
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,632
This is Linda.

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,990
- How are you?
- And I know Maya.

77
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,911
Hello, Maya.

78
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,149
Wanna get down and play? All right.

79
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,831
There you go.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,351
All right.

81
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,795
- Hey, you guys going to Jimmy's thing tonight?
- I'm so sick of Jimmy's things.

82
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,513
I actually think we're not going.

83
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,795
We're all going.
It's not like there's anything better to do.

84
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,595
- What time are you guys getting there?
- Don't forget about that thing in Chinatown.

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,633
- We should go to that.
- We'll go there first and get to Jimmy's at ten.

86
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,877
Excellent, good. I will see you there.

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,876
Not going.

88
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,274
God, that moustache is repulsive.
I can't believe I loved him.

89
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,349
I thought you guys were just friends.

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,188
No, he was my serious boyfriend,
like, all of freshman year.

91
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,549
I could've have sworn he was gay.

92
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,397
He's knitting.

93
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,228
Haven't you noticed?
A lot of straight guys knit. It's a macho thing.

94
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,589
"I'm so straight I can even knit."

95
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,712
OK, so he's actually not gay?

96
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,873
Don't even ask me. At the time he had,
like, severe bi-curious issues.

97
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,311
Why don't you want to go to Jimmy's thing?
He's, like, the Matthew Barney of LAC Arts.

98
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,396
Right, he wishes.

99
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,432
I already told Edie we were going.

100
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,075
- She's going?
- Yeah, she's always at his things.

101
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,832
Not bad.

102
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,793
If Jessica Simpson is the poor man's Britney,
what's Celeste?

103
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,072
Maybe a thinking man's Britney.
Her music is inspirational to young girls.

104
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,430
- "I'm not just an object, I am somebody."
- Like Christina.

105
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,358
Yeah, but without the ass
hanging out of the chaps.

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,632
Got it. I'd like to see your ass
hanging out of some chaps!

107
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,956
OK, never. You know I hate that shit.

108
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,078
- So do you get to meet Celeste tomorrow?
- No, I'm the third line of defence.

109
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,556
You don't meet the big stars
until you've proven you're not a freak.

110
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,716
Remember Cameron Diaz?

111
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,353
OK, definitely do not do that in front of Celeste
or any of Celeste's "people", OK, freak?

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,192
"Shave my legs for free"?
Those aren't the words!

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,912
Condom.

114
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,271
Come on, come on!

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,991
You got it?

116
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,878
- OK?
- Almost, almost.

117
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,996
Wait a second.

118
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,358
- I'll take care of it.
- I hate these things.

119
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
Let's just... let's do something else.

120
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,035
- Let me make you come.
- No, I want to make you come.

121
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,471
No, then there's this expectation.
I hate expectations.

122
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,239
Just let me try.

123
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,953
I don't want to try.

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,797
- Here...
- OK.

125
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,559
Just lay down...

126
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,591
lay back...

127
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,197
and shush.

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,717
I can't get rid of this goofy smile.

129
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,389
If I can get this right,
I think I can bring her lips down a little bit.

130
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,594
- May I ask what technique you'll employ?
- Yes. It's called the full MacKew.

131
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,677
I've threaded ligature
through her nasal cartilage.

132
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,553
I thought that was called a half MacKew.

133
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,196
If I'd stopped there,
it would've been a half MacKew, but watch.

134
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,711
I'm going downward through her gum line here

135
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,799
and using her jawbone to anchor the thread
before I tie it off.

136
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,478
Fascinating.

137
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,116
Arthur, you ready to go?

138
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,392
Federico, if it's all right with you,
I'll return in one and one-half hours.

139
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,830
Maybe a little longer
if we decide to get lunch after.

140
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,474
I'll wash up and meet you in the foyer.

141
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,592
- You guys are getting lunch?
- Shopping, then lunch.

142
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,313
- Wow, shopping.
- Would you like to join us?

143
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,830
- No, no, I have work to do.
- OK.

144
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,871
This one won't stop smiling.

145
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,558
I wish I knew what the fuck was so funny.

146
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,432
Hello?

147
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,238
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

148
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,875
- Come on in.
- Look, Jaden, tu amiga is here!

149
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,948
Hey, Maya, hi. Hey, if she wants
to go and play, you can just let her go.

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,958
She hasn't really played with many kids yet.

151
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,393
At this age, they play next to each other,
not with each other. It's called parallel play.

152
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,671
You want to get down? Wanna go play?
There you go.

153
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,758
There she goes. Oh, here, I'll take that.

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,317
OK, Miss Madeline. Come, hija.

155
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,396
So...do you want a smoothie?

156
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,158
Sure, sure.

157
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,670
Wanna play with the monkey?
You like monkeys?

158
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,750
Must be a late wedding present. The card
says, "To Mr and Mrs George Sibley."

159
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,112
I like the sound of that. Mrs George...
Oh, dear!

160
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,355
What did we get?

161
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,518
- What's that smell?
- It appears to be excrement again.

162
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,434
No way!

163
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,429
Except this time someone went to the trouble
to place one inside a decorative tin.

164
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,034
"To Mr and Mrs George Sibley."

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,120
- No signature. Imagine that.
- This is a catastrophe of the highest order.

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,355
This involves both of us now.

167
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,391
Who knows you live here?

168
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,637
Why don't you care about this?

169
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,478
I've made a lot of enemies through the years.

170
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,718
Take the back-stabbing world of academia,
throw in a controversial field like geology,

171
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,557
you've got trouble.

172
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,636
Geology is controversial?

173
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,035
Oil, Claire. Oil.

174
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,153
Look, this is from a person
who quite obviously is looking for a reaction.

175
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,193
- Somebody who needs attention.
- That person isn't in the room.

176
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,312
- He can't see my reaction.
- Good point, Mom.

177
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,549
- Maybe it's one of your mother's old lovers.
- My lovers?

178
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,592
- The Greek one.
- He was Russian.

179
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,476
- Are you leaving, Claire?
- Yeah.

180
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,514
- Toss this in the dumpster, would you?
- I think I'll let you do that, George.

181
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,990
Oh, Lord.

182
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,315
Put back to me.

183
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,749
I like you in brown.

184
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,189
Is this brown or is this grey?

185
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,435
- Charka.
- See, chocolate.

186
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,280
- I thought he said charcoal.
- Charka.

187
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,550
OK, take off now.

188
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,717
- What did you find?
- Normally I'd never shop in the Valley.

189
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,196
This place ain't bad.
There's a rack of marked-down Jil Sander.

190
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,234
Plus some John Varvatos, Hugo Boss
and a pair of Prada shoes for $100.

191
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,192
- Where's Arthur?
- Changing.

192
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,068
Maybe we should buy him
a whole new wardrobe. Do they ever do that?

193
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,911
- "Queer Eye for the Gay Guy"?
- I don't think Arthur's gay, I think he's A.

194
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,796
I think asexual people are asexual because
they don't wanna come out of the closet.

195
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,230
- You really think Arthur might be gay?
- Yeah.

196
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,391
- Breaks my heart.
- I'm gonna go try a couple of these on.

197
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,876
You'd look good in this.

198
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,833
David, I need new clothes for work,
not gay ski weekend at Mammoth.

199
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,591
I'm gonna buy you the suit, OK?

200
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,954
- No, I couldn't possibly let you do that.
- I want to. Besides, it's a business expense.

201
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,751
If I had a father, this is the kind of thing
he'd do for me.

202
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,911
Or even an elder sibling.

203
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,951
It's just a suit.

204
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,316
Hey, Nicole.
You like the way this sounds, huh?

205
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,830
The guy goes, if I wanted my food stamps,
I should've been on time.

206
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,589
He said I had to call the social worker,
but she's out all week.

207
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,633
Anyway, my friend's here
so I'm gonna go right now. Bye.

208
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,709
We should get Nicole some toys.

209
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,630
That top is kid safe...
but, yeah, she needs some new toys.

210
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,919
I didn't know you got food stamps.

211
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,555
Yeah, they're from
before I was working at the club.

212
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,557
I can afford food.

213
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,038
It's just, if I get the food stamps,
then I can save the cash for something else.

214
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,631
Hey, you OK?

215
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,074
I don't want Nicole to see me cry.

216
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,313
It's just I've been a little freaked out lately
because I'm completely exhausted.

217
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,432
I think it's because I have the lupus.

218
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,109
Oh, shit, are you serious? No? What...

219
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,549
It's caused by leaking implants.

220
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,516
I feel like one of 'em ruptured and there's
poison silicone roaming around my body.

221
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,239
Jeez.

222
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,948
- Did you see a doctor? Did you...
- Not yet, not yet.

223
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,431
Oh, my God, Sophia.
Hey, listen, it's gonna be OK. All right?

224
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,388
- Maybe we should... maybe we should pray.
- Rico, I don't need prayer, I need surgery.

225
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,149
Medical surgery! Plus if I get one boob done,
they're not gonna match.

226
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,034
I have to get them both re-done,
which is, like, five grand!

227
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,910
Unless you put the payment plan,
which is, like, $1,500 deposit.

228
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,598
I'm not asking you for the money.
God, I should have never told you.

229
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,960
If I were to give you the $1,500 for the deposit,

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,516
do you think that maybe
you can pay me back?

231
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,278
I don't know where I could get $1,500
in a chunk like that.

232
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,876
Well, you can pay me back whatever you have
whenever you have it.

233
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,229
I'll just give you the money.

234
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,511
Oh, my God, are you serious?

235
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,074
My angel.

236
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,112
Nicole, God sent us an angel.

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,472
Thank you.

238
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,951
You have a great life.

239
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,552
Thanks.

240
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,909
Do I need a coaster?

241
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,155
No, you can put it anywhere.

242
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,119
OK, so this is the book I was telling you about.

243
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,549
His name is Thich Nhat Hanh.

244
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,156
He says that
it all starts with learning how to breathe

245
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,679
so...

246
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,917
Thich Nhat Hanh.
So, if I read this book, I'll be happy?

247
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,389
It's not that simple.

248
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,111
So what is it? You seem to be happy.
You ought to know.

249
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,077
God, well...

250
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,959
I don't know. I guess for me
it all started with my divorce, actually,

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,198
and then making the decision
to be a stay-at-home mom.

252
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,950
I mean it's hard, not working,
but I love being with Jaden so...

253
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,918
When she's not with her nannies.

254
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,589
OK, one is a nanny
and the other is a housekeeper.

255
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,119
OK.

256
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,788
So this...

257
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,870
- Is this what you wanted your life to be?
- This is actually better than I expected.

258
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,271
It smells so good in here.

259
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,756
- Thich Nhat Hanh?
- Right.

260
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,156
That fireplace work?

261
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,592
Yeah.

262
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,872
It's OK.

263
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,351
What's OK?

264
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,515
About fucking time! Everybody kept asking,
"When are Claire and Anita getting here?"

265
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,551
I said, how the fuck should I know?

266
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,268
How 'bout it, my ladies?

267
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,919
- Whoa!
- You're quite the host.

268
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,918
Everything I do, I do for you.

269
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,595
- Do you have a lighter?
- I've got fire. Go, your serene hotness.

270
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,268
- Better now.
- Me, me.

271
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,157
- That better not be you, Russell.
- Hey, you.

272
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,033
- How long have you been here?
- Too long.

273
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,435
Hey, I like your skirt. Did you make it?

274
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,472
- Maybe I did.
- You are so talented.

275
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,917
Look at that.

276
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,631
This always happens. I get stoned
and then I'm locked in this prison.

277
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,476
What, you're paranoid?

278
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,353
God, please, no one thinks anything bad.

279
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,358
You're the beautiful, fair,
untouchable art princess.

280
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,196
No, I'm not so much paranoid.

281
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,232
More like I'd rather choose
to just be this observer.

282
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,475
For one, I know that if I feel any vibe
about any guy,

283
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,557
I should know it means red flag, red flag!

284
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,195
Beyond that, basically I hate everyone.

285
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,710
I hate her...and her.

286
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,315
And that guy with the fucking Boy Scout jacket.
Like, is that supposed to be ironic?

287
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,832
Yeah, I would say more misanthrope
than paranoid.

288
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,874
Yeah, but I'm also so tired of hating
everything, you know? I mean, truly.

289
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
Check one, two.

290
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,710
People, focus. The person on stage
needs to be looked at.

291
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,229
- Are you incredibly stoned?
- No.

292
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,033
- Does she do this a lot?
- All the time.

293
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,788
- I miss you.
- Shut it.

294
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,755
..great American art school poseur
jerk-off extravaganza.

295
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,188
Anyone near the stage, we call that the
splash zone so you may wanna stand back.

296
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,277
I'm not responsible for dry-cleaning bills.

297
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,675
Yeah, baby.

298
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,430
Jesus Christ.
This girl is ding-dong out of her mind.

299
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,473
You're the only girl here.

300
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,718
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

301
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,788
- I wish I had my camera.
- Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

302
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,117
Please enter.

303
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,791
Well... Hello, Mrs... Ruth.

304
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,276
- Arthur, I have something to say to you.
- Please.

305
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,915
What we had was very special,
but it's in the past.

306
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,350
We can't hold grudges
and be angry with one another.

307
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,391
I hold no grudges with you.

308
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,910
I'm happy that you...appear so happy.

309
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,269
Arthur, this has to stop!

310
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,359
I know that you sent us the faeces box
and the faeces gift basket.

311
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,879
Ruth!

312
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,348
Do you know how horrified I am

313
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,359
that you think I could commit
an act so heinous?

314
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,028
You don't know me at all, do you?

315
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,071
I know that you're frustrated,

316
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,830
sitting idly by as George and I fall
deeper and deeper in love each day.

317
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,668
- But we had our chance, we had our time...
- We never had a chance!

318
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,830
So...you are harbouring feelings.

319
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,791
I do harbour feelings.

320
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,517
I'm human...

321
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,509
and I'm a man.

322
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,710
You of all people should know that.

323
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,039
But I would never send those things to you.
I could never send you...

324
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,797
poo.

325
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,831
Ever.

326
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,952
I wish I could believe you.

327
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,751
I wish you could, too.

328
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,437
Now, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

329
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,917
- Is this the line?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,552
So this course I'm taking,
Recovery From Madness,

331
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,752
the woman who teaches it was actually,
or is, bipolar.

332
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,190
- Do you have to be bipolar to get in?
- It helps.

333
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,279
Anyway, she wrote this incredible book
explaining what it feels like.

334
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,311
She's kind of a pioneer.

335
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,238
Here.

336
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,915
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

337
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,350
I could wait on you hand and foot all day.
I'm serious.

338
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,198
It would make me a very happy man.

339
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,159
You know last night
when I was putting on that condom...

340
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,988
Listen, I should just go back on the pill.
It won't be a problem.

341
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,758
No, no, no.

342
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,188
I used to think that I had a problem
staying hard or whatever.

343
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,435
Hey, no, it's OK, really.

344
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,870
No, then I realised

345
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,071
that I'm totally hard when I...

346
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,953
You know, like when people role...

347
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,950
I really like that dynamic when, one person
is boss and the other person is sort of, like,

348
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,390
more dominant
or the other person's a little more sub...

349
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,273
I'm not explaining this very well.

350
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,039
No, you're... You're explaining it fine.

351
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,878
- It's actually...
- You don't need to explain it any more.

352
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,911
I know everyone has their thing.

353
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,715
I've known prostitutes and dominatrixes.
I've been to sex clubs and leather clubs.

354
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,356
I've heard of guys who can only come if...
I don't know, the girl is sitting on a balloon.

355
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,598
I wrote this whole erotic novella
about a girl who...

356
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,558
I was hoping that we could be...

357
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,037
- We can be anything, I'm not...
- No. I was hoping that...

358
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,998
we...

359
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,476
could have normal sex.

360
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,356
- Like, normal sex?
- Yeah, normal sex.

361
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,755
The way normal people do it.

362
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,997
- Normal people have sex, right?
- Yeah, I presume so.

363
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,750
They don't turn it all into fantasy or
get drunk or smoke pot to make it interesting.

364
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,588
- We can smoke pot. I can get pot.
- I don't want to smoke pot.

365
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,194
I smoked so much pot, it was...
It made me me.

366
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,274
Now all those things just seem
like an escape from sex.

367
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,794
All right, well, I'll put some thought
into exploring my normal side.

368
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,589
That's not what I was saying.

369
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,398
But, anyway, look... I should go to bed.

370
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,431
I've got class tomorrow.

371
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,396
So I'm going home?

372
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,795
If you need to.

373
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,911
Yeah.

374
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,028
Yuck. Spinnies.

375
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,795
Are you gonna barf in my bed?

376
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,199
Nah.

377
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,437
I can get a garbage can
and put it next to you if you want.

378
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,277
Nah.

379
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,111
I can't believe I drank so much
and didn't even have fun.

380
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,355
I can't believe I made out with Russell.

381
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,748
He's a really good kisser.

382
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,319
Yeah.

383
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,832
So is Edie, like, full-time lesbian

384
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,917
or is she just, like, art school bi-girl?

385
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,353
No, hardcore. Like, totally lesbian feminist.

386
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,992
Is she going out with that girl?
That red-haired girl with the Wife Beater?

387
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,749
You OK, Anita?

388
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,189
Maybe I could use that garbage can.

389
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,032
Arthur?

390
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,438
"To the Fisher family.

391
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,679
"I am sorry to inform you
that I am resigning from Fisher & Diaz,

392
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,076
"as well as releasing tenancy of my room
in the Fisher residence.

393
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,511
"I no longer feel comfortable
in these surroundings. Best, Arthur."

394
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,430
- Who's Arthur?
- Who are you?

395
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,719
This is my friend Anita. That's my brother
David. And this is my brother Nate.

396
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,634
- Hi.
- Hey.

397
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,312
Arthur quit.

398
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, that's too bad.

399
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,389
- What happened? I just bought him a suit.
- Well, I got to go.

400
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,479
I have to take Maya over to
her new friend Jaden's house for a play date.

401
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,953
Cool.

402
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,916
- Leave. Maya has places to be. I'll be fine.
- Two-year-olds have friendships?

403
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,077
Yeah, they met at Mommy and Me
and hit it off.

404
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,238
- Where's all your garage sale stuff?
- I don't have any.

405
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,353
Look, everything I have, I need.

406
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,952
Don't ask.

407
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,150
I wonder if Arthur felt pressured.

408
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,909
Like Keith and I were trying
to welcome-wagon him into Gayland.

409
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,236
Gayland?
Please, Arthur had a thing with Mom.

410
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,352
In fact,
I'm pretty sure they were fuck buddies.

411
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,319
Arthur and Mom?

412
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,956
Yeah, she was very vague about it,
but I know something went on.

413
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,195
Scott, I'm putting you out in the audience
in case some freak got in.

414
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,028
- Keith, you're the designated for Celeste.
- Got it.

415
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,517
Park it outside her dressing room. Don't let
anybody in except for the rabbi and lawyer.

416
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Just those two guys, check.

417
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,119
- No, they're the same guy.
- Copy that.

418
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,551
Fred, I think I've already made this
perfectly clear. Yes.

419
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,671
Yes.

420
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,953
I'm fine doing the crappy Kids' Choice Awards,
but I will not present with Hilary fucking Duff.

421
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,111
There has to be someone else.
Come on, think a little harder than that.

422
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,869
The Olsen twins?
What, is that supposed to be funny?

423
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,712
Hi, it's me. I miss you. Where are you?

424
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,954
- Hi. How you doing?
- Good.

425
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,958
- She in there?
- I believe so.

426
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,072
I'm not supposed to allow anybody in.

427
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,033
I understand, but I'm Ellen. It's my show so...

428
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,957
Right.

429
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,992
Not a threat. That's a pretty blouse.

430
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,391
That doesn't sound manly. Nice shirt.
Is that mauve or mauve?

431
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,829
- Yeah.
- Pretty. Excuse me.

432
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,838
Celeste. Hi, I'm Ellen.

433
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,996
I know that.

434
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,191
- Pineapple?
- No, thank you.

435
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,468
It's like my brain is encased in this fluid

436
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,672
and if I move, then the fluid moves
and my brain kills.

437
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,518
Or it could be encephalitis.

438
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,551
Here, try my soda.

439
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,795
Looks like you sold my TV.

440
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,037
Yeah, I got 50.

441
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,551
Your little boys are so cute.
The big one looks exactly like his daddy.

442
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,993
Yeah, his daddy's gonna buy some more junk
and we're gonna spend the 50 we just made!

443
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,273
<i>Control Freaks is the movie and</i>
<i>Colin Farrell, who she's just friends with</i>...

444
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,916
- <i>We're just friends. He's really sweet</i>.
- <i>Whatever you say</i>.

445
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,428
<i>So let's talk a little bit about the CD</i>.

446
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,948
- <i>Me. Here. Nowl</i>
- <i>Me. Here. Nowl</i>

447
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,950
- <i>And is it me, comma, here, comma, now?</i>
- <i>No, me, period, here, period, nowl</i>

448
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,719
- <i>Exclamation</i>.
- <i>It is strong</i>.

449
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,911
<i>It's about me being here right now</i>.

450
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,114
<i>I want my fans, all the girls out there, to know</i>
<i>that the most important thing is to be yourself</i>

451
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,355
<i>and to be here, now</i>.

452
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,712
<i>That's right</i>.
<i>And this is who you are in the now</i>.

453
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,153
<i>But if you were someone different yesterday</i>
<i>or even tomorrow, that's still who you are</i>.

454

455
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,077
<i>But it's you in the then</i>.

456
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,839
<i>Uh-huh, and it comes out in two weeks</i>.

457
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,679
Oh, my God! Creepy Colin Farrell
just left me another creepy message.

458
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,111
- Can't we do something about that? Legally?
- I guess that's it.

459
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,551
Keith, did you use the bathroom
in Celeste's dressing room?

460
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,071
Yeah, but that's when she was doing the show.
No one was around so I thought...

461
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,715
- It's not cool, OK?
- OK, I'm sorry.

462
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,877
You do not use the client's can ever.

463
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,717
Got it.

464
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,195
I think I know who sent us the...

465
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,549
- The shit?
- Yes, the shit.

466
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,591
I believe it was Arthur.

467
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,997
- Arthur?
- Arthur quit today after I confronted him.

468
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,079
You should probably know
that Arthur and I once had something.

469
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,509
I don't know why I didn't tell you.

470
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,199
No need. It's none of my business.

471
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,318
He doesn't seem like
someone you'd be attracted to.

472
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,956
Well, it wasn't... It wasn't a relationship.

473
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,673
But we did care deeply for one another.

474
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,712
We understood one another,
had similar interests.

475
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,150
Similar interests? Like sex?

476
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,919
No, no, it wasn't like that.

477
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,999
We had our own language. We nuzzled.

478
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,349
- I don't know what you mean.
- The way horses nuzzle.

479
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,834
Like a head rubbing.

480
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,871
Head-butting.

481
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,277
You butted heads?

482
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,788
You make it sound so sordid.

483
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,195
Look, we did this.

484
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,596
- Stop it. It was quite lovely. It wasn't funny.
- No.

485
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,714
Yes, maybe we were a little crazy.

486
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,638
It's called a folie à deux.

487
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,639
Two people confusing
a momentary insanity for love.

488
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,671
Is that what it's called?

489
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,953
I'm sorry, Jaden and I
have to go meet some people at The Grove.

490
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,233
- No, it's fine, I just thought...
- Hey, did you get my bed all wet?

491
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,430
I thought you were coming back.

492
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,549
- I wish.
- Maya and I could stay here with the nanny.

493
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,593
I could pop in a movie for her.
We could be waiting when you get back.

494
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,598
You're funny.

495
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,751
God, these sheets feel so good.

496
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,913
I've never felt anything like them.
Where are they from?

497
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,955
I need you to leave.

498
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,318
Right.

499
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,636
- So it's that easy?
- What is?

500
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,514
I mean, how are people
supposed to do this exactly?

501
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,550
Am I supposed to avoid
that particular Mommy and Me class

502
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,910
or you'll send your nanny
so you can avoid looking at me

503
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,353
and seeing what I thought I saw in you...
until I just cease to exist?

504
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,711
And so do you.

505
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,278
Nate...are you OK?

506
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,119
I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm doing this.

507
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,071
You have to leave. We'll go.

508
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,549
OK, I'll wait for you downstairs.

509
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,078
Oh, God.

510
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,831
You got in trouble?

511
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,192
What, did you ask for her autograph
or something or look her in the eye?

512
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,959
No, worse. I peed in her john.

513
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,194
- What, you mean, like, on the toilet seat?
- No, I lifted the seat.

514
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,472
I just used the same toilet she did,
which apparently is a major faux pas.

515
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,549
Well, if it helps, my day sucked, too.
Arthur quit.

516
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,710
Yeah, I'm in hell. And I'll probably never
be home in time for dinner again.

517
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,519
So where's your other brother?

518
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,632
What's your problem?
In love with my brother now?

519
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,671
I just asked where he was.

520
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,278
God, if no one buys this stuff,
I am not dragging it back upstairs.

521
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,079
I'm just not feeling
this hippy-dippy paisley crap any more.

522
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,556
It's, like,
suddenly I just feel modern and simple.

523
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,194
I just want, like, white plastic furniture.

524
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,279
Why not just trash all the shit you don't want
or take it to the thrift store?

525
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,275
Yeah, or burn it.

526
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,912
Yeah?

527
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,672
Yeah.

528
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,192
Hey, Mom.

529
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,437
Mom, why don't we just burn what's left over?

530
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,156
- We can't. Some of this stuff is valuable.
- Sure you wanna save this?

531
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,998
That was Arthur's pouch.

532
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,031
Couple pennies in it.

533
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,670
I think you're right, Claire.
Let's burn it. Let's burn it all.

534
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,188
I missed you.

535
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,390
You were so far away.

536
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,829
All the way across the courtyard.

537
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,429
It was nice knowing where you were
even when we weren't talking.

538
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,471
Were we not talking?

539
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,309
Not officially, I guess.

540
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,791
So this question of normal sex...

541
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,434
I know. It is so silly.

542
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,871
I don't know why I said it.
I don't even know what I meant.

543
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,869
I think I just wanted so much
to do it right this time and I thought...

544
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,914
Funny, cos the more I thought about it,
the more normal sex just seemed like...

545
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,150
you know, bad sex.

546
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,997
I know.

547
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,957
I think, ideally, sex for me should be this...

548
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,434
you know, revealing of myself.

549
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,711
Ourselves, maybe.

550
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,998
And I think that can be a loving thing, too.

551
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,392
Right?

552
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,274
Don't... don't take Brenda apart

553
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,118
and just sort of hand me the good stuff.

554
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,278
I want all the stuff, even the bad stuff.

555
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,872
What?

556
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,270
So...

557
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,869
what was it that you wanted to say?

558
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,672
Well...

559
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,709
remember when I said
I could wait on you hand and foot?

560
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,871
What's this?

561
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,751
You look weird.

562
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,511
Hey, can you hold her?

563
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,071
- Don't let her get too close to the fire.
- OK.

564
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,632
Mom, I'm moving back into the house.

565
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,238
OK.

566
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,589
You can have Arthur's room.

567
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,670
Can I have the coach house then?

568
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,438
Well, I don't see why not.

569
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,549
English
