1
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,894
Expansion has slowed,
but then the economy has slowed.

2
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,295
It's only natural.

3
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:49,220
No, growth is the only thing
that is natural, Mr. Gilardi.

4
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:52,220
And growth is the only thing
that is acceptable.

5
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,261
Now, I know that may sound harsh,
but it's the truth.

6
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:58,415
To accept anything less
is sheer laziness.

7
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,422
And if there's one thing
I can't abide, it is laziness.

8
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,262
I've been watching you.

9
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,581
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. You're smart.

10
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,053
You're ambitious.

11
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:13,983
You're also shallow and amoral.
I like that in a man.

12
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:17,776
Kroehner needs new funeral homes.
We got a serious cash-flow problem.

13
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,456
We need new real estate that we can
unload at a profit.

14
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:23,341
Because we're not exactly liquid
at the moment. Understand?

15
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,346
- I do.
- I need at least three new homes...

16
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,426
...in L.A. Before the end of the year.

17
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,142
- Three?
- That's right, three.

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,659
And I'm making you responsible
for finding them.

19
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,261
Now, I would only do that
if I thought that you were up to it.

20
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,900
- Any questions?
- No, ma'am.

21
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:39,545
Fuck you with the "ma'am" shit!

22
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:43,381
Call me that again, I'll have your balls
on a plate, your spleen on a stick...

23
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:46,187
...and your heart wrapped and FedEx'd
to your mama, all right?

24
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,953
- All right.
- All right.

25
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,148
Fuck.

26
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:57,188
Mrs. Huntley, are you all right?

27
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,387
Yeah, I'm fine.

28
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,148
I shouldn't have had escargot at lunch.
Little fuckers always give me heartburn.

29
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,027
Hey, let's quit after this hole.

30
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:13,070
I need a drink.

31
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,109
Goddamn it, I hooked it!

32
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,568
Hi.

33
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,083
David, something awful's happened.
I didn't know where else to turn.

34
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,050
Tracy, I'm sorry you're having trouble,
but I thought it was clear...

35
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:22,527
I need to arrange a funeral.

36
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,212
Yes, my Aunt Lilian.

37
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,803
She was only the most important
person in my whole life.

38
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,370
What? You thought I was here
for some other reason?

39
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:35,854
Oh, David, please.
You need to get over yourself.

40
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,815
All right, this won't be hard.
I'm massively organized.

41
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,371
I'm a professional party planner.
Did you know that?

42
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:44,933
I did this huge party for New Line
for the Golden Globes last year.

43
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:49,609
The Hollywood Reporter
called it "resplendent. " And it was.

44
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:53,647
Aunt Lilian's funeral needs
to be equally resplendent.

45
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:57,534
I need these programs by tomorrow
afternoon at the latest, George.

46
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:02,177
You've been such a good supplier to me.
I'd hate to see that relationship end.

47
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,620
Oh, great. Thank you.
Okay, bye, now.

48
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,857
All right, that takes care of that.

49
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,781
Now I have to go to Harry Winston's,
see if they'll loan me...

50
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,132
...something fabulous
for Aunt Lilian's viewing.

51
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,413
- I just need you to sign...
- I'm serious, David.

52
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:20,539
Don't worry about the cost.
She practically raised me. I owe her.

53
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:22,097
Besides...

54
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,454
...she was loaded.

55
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:26,225
And also I intend to sue
the pants off that country club.

56
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,940
- I still need a signature...
- I've had it out for them...

57
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:31,740
...ever since my debut,
when one of the Chinese busboys...

58
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:36,338
...made a really inappropriate comment
about the neckline of my dress.

59
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,386
I'll be faxing you.

60
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,220
Jesus Christ, Nate,
what took you so long?

61
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:51,264
I told you, I was taking
the Funeral Directors' Licensing Exam.

62
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,264
I had to finish or wait
until next March to take it again.

63
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,382
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

64
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,744
It's just...

65
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,551
I have to go see Billy in the hospital.

66
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:05,664
I have to, Nate.

67
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,832
- All right.
- He needs me. I can feel it.

68
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:16,228
- Will you come with me, please?
- Of course.

69
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,668
Thank you.

70
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:23,469
- So, what're you up to this weekend?
- I don't know.

71
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,589
Probably come up with some
creative way to avoid my family.

72
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:30,188
- Why?
- I'm having this big party on Saturday.

73
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:31,831
Yeah?

74
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,509
Yeah, my dad and my stepmom
are renewing their vows in Hawaii.

75
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,154
- You're not going?
- No way.

76
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,478
They do this, like, every six months.
It's so not a big deal.

77
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,833
And guess who has the keys
to her dad's total party house in Bel Air.

78
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,954
I'm beginning to see how this
Little Miss Perfect act pays off.

79
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,472
Yeah, why do you think I do it?

80
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,437
So, what's up with you and Mr. OD?

81
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,716
Shut up.

82
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:03,601
No, I was just wondering
if he's, like, you know...

83
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,397
...over it.

84
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,881
Yeah, he is.

85
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,316
He's incredibly strong.

86
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:14,722
He's much stronger than he thinks.

87
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:19,278
Well, that's a good thing, right?

88
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,759
I guess.

89
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:25,166
Bring him to the party if you want.

90
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,166
Okay, I will.

91
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,808
I'm sure he hates me.

92
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,327
The one person he thought he could
count on, and I had him committed.

93
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,648
Well, it was for his own good.

94
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:43,086
He always felt the entire world
was against him.

95
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,011
It's all because
of my fucking mother.

96
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,569
She had children as, like,
fashion accessories.

97
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:52,052
You had no choice. He could've
harmed himself. He did harm himself.

98
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,763
I'm so afraid of what
he's gonna say to me.

99
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,615
Brenda, you cannot let
him hurt you anymore.

100
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,248
For your good and for his.

101
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:05,688
What if he thinks I hurt him?

102
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:09,767
- What if he's right?
- You saved him.

103
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,415
I'll go by Bristol Farms and pick up some
of those dried Porcini mushrooms.

104
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,694
You wanna take me out to dinner?

105
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,860
No, there's nothing wrong
with that, it's just...

106
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:32,339
Hiram, do you realize that you've
never taken me out before?

107
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:36,821
I suppose because of Nathaniel we just
always got in the habit of staying in.

108
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,901
I have to run.

109
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,415
Can you pick me up at...?
Is 8 too late?

110
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,139
No, at the house. Bye, now.

111
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,495
- I need you to stay and work tonight.
- What?

112
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,663
It's very busy right now.

113
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,983
We have three unfilled orders,
that's nothing.

114
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,179
And Robbie's coming in
at 6 tomorrow morning.

115
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:02,426
It's coming up on Father's Day,
very busy time.

116
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:05,939
No one sends flowers for Father's Day,
which is the day after tomorrow.

117
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,220
You think we'll get
a rush of orders tonight?

118
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,341
Yes, you have to stay.

119
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,902
Change your plans.

120
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,189
No.

121
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:20,665
This is my business!
I am boss here.

122
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:24,548
I'm not debating that. But your authority
does not extend to my personal life.

123
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:28,030
I don't care about
your ridiculous personal life.

124
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,903
Going to sleep someplace
outside in a tent, like refugee.

125
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:35,152
Yes, you do. You don't like me seeing
Hiram because you're jealous!

126
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,507
It's no longer flattering.
It's just irritating. I have chosen Hiram!

127
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:42,153
I'm sorry if I somehow made you
feel that's not the case, because it is!

128
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,389
I wish you'd stop behaving
like a spoiled child!

129
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,475
I've dealt with enough children
in my life.

130
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:52,116
I'm finally at the point where they get
along without me, and I won't go back!

131
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,355
You are fired!

132
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,399
- You can't do that.
- I just do do that!

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,196
Now you can go. Get out of here,
you're fired. Go on, get out!

134
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,113
It's a piece of cake.

135
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:15,398
Just the one bump on her head
and a pretty big bruise.

136
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,317
But most of it's covered by her hair,
which, lucky for us...

137
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,958
...is remarkably thick
for a woman her age.

138
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:23,803
What?!

139
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,235
Tracy wants to change the casket,
the flowers...

140
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:30,041
...the music and the times
of the viewing. And the ceremony.

141
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,523
How am I supposed to put together
a resplendent funeral in two days...

142
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:36,606
...when she can't make up
her fucking mind?

143
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:41,006
By telling her that once she signs
a contract she can't pull any of this shit.

144
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:45,720
- That's what I'd do. If I was a partner.
- Which you're not, so let me handle this.

145
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,640
I need you to do everything you can to
make her look the best she possibly can.

146
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,325
- I always do that, David.
- Of course you do, Federico.

147
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:57,730
It's just that it's a very important funeral,
and we stand to make a lot of money.

148
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:01,687
- Which I won't see any of.
- We just gave you a raise.

149
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:25,806
Do you want me to come with you?

150
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:29,374
No, I don't want him
to know that you're here.

151
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,051
I'll be right out here
if you need me.

152
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,819
Okay.

153
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:00,262
Billy?

154
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:04,423
Hi.

155
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:06,619
Hi.

156
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,897
How're you doing?

157
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,259
- Fine.
- Yeah?

158
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,059
Yeah.

159
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:19,224
Whatever I was feeling before
I'm not feeling now.

160
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,624
I'm so sorry, Billy.

161
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,706
It's so weird.

162
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,308
I love you more than anything...

163
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,983
...and I could've seriously hurt you.

164
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,630
It all made sense at the time.

165
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,226
- You know...
- I hate this.

166
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:53,946
I hate that my blood
makes me crazy.

167
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:57,154
I hate that I can't function
without being chemically altered.

168
00:12:57,356 --> 00:13:00,746
- I hate that I fucked up your life.
- You haven't.

169
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:05,351
- I did that on my own.
- No, you deserve to be happy.

170
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,156
I don't.

171
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,754
I must have some weird-ass karma.

172
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,877
- We both do.
- No, it's just me.

173
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,713
The fact that I could've
hurt you like that...

174
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,753
...upsets me like nothing ever has.

175
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,919
And when I look at you...

176
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,557
...all I want to say is I'm sorry.

177
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:37,720
Please forgive me.

178
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:45,801
And inside I feel like tears
are streaming down my cheeks.

179
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,084
But they're not, are they?

180
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,959
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

181
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,363
Just because I can't.

182
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,446
You be happy.

183
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:07,206
I want you to be happy.
I'll be happy if you are.

184
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,241
Okay.

185
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:17,209
I'm so lost...

186
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,083
...inside.

187
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:24,327
I wish that I could get out.

188
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:29,606
- But I don't think I ever will.
- You'll be all right.

189
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:40,413
- You'll be okay.
- It's all right.

190
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,975
It's okay.

191
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:48,614
You're so beautiful.

192
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,128
How come there's no home movies
of me when I was a kid?

193
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,093
I'm not sure.

194
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:06,850
After I bought that new super-8 camera,
we filmed everything the boys did.

195
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:10,653
After you came along, I guess
we sort of felt like, you know...

196
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,331
...been there, done that.

197
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:18,015
Yeah, I know. Which made me feel,
like, totally secondary, thank you.

198
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,421
Cheer up, kitten.

199
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:24,176
Maybe some of that attention
you never got will motivate you...

200
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:28,698
...to get off your lazy ass and do
something interesting with your life.

201
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:39,498
I got fired today.

202
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,586
- That sucks.
- Yes, it does.

203
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,947
If you wanna know the truth,
I was a victim of sexual harassment.

204
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,744
- What?
- Nikolai wanted me to work late...

205
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,023
...to keep me from dinner with Hiram.
When I refused, he fired me.

206
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,503
- Oh, my God. What a dork!
- I know. Can you believe it?

207
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,270
I have a good mind
to call a lawyer.

208
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,747
Well, it sounds like you're
better off out of there.

209
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:02,672
I have a certificate in floral arranging.
I can get a job anywhere.

210
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:05,672
- Screw Nikolai.
- Exactly.

211
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:15,513
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

212
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:20,226
- Sure, I've thought about it, but...
- We've been together almost a year.

213
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:25,114
And you practically live at my house.
You've seen me at my worst.

214
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,027
- What other information do you need?
- We've been together six months, Bren.

215
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,349
I didn't realize you
were counting the days.

216
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,550
- I'm not...
- What, you mark them off at night?

217
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,230
Like a prisoner in his cell,
like the Count of fucking Monte Cristo?

218
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,476
Since when are you so hot on marriage?

219
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:44,716
Well, I need to know where this is going.
I need to know if I'm wasting my time.

220
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,312
- What if I wanna have children?
- Well, you said you didn't.

221
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:52,641
Well, do you?
I mean, you're what, 35?

222
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:55,199
What's the longest relationship
you've ever been in?

223
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,156
- This one.
- Yeah, well, that's pathetic.

224
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,357
You haven't had a serious
relationship since fucking high school.

225
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,915
At least I've had a serious relationship.
At least I know what one is.

226
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,084
You know how many guys would've left
after all the psycho shit...

227
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:09,960
...you've put me through?
- Now we're getting to the point.

228
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,237
This is what's really going on,
you wanna bail.

229
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,358
No, you want me to bail!

230
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:15,887
Look out!

231
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,721
Hey, Augusto's christening
is Sunday afternoon.

232
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,401
We're thinking about
having a party afterwards.

233
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,331
For my folks and Vanessa's and...

234
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,892
Well, our place is a little small.

235
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,051
You think we could have it here?

236
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:52,609
Right now, Lilian Montrose's viewing
is scheduled for 3 to 6, so...

237
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,928
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I was thinking after that.

238
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:59,806
I'm only asking because I...

239
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:04,015
I still think of your family
as my family.

240
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,217
And...

241
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,654
I really want you all to be there.

242
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,618
Sure.

243
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,050
We'd be happy to let
you have the party here.

244
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,016
Thanks, boss.

245
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,657
Could you load me a hypodermic
with some phenol solution for this bump?

246
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,659
Wouldn't you rather
start with a compress?

247
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:28,775
Why? An injection will get rid of the
swelling and take care of the bruising.

248
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:33,499
- You're getting better at this, Dave.
- Thank you, Federico.

249
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:38,137
Oh, great, now what? Tracy's decided
to have Aunt Lilian cremated...

250
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,779
...and her ashes placed
in a Faberg'e egg?

251
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,453
Can we do it by 7 tonight?

252
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,295
- I think you should look at this.
- Well, what is it?

253
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:51,382
Oh, good grief.

254
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:59,467
Adult female, unrestrained driver,
unconscious upon arrival.

255
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,785
Now responsive only
to painful stimuli.

256
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,869
Blood pressure, 86/40. Pulse, 130.
Respiration, 36 and shallow.

257
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,220
- Brenda?
- She has a large scalp emulsion.

258
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,747
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Trachea's midline, neck veins are flat.

259
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,627
- Lactated ringers.
- What happened? What happened?

260
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,703
Patient two, adult male...

261
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:21,747
Sir, you've been in an accident.
Just stay calm, okay? Everything's fine.

262
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,424
Adult male, he's alert now
but confused, no memory of accident.

263
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:29,425
- Why is her head in that thing?
- She had an injury. She's gonna be okay.

264
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,745
- Is she dead?
- She's fine. She's gonna be fine.

265
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:43,546
- How's your sea bass?
- Delicious, thank you.

266
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:49,151
Ruth, I need to tell you
something, and...

267
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,310
- I'm not proud of this.
- What is it?

268
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,910
I've met someone.

269
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:04,113
I never meant for this to happen.
I wasn't looking.

270
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:07,951
Yes, well, that's always
when it does happen.

271
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:12,592
Well, I'm not sure quite how to...
Oh, boy.

272
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:16,922
- I'm not quite sure how to say this.
- For heaven's sake, spit it out.

273
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,839
I'd like to pursue it.

274
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:25,085
Things between you and I have felt...
Well, not exactly...

275
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,605
And I feel a bond
with this new person that...

276
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:33,882
Well, the beginnings of a bond,
that could be something quite profound.

277
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,726
All right.

278
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,763
I thought you'd be more upset.

279
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,200
I would've thought the same thing.

280
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,130
Hiram, please. Go, explore.

281
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:52,839
You owe it to yourself
and whoever she is.

282
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:56,880
Maybe the two of you could have
something, as you say, profound.

283
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,482
Lord knows we don't.

284
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,765
Well, if it was, this would be a lot more
difficult, wouldn't it?

285
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,612
Oh, it is difficult...

286
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:06,612
...for me.

287
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:12,683
Let's order dessert.
That'll cheer you up.

288
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,131
Hey, you.

289
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,536
Doctor says you're gonna be okay.

290
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,613
Well, I like hearing that.

291
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,018
- What about you?
- I'm okay.

292
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,889
Banged up, but apparently
nothing broken.

293
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:44,020
I'm sorry I almost killed you.

294
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:50,534
Goddamn it. This is gonna send my
car insurance premiums through the roof.

295
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,941
When you were unconscious,
I prayed.

296
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,461
You know how long
it's been since I prayed?

297
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,463
And I've never prayed like this.

298
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:08,745
So because of me,
you've become...

299
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:11,017
...born again.

300
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:13,105
I'm so sorry.

301
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:17,741
You are one incredibly difficult
and sometimes infuriating woman.

302
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:22,018
And I cannot imagine
my life without you.

303
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,464
Promise me you'll be a better driver.

304
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,184
Promise me you'll take care of yourself
and you'll live as long as you can.

305
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:33,623
Because I don't know
what I'd do if I lost you.

306
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:37,503
So if you wanna get married,
I'm all for it.

307
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:40,546
Okay, maybe I was overreacting.

308
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:47,505
Let's just take one step
at a time, shall we?

309
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,313
Okay.

310
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:01,435
- Oh, my God. What a bad dream.
- Yeah.

311
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,472
Father Jack doesn't deny he performed
a commitment ceremony for two lesbians.

312
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,271
Privately, not in the church.

313
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,598
The Lambeth Conference resolution
on sexuality expressly condemns...

314
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,598
...the blessing of same-sex unions...

315
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:22,237
...and councils against ordination
of those involved.

316
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,478
Whether or not we agree
with this resolution...

317
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:30,599
Do we really want our children learning
from a man that ignores God's laws?

318
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:33,841
I think we should ask Jack to leave.

319
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:37,873
And so do James and Owen,
and I'm guessing David feels the same.

320
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,277
Actually, I don't.

321
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:50,045
The church rejects homosexual practice
as incompatible with Scripture.

322
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,285
So because of their random genetics,
gay people should be denied...

323
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:56,844
...any romantic or sexual love?
- That is liberal claptrap.

324
00:23:57,048 --> 00:24:00,007
It's not genetics.
It can be overcome.

325
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,565
Walter, the only way you could
know that for sure...

326
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:08,084
...is if it's something that you overcame.
- And the only way you couldn't know...

327
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:12,763
...is if it's something you're not strong
enough to overcome.

328
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,648
Are you gay, David?

329
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,845
Yes.

330
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,369
Then his vote cannot be counted here.

331
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:27,453
That's ridiculous.
He's a deacon. He gets a vote.

332
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,771
David does not obey
the laws of the church.

333
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:33,366
Without his vote, it's an even split.
How do you plan to resolve the matter?

334
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,567
I think we should
get the bishop involved.

335
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,290
You sure you wanna do that?

336
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:39,209
Okay, we talked about the flowers.

337
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,569
I gave you the CD I burned
with music for the viewing.

338
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:44,416
I wish David were here.

339
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:49,534
I'd much prefer to go over things with
him than with some underling, but...

340
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,416
Oh, no. No.

341
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,213
No. This won't do.

342
00:24:58,421 --> 00:24:59,854
What?

343
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:02,451
Well, this right here,
there's a nick in the wood.

344
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:05,415
Oh, no, that's part of the grain.

345
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,295
I don't think so.

346
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:10,654
All right, well, we'll just have to return it
and then get a new one.

347
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,616
That's not possible.

348
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:15,942
I'm sorry?

349
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:19,855
There's nothing wrong with this casket.
Even if there was, it's too late...

350
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:23,342
...to get another like it by tomorrow.
- I don't care how much it costs.

351
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,504
This isn't about cost. There's not
another one of these available.

352
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:29,346
We had to ship this one down
from San Francisco as it was.

353
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:32,586
I'm very unhappy about this.

354
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:39,107
If you want to call it off,
I can bring your aunt's body up...

355
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,186
...and you can take it
somewhere else.

356
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:42,948
Okay?

357
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,509
Hello?

358
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:52,792
Hiram, there's nothing to talk about.

359
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,189
No, I'm not angry.

360
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:58,226
Oh, Mom, I'll probably be spending
tonight at a friend's house.

361
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,912
What friend?

362
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:02,184
- Parker McKenna.
- I don't know any Parker.

363
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,227
- Well, you haven't met her yet.
- Oh, good grief!

364
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:07,744
Hiram, you're the one
who wanted to break up.

365
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:12,112
I'm sorry if you're having
second thoughts, because I'm not.

366
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:15,546
Men can be so stupid.

367
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:17,871
Yeah.

368
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,875
I'd like for you to have
Parker's mother call me, okay?

369
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:24,629
Okay.

370
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,562
Oh, Nate, glad you're here.

371
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,077
Need to talk to you later.

372
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:49,511
- About what?
- In private.

373
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:52,921
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

374
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:55,354
Oh, God.

375
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,757
I was having the most
incredible dream.

376
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,756
I was swimming with dolphins.

377
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:06,925
Only we weren't swimming,
we were flying.

378
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,805
Oh, and Drew Barrymore was there.

379
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,158
Whatever you are on,
I would like some of it.

380
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,165
She was like my best friend.

381
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,883
- How's your headache today?
- It's better.

382
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:21,125
Oh, my God, and there
was this shark following us...

383
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,560
...and I think it was Courtney Love.

384
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,320
- How'd she look?
- She was in Versace.

385
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,365
Are we supposed to believe
that the same God who made us...

386
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:35,848
...wants us to be lonely and frustrated
while the rest of the world's...

387
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:39,250
...free to make love and have families?
- No, God isn't that cruel.

388
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:43,447
- Good for you for marrying two lesbians.
- My high school girlfriend.

389
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,371
Who do you think sent that fax?

390
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:48,486
Walter swears it wasn't him.

391
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,415
I am so fucking tired
of being ashamed.

392
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:05,408
We'll just fight back, you and me.
We'll fight them. Walter's just a bully.

393
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:09,532
- We'll just bully him back.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

394
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,890
I've agreed to not officiate
at any other gay weddings.

395
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,134
And you get to stay.

396
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:23,778
- How do you feel about that?
- Relieved.

397
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,617
I've put in almost six years
here at St. Bart's.

398
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,701
And I'd really prefer not to have
to start over somewhere new.

399
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,576
Not at this point in my life.

400
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:36,215
And I have a favor to ask of you.

401
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,936
I need you to resign as deacon.

402
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,025
Otherwise, Walter will keep making
noise until he gets his way...

403
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,741
...and I'd really prefer
not to get the bishop involved.

404
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:52,304
- Jack, you can't give in to them.
- I know which battles can be won, David.

405
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:54,100
This is not one of them.

406
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:59,627
I guess I just thought
that you were...

407
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,742
I don't know, braver than that.

408
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,349
I'm tired.

409
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:11,666
I'm tired of trying to make it better here
and never succeeding because of politics.

410
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,668
I just don't have it in me right now.

411
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,465
But how can you...?

412
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:19,145
You're gay.

413
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:21,985
No, I'm not.

414
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,513
I'm not.

415
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:27,354
People have always assumed that.

416
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,273
But I'm not.

417
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,634
Sorry.

418
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,915
More Scotch?

419
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,756
No, thanks.

420
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,158
I...

421
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,114
- I really don't wanna be here.
- Oh, get over yourself.

422
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,712
I know you and Parker had sex, so what?
You're not the first guy I slept with.

423
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,674
Right, but am I the last?

424
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,440
Maybe.

425
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:06,591
If he's gonna get me
in here, I'll use it, but...

426
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:09,522
Oh, my God.

427
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:12,598
What the fuck do these people do?

428
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:16,878
Her father's, like, some movie bigwig.
I think.

429
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,519
Invitation only.

430
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:25,685
- Okay, this is tragic.
- We can always leave.

431
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:29,118
Let's just find the bar.
Excuse me?

432
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:32,043
Excuse me, do you know
where the bar is?

433
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,597
- Over there.
- Right.

434
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,080
- Where's Parker?
- It's not her house.

435
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:42,839
This is a porn party. I'm telling you,
they're shooting a porno here.

436
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,201
What the fuck is that?

437
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:53,481
- Faggot.
- Hey, shut up. My brother's a faggot.

438
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:56,366
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

439
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,083
Let's just say hi and leave, okay?

440
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:04,844
Oh, no, this could be kind of fun.

441
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:06,534
Come on.

442
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:08,891
- Hey, Parker.
- Hey.

443
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,052
This is a really nice house
you've got here.

444
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:14,168
I know. So, like, of course
I don't get to live here.

445
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,572
I just get to trash it
when they're gone.

446
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:19,691
This is Warren. This is Claire.

447
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,650
- Nice to meet you.
- And...

448
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:23,211
Gabriel.

449
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,171
This is what concerns me, this area
of decreased attenuation. It's very faint.

450
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,171
Doesn't look like there's an acute injury,
but something's not right.

451
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:40,452
Well, she's gonna be all right,
isn't she?

452
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:44,216
These are your CAT scan results,
Nate.

453
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,341
- Mine?
- Don't worry about Brenda.

454
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,534
Hers was totally clean.

455
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:54,455
So, what do you think it is?

456
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,225
I'd like to give you a shot
of contrast dye...

457
00:31:57,425 --> 00:32:00,543
...and do another CAT scan
to really know.

458
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:06,859
Oh, hello, Mrs. Fisher?

459
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:10,856
This is Elise McKenna, Parker's
stepmother. Claire asked me to call you.

460
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:14,105
Yes, I just wanted to be sure
there's proper adult supervision...

461
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,460
...if she's staying there.
- Oh, absolutely. Yes, of course.

462
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,988
Don't worry for a minute.

463
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,339
All right, then,

464
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,699
I don't want her drinking.

465
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,707
There isn't even any liquor
in the house,

466
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,027
You see, my husband
and I are both alcoholics.

467
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:30,145
And Parker's fresh out of rehab.
So we'll take really good care of Claire.

468
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:32,781
I promise, Kisses,

469
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:40,745
- That was mean.
- What?

470
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:43,866
A Hollywood ass-waxing party.

471
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:47,954
- Everybody's wearing leather or rubber.
- Seriously, bro, seriously.

472
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:51,626
- Rip those fucking nipple-rings out.
- No shit.

473
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:56,115
Where were you last night? I called you,
and your mom was all, "I don't know. "

474
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,394
I was hanging with my girl.

475
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:03,313
Okay, well, while you were
getting your toes sucked...

476
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:06,829
...we sucked down a free sixer
from 7-Eleven.

477
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:11,990
- Fuck, we pulled a beer cow.
- A beer cow, dude, that's the shit.

478
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,237
Hell yeah, a fucking beer cow.

479
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:17,717
Dink, shut the fuck up, dude.
What the fuck is a beer cow?

480
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:21,039
Oh, shit, it was mad.
So we go to buy some beer, right?

481
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:24,155
And we get to the counter,
but it's like, nobody has enough cash.

482
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:29,358
So Dink just starts fucking mooing
at the top of his lungs at this guy, right?

483
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:32,357
So I'm like, "Fuck it. "
So I start mooing too.

484
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:34,317
Oh, yeah, but really fucking loud.

485
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,117
Like we just might totally go nuts.

486
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:38,122
The guy was so fucking scared of us.

487
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,601
It was hilarious, man.
It was a total movie moment.

488
00:33:40,806 --> 00:33:43,479
Fuck yeah, and then we grab
all the beer and we fly.

489
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:47,123
We laughed for, like, five straight hours.
It was the shit.

490
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,558
Yeah, dude. A beer cow, right?

491
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:51,887
We gotta do that shit again, man.

492
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:54,808
I haven't had that much fun
since I was, like, 6.

493
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:58,089
- Fucking beer cow, right?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,769
Fuck.

495
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,010
Well...

496
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:10,649
...we did find something
that concerns me.

497
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:19,452
My guess would be that it's AVM.

498
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:23,124
- Arteriovenous malformation.
- What the fuck is that?

499
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:26,486
Abnormally enlarged and intertwined
blood vessels in your brain.

500
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:28,492
Have you been experiencing
any headaches?

501
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:31,245
Yeah, I get headaches.
I take Advil, they go away.

502
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:35,006
Any vertigo, nausea,
problems with your balance?

503
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:36,206
Nope.

504
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:39,615
- Any fluctuation in your field of vision?
- Like what?

505
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:42,696
Like a fluttering
in your peripheral vision?

506
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,893
- Once.
- Do the headaches seem to affect...

507
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,056
...one side of the head
more than the other?

508
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,808
The left side. Sometimes.

509
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,458
Well, I would like to schedule
an MRI for you as soon as possible.

510
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,740
What's the worst-case scenario
here?

511
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:03,854
- Nate, it's way too early for that.
- You fucking tell me.

512
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:10,773
Not all vascular malfunctions
of the brain become symptomatic.

513
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,057
Some, however, carry
a significant risk of hemorrhage.

514
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:15,618
So I could have a stroke?

515
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:18,863
You could be at a higher risk
for stroke or seizure than most.

516
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,819
We need to do more tests
to be certain.

517
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,782
Could I die from this?

518
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:30,422
It's possible. Yes.

519
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:36,061
There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
I mean, I don't smoke.

520
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,580
I haven't had any red meat since 1989.
I run three miles a day.

521
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,509
Don't blow this out of proportion.

522
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,748
There are treatments,
surgical options.

523
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:49,911
Even if it is AVM,
you could live for another 50 years.

524
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:53,509
However, I would like to run
a full cardiovascular profile on you...

525
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:56,227
...before you continue
with the running, okay?

526
00:35:57,993 --> 00:36:02,112
This happened yesterday? For heaven's
sake, why didn't you call me earlier?

527
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:04,471
Because I thought I was okay.

528
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:08,914
- Well, you are okay, aren't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

529
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:11,311
I'm a nervous wreck.

530
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,906
Are you all right, dear?

531
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:15,470
Yes, thank you.

532
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:19,307
Well, I want you both to promise me
that you'll be more careful from now on.

533
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,315
We promise.

534
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:23,991
Oh, boy.

535
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,796
This time it's personal.

536
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,191
What's wrong?

537
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:35,679
Nothing.

538
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:45,313
- So how old did you say you were?
- How old do you want me to be?

539
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:47,196
Parker?

540
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:50,476
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
- What do you want?

541
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,637
Nothing, I was just looking
for Gabe. I'm sorry.

542
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:05,280
You drop a beer,
you have to pay for it.

543
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,960
No, no, no, no.

544
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:09,157
Moo.

545
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:10,477
Moo.

546
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,959
Hey, say "moo. "

547
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,203
- Where the fuck did you get that?
- Say "moo. "

548
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:28,371
- Moo.
- Now get the money out of the register.

549
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,521
Go get the fucking car!

550
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:40,052
Moo.

551
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,053
- So do you think I should resign?
- What do you want to do?

552
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,724
I don't wanna belong to a church
that's so intolerant.

553
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,770
And I don't wanna waste my time
with a fight that can't be won.

554
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:55,774
But I don't wanna just take it either.

555
00:37:55,977 --> 00:38:00,176
I've been doing that my whole fucking
life, and I'm fucking sick to death of it.

556
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:05,055
And to top it all off, I'm scheduled to do
a devotional reading in Mass tomorrow.

557
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:08,058
- You gonna do it?
- Of course.

558
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,377
They're not gonna intimidate me
into just disappearing.

559
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:16,416
Oh, I came out to my mother.

560
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:19,455
- You're kidding.
- It was really uncomfortable.

561
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:23,372
- How's she taking it?
- Hard to tell. She's as weird as always.

562
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,734
Thanks for meeting me here today.
I just had to talk about it to somebody.

563
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:34,175
And I could always talk to you.

564
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:39,224
Well, I'm glad that we've managed
to remain friends.

565
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:44,381
Listen, I gotta run.
I'm meeting Eddie later.

566
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:49,106
Hey, he said he saw you
at the candlelight vigil for Marc Foster.

567
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:53,777
Yeah, yeah, I was driving by
on my way home.

568
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,821
Okay. Well, thanks again.

569
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,189
Yeah, well, let me know
how it all turns out.

570
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:05,944
I will.

571
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,628
- Take care, David.
- You too.

572
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,943
Tell Eddie I said hi.

573
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:41,075
Don't you wanna do what those
really cool kids in there are doing?

574
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,837
No.

575
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,395
Where's your boyfriend?

576
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,797
I don't know.

577
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,716
I like him.

578
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:55,754
- You do?
- Yeah, something about him.

579
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,112
Can't quite put my finger on it.

580
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:17,436
- Hey.
- Hey. Where'd you go?

581
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,720
We just went to get
some more beer.

582
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,960
- Why, did you miss me?
- Not that much, ego man.

583
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,010
Hi.

584
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:50,165
Can I help you?

585
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:52,443
I'd like to speak to David,
if at all possible.

586
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,484
Well, he's not here right now.

587
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,448
- Well, where is he?
- I'm not sure. Perhaps I can help you.

588
00:40:58,654 --> 00:41:00,929
Perhaps you can.
That remains to be seen.

589
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:03,330
My aunt's viewing is tomorrow.

590
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:06,733
And I'm not at all satisfied
with the state of her casket.

591
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:09,814
I spoke to one of your other employees
about it earlier today...

592
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:13,214
...and he didn't seem to be the slightest
bit concerned. I'll show you.

593
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,975
I'll show you.

594
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:21,775
See? Right here. It's been nicked.

595
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:25,131
How about we take 100 bucks off?

596
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:28,613
- I want a new casket.
- Well, I'm not sure that's an option.

597
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,894
Why does nobody around here
seem to care about doing things right?

598
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:37,575
If I'm not mistaken, you haven't
even signed a contract, right?

599
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:40,455
- That's not the point.
- So you could turn around in the end...

600
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:44,133
...say, "I never agreed," and not pay?
- Of course not, that's ridiculous.

601
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:46,175
Yeah, that is ridiculous.

602
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,699
So I'm gonna go get
that contract right now...

603
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:52,375
...and until you sign it, you don't
get to complain about anything else.

604
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,703
I resent your implication.

605
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:58,694
You ought to be thanking your fucking
stars that you're alive and healthy.

606
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:03,822
And that you don't work like a dog
just to starve or get shot in the street.

607
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,824
I'll be right back
with that contract.

608
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:24,707
I thought this is what you wanted.

609
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:27,028
It's too little too late.

610
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:33,302
What, are you trying
to get your wings?

611
00:42:35,193 --> 00:42:38,948
- Where's your boyfriend? I do like him.
- Yeah, you said that already.

612
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:42,465
He'll be headed over to my neck
of the woods pretty soon.

613
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:52,306
Right here. Look at this.

614
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:55,429
- Yeah.
- I like it.

615
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:23,084
Why you are here? You're fired.

616
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:25,571
Dear Lord, have you been here
all night?

617
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,976
Go drive in the woods
with your man...

618
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:32,567
...who burns chicken
in the funny little toy car.

619
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:36,934
I came here to get my things
before I go to church.

620
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,771
I thought this would be a safe time
not to run into you.

621
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:46,128
- Is he rich?
- What? No.

622
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,181
So he is a good lover, yeah?

623
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:53,417
That's none of your business.

624
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:59,101
Because you are the kind of woman
who needs a good lover.

625
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:01,414
Oh, and why is that?

626
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:06,223
Because you're so scared of feeling.

627
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:13,578
You are scared of your own heart.

628
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,940
You should have a man
who can touch you there.

629
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:20,217
Who sees your beauty.

630
00:45:22,707 --> 00:45:24,379
I hoping...

631
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:27,827
...he is this man for you.

632
00:45:55,914 --> 00:45:59,304
In your steadfast faith and love,
that through your grace...

633
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:02,109
...we may proclaim your truth
with boldness...

634
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:04,989
...and minister your justice
with compassion.

635
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:09,474
For the sake of our savior, Jesus Christ,
who lives and reigns with you...

636
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:13,829
...and the Holy Spirit, one God,
now and forever.

637
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,357
Amen.

638
00:46:15,558 --> 00:46:16,991
Amen.

639
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:45,242
"In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.

640
00:46:45,444 --> 00:46:47,719
Let me never be ashamed.

641
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,764
Deliver me in thy righteousness. "

642
00:46:58,366 --> 00:47:00,927
"Let me never be ashamed. "

643
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:06,725
There's a concept.

644
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,809
I've been ashamed my entire life.

645
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,769
I grew up thinking I was unworthy in the
eyes of God instead of trusting God...

646
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,840
...not to be an ignorant,
frightened bigot.

647
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:32,087
Because of this,
I've made myself crazy.

648
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:35,127
I've put myself in danger,
I've made a lot of mistakes.

649
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:37,052
Big mistakes.

650
00:47:38,694 --> 00:47:41,084
Which all could've been avoided
if I'd just had faith.

651
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:45,369
Faith that maybe God really is love,
like we say.

652
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:53,169
How am I supposed to spread
God's love throughout the world...

653
00:47:53,377 --> 00:47:55,653
...when I deny it to myself?

654
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,610
God be with you all.

655
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:44,706
- Really nice job.
- Thanks.

656
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:47,741
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

657
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:52,381
- Oh, David, wonderful. Good to see you.
- Thanks.

658
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:05,509
Thank you.

659
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:07,191
David!

660
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:10,262
I am so proud of you.

661
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:12,864
That was great, David.

662
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:16,510
- I didn't even know you were here.
- I had to see what you were gonna do.

663
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,315
We're gonna get something
to eat, why don't you come?

664
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:23,269
Yeah, Fred 62 in Los Feliz.
Maybe a movie afterwards.

665
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,872
No, I can't. I've gotta work.

666
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:29,668
Okay, well, congratulations.
You spoke the truth.

667
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:31,066
Thank you.

668
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,750
Take care.

669
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:39,389
Okay, well...

670
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,317
...don't be a stranger.

671
00:49:58,603 --> 00:50:01,071
We go for big breakfast now, yeah?

672
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:03,274
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

673
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:05,281
But it's Sunday.

674
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:07,674
I can't believe I missed church.

675
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:10,638
My son was giving a reading
during the service.

676
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:15,363
- You are happy, no?
- Yes, I'm very happy.

677
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:24,486
- I'm never gonna marry you.
- What?

678
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:29,686
I will be your friend and your lover,
but I will never be your wife.

679
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:33,849
I spent the first half of my life doing that,
I don't need to do it again.

680
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,968
- Maybe I can convince you.
- Nope.

681
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,725
Not going to happen.

682
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,335
Nate.

683
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:06,851
Mom told me about the accident.
Are you all right?

684
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:09,657
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

685
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:14,014
Thanks for making Tracy
sign that contract.

686
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:17,369
I don't know if you've noticed this,
but she's kind of crazy.

687
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:19,735
Yeah, I got a whiff of that.

688
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,738
And thanks for staying in L.A.
And helping me run the business.

689
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:31,769
Things have been a lot more fun
around here since you've been home.

690
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,291
Why, thank you, Dave.

691
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:47,376
Look, I'm gonna be late for
Augusto's christening. I gotta run.

692
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:52,215
Oh, that crazy-ass niece
is upstairs crying and won't come down.

693
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:58,945
Oh, no, I think this one is yours.

694
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:01,335
Okay.

695
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:04,460
But I'm warning you,
I might just fucking punch her.

696
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,591
Tracy?

697
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:53,993
My Aunt Lilian was the only person
who ever really loved me.

698
00:52:56,598 --> 00:52:58,510
My parents didn't.

699
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,438
My husband certainly didn't.

700
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,310
And now she's dead.

701
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:10,560
Her husband died,
then her daughter died too...

702
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:14,357
...in this car crash
on her 17th birthday.

703
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:18,556
But Aunt Lilian just went on.

704
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:24,274
She raised Welsh corgis
and she took up watercolors...

705
00:53:24,484 --> 00:53:29,354
...and she loved me.
And now she's dead.

706
00:53:34,606 --> 00:53:39,761
I've never felt this alone
in the world.

707
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:42,804
And I'm used to feeling alone.

708
00:53:43,008 --> 00:53:46,318
I know what that's like. And...

709
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:49,523
...now I find out that there's this...

710
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:51,720
...whole new level.

711
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:01,885
Why do people have to die?

712
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:14,009
To make life important.

713
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:18,254
None of us know
how long we've got.

714
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:21,248
Which is why we have
to make each day matter.

715
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:26,170
And it sounds like
your Aunt Lilian did exactly that.

716
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:31,286
- Yeah, she did.
- Then you can be happy for her.

717
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:33,494
For a life well-lived.

718
00:54:36,538 --> 00:54:38,928
That's the most any of us
can hope for.

719
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,974
I go to funerals sometimes.

720
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:52,700
Funerals of people
I don't even know.

721
00:54:54,062 --> 00:54:58,261
Harold and Maude is, like,
my favorite movie of all time.

722
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:03,458
I saw it when I was in junior high
and it profoundly affected my life.

723
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:05,577
It's a great movie.

724
00:55:09,985 --> 00:55:11,977
You're very kind.

725
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,897
Are you married?

726
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,505
Sort of.

727
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:31,782
Come on in.

728
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:36,463
Julio! Get over here, man!

729
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:39,311
Baby, does that dead lady
have to be in here?

730
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,980
No. No, I'll take her
downstairs right now.

731
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:43,511
Get over here.

732
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:11,748
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

733
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:06,163
What's up with you?

734
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:09,042
I'm just thinking about
how lucky I am.

735
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,485
I love you.

736
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,522
You know that, right?

737
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:20,248
Yeah.

738
00:58:16,633 --> 00:59:10,789
