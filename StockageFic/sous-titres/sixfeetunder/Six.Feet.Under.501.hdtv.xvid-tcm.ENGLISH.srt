Saison 5 Episode 1
"A Coat of White Primer"

2
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:48,839
Have you ever told
her how you really feel?

3
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,749
Of course not.

4
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,414
Why not?

5
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,362
Because she'd
start screaming at me.

6
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,399
Or cry.

7
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:02,005
When else have you chosen
not express your feelings

8
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:05,230
So that someone wouldn't
start screaming at you,

9
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,136
Or cry?

10
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,525
You mean, like with my dad?

11
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,352
And?

12
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,183
My sister.

13
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,865
And?

14
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,599
Oh, and leonard.

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,141
So pretty much everyone.

16
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,700
Andrea, would it be so bad

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,500
If someone screamed or cried?

18
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,714
Yes.

19
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:30,482
- Horrible.
- Really?

20
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:34,839
Worse than feeling
"isolated and invisible,

21
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,505
Like an empty gaping
hole in the universe"?

22
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:45,754
Sometimes you talk about your life...

23
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:50,368
In a way that makes me feel sort of bad.

24
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:56,290
Okay, like, you make a lot of money,

25
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,029
Your house is a palace.

26
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,088
And you wear a size four...

27
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,678
When you're bloated.

28
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:06,344
So, when you get upset
because you gain a few pounds,

29
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:09,862
Or you complain about
how high your taxes are

30
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:13,960
With no comment on how much worse
those situations are for me.

31
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:16,500
makes me feel like

32
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:20,272
I'm not a real person to you.

33
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:33,700
I am... I am so sorry.

34
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,926
I guess I get wrapped
up in my own drama,

35
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,738
Or something and...

36
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,200
I am so glad you
finally said something.

37
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:47,469
I'm just asking you to
think about how what you say

38
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,500
might feel to me sometimes.

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,749
When you tell me that you
only want to hear good news...

40
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:05,024
It makes me feel like
you only, sort of...

41
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:08,125
Love me if I get engaged

42
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,500
Or promoted at work.

43
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,501
And that makes me really
not want to call you

44
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,152
when I don't have good news,

45
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:18,732
Which is, you know,
most of the time.

46
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,815
Dad?

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,256
God, that is so not true.

48
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,051
I'm just telling you how I feel.

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,486
That I never think
about your feelings?

50
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,299
I shower you with
gifts. I mean...

51
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:42,964
God, Andrea!

52
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,849
Look at this apartment! Look at all
the beautiful things I've given you!

53
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,479
That antique mirror?
The Italian Gondola ashtrays.

54
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,247
The Queen Anne
Brass andirons!

55
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,500
Honey, I don't smoke.

56
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,595
I don't have a fireplace.

57
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:58,134
And I don't like antiques.

58
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,236
You like antiques. I like
modern decor, which you know.

59
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,786
Your modern stuff just isn't as nice.

60
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,308
I like it.

61
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,091
But it doesn't matter what I like.

62
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:10,105
Fine. You know what? I'll
take it all back then.

63
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,888
Leonard!

64
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,062
It's not about the things.

65
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,130
It's not even about your reaction.

66
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,898
- It's about me being able to express...
- Give me the chair!

67
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,333
- Give me the chair! Get up!
- What are you doing?

68
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:21,900
You hate it so much, give it back!

69
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,144
I'm trying to tell you how I feel.

70
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:25,600
Lenny!

71
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,782
Andrea?

72
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:31,600
Andrea?

73
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:44,841
Oh, jesus!

74
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,058
Andrea, don't do this to me!

75
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,493
Oh, god.

76
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:53,536
Oh Jesus, now
what am I gonna do?

77
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,947
So how do you feel?

78
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:14,082
Alive, uh, glad about that.

79
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,691
Can you get this to stay on?

80
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,751
This pin is defective.
It won't prick.

81
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,100
Looks like Nate may have to
get married without a prick.

82
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:32,063
What do you think, Ma?
You got any advice?

83
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,724
Advice?

84
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,866
Oh, Claire, I don't know.

85
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,800
Don't give up.

86
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,696
Even when things get hard.

87
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,710
And they always do eventually.

88
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,900
Never stop trying.

89
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,844
Oh my god! I nearly got
killed on the way out here.

90
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,351
Some crazy old lapdog lady
almost ran me off the road

91
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:53,870
With her Lexus SUV!

92
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,522
Claire, where's David?
I need the rings.

93
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,242
I think he's over there.

94
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,532
David, we're starting!

95
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:04,198
The twins need to get
the rings on the pillows.

96
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:05,961
I just don't want
them to get lost.

97
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,961
Thanks. Come on.

98
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,142
Oh yes, you can't stand

99
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,700
Being away from mommy
for moment, can you?

100
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,987
- How do you feel?
- Like...

101
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,500
Every moment of my life
had led up to this one.

102
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:23,089
Like all of it makes sense

103
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:26,665
Like this is the destiny
that's been waiting for me.

104
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:30,449
I know it's stupid to think in
terms of "happily ever after,"

105
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,500
<i>But that's what it feels
like right now.</i>

106
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,152
<i>Okay, let's do this thing.</i>

107
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,352
"Let's do this thing"?

108
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,787
- No analyzing.
- I'm not analyzing.

109
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:53,294
I'm loving. Thanks.

110
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,367
Coffee-- I can't even smell it.

111
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,500
Sorry.

112
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,721
<i>We come together
on this beautiful day,</i>

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,561
<i>To witness and celebrate
the union of Nate and lisa.</i>

114
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,772
<i>- I vow to love and nurture you...
- I'll skip the vows.</i>

115
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:21,109
- No, you can watch the vows.
- I'll watch them later.

116
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,038
Have you learned all kinds
of interesting things?

117
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:26,936
I just wanted to
see it, you know?

118
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:30,070
So that I didn't do the same
thing in some weird way,

119
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,215
Make everyone
uncomfortable.

120
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>I was the first
one to shoot this location.</i>

121
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:41,337
<i>We used it in "pack up your
sorrows: the mimi farina story."</i>

122
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,917
<i>- Isn't it gorgeous?
- This is going to be different.</i>

123
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,766
I want it to be perfect.

124
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,922
It's already perfect, even if it rains

125
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,589
- And everybody gets soaked.
- That's why I got the tent.

126
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,082
Even if the band sucks
and the food is rancid.

127
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:56,221
That's why we're only
having hors d'oeuvres.

128
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,088
<i>I love how weddings erase the past.</i>

129
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,451
<i>Like a coat of white primer.</i>

130
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:03,620
<i>Slap a veil on her and the
biggest slutbag on the planet</i>

131
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,953
Becomes a fresh-faced ingenue.

132
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,055
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

133
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,777
Sorry. Is it the coffee?

134
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,373
You okay, Bren?

135
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,486
God damn it!

136
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,582
<i>Yeah well, that's not
what she told me.</i>

137
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,670
Who wanted tuna fish?

138
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,829
Hold the mercury!

139
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:02,824
- Well, you're an idiot!
- George?

140
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,234
If you want mercury,
i'll give you mercury.

141
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,350
Hell, our bloodstream's
already full of it.

142
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,200
It's in all the water. The rivers
are poisoned. The ocean's poisoned!

143
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,825
- George.
- No.

144
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,303
No!

145
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,695
No! No!

146
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,695
No! No!

147
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:38,362
I just don't know how
this could have happened.

148
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:42,055
I mean, they had such a
good relationship, I thought.

149
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,359
They never fought.

150
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,595
I just don't understand.

151
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,565
Some things in life...

152
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,051
We can never understand
exactly why they happened.

153
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:59,765
But it's so unfair. She was just
starting to really be herself

154
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,634
For the first time in her life.

155
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,200
That's rough...

156
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,481
When people are just starting over.

157
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,568
I know. I know.

158
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,764
<i>Your husband is suffering
from a condition</i>

159
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:16,649
<i>Called "depressive psychosis."</i>

160
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:19,134
The hallucinations,
paranoia and delusions

161
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,047
Are all characteristic.

162
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,899
We generally get good
results from a combination

163
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:27,420
of tricyclic antidepressants
and antipsychotic medications.

164
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,291
But how did this happen?

165
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:32,175
Any kind of stress can
trigger this type of condition.

166
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:35,407
A death in the family,
pressures at work,

167
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,770
Marital conflicts.

168
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,596
But he was fine when we met.

169
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,596
He was so... lovely.

170
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,915
It can come and go
throughout one's lifetime.

171
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,190
And, according to his daughter,

172
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,335
Your husband has had a long
history of mental illness.

173
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:55,654
What I'd like to do is get him
started on the meds right away.

174
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,031
And we'll keep him here for
observation for a couple of days

175
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,500
And see how he takes to it.

176
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:09,931
I liked that girl janine.

177
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,859
What do you think?

178
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,577
- About what?
- Her sister.

179
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,418
She was nice, I thought.

180
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,157
I guess she was nice.
She was in shock,

181
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,882
So it's a little hard to tell
what she'd be like on a date,

182
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,300
- If that's what you're asking.
- Jeez.

183
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,179
What'd he do, stab her in the eye?

184
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,107
That's what happens to couples
who never learn how to fight.

185
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,252
"Ricky, are you there?"

186
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:36,686
- Uh, ricky?
- Oh, shit.

187
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,454
I gotta deal with this girl.

188
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:41,512
- What girl?
- Just someone I dated a few times.

189
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,773
- Really?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,523
I signed up on match.com just to...

191
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,447
- You know, get out there a little.
- Good for you, dude.

192
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,491
- I got to break up with her now.
- On an instant message?

193
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:56,274
I don't want to lead her on.

194
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,662
What do you think?

195
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,852
"I'm looking for someone with a
more positive attitude about life."

196
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,730
That's a little harsh, dude.

197
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:08,281
She should know for her other
dates. She was a downer, man.

198
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,700
That's very thoughtful, "ricky."

199
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:37,257
Doctor: we're not getting the response
to the medications I was hoping for.

200
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:38,633
George and I have discussed it,

201
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:42,054
And we agreed our best
option is to move on to e.C.T.

202
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,662
- e.C.T.?
- what's...?

203
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,793
Electroconvulsive therapy.

204
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,996
- Shock treatments?
- It sounds much worse than it is.

205
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,517
We administer a slight
shock to the brain to

206
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,330
reboot the circuits as it were.

207
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,359
But isn't that?

208
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:57,692
It's a very effective treatment
for this type of depression.

209
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,333
Nothing else is working.

210
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,300
George?

211
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,841
- How's he doing?
- Much better.

212
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,700
They think he'll only
need a few more sessions.

213
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:41,623
Tonight? But he's still sleeping.

214
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:43,217
He should wake up
in about a half hour.

215
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,884
He may have some nausea
or mild confusion,

216
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,159
But he'll be fine to go home tonight.

217
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:49,101
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

218
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,906
Worst case scenario, he'll have some
short-term memory loss but nothing too severe.

219
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,640
I think he should be
observed one more night.

220
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:59,100
- It's not necessary.
- I am not bringing him home tonight!

221
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,596
He's not ready.

222
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,309
All right, one night more.

223
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,193
But tomorrow, he has to go home.

224
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,900
We need the bed.

225
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:20,860
Fuck, I forgot to buy wine.

226
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,800
Maybe it's rude to bring
wine to a pregnant house.

227
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,454
Maybe we should just
pick up some ice cream?

228
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,541
No, we should definitely buy wine,

229
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,584
In case they forgot that
other people still drink.

230
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:35,135
Can I wear this, or will everyone
think I'm a total indigent?

231
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,200
What about that purple
thing in the closet?

232
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,613
- That's here?
- Yeah.

233
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:42,900
Oh, good. I totally
thought that was lost.

234
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,686
Maybe you should just move in.

235
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,193
Really?

236
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,048
- You mean, like, totally?
- Wouldn't it just be easier?

237
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,946
You're in my darkroom all day long

238
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,265
- And you sleep over every night.
- Is that annoying?

239
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,744
Yeah, it's annoying, that's
why I want you to move in,

240
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,715
Because I'm a total masochist.

241
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:11,758
Yeah, but how would
we both work in here?

242
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,889
It's been fine so far.

243
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,916
Okay, 'cause I totally
took over your space.

244
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,467
I could use my studio at school

245
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:20,293
If I ever get inspired
to make anything again.

246
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,200
Oh, come on.

247
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:28,162
It would be a relief to never
have to see my mother again.

248
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,700
You're going to have
to see her tonight.

249
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,670
Would you be terribly disappointed

250
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,699
If I couldn't make
it tonight, dear?

251
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,974
<i>No. Is everything all right?</i>

252
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm just feeling a little tired.

253
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,192
Is George okay?

254
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,916
<i>- He's coming home tomorrow.
- That's great.</i>

255
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,518
Is he going to be able
to make it to the wedding?

256
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,600
Make it to the wedding?

257
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,100
Do you have any idea what
kind of state he's in?

258
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,438
<i>I'm sorry. I thought
he was better.</i>

259
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,120
He is better.

260
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,400
He's just not himself yet.

261
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,600
<i>You sure you don't want to join us?</i>

262
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,090
Yes.

263
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:10,465
I just need one last quiet night.

264
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,699
I'll be in by 9:00 tomorrow
if you need help with anything.

265
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,370
All right. Bye.

266
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:22,899
You look great!

267
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,899
Thank you. I feel like shit!

268
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,822
Hey. Welcome.

269
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,874
Non-Alcoholic sparkling cider.

270
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,999
- Thank you very much.
- So mom's not coming.

271
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,560
- Why not?
- Because she hates me.

272
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,300
- She doesn't hate you anymore.
- Now she hates Claire.

273
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,850
Why does she hate Claire?

274
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,691
Mom thinks she's flushing
her life down the toilet.

275
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:43,676
Because she's taking
the semester off.

276
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:46,200
Not because she's
dating my brother.

277
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,700
Uh, no! Just the school thing.

278
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,900
Brenda: because she's
taking off one semester?

279
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,000
I think she's terrified
that Claire won't go back,

280
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,270
And mom's biggest regret in life
is that she never went to college.

281
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:01,343
So if Claire doesn't
graduate, it's like she...

282
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,662
Failed twice or something.

283
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,600
It's time for somebody
to take a bath.

284
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,364
- I'll do it.
- You sure?

285
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:15,099
Yeah! I got to pee anyway
for the billionth time today.

286
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,162
Where does it all come from?

287
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,843
- Bye!
- Bye!

288
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:22,234
We'll go have a bath.

289
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:24,408
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

290
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,249
She knows we all think Billy's
a bomb waiting to go off.

291
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,871
What does she think?

292
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,843
She thinks he's fine when
he's on his medication

293
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:34,700
And he's been taking it for
a long time, so whatever.

294
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:37,554
I could almost deal with the guy if
he wasn't fucking my little sister.

295
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,700
<i>He's better than gabe.</i>

296
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,506
Come on, he was
a drug-crazed killer.

297
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,173
He didn't kill the
guy, he shot at him.

298
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,389
She should have stayed
with her nice gay boyfriend.

299
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,947
That guy was an asshole.

300
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:49,324
She knows how to pick them.

301
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,353
- They're here!
- Hey, Billy!

302
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,976
Come on in!

303
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,200
- How you doing, Billy?
- Good.

304
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:59,136
- Hello.
- Hey.

305
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,000
- Hey, guys!

306
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,200
- Where's mom?
- She's not coming.

307
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,099
- Do your parents still live in ohio?
- Columbus, yeah.

308
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,503
- Where did you grow up?
- L.A.

309
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,546
West adams area,
near where I work.

310
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:24,099
I don't know
L.A. that well.

311
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:27,461
- How long have you been here?
- Four years, But it's so big!

312
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:29,278
My hours are
crazy at the dentist,

313
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,220
Because people schedule
their appointments

314
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,509
Before and after regular work
hours, and on weekends too. So...

315
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:36,220
- Yeah, my business too.

316
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,843
You're never off.

317
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,800
You could always get a call.

318
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,764
That must be
convenient for dating.

319
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,300
- Uh, what?
- Like, when you want to get out of a date,

320
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,899
You can have a friend call you and
pretend to be a dead person or whatever.

321
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,720
Come on.
I wouldn't do that!

322
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,865
How's it going
with the adoption thing?

323
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:00,299
We have two interviews
left for the home study.

324
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,793
Then we just have
to wait for a referral.

325
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,000
What's a referral?

326
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,825
- A kid.
- Wow. How long will you have to wait?

327
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:13,200
- Anywhere from a week to many years.
- That's got to be hard.

328
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:17,464
Yeah. But they all say sometimes
being gay helps you get chosen faster.

329
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:19,377
In this backward country?

330
00:20:19,464 --> 00:20:22,500
The birth mothers have to
look at thousands of pictures of

331
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,611
- straight white people.
- So we kind of pop out.

332
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,307
It's so weird to imagine
going through all that--

333
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,600
Nine months and a delivery and
you don't even want the kid.

334
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,365
I mean, who would do that?

335
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,200
- Christians.
- No, not only.

336
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,499
Some women just can't deal
with making a decision,

337
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,218
And they leave it too long.

338
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,073
But they don't even
get money, right?

339
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:45,189
We'll have to pay
the hospital bills.

340
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,000
That's where they
can scam you.

341
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,898
If they change their mind,
you're left with the bill.

342
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,498
That rarely happens.

343
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:53,222
It really makes you see
the appeal of a surrogate.

344
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,200
It does?

345
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,150
Yeah.

346
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:59,729
That and wanting to have your own kid.

347
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,570
Yeah, but there are so many kids
who already exist who need homes,

348
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,483
Why would we want
to make another one?

349
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,729
For the same reason
straight people do.

350
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,900
But given that it's not
quite as easy for us,

351
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:13,564
Why would we do
something so extreme?

352
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:17,159
Why should we be the ones who
don't get to have our own kids,

353
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,300
Just because we're gay?

354
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:22,300
It's not because we're gay.

355
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,200
I just don't think a
child has to have my genes

356
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,400
For me to feel like it's mine.

357
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:33,634
I'm sure people love adopted
kids as much as their own.

358
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,065
I mean, obviously.

359
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,200
Maybe. It's easy to say
when you have your own.

360
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,344
I love Maya.

361
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
And you still wanted
one of your own.

362
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,300
You just think you don't deserve
to have what everyone else has.

363
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:02,075
Would anybody have more wine
if I open another bottle?

364
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Yes.

365
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,162
<i>You think you're the only one
with dreams that don't work out?</i>

366
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:10,165
<i>We both got what we settled for.</i>

367
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:12,900
<i>I think you just don't love
me anymore.</i>

368
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:15,900
<i>- I do love you.
- Hello!</i>

369
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,765
<i>You're home early.</i>

370
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, well, first
date, you know.

371
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:22,827
How was it?

372
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,001
It was okay.

373
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:26,900
Well, good night.

374
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,764
Would you like
some Sambuca?

375
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:32,909
Sure.

376
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,399
Unless...

377
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,800
- I don't want to disturb you.
- Oh no.

378
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,281
I want to hear about it.

379
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:43,296
Was this the dental hygienist
or the investment banker?

380
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,000
The hygienist. Sharon.

381
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,368
The banker was too... shiny.

382
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,318
You know...

383
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,299
It may have just been
an unfortunate lotion.

384
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,912
But let's hear about sharon.

385
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,651
Well, uh, she was nice.

386
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,999
I liked her, I guess.

387
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,956
Did you get a sense of
what kind of person she was?

388
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:17,072
Does she seem solid?

389
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:20,066
Yeah, definitely solid.

390
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:23,691
It's so important. To feel
you could rely on someone.

391
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:27,100
Yeah. It's interesting,
this whole dating thing.

392
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:29,599
I never really did it before vanessa.

393
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:31,512
Enjoy it, dear.

394
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,313
But try not to be blinded
by lust, if you can.

395
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,640
Hey, do you guys
want to get high?

396
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:48,596
I could get high.

397
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,292
I've got some really good pot.

398
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,000
- I've got some.
- I actually have some in my jacket.

399
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:54,669
You do?

400
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,400
It's left over from when we
went to the hollywood bowl.

401
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,000
That's too old.

402
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,191
I just got this.

403
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:03,133
Mine cost $200
for an eighth.

404
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,100
- Let's smoke that.
- It's inside.

405
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,909
Don't tell Keith we're smoking.

406
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:10,851
He gets really
annoying when he's high.

407
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,518
I don't want to make a big deal
about it in front of Brenda.

408
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:17,532
I know what you mean. Billy can't
smoke because of all his medications.

409
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,752
So how's mom?

410
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:29,600
When was the last
time you talked to her?

411
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:33,795
You might want to call her
tomorrow before the wedding

412
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:37,200
- So it's not tense.
- She can call me.

413
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:45,114
There you go.

414
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,407
So, um, what do you
guys think about Billy?

415
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,725
He's in a pretty good
place, you think?

416
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,865
Yeah. Definitely.

417
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,030
Good place, what
does that mean?

418
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,711
Just that he's doing really well.

419
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,421
It doesn't mean I won't
lay awake at night worrying

420
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,580
About the fact you're in his bed.

421
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:07,349
That's a nice thing to say
about your wife's brother.

422
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:09,479
She knows how I feel.

423
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,392
It is so unfair to hold
things that happened

424
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,378
years ago against someone.

425
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:19,595
That's saying that
people can't change!

426
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,754
I mean, you changed!

427
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,204
Yeah, I've changed,

428
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,624
But I'm not totally
fucking insane.

429
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,522
I didn't try and carve a
tattoo off somebody's ass.

430
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,291
Shut up!

431
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,500
Here.

432
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,479
What?

433
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't know.

434
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,479
Did you have
a bad dream?

435
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,175
Maybe.

436
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:57,667
Yeah.

437
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:00,349
What?

438
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh my god,
I'm bleeding.

439
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,993
- Oh, Nate!
- Okay okay okay. It's okay.

440
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,327
It's okay. It's okay.

441
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm going to try to schedule
the d&c for tomorrow morning.

442
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,327
We can't do it tomorrow.

443
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,153
We're getting married.

444
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,300
Congratulations.

445
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,900
Thank you.

446
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,599
- Bren, we can cancel.
- No, we have to do it today.

447
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,000
I can't get an anesthesiologist today.

448
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,600
We have to do
it tomorrow, Bren.

449
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, fuck.

450
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:44,700
Can it wait till monday?

451
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,225
Sure, monday's fine.

452
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,051
Then we'll do it monday.

453
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:06,928
Hey, how's it going?

454
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,667
Good.

455
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,703
Is that me?

456
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,500
No, it's Nate.

457
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,500
No, these pieces?

458
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,100
That's Brenda. Narcissist.

459
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,891
Well, it looks like me.

460
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:23,717
Well, they're not. This
is a wedding present.

461
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:25,500
Why would I
have you in there?

462
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,908
Because she can marry Nate,
but she'll always love me.

463
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,401
She is me!

464
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:35,100
No!

465
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,463
Are you upset with me?

466
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:43,700
No, I was just concentrating.

467
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:46,347
All right.

468
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,289
I'll leave you alone.

469
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:07,941
I'm sorry.

470
00:28:09,184 --> 00:28:11,517
How do I get
to my room?

471
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:14,083
You mean our room?

472
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,040
Our bedroom?

473
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:20,403
If that's what it is.

474
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,260
Come on upstairs now.

475
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,838
We'll get you unpacked.

476
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:41,933
David: you made it clear we're
only considering a surrogate?

477
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,900
Yeah. Now what
about Tamara?

478
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:45,643
She's got your
forehead, an I.Q. of 120.

479
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,922
She's 5'2" and
she weighs 160 lbs.

480
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,270
Maybe that's why she costs
less than the other ones.

481
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:55,053
It's not like I wouldn't
love an obese child,

482
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:58,082
But I'd rather not sign up
for a lifetime of body issues,

483
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,865
Especially if we get a girl.

484
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,633
If we get a girl, you
better hope she's obese.

485
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,662
I'm not having some
12-Year-Old hottie

486
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,140
Running around sunset boulevard
with her ass crack showing.

487
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,067
Hey, Rog, what's up?

488
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:21,473
Yeah. I can do a couple
of nights next week.

489
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:23,821
Let me get my calendar.

490
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,900
What nights were you thinking of?

491
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:29,053
I know I'm free tuesday.

492
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,807
Are you ready to
meet the bachelorettes?

493
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,575
Uh, I guess so.

494
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:41,604
Ladies.

495
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,053
Hi. I'm Sierra.

496
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,299
I'm 20.

497
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,864
I have a combined
S.A.T. Score of 675.

498
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,937
And I want to be your
egg donor-surrogate

499
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:55,850
Because, although I'm not ready
to start a family of my own,

500
00:29:55,922 --> 00:30:00,067
I want to put as many versions of
myself on the planet as I possibly can.

501
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:04,430
Hi! I'm Deedee
from san pedro.

502
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,465
I'm 27 years old.

503
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,299
I love outdoor sports, and
i'm your dream surrogate

504
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,864
Because I've given birth
to nine healthy babies.

505
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,865
And it's my personal
mission to have children

506
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,199
For Bourgeois narcissists who
can't conceive on their own.

507
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,300
Hi.

508
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:21,560
I'm Lindsay.

509
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:23,600
I've got a degree in
applied science from yale,

510
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:27,359
A masters from M.I.T. And
$60,000 of school loans to repay.

511
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:29,641
I'm hoping you pick me
so I won't have to resort

512
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,916
To more obvious forms of
prostitution to get out of debt.

513
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,600
So, have you found her?

514
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,682
I can't do this, Keith. I'm sorry.

515
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,900
I can't just rent out some woman's
uterus like it's a storage locker.

516
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay.

517
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:54,586
Hi, guys!

518
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,499
Daddy got us a gamecube!

519
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,571
- You could say hello!
- Hi.

520
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,615
Share with your
brother, Julio!

521
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,399
You're spoiling them.

522
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,803
Can you take them tomorrow
for a couple of hours?

523
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,800
I can't. It's Nate's wedding.

524
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,296
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

525
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,615
<i>Who are you bringing?</i>

526
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,079
No one. You want to come?

527
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,890
No, thank you.
I'm happy for Nate,

528
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:18,100
But I have a week
of errands to do.

529
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,365
- You should bring a real date.
- To a wedding?

530
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:25,237
Isn't that weird?

531
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:27,300
You should bring someone
so it won't be boring.

532
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,847
What happened with that makeup
artist dana? She sounded nice.

533
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,300
Yeah, she was too... I don't
know, cheerful or something.

534
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Nobody's perfect. You have to give
people a chance to grow on you.

535
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:39,108
Yeah.

536
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,122
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

537
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,340
No one's you.

538
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
That's sweet, but I
was never me either.

539
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,195
- Yes, you were...
- No, if you were this picky

540
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:51,615
when we were going out,
you never would have married me.

541
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:54,700
You just have to find someone
you like and be nice to them.

542
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,557
Is that how it is with kenny?

543
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,383
Oh. That didn't work out.

544
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,803
Really? What happened?

545
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,064
Ugh, he's a pig. I don't
even want to talk about it.

546
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,165
But I'm too busy
for all that now.

547
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,700
It's okay for me. I don't
need someone as much as you do.

548
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,311
Oh really?

549
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,064
It's not a bad thing, Rico.
You're just...

550
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:18,054
A person who does
better with someone.

551
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,388
So tomorrow, while
I'm at the wedding

552
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:28,501
I'm going to have a home
aide come stay with you

553
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,900
So you won't be
alone, all right?

554
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:37,033
- Whose wedding?
- Nate's. My son.

555
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,584
I know who Nate is.

556
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:42,062
Who is he marrying?

557
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:45,100
Brenda... his girlfriend?

558
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,000
That's wonderful!

559
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,246
Of course I'll be there.

560
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,765
This is an important
passage for Nate

561
00:32:57,346 --> 00:33:00,520
From being a widower to
starting again as a householder.

562
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:03,868
- I want to support him.
- If you don't think it's too much for you.

563
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:07,200
Too much? My only son
is getting married!

564
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:14,877
Well, why don't we see
how you feel tomorrow?

565
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,200
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

566
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,765
<i>The splendid young man
who came to the throne in 1509,</i>

567
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:28,970
<i>By 1547 had become a revolting
swollen mass of putrefying flesh.</i>

568
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,173
You want the vicodin or some naproxen?

569
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:33,346
- Vicodin please.
- All right.

570
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,520
Here.

571
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:43,857
Cramps are pretty bad, huh?

572
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:46,742
I just want to get a whole lot number.

573
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:57,043
God, this is so not the vision I had
of the night before my wedding.

574
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,100
Where is the stripper?

575
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:06,200
It would be so easy to postpone
this for a couple of weeks.

576
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:10,100
It would not be easy.

577
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,651
And it would cost a fortune.

578
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,057
So what? It's just money.

579
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,985
I'd rather not even have a wedding

580
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:18,100
Than have to deal with
rescheduling everything.

581
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,100
Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,898
Let's just-- We can
run off to vegas.

583
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:27,854
- Yeah right.
- Come on, you loved that idea.

584
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:32,056
That was before I spent six months
planning my stupid fucking dream wedding.

585
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,099
That's why I think we should reschedule.

586
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,900
It's only going to be depressing.

587
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,056
<i>- For you?
- Yeah, for me!</i>

588
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,345
And it's going to be
depressing for you too, I think.

589
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,998
It's not as depressing
as calling 100 people

590
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:47,780
And telling them that it's canceled
because I lost my fucking baby,

591
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:50,699
Which I just told the
whole world I was having.

592
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,900
Why did you let me tell
so many fucking people?

593
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,693
I just... I don't
think that you...

594
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,606
I don't think you
realize how upset you are.

595
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:04,418
Don't tell me how I feel! I
think I know how upset I am!

596
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:07,766
Then why are we going through with this?
Because when I think about not doing it,

597
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:10,096
I want to throw myself under a bus.

598
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,099
I want to swallow razor blades.

599
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,650
I'm gonna have to take
every painkiller in the house

600
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,737
Just so I could pick up the
phone and cancel the caterer.

601
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,012
Then fuck it!

602
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,200
Let's get married.

603
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,056
Okay?

604
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,621
It will be a great day.

605
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:31,780
Yeah.

606
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,954
You can have one of
my vicodin if you want.

607
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,462
Thank you.

608
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:42,400
Just make sure you leave
enough for tomorrow.

609
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:46,244
<i>... which meant
that he constantly stank</i>

610
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,157
<i>of rotting flesh.</i>

611
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,200
Oh god.

612
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:59,099
Are these big granny-panties
your "something old"?

613
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:01,038
Because they really kill the mood.

614
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,121
You can't see them
through the dress, can you?

615
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:06,000
No, but they're hideous, sweetie.

616
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,103
Would it kill you to wear a thong?

617
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,096
These are fine.

618
00:36:10,223 --> 00:36:11,853
What's the matter?

619
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,969
Nothing's the matter.
I just don't want to wear a thong.

620
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:21,491
Did something happen? Is it the baby?

621
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,784
What is it? What happened?

622
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:32,600
Oh, baby.

623
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,238
I don't want to fuck up my makeup.

624
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:38,672
Oh, honey. We'll ean you
up with a good powder.

625
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,977
I've got chanel in my purse.

626
00:36:41,904 --> 00:36:43,064
I don't want to be late.

627
00:36:43,093 --> 00:36:46,499
You don't have to worry about
everything going right anymore.

628
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:49,000
That boat has sailed.

629
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,557
You know it happens all the time

630
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,919
So many of my friends...

631
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:59,165
Joanie, Celia, aunt
Mary before she had Deb.

632
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:03,050
Even Teresa Heinz Kerry
had one.

633
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,300
And God knows,
she looks terrific.

634
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:09,745
- Aunt mary did?
- I'm telling you,

635
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,890
More women have miscarried

636
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:15,904
Than they have masturbated with
a dildo. They just don't talk about it.

637
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,513
And then they
have a baby,

638
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:22,542
And then they're
fine, sweetie.

639
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:33,020
I'd better change
this fucking pad.

640
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:36,100
If I get blood on this dress
I'm gonna kill myself.

641
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:44,600
- I'm so sorry, Nate.
- Yeah, well...

642
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:50,200
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
We want to keep today kind of nice, you know?

643
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:54,907
Are you going to try again?

644
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,515
Yeah, of course, as soon as we can.

645
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:02,138
- You might want to give it some time.
- No no no. I don't want to wait.

646
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,799
No, I mean, to grieve.

647
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,196
With all the fucked up shit
that's happened in my life,

648
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,167
I don't want to grieve
anymore. I can't.

649
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:13,443
I can't! I don't
have it in me.

650
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,153
Well, maybe
Brenda needs to--

651
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:20,000
What Brenda needs to do is
get pregnant again. Soon.

652
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,225
'Cause it's not like she's 20.

653
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,800
Yeah, but...

654
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,138
With all the stuff Keith
and I have been reading,

655
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,964
It seems psychological stress
can affect a woman's chances--

656
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,093
It's the only thing that's gonna make
her feel better! Why should I wait?

657
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:36,599
Why put it off? Because bad shit
happened and we need to feel bad?

658
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,500
Bad shit happens every day.

659
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:41,800
You of all people should know that.

660
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,100
Move fucking on, you know?

661
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:50,196
Anyway, I've already got
Maya so it's not for me.

662
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,633
But it'll be your child,
your flesh and blood.

663
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:57,125
- How could it not be for you?
- Because it's what Brenda wants

664
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,430
More than anything, and i
can make that happen for her.

665
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:04,600
Listen, the justice
of the peace is here.

666
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,817
I take you, Nate,

667
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,799
With all your strengths and faults

668
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:35,600
As I offer myself to you

669
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,900
With all my strengths and faults.

670
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,674
From this day forward,

671
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,800
I will be there
when you need help

672
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,041
And turn to you

673
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,214
When I need help.

674
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:57,322
I promise myself
to you forever.

675
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,700
I vow to trust,

676
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,400
To honor and to cherish,

677
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:08,582
To share and support your hopes,

678
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,104
Your thoughts and your dreams

679
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,843
As long as we both shall live.

680
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:30,838
By the power vested in me
from the state of california,

681
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:33,911
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

682
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,186
You may kiss the bride.

683
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,224
So is it weird to see
Brenda get married?

684
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,195
"Weird"?

685
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:15,824
No, it's great.

686
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:18,737
I mean, because you
guys used to be so close?

687
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:22,027
I'm really happy.

688
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:27,723
I'm happy we're both in
healthy relationships.

689
00:41:27,998 --> 00:41:30,000
With siblings.

690
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:34,900
It's funny how you both ended
up with another set of siblings.

691
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,230
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:41,600
It's funny that you
and Nate did too.

693
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,607
God, what do you think it means?

694
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,911
- It was a nice ceremony.
- It was.

695
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:56,500
You got a little
choked up, didn't you?

696
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:58,824
Yeah.

697
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,013
I love weddings.

698
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:02,563
Don't you?

699
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,839
Sure. If it's right.

700
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:07,200
The last one I went to,
the people hated each other,

701
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:08,984
- So it was depressing.
- God damn it!

702
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,781
It's so frustrating to
not be able to help her!

703
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:14,013
But you did help her.

704
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:17,433
You helped her as much as anyone
could under the circumstances.

705
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:20,300
I don't know. I really
believe in marriage.

706
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:23,129
A lot of guys today don't even
know how to make a commitment,

707
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:26,056
But I was married 11 years.

708
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:29,085
I'm the kind of person
who's better with someone.

709
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:32,172
Someone special, I mean.

710
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,085
That's sweet.

711
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:39,500
<i>They couldn't have
picked a prettier location.</i>

712
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:42,600
It looks beautiful.

713
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,984
- All right, that's enough of that one.
- All right.

714
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:49,300
Lovely! A family portrait
with two new Fishers.

715
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:03,062
- Okay, what's next?
- How about mom and George?

716
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:05,800
Okay, I'm just gonna freshen up.

717
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:08,600
Okay, mom. You guys wanna
get over here in the light?

718
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,338
- Let me take that glass.
- Mom, it's fine.

719
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:24,695
Sorry.

720
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:28,491
- What are you doing?
- What?

721
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,200
Have a little respect!

722
00:43:32,628 --> 00:43:33,400
Oh my god.

723
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:36,525
It's not funny!

724
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:39,525
Oh my.

725
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:46,572
- May I have some seltzer please, no ice?
- Yes, ma'am.

726
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:48,702
- Mom, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

727
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:52,500
- What happened with Claire?
- She's in such a terrible phase.

728
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,079
She's so out of control in her life,

729
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:56,000
She doesn't care about
anyone else's feelings.

730
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,700
- What did she do?
- She took a rude picture of George

731
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:01,300
In an extremely compromised
state. There's ice in this.

732
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:03,385
- Sorry.
- I'm sure she didn't mean it that way.

733
00:44:03,414 --> 00:44:05,700
She's always trying
to make some statement!

734
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:07,880
Yes, this is her way
of saying I'm the fool

735
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,500
Who has to take care of a crazy
person for the rest of my life!

736
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:12,420
I don't think she was
trying to say that.

737
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:15,700
I don't need a photograph to see that.
I don't need to have my face shoved in it.

738
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:18,637
Mom, we'll get you some help,
a nurse or something.

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,912
God! No! I'm still the one who has to
be there all day and every night.

740
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:24,400
- Why do you ?
- Because there's no one else!

741
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:34,249
Excuse me, dear. I have to clean
the stain on his jacket before it sets.

742
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,749
Oh, thank you.

743
00:44:44,112 --> 00:44:47,590
- Who's the third one for?
- That's to put under our pillow.

744
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:51,512
So who do you dream of
if you're already married?

745
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:53,714
You dream of a future love.

746
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,164
You mean our second husbands?

747
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:58,077
No. We could dream of our child.

748
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,400
Or just get frosting in our ears.

749
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,700
I think we should go
forward with the surrogate.

750
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:08,599
Really? Why?

751
00:45:08,903 --> 00:45:10,500
Because you want your own child.

752
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:12,657
And...

753
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:14,265
I don't want to be the
one who denies you that.

754
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:17,468
Want to be the one who helps
you to have what you want.

755
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,565
What about the kids who need homes?

756
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:24,600
We can do both. I
think we should do both.

757
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,454
One of each?

758
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,454
Which one comes first?

759
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:32,758
Whichever shows up first.

760
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,178
What if they both show
up at the same time?

761
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,999
Then we'll be really busy.

762
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:40,801
You're serious.

763
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,533
All right then.

764
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:21,400
You don't have to worry about
it being like my wedding.

765
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,100
I had a three-Month-Old
baby when I got married,

766
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,500
So it was a much
happier event, obviously.

767
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:28,800
Really joyful.

768
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:31,111
It all came very naturally to me.

769
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,198
But I was always maternal, unlike you.

770
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:34,600
I'm fucking maternal.

771
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Oh, come on. Look at your past.

772
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,365
What about my past?

773
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,299
You're a slutbag! You were.

774
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,060
- That's got nothing to do with it.
- Of course it does.

775
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:45,900
All the moments of your
life have led to this one.

776
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,256
- You're being punished.
- I don't believe in that.

777
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:53,692
Your insides must have gotten
damaged from all that anonymous cock.

778
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,098
Oh, come on. That's why
this happened to you.

779
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,499
Look at that nice woman over there.

780
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:01,623
She's got her baby.

781
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:04,478
Everybody treated her like a
princess for the whole nine months.

782
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,579
There's a pregnant
goddess, due in six weeks.

783
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:10,579
She has two at home.

784
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,200
She doesn't know it
yet, but she's pregnant.

785
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:15,100
She wasn't even trying!

786
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:17,344
Boy, is she going to be thrilled. Twins!

787
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:19,170
They'll be here in june.

788
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:21,300
I'm gonna get my baby, you bitch.

789
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,425
I got pregnant the fourth time I tried.

790
00:47:24,773 --> 00:47:26,222
I didn't have to try.

791
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:28,799
But I never partied like you did.

792
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,101
It's a miracle you even conceived!

793
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,814
A lot of women have miscarriages!

794
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:37,341
They don't talk about it
so people don't realize.

795
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,532
None of the women at this wedding have.

796
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,202
Except you, of course.

797
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:44,384
You're just bitter because you had to
get pregnant to get Nate to marry you.

798
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,949
I'm bitter? Who's drunk
and yelling at a dead woman?

799
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:48,631
And she might not even be his daughter!

800
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:50,891
You were having an affair
with your sister's husband!

801
00:47:51,254 --> 00:47:53,268
That was purely a spiritual thing.

802
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:56,370
Nate is Maya's father.

803
00:47:56,442 --> 00:47:58,599
He's my husband, and he always will be.

804
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,000
You will never feel his
arms around you again.

805
00:48:01,384 --> 00:48:03,515
You'll never feel the air on your skin,

806
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:05,428
Or wake up in a warm bed.

807
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:06,600
You're done.

808
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,428
You don't get the chance
to try again for anything.

809
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,065
- So what?
- So I can.

810
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,717
Oh, please.

811
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,152
Every time you try to
have a nice normal life,

812
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,500
You fuck it up.

813
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:19,399
You're never going to have
your happily-Ever-After moment,

814
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,906
No matter how many
white veils you put on.

815
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,268
You're just too
fucked up for all that.

816
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:25,660
Maybe you should just accept that,

817
00:48:25,732 --> 00:48:28,200
Instead of trying to
be something you're not.

818
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:46,685
Are you okay?

819
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,354
- Bren?
- You were right.

820
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:52,572
I should never have tried
to have this stupid day,

821
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:56,050
This idiotic tent, the
dumb-Ass wedding band.

822
00:48:56,093 --> 00:48:57,543
It's such a fucking cliche.

823
00:48:57,644 --> 00:49:01,731
Just to prove that I deserve
my own special fucking day,

824
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,500
Which I don't.

825
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,522
Brenda, the
only reason--

826
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:08,146
- The only reason why i...
- No, come on!

827
00:49:08,204 --> 00:49:12,831
You knew. It was a pathetic attempt to
become something I'm not, that we're not.

828
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:15,744
I thought you might be
too upset to enjoy the day.

829
00:49:15,788 --> 00:49:18,643
But it's so perfect this
way! It's so perfect.

830
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:22,107
The only way that I get to get
married in a long white gown

831
00:49:22,165 --> 00:49:25,252
Is to have my dead baby
leaking out of me all day.

832
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,599
That's me. That's what
i get for my wedding.

833
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,150
You're really upset,
maybe you shouldn't be drinking.

834
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,020
Are you kidding me? This glass
of champagne is the only thing

835
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:35,759
in my universe right now.

836
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,643
You have me.

837
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:42,773
You don't really fucking want me.

838
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:46,585
Not that I blame you.

839
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:48,570
Who would?

840
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,200
I do.

841
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:53,570
Well then, you're a
very disturbed person.

842
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,817
Maybe.

843
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,034
Don't be nice to me!

844
00:49:58,411 --> 00:49:59,570
What do you want me to do?
You want me to hit you?

845
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,400
Yes! That would feel fucking fantastic!

846
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:06,674
Come here.

847
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:19,703
I thought you were going to hit me.

848
00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:22,299
No. I'm disturbed, I'm not violent.

849
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,935
You were when you threw your ring at me.

850
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:28,008
Oh, memories.

851
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,799
I'm glad
today sucked--

852
00:50:33,814 --> 00:50:35,307
'Cause I wouldn't want the
happiest day of our life

853
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,104
To be over already, would you?

854
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:39,738
No.

855
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:42,131
It's coming, right? It's coming.

856
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,900
It fucking better be.

857
00:52:17,088 --> 00:52:18,610
Brenda?

858
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,132
Oh, I'm sorry. You
can't come in for this.

859
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:33,364
Can you hold this?
