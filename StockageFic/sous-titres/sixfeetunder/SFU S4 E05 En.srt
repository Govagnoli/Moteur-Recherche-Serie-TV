1
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,195
- Shit.
- Oh, I know!

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,598
You went a little "Showgirls" on me there.
Not that I'm complaining.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,150
Happy anniversary, baby.

4
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,039
- Same time next year?
- You kidding? I got needs.

5
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,073
I'd better wake up in the morning
with you all over me.

6
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,157
I hope you don't think I'm waiting till morning.

7
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,231
Let's go shower.

8
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,271
Give me a minute.

9
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,795
- This feels too nice.
- Just don't cook yourself.

10
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,277
Honey?

11
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,231
Annie, you OK?

12
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,912
Annie?

13
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,231
Annie? Annie!

14
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,511
Oh, my God! Annie!

15
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,958
I'm gonna miss you. This is the first time
we've been apart for any length of time.

16
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,312
- Not that long.
- Keith, three months is a long time.

17
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,148
David, we were split up for eight months.
We weathered that.

18
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,877
You're gonna get hit on
by really hot guys in every city.

19
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,710
It's been OK for us to have an occasional
random fuck here. What'll be so different?

20
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,153
You'll meet some cooler, smarter, hotter guy
who's a lot easier to get along with than I am.

21
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,670
- I could do that here.
- That makes me feel a lot better.

22
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,871
We'll be able to buy a fucking house
with the money I make

23
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,514
with a pool, a hot tub and a steam shower.

24
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,028
- And room for kids.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,632
All of which you'll be sharing with the cooler,
smarter, hotter guy you'll meet on tour.

26
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,274
Don't you know I ain't looking?

27
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,596
I'm settled down. I've found what I want.

28
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,631
Besides, this'll be good for us.

29
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,710
- How will this be good?
- It'll show you you don't have to worry.

30
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,038
Come on, David, what does it take?
Don't be so insecure. I love you.

31
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,030
I'm not insecure.

32
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,834
- If you want me not to do anything, just ask.
- Really?

33
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,668
Yeah, as long as you don't do anything either.

34
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,439
- Be safe.
- Course I'm gonna be safe.

35
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,869
- I'm safe with everybody but you.
- Extra safe.

36
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,948
- Even with blow jobs, use a condom.
- Did you use a condom with that plumber?

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,597
No, but that was different. We hadn't made up
rules. No sex with anybody more than once.

38
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,835
- We'll see about that.
- Keith...

39
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,472
David.

40
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,680
- There's my car. How do I look?
- So fucking hot, it's ridiculous.

41
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,711
I'm gonna miss you.

42
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,033
- I feel like I'm gonna cry.
- So cry.

43
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,598
- Call me every night.
- OK.

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,108
- Starting tonight.
- All right, I will.

45
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,155
All right, bitch, calm down!

46
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,039
Bush just lies and no one cares.

47
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,473
Nate, you got fuckin' oatmeal on my print!
I don't believe this.

48
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,671
- Hey, not in front of Maya, OK?
- Asshole.

49
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,269
- This is really important to me.
- Yes, they're for Claire's crit.

50
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,154
Mom, don't say "crit".
It sounds weird coming from you.

51
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,110
- Are you trying to be a model or something?
- No, I'm not selling anything.

52
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,359
You should try to figure out how to sell out
to the highest bidder as fast as you can

53
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,678
before your life just totally blows up
in your face, because it will.

54
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,873
- It just doesn't stop, does it?
- It gets better, but it never goes away, no.

55
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,874
- Maybe you should try to meet someone new.
- Mom, I don't want to meet... What, date?

56
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,072
- I don't want to be with anybody right now.
- Even if it's just sex, then.

57
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,830
- Sex can be very healing.
- It's OK for us to be celibate if we want to.

58
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,753
- Thank you, Claire.
- Then maybe you should get a job.

59
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,268
I've been trying. It's not easy these days.

60
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,517
- Who's supposed to take care of Maya?
- Us, her family.

61
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,757
I think it's best if I look after my daughter,
thank you.

62
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,190
Don't you think what's best for Maya
is to have a healthy father?

63
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,313
Mom, all I do is think about
what's best for Maya, OK?

64
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,350
A bereavement group?

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,791
I was a grief counsellor for three years.
I know what a load of crap this is.

66
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,470
It actually helps to spend time with others
going through the same experience.

67
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,956
- Then why didn't you go when Dad died?
- I did.

68
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,959
- You didn't tell us that.
- I went once a week for several months.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,915
- One of us could have gone with you.
- It would have been wrong to burden you.

70
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,350
Maybe I could have used it, too.
Why is this family so repressed?

71
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,591
I can tell you from experience.

72
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,713
You won't wake up one morning
and find it's all over. You have to grieve.

73
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,150
I know that. I have grieved.
I've done big grieving, OK?

74
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,236
I just feel like I'm...

75
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,593
stuck in this quicksand and
something bigger than me is holding me back.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,556
<i>It just doesn't make sense</i>.

77
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,311
Something as stupid as that.

78
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,678
Falling in the shower.

79
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,075
It was my fault.

80
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,157
No. No, of course not. It was an accident.

81
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,034
No, I dragged her out to the hot tub,

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,355
made her drink tequila,

83
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,391
got her all dizzy.

84
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,119
- It was our anniversary.
- Mr Thornton...

85
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,591
I think your wife was very much in love

86
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,474
and did all those things
because she enjoyed doing them with you.

87
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,551
Why did this happen?

88
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,469
Out of nowhere, for no reason?

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,991
I was a good husband.

90
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,190
I loved her. I took care of her.

91
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,032
Why is God punishing me?

92
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,868
I don't think God punishes people like that,
Mr Thornton.

93
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,911
No, of course not.

94
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,071
- Hello, Ruth.
- Hello, Becky.

95
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,715
- Pyjamas?
- Hard to get them long enough for George.

96
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,797
- He's such a large man.
- Nothing wrong with that.

97
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,913
No, no, I'm not complaining.
How are things with Hakim?

98
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,918
- He got back together with his wife.
- Oh, no!

99
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,351
Yeah, I guess I was just a pretty toy to him.
$22.40.

100
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,960
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm not.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,120
I left a bag of burning dog shit on his porch
as a little parting gift. Movin' on.

102
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,836
You know, George has a son.

103
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,431
- He got a job?
- I believe he's independently wealthy.

104
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,269
- What's his name?
- Kyle. He's about 40, rather boyish.

105
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,675
Does he have a moustache? I like them.

106
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,396
- No, but I believe he's capable of growing one.
- Why is he still single?

107
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,355
- He's a very complex man.
- I like a man who can keep me guessing.

108
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,351
Maybe I'll have you both over for dinner.

109
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,509
I'll call you.

110
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,960
<i>Shall we start? Anyone?</i>

111
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,197
They remind me
of Katy Grannan's earlier work.

112
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,988
Yes, they certainly do.

113
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,235
I like them.

114
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,673
They're really simple, unpretentious, pretty.

115
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,431
Like Claire herself.

116
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,153
I wonder though...

117
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,236
if they're a little too staged.

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,152
Maybe.

119
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,077
Are they staged, Claire?

120
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,512
Well, yeah.
It's hard to take a candid self-portrait.

121
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,870
Not just staged, but...stagy.

122
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,916
And maybe they're a little stiff.

123
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,951
Dead.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,753
That's what I like about them.

125
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,633
This girl who's, like, dead

126
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,150
and beyond everything.

127
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,192
Beyond hunger, beyond sex, beyond boredom.

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,357
And, really, it's so beautiful to be in that state.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,592
Like, nothing can reach her.

130
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,431
Nothing can get to her.

131
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,268
- See, I wouldn't say dead, I would say empty.
- Yeah, definitely empty.

132
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,630
- Was that your intention, Claire?
- No.

133
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,559
I was trying to capture the stillness
I sometimes feel.

134
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,637
Really? Not emptiness, apathy?

135
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,591
No. Stillness.

136
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,200
OK, what are you doing in this picture?

137
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,629
Nothing. Being still.

138
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,558
What are you looking at?
What are you thinking?

139
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,834
- Nothing.
- OK.

140
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,316
I thought you were actually thinking
something deep.

141
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,670
OK, let me ask you this,
and feel free to roll your eyes,

142
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,679
but do you really want to perpetuate
the idea of woman as a vacant vessel?

143
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,711
Ls this more lesbian stuff?

144
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,752
Yes. I have to meet my quota
so I get my toaster oven.

145
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,156
I'm not trying to perpetuate anything.
I don't have an agenda.

146
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,317
- I shoot from a more instinctual place.
- An empty place?

147
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,432
- I'm not empty!
- No, of course not.

148
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,076
Maybe with your next work, we can see
something that actually is inside you.

149
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,188
- May I help you?
- Oh, I'm just looking for Rico.

150
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,754
Federico?

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,597
Rico Rico.

152
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,194
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

153
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,119
God, I'm glad you called.
I hated the way we left things this morning.

154
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,357
- <i>How did we leave things?</i>
- Awkward.

155
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,473
I was just calling to remind you
to pay the cable bill. I left it on my desk.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,592
OK.

157
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,750
- So how's it going?
- It's great. Got our own sushi chef.

158
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,712
I'm eating yellowtail.
It's out of this fucking world.

159
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,956
I'm drinking lukewarm coffee
and driving a body back to the funeral home.

160
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,157
I'm having an awful day.

161
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,670
- Why?
- The way you left seemed so... "Whatever."

162
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,519
Honey, forget it. You're just feeling needy.

163
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
"Honey"? When do you ever call me honey?

164
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,598
You don't want them to know you're
talking to a guy? Jesus. Just call me Darlene.

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,230
- I gotta go. They're starting a movie.
- What movie?

166
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,751
Some Japanese horror flick they want
Celeste to do the remake of. I love you.

167
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,597
<i>Gotta go</i>.

168
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,396
Rico!

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,829
What are you doing here?

170
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,429
Obviously you weren't gonna
come to see me.

171
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,634
Come on, Maria's watching Nicole today.
Let's go to Magic Mountain.

172
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,877
- Are you stoned?
- So? I don't have to work today.

173
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,117
You can't come in here stoned.
You can't come in at all.

174
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,438
- You don't like me any more?
- Of course I like you. It's just...you know.

175
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,598
I want you to take me to dinner.
I got a new dress.

176
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,995
- It's very short.
- No.

177
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,032
Sophia, no. Sophia, no!

178
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,636
You got the wrong idea.

179
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,951
I spent all day alone yesterday.

180
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,276
I was so sad.

181
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,311
I cried, like, three times.

182
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,395
I miss you.

183
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,071
You're important to me, Rico.

184
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,310
You make my life better.

185
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,590
- Whoa, Sophia...
- I'm sorry if I did something wrong, but...

186
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,031
- No, you didn't do anything wrong, it's just...
- I can't help it that I like you.

187
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

188
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,036
I guess I should go.

189
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,514
Maybe I can get off early tonight.

190
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,511
- Sorry.
- No, you're not interrupting anything.

191
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,313
Sophia Morales, this is Nate Fisher.

192
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,669
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

193
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,991
Do you need anything?

194
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,720
I was just gonna play some Doom.

195
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,469
- Pick me up at seven.
- OK, OK.

196
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,595
It's not what you think.

197
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,756
Rico, I don't care.

198
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,479
..<i>studios in Los Angeles. This is</i>...

199
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,830
..<i>patrolling for petroll</i>

200
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,549
..<i>more than in any other land</i>.
<i>No wonder about 40</i>...

201
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,673
- I can't believe someone stopped.
- What's wrong?

202
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,597
I ran out of gas. I know, so lame.

203
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,351
- No. It's happened to all of us at least once.
- I'm supposed to help my grandma today.

204
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,191
She broke her hip and can't make it upstairs.
I told her I'd move her bed down into the den.

205
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,030
I know she's just sitting there waiting for me.
I'm sorry, it's just one of those days.

206
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,717
I know what that's like.

207
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,038
Any chance you could give me a lift
to the next gas station?

208
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,551
I wouldn't even ask, I just...
I don't know what else to do.

209
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,155
- Sure, get in.
- Thank you so much.

210
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,711
- I'm Jake.
- David.

211
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,718
David, you just saved my life.

212
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,875
This is so much fun.
I haven't been on a campus in years.

213
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,512
Hi.

214
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,598
Let's wrap him up and take him home!

215
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,474
- Now what?
- You're being wildly inappropriate, as usual.

216
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,990
And, as usual,
I am feeling irritated and resentful.

217
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,031
Well, that's your shit.

218
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,119
- Is Richard Braun teaching here?
- Yeah, my Cognitive Psych class.

219
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,630
You don't believe in all that cognitive crap,
do you?

220
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,240
You have to dig through the past.

221
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,273
Knowing where behaviour comes from
doesn't change the behaviour.

222
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,073
You just know where the behaviour
comes from.

223
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,036
Ricky Braun has the most unusually
shiny penis. I went on this retreat with him.

224
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,359
When he'd get out of the hot tub,
the water would just bead up on his schlong.

225
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,996
- Do you suppose he kept it oiled?
- I don't care, Mom. He's a good teacher.

226
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,237
He's an exhibitionist and an idiot.

227
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,748
Maybe you should teach the class.

228
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,997
Here? No thank you, darling,
I'm not that desperate.

229
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,634
This happens to be an excellent program.

230
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,359
It doesn't matter where you do your training.
You'll be a great therapist.

231
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,713
You really have this uncanny understanding
of interpersonal dynamics,

232
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,069
which you've always had.

233
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,750
You have a problem applying the principles
to your own life. So often the case.

234
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,918
- I was wondering when the insult would come.
- We're exactly the same.

235
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,111
Who's a bigger train wreck than I?

236
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,192
So how's it going with Olivier?

237
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,273
He's a very passionate man. He's a lot of fun
if you don't take him too seriously.

238
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,711
He is completely supportive of my decision
to have vaginal rejuvenation surgery.

239
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,239
Oh, Mom!

240
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,354
Darling, I've had a couple of children.
You, especially, took your toll.

241
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,438
No one wants to fuck a glass of water,
if you know what I'm saying.

242
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,191
Speaking of children,
are you still interested in having one?

243
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,113
- I think so.
- You think so?

244
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,193
And is Joe the man
you want to have them with?

245
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,038
- I think he is, yeah.
- You think he is?

246
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,231
How's the sex?

247
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,750
It's fine.

248
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,475
It's creative. It's interesting.

249
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,231
Dear God, you have to dump him.

250
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,750
Mom, when I brought him to dinner,
you said he was the one.

251
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,670
I didn't realise at the time that the sex between
the two of you was this cerebral exercise.

252
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,113
That's not good. Sex is something you should
feel, not something you should think.

253
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,709
I think to keep from behaving
in a compulsive and destructive manner,

254
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,958
thanks to my early exposure
to compulsive and destructive sexual energy.

255
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,436
You just said that poring over the past
is not important.

256
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,632
- Change the behaviour.
- I have changed the behaviour.

257
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,750
Then what are you complaining about?

258
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,748
This is probably the healthiest relationship
that I have ever been in.

259
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,109
I'm not gonna dump him.

260
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,436
As a matter of fact,
we're talking about moving in together.

261
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,960
Now, that's the Brenda I know.

262
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,831
I hate your new hair.

263
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,918
I could feel the gentle rocking of the train
as we started to move.

264
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,114
And he was so handsome,
sitting there against the window smiling at me.

265
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,951
When I woke up, I could hardly believe
I was this old lady in bed all by myself.

266
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,676
And what's odd is
I had completely forgotten about that trip.

267
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,756
It was so long ago.

268
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,190
I have so many memories
of my time with Walter,

269
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,310
I can't even remember them all.

270
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,836
Memories are nice, aren't they, Ellen?

271
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,877
- Their ATM is down.
- Really?

272
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,394
I got no cash so I tried to use my credit card
to get a gas can and a couple gallons of gas.

273
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,954
I'm way over my limit so he wouldn't take it.

274
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,278
I begged him, please,
and he laughs in my face.

275
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,788
- How humiliating is that?
- Sorry.

276
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,515
Man, I must have been a serious asshole
in a previous life.

277
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,349
I don't think it works that way.
Things just happen.

278
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,868
At least I stole a pack of gum.

279
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,429
- You stole that?
- I figured he deserved it.

280
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,630
Want a piece?

281
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,195
Now you're my accomplice.

282
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,029
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong?

283
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,079
Poor Grandma's still waiting for me. I'd call her,
but she's deaf. She never hears the phone.

284
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,315
Let me buy the gas can and gas, OK?

285
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,148
- No way.
- Really, it's no big deal. I'm going to.

286
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,428
Only if you take me to an ATM
so I can pay you back.

287
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,471
OK.

288
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,272
An apple, some sharp cheddar,
and a hunk of crusty bread.

289
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,232
And somehow, it all tastes little bit better

290
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,556
when you cut it
with your grandfather's pocket knife.

291
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,712
I've been thinking
we should invite Kyle over for dinner.

292
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,595
- Why?
- So he can meet my friend Becky,

293
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,189
who's quite adorable in her own way
and quite single.

294
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,473
- Ruth, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to arrange a dinner.

295
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,717
I can make my vegetable lasagne.
And Becky said she...

296
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,039
- You're meddling.
- It's not meddling to introduce two people.

297
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,676
When one of them is my son
who leaves boxes of shit on our doorstep?

298
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,790
Oh, yes, that's meddling.

299
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,116
But don't you want to help him?

300
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,355
I only agreed to meet with him

301
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,995
because I wanted you to see first-hand
what a mess he is.

302
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,031
If I'd had any idea...

303
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,998
Christ.

304
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,871
Look...

305
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,354
just leave it alone, Ruth, OK?

306
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,273
You deal with your messed-up children
and I'll deal with mine.

307
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,071
I don't care for that tone.

308
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,516
I'm very disappointed in you, Ruth.

309
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,152
Very.

310
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,320
When you lose somebody you love,
you truly have lost a part of yourself.

311
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,920
You shared a lifetime with this person

312
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,670
so it's only natural to have moments
when you're feeling completely lost.

313
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,711
What if you haven't?

314
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,955
Well, if you don't feel lost...

315
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,434
I didn't get to share a lifetime with her.

316
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,708
I'm sorry, I've been listening
to your stories and they're...

317
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,879
They're upsetting because I don't have that.

318
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,233
I don't have a lifetime of memories.
We were just getting started.

319
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,116
Just working things through.

320
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,879
And...

321
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,911
now I have a...

322
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,597
I have a two-year-old daughter
who doesn't have a mother and so she...

323
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,798
she has to get everything from me
because I'm all there is, but I don't...

324
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,195
I don't know what to do with that.

325
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,358
Most of the time, I just...

326
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,391
I just feel numb.

327
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,237
And then sometimes I feel just...just terrified.

328
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,680
Then sometimes, I just feel so angry,
but then I don't want to be this bitter guy

329
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,317
so I try to deal with it because I don't want
my daughter to have to live with that poison.

330
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,798
I try and be thankful.

331
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,991
I try so hard to be thankful.

332
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,110
And I am thankful. Thankful I have
a beautiful child that Lisa gave me.

333
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,673
Yet some days, some days I just feel like I'm
going crazy, like I'm literally losing my mind...

334
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,837
- That's the fire alarm.
- It's probably just a false alarm.

335
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,238
But just to be safe, we're gonna walk down
the hallway and out into the parking lot.

336
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,875
- Is everyone ready?
- I've never heard that before.

337
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,911
Thanks for the gas, man.

338
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,268
Well, this is one incredibly shitty day for me,

339
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,869
but you are, like,
the coolest guy I ever met, David.

340
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,078
Now we just gotta hit that ATM.

341
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,111
They're usually all over.

342
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,828
- Do you want some water?
- No, thanks.

343
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,796
Are you gay?

344
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,155
- Yes.
- I thought so. You look gay.

345
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,314
No, I mean you could be.

346
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,079
I was hoping you were gay.

347
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,715
I mean, I figure you have a boyfriend.

348
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,069
You're too cute not to.

349
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,115
But what if I could be your guy on the side,
who understands you

350
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,720
and loves you unconditionally

351
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,752
and pretty much lives just to please you?

352
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,268
You want me to take my pants off?

353
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,355
Hello? Do you want some water or not?

354
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,039
Oh, no, thanks, I'm fine.

355
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,629
- Dude, where did you go?
- I'm a little preoccupied.

356
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,955
I'm having one of those days, too.

357
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,149
Well, hey, say no more.

358
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,080
I smell smoke. Anyone else smell smoke?

359
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,590
OK, everyone, false alarm.
We can all go back in.

360
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,311
- So did you grow up in LA?
- Yeah, one of the rare natives.

361
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,036
- What about you?
- I was born in St George, Bermuda.

362
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,548
- Wow.
- Not as exciting as it sounds.

363
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,910
- It was the naval air station.
- Your dad was in the navy?

364
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,953
At first. Then he worked for a food service
company that supplied the navy.

365
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,834
I used to fantasise about running away
and joining the navy.

366
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,512
I pictured myself walking down the gangway in
my uniform like Gene Kelly in On The Town.

367
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,874
Who?

368
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,711
Never mind.

369
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,914
The navy sucks. When I was little, as soon as
I'd make friends, my dad would have to move.

370
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,996
So I was always the new kid.

371
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,068
Yeah, I know how that feels. I was never
the new kid. I was just the odd kid.

372
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,670
I think there's one in there.

373
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,359
- What?
- ATM.

374
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,197
Oh, cool.

375
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,599
Hey.

376
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,190
OK, we walk in there, you get as much cash
as you can with your ATM card.

377
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,189
If you try anything,
if you even breathe in a way that I don't like,

378
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,992
I will shoot you in the spine.

379
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,877
Understand?

380
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,515
Not 300, 500.

381
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,758
- I don't think you can withdraw 500.
- Yeah, you can. Do it.

382
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,598
I don't even have 500 in my account.

383
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,949
- How much?
- Maybe four.

384
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,956
Do four.

385
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,357
Let's go.

386
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,597
Nice try.

387
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,593
Oh, wow, I really hit you hard, didn't I?

388
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,353
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, bro. It just...

389
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,394
It felt so fucking good! I didn't even know I was
gonna do that. I just fucking... I just did it.

390
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,514
- You got your money, just leave me alone.
- Don't be angry. Come on, get in the van.

391
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,951
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- You're not dumping me after our first fight?

392
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,994
We're best friends forever. Get in the van
before I kick your motherfucking ass.

393
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,031
Let's go, cowboy.

394
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,758
- Where?
- That way.

395
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,758
Hey.

396
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,155
Wipe your face.

397
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,269
Do you want me to take you back to your car?

398
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,595
I don't have a car.

399
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,313
Where I picked you up.

400
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,238
That wasn't my car. I don't have a car.

401
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,669
Where would I get a car?

402
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,472
So...

403
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,714
where am I taking you?

404
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,073
Well, it's definitely party time. There are these
guys I know in Long Beach that deal meth.

405
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,351
Have fun all tweak-end long, you know?

406
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,076
No, we'll do it old school tonight. MacArthur
Park. Head on down to the crack gallery.

407
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,917
Oh, Jesus.

408
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,679
- You can just take the van.
- No, I'm drinking. You have to drive.

409
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,439
Friends don't let friends drive drunk.

410
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,190
- How do I get there?
- Just head towards downtown.

411
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,151
- No, what are you doing?
- Getting on the freeway.

412
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,268
No, stay off the fucking freeway!
Just get on Alvarado.

413
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,471
- OK, calm down!
- I don't like the freeway.

414
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,559
I had an accident on the freeway.
My father was killed right after we moved here.

415
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,558
- Sorry.
- On the way to a Dodger game.

416
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,912
We were just talking, and bam,
he ploughed into the back of this truck.

417
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,271
I'm really sorry.

418
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,269
When the car finally stopped moving,
he just...wasn't there any more.

419
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,838
What happened?

420
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,511
He went through the windshield.

421
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,793
He never wore his seatbelt.
It was his little "fuck you" to the world.

422
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,114
I lost my father in a car accident, too.

423
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,151
He was hit by a bus.

424
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,995
How old were you?

425
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,349
It was just three years ago.

426
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,950
Fuck you! That's not the same!

427
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,956
I was ten years old.

428
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,948
- Jesus, man, you fart?
- No.

429
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,677
Yeah, you did! Holy fucking Christ!

430
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,915
- It was the body.
- What?

431
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,748
- The body, it's releasing gas.
- What the fuck is that?

432
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,998
It's a body. I'm a funeral director.
I was taking it home when I picked you up.

433
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,112
Fuck, fuck! Get it out of here!

434
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,596
Stop the fucking van! Stop the fucking van!

435
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,710
Oh, Jesus, it's a chick.
Hey, you wanna fuck her?

436
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,071
I was kidding!
Oh, shit, you should see your face!

437
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,237
- What do you want?
- To get her the fuck out of my van.

438
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,590
Jesus, that is a person!
That's somebody's wife!

439
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,633
If she was always farting like that,
he must be happy to be rid of her.

440
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,955
God, that is disgusting.

441
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,837
Let's go.

442
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,511
I said, let's go!

443
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,429
Man, you got any Lysol?

444
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,199
- I can still smell her farts.
- No.

445
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,757
Pull in there.

446
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,631
Get in the back.

447
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,078
Lay down.

448
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,956
On your stomach.
You think we're gonna make out, faggot?

449
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,271
Give me your hands.

450
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,474
- Is that too tight?
- Yes.

451
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,956
Tough shit. I don't want you going anywhere.
I like you.

452
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,352
Oh, bitch.

453
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,312
That was so great. Your fucking cell phone!

454
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,351
You are so lame.

455
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,231
Oh, my God!

456
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,630
You poor thing.
You thought you were so fucking rescued.

457
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,077
All gone. Cops go bye-bye.

458
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,837
Now say you're sorry
for running away from me.

459
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,991
Say you're fucking sorry, pussy.

460
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,231
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

461
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,639
God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

462
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,999
So...

463
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,109
are you really a mortician?

464
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,471
A funeral director.

465
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,393
- Man, that is so sick.
- There's nothing sick about it.

466
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,750
What's sick was leaving that woman
in the middle of the road.

467
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,837
Imagine the guy who finds her.

468
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,270
"What have we got here? A bag of gold?"

469
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,118
"It's some dead cunt!"

470
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,111
Come on, that's funny.

471
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,357
It's not funny.
What if that was someone you cared about?

472
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,631
- Like who?
- Like someone in your family.

473
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,912
Why are you doing this to me? How can you
be this way? Because your father died?

474
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,357
You idiot. I made that up. He's not dead. He's
doing time somewhere in Washington state.

475
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,598
Then why? I need to understand
how you could do this to me, to anybody.

476
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,758
Don't you have any fucking sympathy
for me...at all?

477
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,239
How can you be so completely disconnected
from another human being?

478
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,831
Jesus, David.
What fucking difference does it make?

479
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,519
Let's just get high and have some fun.

480
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,351
Man, look at your face.
See, you could use some crack.

481
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,391
You ever done it before?

482
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,599
- No.
- Shit, I haven't done crack in a long time.

483
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,111
I think about it. Sometimes I walk by a car
right after the engine's been turned off

484
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,230
and it has that crack smell.

485
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,594
Fuck, this is gonna be great.

486
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,392
Come on, let's go find us a crack dealer.

487
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,118
Him?

488
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,838
Too freaky. There, the little juggler.

489
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,194
- What you want?
- A couple rocks. How much?

490
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,630
- 40 each.
- 40? Shit. Just give me one.

491
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,432
- You bought the drugs right out of his mouth?
- Yeah, we're close that way.

492
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,551
Hold on a second, let me enjoy this.

493
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,998
Up we go.

494
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,072
- No, thank you.
- Come on, it's good stuff.

495
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,913
- No.
- Or I could put a hole in your throat

496
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,679
and blow the smoke in that way.

497
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,398
OK.

498
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,752
There you go. Hold it. Hold it in.

499
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,192
OK.

500
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,668
Nice, huh?

501
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,517
Wow, yeah!

502
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,798
I am so fuckin' loving life right now.

503
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,391
My God, I've never felt like this.
How could I have never felt like this?

504
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,193
- Can you drive?
- Shit, I can do anything.

505
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,435
- Want to have sex?
- Are you serious?

506
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,472
Totally. I need to suck dick, man.

507
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,829
- I need someone to fuck me.
- OK.

508
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,756
Careful, I'm driving.

509
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,839
Jesus!

510
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,318
Give me all your fuckin' money, man, before
I beat your face in, shit-faced motherfuckers!

511
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,078
- Will he come after us?
- No way.

512
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,068
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

513
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,269
Your windshield's busted.

514
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,033
I swear to God, you are such a fucking hero.

515
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,072
- Are you gonna let me go now?
- No.

516
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,352
Now you're gonna go and hurt my feelings?
Man, we're best friends for life.

517
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,994
- You said I saved your life.
- Just talk.

518
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,238
That's what you do with people like you -
say nice things so they feel better.

519
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,272
- That guy would have killed you!
- I don't think so.

520
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,599
I gave you money, you got high, there's
nothing else you want. Let's just end it.

521
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,359
No, no, no, we gotta go to Long Beach.

522
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,960
- What?
- I need some meth.

523
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,069
Yeah, well, there's definitely
some downsides to crack.

524
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,397
OK, look, just take me to Long Beach
and you're done.

525
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,152
Really?

526
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,991
Really.

527
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,558
- Do you even know where we are?
- Not exactly.

528
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,795
- Am I going the right way?
- I guess.

529
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,674
- How will I know when I get there?
- If you hit the ocean, you've gone too far.

530
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,838
- I just don't know where I am.
- It's a red house. Like a barn red.

531
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,036
- Should I start looking?
- Yeah, when we get closer, yeah.

532
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,873
- Hey, that's my dog.
- What?

533
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,196
That's my fucking dog. Wait, stop. Stop!

534
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,630
Roll down your window.

535
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,954
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Charlie!
Here, boy! Here, boy!

536
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,756
- How can that be your dog?
- I used to live around here. Follow him.

537
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,392
Follow him!

538
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,357
- I think he's gone.
- Keep going.

539
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,908
- Just get close.
- That's what I'm doing.

540
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,076
Yeah, but don't scare him.

541
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,675
- Help me catch him.
- I don't want to.

542
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,760
I don't wanna shoot you.

543
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,349
Get out and help me get my dog
and I will let you go.

544
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,351
- What about getting the meth?
- Just help me get my dog and I will let you go.

545
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,919
- Promise?
- I swear to fucking God.

546
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,155
- You're scaring him.
- He's gonna get away.

547
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,912
Charlie. Here, boy, I've got a cookie.
I've got a cookie for you.

548
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,793
Don't lie to my dog!

549
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,675
I got him, I got him.

550
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,951
Charlie, here, boy. Hey, boy. Hey, Charlie.

551
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,999
- That's not my dog.
- What?

552
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,031
That's not my dog. Let him go.

553
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,358
- Of course it's your dog.
- I know my own dog, stupid! Let him go!

554
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,710
Jesus, I ask you for one thing
and you can't even do that!

555
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,233
- Give me your wallet.
- What?

556
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,591
Give it.

557
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,188
So they can't identify your body right away.

558
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,314
That's right, you fucking faggot,
you are so dead.

559
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,075
We'll keep looking. I'll find your dog.

560
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,829
Jesus, he'd be, like, 30 years old now.

561
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,311
Fuck it. I'm through with you, man.

562
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,678
It's time to end this once and for all.

563
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,711
No! No!

564
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,831
You're gonna kill me with a rock?

565
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,713
Please!

566
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,912
What'll it be? Wanna go out in a blaze of glory
or should I just shoot you?

567
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,748
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

568
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,751
Suck it.

569
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,519
Put it in your mouth.

570
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,357
Suck it.

571
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,637
That's right.

572
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,675
You are so fucking pathetic.

573
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,155
- Close your eyes.
- No.

574
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,748
Close your fucking eyes
before I shoot them out.

575
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,909
English
