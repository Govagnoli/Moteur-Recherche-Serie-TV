1
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,890
...a report by this entertainment industry
analyst released today...

2
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:29,522
showed a severe drop in the summer
box office results at the major studios.

3
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,525
A Warner Brothers spokesperson
pooh-poohed the projections....

4
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,167
Previn?

5
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,524
Previn, are you in there?

6
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:39,247
It's George, the building manager.

7
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:42,526
I started to smell something
a few days ago...

8
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:45,173
but I just thought
someone was cooking cabbage.

9
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:48,211
See? You can still smell it. I'm not crazy.

10
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,126
Oh, my God!

11
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,361
I'm just surprised.

12
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,728
Why? I told you I was going to write a book.

13
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,373
-No, you didn't.
-I thought I did.

14
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,962
-What?
-I need to get in there.

15
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:22,886
So you're just gonna sit down today
and start writing?

16
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:25,851
Yeah, I think that's how it's usually done.

17
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:28,802
Except for Hemingway. He stood.

18
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,933
-What?
-I need to get in there now.

19
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:42,846
-What? You think I can't write a book?
-No, of course not.

20
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,851
It's just a book is so big.

21
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:49,967
Not all of them.

22
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,682
Well, it's just the last time we talked
about you doing something new...

23
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:57,288
you mentioned getting Billy's friends
to help you open an art gallery.

24
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,091
Yeah, well, I got to thinking.

25
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,641
I don't need to help others
express themselves.

26
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,610
I should do it myself.

27
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,610
I think this is great.

28
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:08,487
Charlotte finally speaks.

29
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,452
Your fucked-up childhood from your
point of view. People will want to read that.

30
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,411
No way. I'm not gonna write a memoir.

31
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:18,411
What is it, then?

32
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,245
-Fiction.
-Really?

33
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,402
That's so ambitious. I love it.

34
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,928
I hope I'm going to be in it.
I've always wanted to be thinly veiled.

35
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:35,731
You might be in it...

36
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:39,087
if you ever do anything interesting.

37
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:43,892
I need help.

38
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,170
Do you think the hair
on Mr. Peterson's forearms is sexy?

39
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:50,450
Or is it too unkempt?
Sometimes he gets all tufty.

40
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,489
I really don't have time for this.

41
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:56,043
This weekend is my last chance
to take the SATs. I have to do well.

42
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:59,409
Just take a break.
It'll keep you from burning out.

43
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,330
Every fall,
I rate the male teachers' fuckability.

44
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,406
I've been doing it since the sixth grade.

45
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,246
I am, like, 400 times smarter than you.

46
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,642
Why aren't you panicking more
about this test?

47
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,689
Because I know how to play the game.

48
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,571
I have a tutor. I've taken practice tests.

49
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:20,162
And my mom's life coach is advising me.

50
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:22,130
Your mom's life coach?

51
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:26,286
Parker, do you have any idea
what a parody of yourself you are?

52
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:28,689
I feel bad for Mr. Van Kirk.

53
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:33,164
If he hadn't stopped working out,
he could've easily cracked the top 10.

54
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,372
Give me that.

55
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,129
Gitterman's coming in at 22?

56
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,851
I was feeling generous.

57
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,288
-Hey, Claire.
-Gary, hi.

58
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,688
-See you this afternoon?
-Yep.

59
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,008
Gary has a great ass.

60
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:00,846
-You think he has a great ass?
-Yeah.

61
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,604
Like you haven't noticed.

62
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:08,249
My mom calls them buns.
She's so not of this century.

63
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,325
I don't care how much she pays
her life coach.

64
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,490
I could fuck Gary. Easy.

65
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:24,722
So this woman in her 40s
just died alone in her apartment?

66
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,770
Just out of the blue?

67
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,963
I mean, she must have had
some kind of medical condition.

68
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,009
No, she choked to death.

69
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,171
She lay there for a week
before anyone found her.

70
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,642
Why didn't anybody notice sooner?

71
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,810
Maybe they thought she was on vacation.

72
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:46,090
Here are the arrangements for her funeral.
They're self-explanatory.

73
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,243
You should be able to take care of it.

74
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,166
Shouldn't I talk
to whoever's gonna bury her?

75
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:54,006
Nate, it's a pre-need. She buried herself.

76
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,653
She bought everything she wanted
ahead of time.

77
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:00,362
You have her contacts for family
and friends, directions for the service...

78
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,808
and the specifications about her restoration.

79
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,691
She knew exactly what kind of service
she wanted.

80
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,571
You'll need to order the sheet music
for the organist.

81
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,213
And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.

82
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:15,281
She certainly had a sense of humor.

83
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,452
What song is that?

84
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,569
It's from Dreamgirls. You know it:

85
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,371
And I am telling you

86
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,171
I'm not going

87
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,892
You're the best man I've ever known

88
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,531
It must be weird
to fill one of these things out for yourself.

89
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,410
I had fun doing mine.

90
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:33,648
I have a test on Monday,
I have an art history paper due next week.

91
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,521
I know I could do a good job on both
if I had more time, but I don't.

92
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,167
-Do I have something on my face?
-No.

93
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,843
You're giving me this look.

94
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:49,452
It's just nice to see you so involved.

95
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,561
Are you taking the SAT this weekend?

96
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,769
I saw the books in the library.

97
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,321
-I don't know why I didn't tell you.
-It's okay.

98
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,723
-I just signed up for it. I wasn't sure.
-No, it's great.

99
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:04,601
You're taking school more seriously,
and you're gonna take the SAT.

100
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,169
-It shows you're nurturing yourself.
-Give me a break.

101
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:11,683
I'm so scared of having my own thoughts
or going my own direction...

102
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,128
that I need some safety or approval.

103
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,932
This stuff is just cop-out distractions.

104
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,686
You know what?
This session's given me some clarity.

105
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,729
I should just blow this test off...

106
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:26,408
and look really hard inside myself
for what I really want.

107
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:33,641
Claire, you're obviously frightened
by taking this test. Why?

108
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,286
I don't know.

109
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,291
It's like, when I think about the test...

110
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,327
I see this nasty fluorescent light.

111
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:49,486
The kind that shows all your pockmarks
and tiny scars that you wish you could hide.

112
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:50,722
I see.

113
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,286
So it's very safe in the darkness, isn't it?

114
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,241
Okay, you're getting kind of corny.

115
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:04,769
All I'm saying is you're finally in a place
where you're coming into your own.

116
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:10,328
You're afraid if people see the real you,
it'll be scary. And guess what? It is scary.

117
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,928
For all of us. Isn't it?

118
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,726
Don't be silly, David.

119
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:24,641
You don't need to apologize
for what you said about The Plan.

120
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,167
If you live in a neighborhood
for a long time...

121
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:31,166
and somebody moves in
and renovates the house across the street...

122
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:34,563
that could just make you feel
your own house is shabby.

123
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,802
I see.

124
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,807
-Did you just insult me?
-Of course not.

125
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,126
You'll see.

126
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,331
When you're ready,
you're going to live in a palace.

127
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,729
Claire, wash your hands. We're about to eat.

128
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:49,327
Don't set a place for me. I'm not staying.

129
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,368
-Who are you having dinner with?
-No one.

130
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:55,570
I'm having coffee
with someone I met at St. Stephen's.

131
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:58,645
David, if you have a date, just say it.

132
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,206
Nothing ever gets built
if the materials aren't labeled properly.

133
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,165
Okay, I have a date.

134
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:08,643
David, I'm having a problem
with the Emily Previn funeral.

135
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,246
Let's hear it.

136
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:15,487
I've called her entire contact list, and
the friends she listed have moved or died.

137
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,165
She has two distant relatives.

138
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,962
One of which I can't reach, and the other
has this phobia about funerals.

139
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:22,850
Some people are so sick.

140
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,811
Now we know why she wasn't found
for a week.

141
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,165
-I don't think she had anybody in her life.
-How awful.

142
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:32,563
Have you called her job
to notify her colleagues about the service?

143
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:36,123
No. She worked at a temp agency,
so she just had jobs here and there.

144
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,727
She must have had someone
that she forgot to list.

145
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:42,010
Try her high school.
Everyone has friends from high school.

146
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,606
No, they don't.

147
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:46,526
Maybe they have people they talk to,
or do things with...

148
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:48,524
but they're not really friends.

149
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,365
They're just filler.

150
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,331
What? It's true.

151
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,410
I want a glass of wine.

152
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,881
Oh, God.

153
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,772
It's so weird.

154
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,003
Who the hell was Emily Previn?

155
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,011
Nate, are you okay?

156
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:12,083
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-'Cause your eyes look really weird.

157
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:17,083
Yeah, it's just this medication I'm taking.
It makes me a little drowsy. That's all.

158
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,407
Honestly.

159
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,162
Maybe Emily Previn was autistic.

160
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:31,122
I read an article about a high-functioning
autistic person who didn't need people.

161
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:34,489
She just had a job
designing these big cattle slaughterhouses.

162
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,167
At night, she came home
and sat in a machine...

163
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,448
that made her feel
like she was being hugged.

164
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,047
And that was all the intimacy she needed.

165
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,771
That's really upsetting.

166
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,492
I don't see why
this person has to be mentally ill...

167
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:51,044
just because she had a life that doesn't
conform to a familiar image in our heads.

168
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,966
Maybe she was living the life she wanted.

169
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:56,248
A life without the hassle of other people.

170
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,449
What kind of a life is that?

171
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,931
"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor...

172
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,164
"but how was I supposed to know
it was your car?"

173
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,809
-I don't think I could be a public defender.
-No? Why not?

174
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,010
I just don't think
I could defend people who are guilty.

175
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:19,210
I guess I could be
a some-of-the-public defender.

176
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,204
So, what do you do?

177
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:28,164
Me? My family owns a business.
Actually, it's a funeral home.

178
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:34,963
But I got out of that really quickly,
and now I'm in textiles.

179
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,972
I like fabric.

180
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:43,123
I have to be in court in the morning.
I have a lot of work...

181
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,967
-Okay. Maybe we'll see each other around.
-David, relax.

182
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:51,092
It's fine. I understand.
I guess there's not much of a spark here.

183
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,962
I thought there was. You don't?

184
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,683
No, I do. I was just worried.

185
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,813
I'm sorry, Ben.
I get a little nervous at these things.

186
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,885
If I seem calm,
it's only because I take a beta-blocker...

187
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:09,330
before I have to get in front of a jury
or first dates.

188
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:13,926
You're still nervous on the inside,
but you don't show it as much.

189
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,890
Do you have any extra?

190
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:24,086
Let's go on a real date next time.
Like, for dinner.

191
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,684
Okay, that would be nice.

192
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:31,250
You seem a little....

193
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:36,249
-Are you coming out of a bad breakup?
-No, I'm coming out of a bad celibacy.

194
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:41,010
I was in a relationship, but that ended.

195
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:45,444
Well, whatever happened, I blame him.

196
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:48,971
You shouldn't. He's a great guy.

197
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,966
You get your spoiled little ass
into that bed right now! Do you hear me?

198
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,088
You suck!

199
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,164
Right now! I mean it!

200
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,252
I'm not tired.

201
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:03,242
When I'm at my real home,
I don't have to go to sleep until I get tired.

202
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,848
I'm going to turn off the lights now,
and soon you'll be tired.

203
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,446
What if I never get tired?

204
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:12,367
Then you'll lay awake for hours and hours,
wondering why life is so hard.

205
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:14,284
That's what the rest of us do.

206
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,091
That sounds boring.

207
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,125
You get used to it.

208
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,442
Do you want to talk about anything?

209
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:34,687
Like how you feel about staying here?

210
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:37,925
Or being scared, because your mom's
been in Oakland so long?

211
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,048
No.

212
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:42,450
Okay. But we don't know how long
you're gonna be here.

213
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:46,765
So why don't we both try
and ease up on each other a little bit, okay?

214
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,728
You guys have bad toothpaste.

215
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:55,887
My first instinct is to get angry with her.
I open my mouth, I hear my father.

216
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:01,282
Stop being so hard on yourself.
That child is not easy.

217
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,245
I swore to myself I would never be like him.

218
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,051
I'm not in the mood.

219
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:18,608
Fine.

220
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,927
Get up!

221
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,125
-Hello?
-Hi, Melissa. It's Brenda.

222
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:02,441
Chenowith.

223
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,410
Your massage therapist.

224
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,045
Hey, how's it going?

225
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,651
Listen, I was just wondering
if you hadn't eaten yet...

226
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,689
if you wanted to have lunch.

227
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:15,241
Actually, I'm at a restaurant right now.

228
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:20,446
Look, I'm probably breaking
all these client/masseuse boundaries.

229
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,001
I'll see you
at your regular appointment tomorrow.

230
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:26,051
No, I was just gonna say I'm by myself.
I'd love the company.

231
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,452
Thank God.

232
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:40,092
Oh, Jesus!

233
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:43,892
This one's gonna be one hell of a ride.

234
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:46,328
I'm sure you'll be able to take care of it.

235
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,892
Yeah? Well, don't be.

236
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:51,409
She must've been laying out for a week
in a partially-ventilated space.

237
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,961
Why can't everyone die
in an air-conditioned room?

238
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,408
Her face is discolored from being lain on.

239
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,087
That I can fix,
although it's gonna take me hours.

240
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:02,609
Her abdomen's all distended.
This woman's got a lot of gas in there.

241
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:05,253
When I poke a hole,
we're gonna get some major fumes.

242
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,766
Whew, Nellie!

243
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,162
I have no idea why I came in here.

244
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:12,051
-Maybe you have Alzheimer's.
-Yeah, maybe.

245
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:24,852
We really are just biology, aren't we?

246
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:29,604
You may need to talk the family
out of an open casket.

247
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:33,242
-There's only so much I can do, man.
-She doesn't have any family.

248
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,082
-No one?
-No friends, or anybody.

249
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:40,169
I ran an obituary in the paper today.

250
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:42,892
I'm just praying
someone will read it and come tomorrow.

251
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:44,201
Pre-need?

252
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:50,128
If she wanted an open casket,
we'll try to give her one.

253
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:53,808
I'll boost up the fluids
and see if that'll bring the swelling down.

254
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:58,171
There's a good chance we're going to get
some skin slippage, and then we're screwed.

255
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:04,689
Maybe she was just some vicious asshole,
you know?

256
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,046
Just twisted and evil. Maybe that's why
she didn't have any people in her life.

257
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,122
No.

258
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:16,645
You can tell what kind of life people lived
even when they're dead.

259
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,329
Yeah, she was all right.

260
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:29,331
Please have your IDs out and ready
so we can speed things along.

261
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,609
-Claire Fisher.
-ID?

262
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,686
-Sign right here.
-Name?

263
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:40,207
-Parker McKenna.
-Let's see.

264
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,404
Parker. Sign here, please.

265
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,048
Next?

266
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,522
Does anybody have
an extra number two pencil?

267
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,012
Here you go.

268
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:56,606
So it sounds
like a pretty serious relationship for you.

269
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:57,842
It is.

270
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,084
I love Nate. I really do.

271
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,962
But, lately, I feel kind of separate from him.

272
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,927
Which I know is healthy on one level.

273
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:13,922
But, on another, I kind of miss how it was.

274
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,366
When we started seeing each other
and weren't together...

275
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:20,684
I'd be wondering,
"What is he doing?" all day long.

276
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:21,962
Now?

277
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,883
I never even think about it.

278
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:31,090
I don't know exactly when it changed.

279
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:35,961
But at some point,
he became less present with me.

280
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:41,731
Sometimes I think it's because
I don't give him enough to be present for.

281
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:46,762
But then I think, maybe he's not present
because he knows if he was really present...

282
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,851
then I'd leave him.

283
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:55,889
You know, it's just so sad
that you can love somebody so much...

284
00:22:55,973 --> 00:23:00,285
and have absolutely no idea
what's going on in their head.

285
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:07,928
-Relationships are fucked.
-That's what I always say.

286
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,489
I haven't had a real relationship
in over a decade.

287
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,562
-Is that because you....
-Because I blow guys for money?

288
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,769
I'm so sorry. That was....

289
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:20,252
It's okay.

290
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,565
I've only been doing that
for about five years.

291
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,052
So why, then?

292
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:30,323
I'm just not built for it.
Some people aren't, I think.

293
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:33,686
It's not healthy or unhealthy. It just is.

294
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:39,967
Oh, shit.

295
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,609
I'm being paged by a client.

296
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:51,405
I am not driving out to Calabasas
in this traffic.

297
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:53,404
Let the jerk whack off.

298
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:57,932
You know, I'm really glad
you could have lunch.

299
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,207
Me, too.

300
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:04,244
You know, it means a lot to me
that you're so normal around me.

301
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:08,252
Most people have preconceived notions
about what I do.

302
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,530
Yeah, well, people can be
such judgmental assholes.

303
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:13,444
You don't have to tell me that.

304
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,649
You want to know what's worse?

305
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:19,847
Most girls want to be my friend
so that they can pump me...

306
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:23,243
for all the gory details
about being a lady of the evening.

307
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:28,052
It's just question after question,
like I'm some kind of freak.

308
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:39,525
-All right, you get three questions.
-Oh, goody!

309
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:42,611
There's that one.

310
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,247
No, I think that one makes you look fat.

311
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,686
Very funny.

312
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,006
Which one do you think
will look better on Miss Previn?

313
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:51,128
The pink one.

314
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:54,364
Didn't she specify which gown she wanted,
or did Dad slip up?

315
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:58,162
No, Dad didn't slip up.
She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.

316
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:01,802
-The outfit she came in with was shot.
-Give her the blue to get rid of it.

317
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:03,246
It's coming apart in the back.

318
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,482
David!

319
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:09,491
-Mom, did you want something?
-I was dusting your casket wall.

320
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,892
If this woman wanted to be buried
in her own clothes...

321
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:16,090
then one of you boys should go to her home
and pick something out.

322
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:17,811
Isn't that a bit much?

323
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:22,409
I remember Dad doing it once or twice.
You get the building manager to let you in.

324
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:25,087
Fine. I'll pick out something dressy.

325
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,249
Considering the shape her body's in...

326
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,608
I should pick
whatever covers her up the most.

327
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,092
I'll come with you.

328
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,892
-You don't have to do that.
-I know that.

329
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:40,125
Aren't the guys scary?
It must get dangerous.

330
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:42,887
To tell you the truth, it doesn't.

331
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:47,241
You just have to trust your instinct.
It's never wrong.

332
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:51,207
We're kind of like animals that way.

333
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,803
When I first meet a client,
I take a good long look into his eyes.

334
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:58,010
That stupid stuff they say
about looking in people's eyes is true.

335
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,561
-You just look into them, and you know.
-Know what?

336
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:04,441
You know, whether someone is right,
or whether they're...

337
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,931
you know, wrong.

338
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:12,522
And if they're wrong,
you just get out of there immediately.

339
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:16,288
No. I think everyone has the answers
to everything in life.

340
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:19,331
-It's a matter of knowing how to listen.
-You're fantastic!

341
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,051
Fuck, you are!

342
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:25,888
There is no bullshit with you!
You are just who you are. Period.

343
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:28,968
Even the way you talk about your work.

344
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:32,648
You provide a service
for which you're well-compensated.

345
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,612
-Unlike the rest of us losers.
-Please.

346
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,966
If there was anything else that paid
this much, I would do it in a heartbeat.

347
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:43,170
But there's not a touch
of victimhood about you.

348
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,727
It's almost like it's empowering, in a way.

349
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,123
I went through that whole
feminist rationalization stuff at first.

350
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,647
Now I'm just a little more honest.

351
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:54,882
It's just a way to pay the bills.

352
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,449
Sorry I can't make it to the funeral.

353
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,808
My kid's got a soccer game.

354
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,245
She was one of your tenants,
for God's sake.

355
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,527
She lived among you.

356
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:09,968
Hey, come on. I just started, all right?

357
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,521
She only lived among me for a week.

358
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:16,090
She never even got to finish
her crossword puzzle.

359
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:19,245
All right, look.

360
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,769
-Five minutes?
-Yep. Great.

361
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,288
Mom!

362
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:31,208
Eddie needs to adapt
to how things have changed.

363
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:33,682
I have a lot more responsibility now.

364
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:37,732
He needs to be more understanding
that sometimes I'm gonna be tired, man.

365
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:40,532
-Yeah, kids come first. Period.
-Exactly.

366
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,442
Have you had this conversation with him?

367
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:47,924
He'd just say I need to make more time
for him, which would piss me off.

368
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,369
So why bother talking to him about it?

369
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:53,286
Because you keep everything bottled up
inside you, my friend.

370
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,329
That's not good. That creates cancer.

371
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:56,846
-Give me a break.
-It does.

372
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:00,084
My wife's cousin was a very angry person,
but she never showed it.

373
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:03,370
She just cleaned all day,
then she lost both her breasts.

374
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:04,568
It's weird.

375
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,284
You get away from me, dickless fuck!

376
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:10,807
-You don't own me.
-What the fuck's wrong with you?

377
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:13,168
You know, you fucking lie to me, bitch!

378
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:16,484
Bitch, I'll blow your fucking brains out,
you stupid cunt!

379
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:19,326
I wish you would,
but you don't got the balls to shoot me!

380
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:22,450
-Police! Drop the gun!
-Stay out of this! Fucking cops!

381
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:23,602
Drop the gun.

382
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,571
You shoot me, they'll shoot you.
Then you'll be dead!

383
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:29,042
You know what?
The world will be a better place!

384
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,169
-Shut up!
-Drop the gun now!

385
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:40,005
What is wrong with you?
What did you do that for?

386
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,731
What's wrong with you?

387
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:52,242
I like all of these, but they seem so flat.

388
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:55,529
I wish one had a little more oomph.

389
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:59,162
-Just grab that one. That one has oomph.
-No, it doesn't.

390
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,568
Don't rush me, Nate. I'm not nearly done...

391
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:06,123
and I haven't even started
with the shoes and the jewelry.

392
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,486
Nate Fisher.

393
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:15,724
Yeah, hi. I left a message there
for Father Martin Farrell.

394
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:20,409
He was requested by the deceased
to officiate at her funeral.

395
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,962
Great! Well, I'm fucked.

396
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,131
I'm sorry, Sister.

397
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:32,131
Are there any other priests
you'd recommend for a funeral tomorrow?

398
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:16,608
Mom?

399
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,093
-What, are you hungry?
-Of course not.

400
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:25,971
-Then, are you ready to go?
-I don't know.

401
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,364
Maybe she liked solitude.

402
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,051
Maybe she was living the life she wanted
and was happy.

403
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,452
I hope so.

404
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,251
But what if some nights,
she wanted to talk to someone...

405
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,085
and she picked up the phone...

406
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:44,530
and realized she didn't have anyone
she could call? What then?

407
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:50,091
We don't know that she didn't have
anyone to call. Maybe there was someone.

408
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:51,492
I hope so.

409
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:28,524
No one thinks you did anything wrong.
You were just doing your job, okay?

410
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:34,452
Now I know what's different.

411
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,922
You're not wearing your glasses tonight.

412
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,811
I was getting dressed,
and nothing looked right...

413
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:43,487
and I realized it was all my glasses' fault.

414
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:46,973
So I put in these contacts,
which I actually hate...

415
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,806
but I thought it was worth it, if you'd....

416
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,690
This is me without beta-blockers.

417
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,532
It's good.

418
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:00,129
Maybe it's even better.

419
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:09,924
-I still work in the family business.
-Excuse me?

420
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:13,132
I'm a funeral director, that's who I am.

421
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:21,172
I have to say, I'm glad you're not in textiles.
That sounded really dull.

422
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:24,091
Why did you lie?

423
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,807
Well, come on.

424
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:30,165
People always get that look in their eyes,
like there's something wrong with you.

425
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:35,122
They wait about 5 seconds before bringing
the conversation around to necrophilia.

426
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,492
I just liked you too much,
and I was scared it would repulse you.

427
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,729
So what made you tell me now?

428
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:45,609
Because on our last date,
I just sort of liked you...

429
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:48,489
and now I really like you.

430
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:55,523
-So I didn't screw things up because I lied?
-No, I think it's cute.

431
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,763
-And I'm gonna wanna take this slow.
-All right.

432
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:04,048
Can we just make out, already?

433
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,045
We had plans to meet tonight. At the Tiki Ti.

434
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,407
Did we?

435
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,246
Claire, why did you blow me off?
And why didn't you return my phone calls?

436
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,563
Because I have nothing to say to you.

437
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:36,606
Look, I know this is about the SATs,
but it wasn't my fault.

438
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:40,807
It was my mother's idea. She heard
about this girl through one of her friends.

439
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,169
She's this genius from Westlake
who's going around taking the test.

440
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,164
And let me tell you, it works.

441
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:49,649
She got three people into Yale
and five into Harvard.

442
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:53,410
-This is so gross.
-What was I supposed to do?

443
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:58,404
My mom came into my room last night and
told me she'd already paid the girl $1,000.

444
00:33:58,493 --> 00:34:01,291
You make me so sick. Just get out of here!

445
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:04,685
Okay? I don't feel like
ever seeing you again.

446
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,763
-You're serious?
-Yeah, I am.

447
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,924
Fine. Fuck you, Claire!

448
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:17,525
By the way, I flirted for 45 minutes with
Gary Deitman outside of school yesterday...

449
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:19,683
and he's this total horny little freak.

450
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:21,491
And I'm gonna bag him, big time.

451
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:26,044
Congratulations. I hope you and
his stupid buns will be very happy together!

452
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:35,131
"David Fisher and Benjamin Cooper
invite you to a holiday open house. "

453
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,327
"Merry Christmas from Ben and David. "

454
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:42,526
"Happy Holidays from the Cooper-Fishers. "

455
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:45,646
"Fish & Coop, new this fall on ABC. "

456
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:55,210
Keith, what's wrong?

457
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,406
I'm not sure.

458
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,045
Okay. Come in and sit down.

459
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:09,723
I shouldn't have even come here.

460
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,041
It's fine.

461
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,932
You want a beer?

462
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:16,528
-I have Rolling Rock or Amstel Light...
-I killed someone today.

463
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,286
-Oh, my God.
-It was this guy....

464
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:23,928
Him and his woman were having a fight.

465
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:27,531
They were obviously
both high on something.

466
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:29,484
He had a gun and....

467
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:32,610
I'm sure whatever it was,
you did the right thing.

468
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,764
He's dead, you fucking idiot!

469
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:39,086
I should have aimed at his arm or his leg.

470
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,732
I'm stupid.

471
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,844
I'm so fucking stupid.

472
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:52,288
I never killed someone before.

473
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:56,884
I can't live with this.

474
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:00,169
I don't know how to help you.

475
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:03,327
Do you want to pray?

476
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,608
Maybe that would do something.

477
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:34,811
David's not up yet?

478
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,889
So where's Emily Previn?

479
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,046
She's in there.

480
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,766
So she's not gonna have an open casket.

481
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:52,413
-I couldn't do it.
-Okay.

482
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:56,966
I was supposed to take the kids to dinner
so Vanessa could have the night off.

483
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,044
But instead, I was here.

484
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:01,330
Until 9:00 last night.

485
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,804
Skin was fricking pouring off
that woman's face!

486
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:08,647
I get all this shit from Vanessa,
and I wasn't able to restore the poor lady!

487
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,132
Nobody could have.

488
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:12,363
But, here, you think you can do it?

489
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:15,362
Here's some tools.

490
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,808
I want to watch you swim in that skin.
Go ahead!

491
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,645
All I said was, "Okay. "

492
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:30,052
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,524
I just wish I could've done her
the way she wanted.

494
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:40,209
If it'll make you feel any better, I don't think
there are even gonna be any mourners.

495
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:43,967
Thanks.

496
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,208
Hello?

497
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:58,847
It's me.

498
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:03,888
-I thought you were still here.
-I had to get back home.

499
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,202
Are you okay?

500
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,369
Yeah, I'm fine.

501
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,611
Listen, what happened last night,
that was wrong.

502
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:18,250
I don't know why I went to you,
but obviously I wasn't thinking right.

503
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:20,446
Obviously.

504
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,445
I'm in a relationship.

505
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:24,444
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

506
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:28,405
I just thought you and I could be friends...

507
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:30,808
but I was just kidding myself.

508
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:36,368
Look, I don't think that you and I
should see each other anymore.

509
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:43,682
David?

510
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:46,808
Yeah, I'm here. Sure, whatever you want.

511
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:51,003
I knew you would understand.

512
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:54,848
Goodbye.

513
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,048
Bye.

514
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:08,129
Thank you. That was intense.

515
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,006
You're practically like jelly.
You don't need this.

516
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,812
Maybe not, but I love it.

517
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:16,084
You're gifted, you know that?

518
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,282
Hello?

519
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:26,011
Don't give me that bullshit, Allison.
I want your ass there in half an hour.

520
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:29,370
Okay, fuck you.
You are officially dead to me now.

521
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:32,642
Everything okay?

522
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:36,328
I have a client at 2:15,
and my watcher just cancelled.

523
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,772
Your watcher?

524
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:40,885
He likes to be watched
by another girl while I do him.

525
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:43,248
It's the easiest $100 in the world...

526
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:47,406
and this asshole just blew me off
for a runway audition.

527
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,211
God, I hate models.

528
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:51,808
Fuck.

529
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,609
If you're sitting in the corner depressed,
pick up.

530
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,401
Pick up.

531
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,524
All right, be depressed.

532
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:07,248
Listen, if you're in a jam....

533
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:10,652
This isn't a science project, honey.
This is business.

534
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:13,247
Please. You think I can't handle it?

535
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:20,643
Like I said, it's pretty easy.

536
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,484
Actually, it's like you're invisible.
Just sitting and watching.

537
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:26,801
I can do that.

538
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:30,090
I sit and watch all the time.
In fact, that's mostly all I do.

539
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:33,290
I guess you've been
in three-way situations before.

540
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:35,483
-I mean, who hasn't?
-Yeah.

541
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:38,887
Fuck.

542
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:45,052
I've never seen you this angry before.
It's terrific!

543
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,522
-No, my nephew made that.
-Sorry.

544
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,205
Here, talk to me.

545
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:53,482
This girl cheated on the SATs,
and now she's gonna get away with it.

546
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,403
Okay, what's this girl's name?

547
00:40:57,173 --> 00:41:00,961
When I realized what was going on,
I just wanted to run and not take the test.

548
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:04,568
But I did. I took it, like an idiot.
And what was the point?

549
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:06,609
It's all just some stupid game.

550
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:09,082
I don't know what I want,
but I don't want this.

551
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,891
And this is your excuse to bail?

552
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:13,533
Bail? What's that?
Some hip lingo you think kids say?

553
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:17,447
-You are so lame sometimes.
-Direct your anger at me, if you need to.

554
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:21,924
By the way, you can fuck Parker McKenna,
but if I were you, I'd wear a condom...

555
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,573
because I'm sure she has hepatitis,
at the very least.

556
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:26,769
What are you talking about?

557
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,961
If you're referring to the conversation
I had with Parker, that's all it was.

558
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,372
A conversation.

559
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:36,446
I have conversations with lots
of young women. They approach me.

560
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:40,448
Claire, I'm worried about you.

561
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,282
Why?

562
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:45,012
You're getting your life together,
and it scares you.

563
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:48,881
So you want to slip into the old habit
of focusing on someone else's drama...

564
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,727
instead of concentrating on yourself.
You need to stop doing that.

565
00:41:57,853 --> 00:41:59,286
You're right.

566
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:09,362
And now is probably as good a time as any
to talk about the sexual tension between us.

567
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,490
-What?
-It exists.

568
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,692
It's a part of transference
and counter-transference...

569
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:19,448
so we should acknowledge it's out there,
and it'll never be acted upon...

570
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,969
because to do so
would be irresponsible and destructive.

571
00:42:28,093 --> 00:42:31,529
Do you have anything
that you would like to contribute?

572
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:34,201
No, I don't.

573
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:37,682
Okay.

574
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:46,085
I bet you I could glue this together
if I tried hard.

575
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:50,208
I know people
don't really glue things together anymore...

576
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,523
but I could probably fix this.

577
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,529
You've reached the private line
of David Fisher.

578
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:07,968
Please leave a message after the beep.

579
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:12,849
Hi, David. It's Ben. I'm calling to figure out
what time's good for you on Saturday.

580
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:17,524
And I had a really good time last night,
especially the making out part.

581
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:20,927
Okay. Bye.

582
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:30,525
Yeah, honey.

583
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,373
You know exactly how I like it.

584
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,211
Come on. Move your tongue around it.

585
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,646
Yeah.

586
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,528
And I am telling you

587
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:35,361
I'm not going

588
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:40,167
I'm the best man you'll ever know

589
00:44:40,653 --> 00:44:44,362
There's no way I could ever go

590
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:46,603
Nate, I love you!

591
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:04,052
Now that I've heard this song five times
in a row, I can honestly say I like it.

592
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,124
I'm here for the service.

593
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:09,965
Look around, nobody's here.
There's not gonna be any service.

594
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:12,567
I couldn't even get a minister,
and they get paid.

595
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:16,692
I've taken care of that.
Father Jack is on his way here right now.

596
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:19,241
-Just give me 10 minutes.
-For what?

597
00:45:23,773 --> 00:45:26,333
-Federico?
-Yes, Mrs. F?

598
00:45:26,973 --> 00:45:29,282
Could you come upstairs, please?

599
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:36,202
Keith?

600
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:42,684
David, I need you for a few minutes.

601
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,162
-Mom, I have a headache.
-Too bad.

602
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:51,012
-But I'm in the middle of a show.
-Just do what I say!

603
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,527
And get out of those ragamuffin clothes.

604
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:02,690
Why is this happening?

605
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,971
I don't know.
Our structures probably need new fencing.

606
00:46:06,053 --> 00:46:10,012
-And our roofs had bad shingles.
-I had shingles once.

607
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,806
She was supposed to have an open casket.

608
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,927
I did the best I could, okay?

609
00:46:20,013 --> 00:46:22,891
I didn't see you down there helping me out.

610
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,127
Leave it alone.

611
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:35,810
We gather to mourn
the passing of Emily Previn.

612
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,563
I did not know Emily Previn.

613
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:41,531
From what I gather, few, if any, people did.

614
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:46,527
People might wonder what point there is
in leading a life...

615
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,968
where you don't touch any other lives.

616
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:52,325
But it would be arrogant of us
to assume that.

617
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:57,692
Every life is a contribution.
We just may not see how.

618
00:46:58,973 --> 00:47:02,932
I'm glad to encounter Emily Previn,
even if it is in death.

619
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,763
Everyone comes into our life for a reason...

620
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:10,892
and it is our responsibility to learn
what they have to teach us.

621
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:17,127
Now, in accordance with Emily's wishes...

622
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:20,171
I will read
from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.

623
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:22,972
Strange, but somehow I feel like Emily won.

624
00:47:23,413 --> 00:47:26,689
She remains a fucking question mark
right up to the bitter end.

625
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:31,608
Basically all I know about her is that
she kept Wheat Thins in her refrigerator.

626
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,248
That's something.

627
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,291
So, tell your mother
I have to get back to work.

628
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:39,245
Unlike some people.

629
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:44,369
I'm sorry, Federico, but I have a headache.
Am I not allowed to have a headache?

630
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,882
-It's so good to see you.
-Hello, Father.

631
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:56,007
How is everything at St. Stephen's?

632
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,882
It's okay.

633
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:05,087
Apropos of what I said earlier,
I wanted to thank you, David.

634
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,243
I'm really glad you came into my life.

635
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:11,450
You will never know
how much you taught me about myself.

636
00:48:12,053 --> 00:48:14,283
Really? How so?

637
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,245
Another time, maybe.

638
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:20,771
-You look a little sad.
-I have a headache.

639
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:24,645
Well, God bless.

640
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,805
David, come over here. There's something
I want to say to the three of you.

641
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:37,052
Oh, Lord, our gutters are clogged. I think
we need to see about removing the leaves.

642
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:38,851
That's very funny, Claire.

643
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:41,289
I know you think The Plan is ridiculous.

644
00:48:41,373 --> 00:48:44,092
-No, we don't.
-We just think it's weird.

645
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:48,366
Did any one of you wonder why I felt
the need to change the structure of my life?

646
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:50,125
Did you even care?

647
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:56,168
At first I didn't understand
why I was so upset about Emily Previn.

648
00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:59,450
Then it hit me. I don't want to turn into her.

649
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:02,765
Life is hard enough
without not having people to help you.

650
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:05,447
-But, Mom, you have us.
-I do not.

651
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:09,688
Nate, you've been walking around
like a zombie for months.

652
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,327
You're lying in bed during the day,
God knows why.

653
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:14,051
I have a headache.

654
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:16,562
Claire, I can't even look in your direction...

655
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,690
without you acting like
it's some incredible imposition.

656
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:24,130
All I want is for us not to be strangers.
I want some intimacy.

657
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:26,885
Give me intimacy.

658
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:31,045
Won't any of you have intimacy with me?

659
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:39,170
Okay, I guess I have my answer.

660
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:41,128
Mom, wait.

661
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:45,445
I just think that intimacy should happen
a little more organically than this.

662
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:48,923
Fine. Then I'll simply wait for it
like I have been.

663
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:53,892
I just pray that it happens
before I end up like Emily Previn.

664
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:57,082
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

665
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:09,882
When I saw you typing at your computer,
you had the strangest expression.

666
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:12,847
I was writing. It's called flow.

667
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:16,043
You know all about flow, don't you?

668
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,369
Let me ask you a question.

669
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:25,528
Do you think you and I have
as much intimacy as you want?

670
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:31,892
I don't have as much of anything as I want.

671
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,289
That's not really much of an answer.

672
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:38,206
It wasn't really much of a question.

673
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:43,008
Did you remember to lock the door?

674
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:46,608
Yes, I did, for the second time.
You've been acting strange tonight.

675
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:49,765
-What do you mean?
-Well, you've been all jumpy.

676
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,008
Oh, God.

677
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:03,653
Okay, something has been on my mind.

678
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,606
Nate Fisher...

679
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:25,844
would you be my wife?

680
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,087
My God, this isn't what I was expecting.

681
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:33,847
-Is that a no?
-No, of course not.

682
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:41,126
It is kind of an ugly ring.
It's got these Greek letters on it.

683
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:45,283
Delta Phi Delta.
It's my grandfather's fraternity ring.

684
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:47,887
I found it when I was cleaning up...

685
00:51:49,213 --> 00:51:51,602
and that's when I got the idea...

686
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:54,365
to propose to you.

687
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:00,286
So why today?

688
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:02,652
I don't know.

689
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:06,603
I just started thinking...

690
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:11,330
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

691
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:16,003
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:18,601
Promise?

693
00:52:30,253 --> 00:52:33,165
Of course I'll marry you.
I love you. Absolutely.

694
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,683
I love you. Yeah, let's get married!

695
00:52:35,773 --> 00:52:38,685
Yes! Let's get married!

696
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:40,001
Come on!

697
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:44,445
I love you, too.

698
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,086
