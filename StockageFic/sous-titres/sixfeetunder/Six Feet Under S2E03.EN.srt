1
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:51,082
Okay, let's go then.

2
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,211
Are you packed?

3
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:57,251
Don't forget the dog, honey.

4
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,203
Don't forget the dog, honey.

5
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,290
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,048
He's not in the car, is he?

7
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:19,445
-Why is he talking about a dog? What dog?
-We had a dog in Boulder.

8
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:30,092
-What is this?
-We're in the hospital.

9
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,924
You're sick, remember?

10
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,328
But you're gonna be just fine.

11
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:38,132
Rita, lying to him
doesn't help anybody but you.

12
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:44,927
Stop it.

13
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,522
-Nurse!
-It's okay to let go.

14
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,164
I'm going to beat it.

15
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,806
But maybe you can't. You don't have to.

16
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,644
Why would you say that?

17
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,688
I don't want you to be scared.

18
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,730
I don't want to die.

19
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:12,931
I'm not gonna die.

20
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,253
That's just your body. It's not you.

21
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:20,644
That's bullshit, Eileen.

22
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,452
Excuse me.

23
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,402
Here you go.

24
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:31,202
We're going to increase your morphine,
all right, Mr. Piper?

25
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,052
Do you see?

26
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:52,011
Rita, above his head.

27
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,332
The light.

28
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,849
Oh, yes, he's a good boy.

29
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,411
Better hurry up.
We've got Mrs. Piper at 8:30.

30
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,529
Yeah, I'll be right there.

31
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,003
What are you doing, Dave?
Downloading pics from mansluts. com?

32
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:39,650
Great, Dave, thanks.

33
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,724
I thought we should have
all the information.

34
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:44,327
-I have all the information.
-I don't think you do.

35
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:45,687
If you don't get this treated...

36
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,686
you could have seizures with
muscular twitching, loss of verbal skills.

37
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:52,492
You could even have
some kind of hemorrhage at some point.

38
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:56,282
Or I could be in the wrong airplane
at some point, or so could you.

39
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,011
All right? Come on.

40
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,441
The Parliament. It's very elegant.

41
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,805
Yes. I like it.

42
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,283
But Michael thinks it's tacky.

43
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,248
That's the Cleveland.
It's a more affordable choice.

44
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,450
But, as you can see,
it's not quite as gracious.

45
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:36,129
Really? No, but it's just so self-effacing.

46
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,607
But why?

47
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,212
-Mrs. Piper?
-I'm sorry.

48
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:46,889
Can you excuse me for a moment?
I can't carry on two conversations at once.

49
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,372
It's exactly like that horrible IKEA couch
your mother bought us.

50
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,808
Michael claims to love this one.

51
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:02,564
In my opinion, he's trying to do
what he thinks his mother wants...

52
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,689
which is typical, really.

53
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,203
Fine, deny it. Why change now?

54
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:11,604
Would you like to sit down for a minute?

55
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,253
I'm fine. It's just Michael's here.

56
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:17,491
He didn't want to deal with this stuff
when he was alive.

57
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,404
You know, the funeral.

58
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:21,689
Now he's very opinionated.

59
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:27,328
I'm a psychic, so, you know....

60
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:31,092
That must be very interesting for you.

61
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,564
It's just more information.

62
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,401
This room has a lot of pain in it.

63
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,126
Well, yes.

64
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:52,171
You have a lot in your mind.
On your mind, I mean. Don't you?

65
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,170
Yeah, I guess so.

66
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,562
Don't worry. It's okay, all right?

67
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,051
It's all gonna be okay.

68
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,041
Thanks.

69
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,608
Okay, honey, if it's what you want.
It's your funeral.

70
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,483
Look, she gave me her card.

71
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,770
"Spiritual Consultation
and Past Life Regression"?

72
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,571
For God's sake, who does this?

73
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,726
Who spends $100 to be told
they were once Eleanor of Aquitaine?

74
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,528
Or whoever, the Marquis de Sade.

75
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,732
So what do you think happens
after we die? Heaven?

76
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,292
-Or Hell.
-Really?

77
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:51,410
But with angels, devils, or brimstone,
or whatever?

78
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,688
I don't know what it looks like,
or who's there...

79
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,368
but I do believe there are consequences
for the way we live our lives.

80
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:05,932
You know,
sometimes I kind of feel like Dad's around.

81
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,606
Do you ever?

82
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,402
Nope.

83
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:21,209
You know we have the Independent
Funeral Directors' lunch today, right?

84
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,045
Why do I have to go? That's your thing.

85
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:26,842
It's your thing, too, now. These are
your colleagues. You need to know them.

86
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,925
I know who they are. I met them in Vegas.
They're freaks.

87
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:33,642
-They're not freaks.
-Nobody likes the Brazil nuts, David.

88
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,212
Not the local guys.

89
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:39,763
I'm sure the LA morticians
are a lot more fun than those from Montana.

90
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,811
You're an LA mortician now, Nate.
This is your community.

91
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:46,687
It's polite for the first person downstairs
to make the coffee.

92
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,411
Even if that person has a penis.

93
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,405
It's also polite for the first person
who uses the bathroom...

94
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:55,406
to spend less than 45 minutes in there.
Even if that person has a vulva.

95
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:00,170
-Oh, goodness, everyone's here.
-With all their genitalia.

96
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,051
-Excuse me?
-Mom, would you like some toast?

97
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,284
No, thanks.
I have to be in the Valley by 10:30.

98
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,523
-What's in the Valley?
-I'm going to a seminar.

99
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:12,128
-What seminar?
-Something Robbie invited me to. The Plan.

100
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,248
Isn't that a cult?

101
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,325
No, it's one of those
self-actualization things from the '70s...

102
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:19,530
where they yell for 12 hours
and don't let you go to the bathroom.

103
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,252
Oh, no. Really?
Should I bring some kind of jar?

104
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,530
-A jar?
-I suppose that's not much of a solution.

105
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:31,445
You're on your own for dinner.
I won't be back until after midnight.

106
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,643
The thought of Mom being self-actualized
is kind of making me nauseous.

107
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,884
You sure it's not the thought
of Mom pissing into a jar?

108
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,445
So, Tahira,
why can't you forgive your father?

109
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,211
When I was 16...

110
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,645
he had a dream
that I had given myself to a man...

111
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,850
who was not the husband
I had been promised to.

112
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,693
For that, he set me on fire.

113
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:59,003
I was able to save myself.

114
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:03,328
But I had to leave the country
so he would not kill me.

115
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,206
And always...

116
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,489
I will have the scars from this.

117
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:14,167
That's horrible. Truly horrible.

118
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,406
How could he do this to me?

119
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,690
But as long as you hold on to that anger
toward your father...

120
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:21,525
you will be on fire.

121
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:26,969
You may have left the country,
but you are still living in the same house.

122
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,763
And in that house,
there is a room that is still burning.

123
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:32,684
Who lives in this room?

124
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:38,207
-I do?
-Your father is still living in this room.

125
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:43,041
So you never invite anyone in,
and you go through life alone.

126
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,729
You must open that door.
Put out the flames.

127
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,890
You must invite your father
to come visit you.

128
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:55,131
-But he won't even speak to me.
-That is your old blueprint.

129
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,810
That is what you want to believe...

130
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:02,205
because you are too afraid
to tear down the walls and rebuild.

131
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,612
Come on.

132
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:05,206
Stop blaming the victim.

133
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:08,444
All right, who here thinks I'm being unfair?

134
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,766
Be honest.

135
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,481
Ruth, do you agree?
Until Tahira forgives her father...

136
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:26,771
she will never feel safe in her home.

137
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,363
-Well, maybe, but...
-Speak up.

138
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:32,771
We all paid to hear you.

139
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,805
Why don't you stand?

140
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,372
Her father did such a terrible thing.

141
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:44,652
I don't see why she has to have him
as a houseguest.

142
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:48,009
If you don't agree with me,
why didn't you raise your hand?

143
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:50,561
I was just trying to understand your point.

144
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,247
Or do you think
that your opinion doesn't matter?

145
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,052
That perhaps you are just a guest here?

146
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,567
Are you a guest in your own house, Ruth?

147
00:11:58,653 --> 00:11:59,722
I don't think so.

148
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:04,489
Yes, she tiptoes around herself
like she's afraid of waking someone up.

149
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:07,161
The only person sleeping
in your house is you.

150
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:10,484
-I do have three children.
-See? She's not even listening.

151
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,087
Ruth, you have to get out of bed...

152
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:16,770
open the windows,
and let some light into your house...

153
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:19,845
so that you can see the way things are.

154
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,768
Then, and only then...

155
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,806
can you begin renovating your life.

156
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,484
So, Tahira, are you ready to renovate?

157
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:33,165
Yes, I think so.

158
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,525
So, when you call your father,
what will you say first?

159
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,207
Hello?

160
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:41,409
Sorry, my beaker exploded.

161
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,212
That's okay. Catch your breath.

162
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,891
How's it going?

163
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:55,081
I have hydrochloric acid in my hair,
but other than that, I'm fine.

164
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,367
Really?

165
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,643
No, but I'm incredibly bored
with myself right now.

166
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:06,529
Let's talk about you.
How's your girlfriend? What's her name?

167
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,729
Jenny. Fine, thanks.

168
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:10,761
How's it going with Gabriel?

169
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:14,163
I have no idea.
I haven't even talked to him in two weeks.

170
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,646
Is that her?

171
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:24,411
-What does she do?
-She's a jewelry designer.

172
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,404
Really? Does she have a store?

173
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:30,088
No, she has clients and she caters.

174
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,122
But we're not here to talk about Jenny.

175
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:41,326
It might help to tell me
what you're going through right now.

176
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:44,770
It's no big fucking mystery. I mean, it sucks.

177
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:51,403
It sucks to be pretty much in love
with a guy who's too fucked-up for life.

178
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,086
-What happened?
-Nothing really. Just....

179
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,652
Whatever.

180
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,286
It's not even his fault.

181
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:03,082
And it fucking pisses me off.
His whole family thing is so fucking unfair.

182
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:06,927
And I really just thought he needed....
I don't know.

183
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,652
-You?
-No.

184
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,690
But someone, maybe.

185
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:15,525
Some person on the planet who gives a fuck
about him, for once in his life.

186
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,251
Yeah, I did think that would matter.

187
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,723
It does matter.
No one can ever solve someone else's life.

188
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,926
So, basically, your job is totally pointless?

189
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,045
No one but a guidance counselor, I mean.

190
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:34,682
There they are.

191
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,241
That's the community?
I thought this was an event.

192
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,812
It's an event.

193
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,841
-Didn't I meet one of those guys in Vegas?
-Bobo from Peaceful Haven.

194
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,731
-Right. He spits.
-Yes, he does.

195
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:53,888
Stan, Jack, Bobo. This is my brother, Nate.

196
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,126
-Nice to see you, Nate.
-Nice to meet you, Jack.

197
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,804
Good seeing you, Bobo.

198
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,204
Congratulations.

199
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:05,729
We heard you just got your license
to operate a moving funeral.

200
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:07,932
Yep, finally went pro.

201
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,526
-Well, sit.
-No, go ahead.

202
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:12,411
-No, after you. Age before beauty.
-Right.

203
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:16,369
David tells us that you are very gifted.

204
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,007
He does?

205
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,290
We were just giving Stan grief...

206
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,331
for poaching our customers
with false advertising.

207
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,528
That sounds like something
Kroehner would do.

208
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,162
Fucking Kroehner. Those cocksuckers.

209
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,249
Sorry. Those cunts.

210
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,250
So this family goes off the 405.
We get five bodies, right?

211
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,527
In truth, my walk-in only holds three.

212
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,366
So my guy is working overtime
to get everyone juiced.

213
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:49,287
But sometimes you have to leave them out
for an hour or two beyond regulation.

214
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:52,490
It happens, right?
But those Kroehner fucks...

215
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:57,532
are just waiting for a chance to send in
their flacky at the DCA, and boom!

216
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,491
I get hit with a giant fine and a lawsuit.

217
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,522
I will ram a plastic screw up my anus...

218
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,650
before I give in to those fucks. No offense.

219
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:14,484
-Do we have a waitress?
-Yeah, she'll be back with the fries.

220
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:16,252
Those fucks.

221
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,890
They are fucks. They're fucking evil fucks.

222
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,043
They're sucking up all the mom-and-pops.

223
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,727
Businesses that people
spent their lives building up...

224
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,883
They don't care about people and lives.

225
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:29,203
All right, we appreciate your passion, but...

226
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:33,650
No, all they care about is money.
It's not just our industry. It's everywhere.

227
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,531
When corporations try and squeeze out
all the competitors...

228
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:40,401
the further management gets from labor,
the more alienation in the workplace...

229
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:43,451
-the more meaningless all our lives become.
-Fuck, yeah!

230
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,331
-It's hopeless, isn't it?
-No, I don't think it is.

231
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:49,405
We have to stick together
and save our energy to fight Kroehner.

232
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,883
-You know, Stan?
-Yes. I love this guy. Terrific!

233
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:01,207
I don't know, Gary. Twice in one day?

234
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:04,930
Claire, this is Detective Reese.

235
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,724
Why don't you sit down, Claire?

236
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,928
Any idea where Gabriel Dimas is?

237
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,771
-Why would I?
-He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

238
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,005
Yeah, so I know where he is
every second of the day?

239
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,403
You have noticed that he hasn't been
in school for the last two weeks?

240
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:28,882
Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

241
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,481
I don't.

242
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:35,086
Did you know that he held up
a convenience store with a gun?

243
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,210
-No.
-Did you give or sell him embalming fluid?

244
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,602
No. My God.

245
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:47,331
-So how do you think he got it?
-I don't know. The Internet?

246
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,605
-Don't they have catalogs for that stuff?
-Maybe.

247
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,122
Be a lot easier to get it from you,
don't you think?

248
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:58,246
No, because I would never
do anything like that.

249
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:01,726
I don't even know
where they keep that stuff.

250
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:15,202
So it's between Ethics of Evolution
and Biogenetics, I think.

251
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,881
-Biogenetics? Really?
-What?

252
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,524
Yawn, kind of, right?

253
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:26,325
Biogenetics might sound dull to you,
but it's actually very smutty.

254
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:30,887
It's all about sperm competition
and cryptic ovulation.

255
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:34,211
Oh, yeah? What else you taking?

256
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:38,402
-I'm only doing one class.
-I thought you were going back to school.

257
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:43,282
I said I was gonna take a class.
I still have to work, you know.

258
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:47,128
Fuck, if it's only one class,
why not pick something interesting?

259
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,529
How about this religious studies class?

260
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:51,763
"Cross-Cultural Perspectives
on the Afterlife. "

261
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:52,968
Yawn.

262
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:56,171
-It's not boring. It's spiritual.
-Double yawn.

263
00:18:56,893 --> 00:19:00,772
Why don't you sign up for that
and we can meet in the quad for lunch?

264
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,970
That would be so fun.

265
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,607
We could make out in the stacks...

266
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,163
sneak into the pool at night
and go skinny-dipping on acid.

267
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,892
Sounds like you did a lot of work at college.

268
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:15,283
I was only in school for two years,
but I learned a few things.

269
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:18,604
About breaking into school property
while tripping?

270
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,649
That'll help you in life.

271
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:29,122
What?

272
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,446
Come on, Bren.

273
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:38,202
-I was just in the middle of something.
-Look, it's been a while.

274
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,772
It's not that long.

275
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,443
It's been three-and-a-half weeks,
and on Tuesday it'll be four weeks.

276
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,603
Not that you're counting.

277
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,170
Yeah, I'm counting.
I mean, have you not even noticed?

278
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:53,162
It's normal, after a certain point,
for sex to slow down.

279
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,888
Yeah, slow down, okay. But stop?

280
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:59,089
People can go months after a certain point.

281
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:03,325
After a certain point, okay.
Like, six years, maybe. But six months?

282
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:06,041
-Seven.
-Not that you're counting.

283
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:11,532
You've never been with anybody
long enough to know this...

284
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:14,969
but there is a certain ebb and flow
that happens.

285
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,523
-Not for everybody.
-It does.

286
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,965
There will be times
when you are not attracted to me at all.

287
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,284
It's just a normal ebb.

288
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:29,128
How long does a normal ebb last?

289
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:33,650
I don't know, but that's the kind of question
that prolongs the standard ebb.

290
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,769
Did you hear about the guy
at the nuthouse that walked around naked...

291
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,081
except for a hat and gloves?

292
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:48,970
And this nurse came up to him and said. :

293
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,009
"What do you want?
You can't walk around.... "

294
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,128
Mom?

295
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,689
And the guy says, "It's okay.
Nobody comes around here, anyway. "

296
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:59,846
And the nurse says, "Well, what do you
have on the hat and gloves for?"

297
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,843
-It's so late. I was kind of worried.
-It goes until midnight.

298
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,126
Was it fun?

299
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,971
It was horrible.

300
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:12,924
-So you're not going back?
-No, I'm going back.

301
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,610
-Why?
-I don't know. I don't want to be rude.

302
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:20,813
They don't care about that.
They already got your money.

303
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,804
Well, there's that, too.

304
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:30,292
-Don't you get bored around here?
-Well, sometimes.

305
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,401
Do you want some tea or something?

306
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,563
All right, what did you break?

307
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:43,483
Nothing. I was just being nice. God!

308
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,686
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:52,005
I was imposing my old blueprint on you.

310
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,286
Excuse me?

311
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:59,132
In the old blueprint of my old house...

312
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,245
you're only nice to me
when you've done something bad...

313
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,449
or when you want something.

314
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,126
-That makes me feel like shit.
-I'm sorry.

315
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,726
But it really does seem that way to me.

316
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,163
I should go do my homework.

317
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:25,884
They give you homework?

318
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,491
I have to write a letter to my dead mother...

319
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:33,009
and forgive her
for all the terrible things she did to me.

320
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,691
That sounds fun.

321
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,486
And then I have to write
a private letter to myself...

322
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,326
outlining how I want to renovate my life.

323
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,485
Good night, dear.

324
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,972
Good night.

325
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,851
The shovel's in the truck!

326
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,286
-That's good.
-Rico, you forget something there?

327
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:23,168
Shit.

328
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,569
Sorry, man.
I got about two hours of sleep last night.

329
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:31,606
-Augusto?
-No, Angie, Vanessa's sister.

330
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:33,452
She walks out on her boyfriend...

331
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,366
and comes over to wail
in our living room all night long.

332
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:38,683
-Women.
-Yeah, I'm telling you, man.

333
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:43,051
And she shows up with this suitcase,
like she's got some right now that....

334
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:47,562
She has fancy Hollywood friends
who flash their money around all the time.

335
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:51,043
I'm like, "What, you can't go
somewhere there's a guest room?"

336
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:55,452
Rico, I'm really sorry about that loan.

337
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,522
It's just a really tight budget.

338
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:03,245
That's okay. We got the house.
Something else came through.

339
00:24:03,413 --> 00:24:06,485
-That's great.
-Yep, the escrow closes next month.

340
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,610
That is super, man.

341
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:14,163
You and Vanessa
have been together, what...

342
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,167
five years now?

343
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:19,609
Married five, together eight.
Man, can you believe that shit?

344
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:26,092
Okay, so this is sort of a personal question.
You don't have to answer...

345
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,122
but do you guys still, you know...

346
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,404
pretty much have sex?

347
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:42,206
We've got two kids now,
so it slows down a bit.

348
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:43,688
Right.

349
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,052
How slow?

350
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:52,772
Right after the baby, Vanessa's got
all the wrong hormones and stuff.

351
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:57,885
So now, maybe three or four times a week.

352
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,804
-That's too bad, man.
-Yeah, that sucks.

353
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,043
It's not like the first two years.

354
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:15,206
-Yeah, you better enjoy it while you got it.
-No kidding, right?

355
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,448
This moron always goes over.

356
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,762
I should go in and correct his selfish ass.

357
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:27,321
Let them finish their game.
We go over sometimes.

358
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:43,324
-So how's Eddie?
-He's good. Things are good, I guess.

359
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,486
Keith, what's going on?

360
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,810
I think my sister's
fucking using that shit again.

361
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:04,084
My mom's come up from San Diego to watch
over her, like that's gonna fix anything.

362
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,932
According to her,
everything is just fine now.

363
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,368
I'm the one that's overreacting.

364
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,487
I don't think you're overreacting.

365
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:16,607
Thanks.

366
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,806
-Eddie hates racquetball.
-Really? Why?

367
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,324
Poor depth perception.

368
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:33,004
Can't play pool, either.

369
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:36,532
That's too bad.

370
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,846
Let's not beat around the bush, shall we?

371
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:52,564
Biology has a long history of being abused
as an ideological instrument...

372
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,170
to justify social inequities
and amoral behavior.

373
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,608
For those of you
who have not yet read my book...

374
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,411
the central argument I posit...

375
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,849
in Genes Out of the Bottle. :
Evolution in Biotechnology...

376
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:07,289
is that genetic engineering is,
in and of itself...

377
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:12,003
the most effective argument
against biological determinism. Why?

378
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:15,482
The thesis that you present so brilliantly...

379
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:18,326
is that though biology manifests
in behavior...

380
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:22,884
as we can see in the instinct of human
males to seek a variety of sexual partners...

381
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:26,409
the fact that we have
the technology to modify genetics...

382
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:29,405
confirms the supremacy of culture
over biology.

383
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:31,563
Excellent. Other thoughts?

384
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:34,766
I have a question.

385
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,732
Isn't natural selection still operating
though, since members of the species...

386
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:43,170
who have access to genetic technologies
are more likely to survive and procreate?

387
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:48,411
That kind of reasoning leads us
into a very questionable ethical terrain.

388
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,610
-Other comments?
-What kind of reasoning? Scientific?

389
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:55,527
You can call it scientific, but
as I discussed at great length in Chapter 2...

390
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:59,492
your argument is a political assertion
that privilege is biologically determined.

391
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:01,165
I haven't actually read your book...

392
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:04,245
but you can't tell me
that survival isn't easier for people...

393
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,405
who are born with a private chef
and health insurance.

394
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:11,202
Maybe you should read the book
before commenting on its thesis.

395
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,086
Other comments?

396
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,563
-Yes?
-Excuse me, I'm sorry.

397
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:21,409
Are we not allowed to disagree with you?
I'm just asking because I'm new in the class.

398
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,803
We certainly don't interrupt our classmates.
Go ahead.

399
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:30,892
In your discussion of bisexual
genital rubbing among pygmy chimps...

400
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:33,203
you note the exchange of sex for meat.

401
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:37,766
I was wondering how this might pertain
to contemporary human behavior.

402
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:39,081
Any theories?

403
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,368
So, where do you think he is now?

404
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,532
According to his wife, he's still here.

405
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:58,604
There's a big chunk of dead meat
in a cheapo box that's still here.

406
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:02,806
But do you really believe that's him?
The essence of who he was?

407
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:06,569
The part of him that hoped and dreamed,
and all that other crap?

408
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:10,926
You tell me. You're the one
who has all the answers now.

409
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:12,287
I never said that.

410
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:16,525
You'd think getting hammered by a bus
would make you a little less of a dick.

411
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:20,847
Sure, it's possible that we go on
after we die.

412
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:27,007
It's also possible that,
once the light goes out, it stays out.

413
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,212
You'll never know, buddy boy,
till it's your turn.

414
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,443
See, that's what you were hanging onto.

415
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,286
Excuse me?

416
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,805
-Michael.
-Is he here?

417
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:40,323
He's been with me the whole time.

418
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,890
-You think he'll stay with you?
-Not like this.

419
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:47,768
He's just helping me get used to it.

420
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:55,728
I hope you don't mind, but do you
get a sense of my father at all around here?

421
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,564
No. I'm sorry.

422
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:15,931
That doesn't mean he's not here.
This room is packed.

423
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,969
I can't get to everyone.

424
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,283
I think everything is ready.

425
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:26,443
-I do see a child coming into your life.
-No.

426
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:30,170
-Well, it might be you.
-I seriously doubt that.

427
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,289
I'm not sure which one of you I'm reading...

428
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,286
but I'm quite sure
there's gonna be a child here very soon.

429
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,124
I'm heading out now, okay?

430
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:45,525
This is Federico Diaz, our embalmer,
and his baby, Augusto.

431
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,012
This is Mrs. Piper.

432
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:51,163
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

433
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:55,162
-You made his body look very nice.
-Thank you.

434
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,087
Actually, his body gave me
a lot to work with.

435
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,209
Hardly any decay for a cancer death...

436
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:04,571
-Okay, Rico, see you tomorrow.
-Okay. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

437
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,932
Here we go.

438
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:22,045
Eileen asked that I close with a reading
from Michael's favorite poet, Walt Whitman.

439
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:28,204
"What do you think
has become of the young and old men?

440
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:31,644
"And what do you think
has become of the women and children?

441
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,606
"They are alive and well somewhere

442
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,246
"The smallest sprout shows
there is really no death

443
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,281
"And if ever there was, it led forward life

444
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:43,887
"and does not wait at the end to arrest it

445
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:46,407
"And ceas'd the moment life appear'd

446
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:50,651
"All goes onward and outward
nothing collapses

447
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:54,362
"And to die is different
from what any one supposed

448
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:56,652
"and luckier"

449
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,652
Let us pray.

450
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:07,363
O Lord, bless the departed soul
of our brother, friend, and son, Michael....

451
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:10,366
I'm just hanging around
to help you get used to it.

452
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,812
I am used to it, Dad. It's been six months.

453
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,527
Seven. Not that you're counting.

454
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:22,083
God is strength. In him, I will trust.

455
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:24,921
Amen.

456
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:40,093
-Are you done?
-Pretty much. What's up?

457
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:43,042
-I wanted to ask you something.
-Okay.

458
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,886
Get this. Bobo sold to Kroehner.

459
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:49,329
-Bobo sold? My Bobo?
-Your Bobo.

460
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,171
I can't believe this. He was so committed.

461
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,967
Think he's got a plastic screw
in his anus about now?

462
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:00,250
-I hope so.
-That old son of a bitch. I'm gonna call him.

463
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:06,571
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

464
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:14,404
-Where's Karla?
-She's just working late.

465
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,883
-Why are you fronting?
-Go to your room now, Taylor.

466
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:20,767
Mama hasn't been home since Tuesday.

467
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,925
-What?
-Now.

468
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:26,729
-But my stomach hurts.
-I'll get you some Pepto-Bismol.

469
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:30,886
-I don't want none of that nasty shit.
-Then go on.

470
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:34,611
Shit, bitch, I gotta get my goods.

471
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,003
Don't talk to your grandmother like that.

472
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,452
Is she sick?

473
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:45,650
She says that every night.
She just wants the attention.

474
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,691
Can you blame her? Her mother's off,
doing God knows whatever.

475
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:51,924
Karla's fine. She just had to go out of town.

476
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,652
-You talked to her?
-I wasn't in when she called.

477
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,850
But she left several messages.
Besides, I'm here with Taylor.

478
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:01,164
Don't blow this out of proportion
like you always do.

479
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:04,286
Hey, Mama, I'm not coming home tonight.

480
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,284
Derek needs some papers, and I gotta go....

481
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:09,803
-Can't she send him his papers?
-You remember how Derek was.

482
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:12,202
Always getting her
to do this and that for him.

483
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:15,683
Yeah, like raise his kid
without a dime from him.

484
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:17,923
Sorry, I dropped the phone. Shut up!

485
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:21,483
Anyway, I'll call you as soon as I can, okay?

486
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,491
Give Taylor kisses for me.

487
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:27,327
To get the phone company records,
we'll have to file a missing persons report.

488
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,803
Keith, why must you always
think the worst of her?

489
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,168
Let's just wait till she gets home.

490
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,209
-We don't even know...
-What are you gonna do?

491
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,488
Move up here
and take care of her all your life?

492
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:39,564
She has a child! Jesus, she needs help.

493
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:44,169
-You covering up for her is not what I mean.
-Who do you think you're talking to?

494
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:45,811
I am your mother...

495
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:49,932
and you will respect that
or I will smack the black right off of you.

496
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,607
Hi, there.

497
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:07,842
Hi.

498
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:10,807
Hard day?

499
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,205
How can you tell?

500
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,885
I'm good at people.

501
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,370
-Are you?
-Gotta be. Tax law.

502
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:29,803
I'm Scott. Scott Axelrod.

503
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,091
Candace Bouvard.

504
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:35,445
Nice to meet you, Candace.
Are you an actress?

505
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:40,522
No.

506
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:46,445
-I teach sign language to the newly deaf.
-Really?

507
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,086
-How noble.
-No, it's very lucrative.

508
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:00,563
And I really enjoy
communicating with my body.

509
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,092
I get that.

510
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:15,605
You know what? My friend is here,
but it's been great getting to know you.

511
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:19,368
I would love to take you to dinner sometime.
Can I give you my card?

512
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:20,932
You sure can.

513
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,292
How was school?

514
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:37,769
All right, you have 20 minutes to do
what's most important in your life now.

515
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,852
What did you write to yourself
in your private letter?

516
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,083
Where are you locked out of your own life?

517
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:46,131
If you learn today
that your relationship with your mother...

518
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:49,569
has been blocking the door
to your happiness, then make that repair.

519
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:53,771
Right now. Waiting only gives you
more chances to make excuses.

520
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,125
There are phones in the hall.
See you in 19 minutes.

521
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:02,088
Where can I find a Snickers bar?

522
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:06,288
Can't you think of more productive ways
to use this time?

523
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:08,489
Like what? Taking up smoking?

524
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:11,451
Why not try rebuilding
with someone right now?

525
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:18,649
I read your private letter to yourself.
If you really want closeness in your life...

526
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,008
you're gonna have to start
major renovations.

527
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:23,812
-In fact, I would gut.
-You read my private letter?

528
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:28,125
-Why don't you try calling your kids?
-I don't even know where my kids are.

529
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,091
The last thing they want
is for me to call on a Friday night...

530
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:32,925
so I can put in new flooring.

531
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,808
I've wanted to hear that my whole life, Dad.
Oh, fuck!

532
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:40,010
I love you, too, you sadistic old fuck.

533
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:44,131
Start with Claire.

534
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,928
Only you can be the architect of your life.

535
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,485
I was 12 years old.

536
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,530
This is your mother.

537
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:15,288
Yes, well, I just wanted to tell you that...

538
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:19,928
I feel like even though
I've been trying to be closer to you...

539
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,049
it hasn't really been working.

540
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:26,132
I wish you felt you could confide in me...

541
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:30,201
and maybe you don't
because you feel my opinion is worthless.

542
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:34,204
Because I don't really live in my house...

543
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:39,243
and so I suppose
that's the infrastructure I built.

544
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:42,650
And so I'm sorry.

545
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:46,083
-And?
-And I love you.

546
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:50,165
That's so good. I gotta pee like a racehorse.

547
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,848
You have exceeded the time limit.

548
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:57,528
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press 1 now.

549
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:18,087
Hello?

550
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:21,252
-Claire?
-Where the fuck have you been?

551
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,732
-I'm fucked up.
-Gabe, what is going on?

552
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,410
Everything is all fucked up, Claire!

553
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:32,088
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You just have to calm down right now.

554
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:35,768
Look, I need you to come and get me.

555
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,367
Please.

556
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:43,565
You know the cops
are seriously looking for you?

557
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:47,847
I know that, okay? Why do you think
I need you to come out here and get me?

558
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,446
Where are you?

559
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:52,371
I'm up past Woodland Hills.

560
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:55,327
Academia is one huge circle jerk.

561
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,161
All the sequestered people
desperately defending...

562
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:01,211
the one good idea
they have ever had in their lives.

563
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,563
So, what, that's it for going back to school?

564
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,450
Yep. Next?

565
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:15,162
-How was your day?
-It was weird.

566
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:19,132
Buried that psychic woman's husband,
and she was still talking to the guy.

567
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,124
-That's sad.
-Not for her.

568
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,641
I mean, she really believed he was there,
you know?

569
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:29,772
Well, she has to say that, right?
If she claims she's a psychic.

570
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:31,923
You don't think that that's possible?

571
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,130
What about you saying
that things happen that leave marks...

572
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,523
-in people, in places, in time?
-That's physics.

573
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,083
Energy affecting matter.

574
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:43,883
Talking to dead people is delusional.

575
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:47,602
So you definitely don't believe
in any kind of a life after death?

576
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:51,847
I think people live on
through the people they love...

577
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:54,846
and the things they do with their lives.

578
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,086
If they manage to do things with their lives.

579
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,329
But that's it? That's all there is?

580
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:04,291
There's nothing more?
There's nothing bigger?

581
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:05,528
Just energy.

582
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:09,049
-But there's no plan?
-No, there's definitely no plan.

583
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:14,924
Just survival.

584
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:21,612
-Should I have ordered the salmon?
-I don't know.

585
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:28,127
How can you live like that? What if you
found out you were gonna die tomorrow?

586
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:31,649
I've been prepared to die tomorrow
since I was 6 years old.

587
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:34,202
Really?

588
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:39,122
-Pretty much. We never got butter.
-Why since you were six?

589
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:43,608
Because I read a report on the effect
nuclear war would have on the world...

590
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:48,130
and it was pretty clear to me at that point
that this was definitely gonna happen.

591
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:49,972
When you were six?

592
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:54,206
And I wake up every day
pretty much surprised...

593
00:41:55,853 --> 00:41:57,844
that everything is still here.

594
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,606
I don't understand
how you can live like that.

595
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:03,964
Well, I thought we all did.

596
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:21,610
-Who was that?
-I went to high school with him.

597
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:24,363
He's clearly had a nose job.

598
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:29,285
Close your eyes.

599
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,882
Go on.

600
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,282
And imagine that everyone in this room
thinks you're an idiot.

601
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:39,012
Total fool. Complete moron. Absolute ass.

602
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,726
Feel familiar?

603
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,131
It's how you feel in the world, isn't it?

604
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:48,290
I want you to feel it deeply now.

605
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:52,207
Really feel that everyone in this room
thinks you're an idiot.

606
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:03,090
Close your eyes, Ruth. Feel you're an idiot.

607
00:43:07,453 --> 00:43:10,490
Now tell me when you get the joke.

608
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,242
-Do you get the joke, Ruth?
-No. I'm an idiot.

609
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,769
Who wants to explain the joke to Ruth?

610
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:36,609
So we all feel the same way, right?

611
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:39,969
So who's really the asshole?

612
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,689
-We all are?
-Ruth, stand up.

613
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:50,122
Tell me what you wrote
in your private letter to yourself.

614
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:53,046
It was a private letter. To myself.

615
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,205
Tell me where your house needs repairs.

616
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:59,046
Yeah, and don't bullshit the lady, cupcake.

617
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:02,243
I have a very nice house.

618
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:07,169
I have nice children, and a nice job,
and a nice gentleman friend.

619
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:11,283
Can't anyone just be happy? I'm happy.

620
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,325
Who's buying Ruth's house?

621
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:18,692
We don't believe your house
is structurally sound, Ruth.

622
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:21,492
Who knows better:
me or a room full of complainers?

623
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:24,252
What do you really
want to complain about, really?

624
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:28,531
The fact that the blood stopped circulating
to my rear end four hours ago.

625
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:30,126
Okay, what else?

626
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:32,364
You want me to complain?

627
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,089
All right, then. Fuck this.

628
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,968
Fuck you. Fuck all of you,
with your sniveling self-pity.

629
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,362
And fuck all your lousy parents.

630
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:44,372
Fuck my lousy parents, while we're at it.

631
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:47,684
Fuck my selfish bohemian sister
and her fucking bliss.

632
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:50,606
Fuck my legless grandmother.
Fuck my dead husband...

633
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:53,571
and my lousy children
with their nasty little secrets!

634
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,770
And fuck you, Robbie,
for dragging me to this terrible place...

635
00:44:56,853 --> 00:44:58,764
and not letting me have a Snickers bar!

636
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:01,048
I'm going to get something to eat!

637
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:04,085
Congratulations, Ruth.

638
00:45:04,173 --> 00:45:07,404
You have just leveled your fleabag hovel.

639
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:11,163
Now you can build the house
of your dreams from the ground up.

640
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,403
Yes! Fucking yes!

641
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:15,682
Excellent.

642
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,805
Congratulations.

643
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:46,362
Jesus.

644
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,925
Okay, let's hop.

645
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:54,051
-Hi?
-We should just get going.

646
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:56,248
Okay.

647
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:58,842
But you could tell me
where the fuck you've been...

648
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:00,605
Yeah, like you care.

649
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:02,481
What?

650
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:07,369
Why did I just drive my ass
way the fuck out to nowhere?

651
00:46:07,453 --> 00:46:11,207
Can we just talk about this
while we're driving, okay?

652
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:15,687
Jesus, it's hot as hell in this car.

653
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:34,243
Can you tell me where we're going?

654
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:37,412
Let's just head out to Angela's Crest
or something.

655
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:40,371
Angela's Crest? That's where serial killers
go to dump bodies.

656
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:42,921
You think you can think up
someplace a little creepier?

657
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,446
I don't care where we go.

658
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:47,684
I just want to go somewhere
where we can be alone for a minute...

659
00:46:47,773 --> 00:46:50,412
and we can just talk, you know? Whatever.

660
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:56,402
-Are you fucked-up right now?
-What the fuck do you expect, Claire?

661
00:46:56,853 --> 00:47:00,004
I'm freaked out. Everything's really
fucked-up for me right now.

662
00:47:00,093 --> 00:47:02,163
-So what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

663
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,528
-I'm trying to it figure out.
-What's to figure out?

664
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,127
Claire, just chill out, okay? Jesus.

665
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:13,246
Look, they know you gave Andy the fry,
or whatever the fuck it's called.

666
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,642
They know you robbed that store, Gabe.

667
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,450
You have to turn yourself in.

668
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:23,730
That is a genius fucking plan.

669
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,607
Hey, baby, you like to drink blood?

670
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:31,242
-That's incredibly original.
-Shut the fuck up, scumbag!

671
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,801
Look, you got a corpse in the front seat.

672
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:36,921
-I said, shut the fuck up!
-Oh, God!

673
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:40,447
Go.

674
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,372
Is he all right?

675
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:47,526
It's okay.

676
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,171
Just keep driving.

677
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:00,371
What are you doing?

678
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:04,081
-We have to go back.
-Are you insane?

679
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,403
We have to go back
and make sure that guy is okay.

680
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:09,371
-I didn't hit him, all right?
-How do you know? Are you sure?

681
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,284
I saw. He's fine, all right?

682
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:14,171
Then let's just go back
and make sure that he is all right.

683
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:16,209
I cannot go back there!

684
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:20,883
-God, I am fucked!
-You know this is just making it worse.

685
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,726
Listen to me. I need you
to just help me right now, okay? Please.

686
00:48:27,013 --> 00:48:28,810
I can't help you!

687
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:32,449
I can't help you anymore! I can't.

688
00:48:34,173 --> 00:48:35,891
Let's just keep going, okay?

689
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:38,203
Let's just keep going,
I'll figure out what to do.

690
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,011
I will figure it out.

691
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:42,524
Come on, please.

692
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:44,486
I'm going back.

693
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:46,768
-Claire, don't do that.
-Get off me.

694
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,850
Claire, give me that.

695
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:54,684
Okay, you have to get out now.

696
00:48:55,773 --> 00:48:58,765
-Don't do this to me.
-Get out!

697
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:02,566
-Get out.
-Okay.

698
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,373
I'm just gonna get my bag, all right?

699
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:15,327
Thanks.

700
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:27,801
Oh, my God.

701
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:14,527
So, where do you think I am?

702
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:17,811
Heaven or Hell?

703
00:50:18,453 --> 00:50:20,808
Apparently, you're here at the moment.

704
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:23,331
You think I'm in Hell.

705
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,931
Yeah, sure, I went to church.
That was just for business.

706
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:28,810
I didn't really believe in God.

707
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:32,886
I mean, not as anyone who you had
to please or impress to get promoted.

708
00:50:35,213 --> 00:50:39,286
The only God I know
is a mean-spirited comedian in ugly pants...

709
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,931
whose every joke
has the same damn punch line.

710
00:50:43,013 --> 00:50:46,688
And I'm thinking, that kind of attitude
lands me straight in Hell.

711
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:52,767
On the bright side, that means...

712
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:57,411
you'll have a familiar face waiting for you.

713
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:01,206
Look it up.

714
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:04,721
Leviticus 20:13.

715
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,809
I don't believe that anymore.

716
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:22,683
And I don't think you're in Hell.

717
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:28,403
But you can't quite see me hanging around
with Gandhi and Mother Teresa up there.

718
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:33,285
I miss you, Dad.

719
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,924
I thought you were at Brenda's.

720
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:46,002
She had a late client,
so I thought I'd, you know...

721
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:48,530
-help clean up.
-Thanks.

722
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:52,601
At this hour? That is a late client.

723
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,765
Some of them like her
to put them to bed, you know?

724
00:51:56,653 --> 00:51:58,211
That's very sad.

725
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:02,123
-How long did you go out with that cop?
-About six months.

726
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:08,772
-Sex ever slow down?
-I was hoping you weren't gonna go there.

727
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,171
I'm sorry. Forget it.

728
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:17,125
-David, I need some help.
-What happened?

729
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,405
"Fuck my legless grandmother.

730
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:27,565
"And fuck you, Robbie,
for not letting me have the Snickers bar. "

731
00:52:27,653 --> 00:52:29,848
Oh, my goodness, the language.

732
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:36,251
I was so rude.

733
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:39,651
It was fantastic. Quel breakthrough.

734
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:43,325
Robbie, I don't even know how to thank you.

735
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,926
Don't thank me.

736
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,652
Just change.

737
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:53,490
So, what are you gonna do tomorrow
to start the renovations?

738
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:56,041
That's none of your fucking business.

739
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,164
Any idea where he'd go?

740
00:53:24,613 --> 00:53:26,365
What was he wearing?

741
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:33,527
You know,
it's gonna be much easier on him...

742
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:36,605
if we can bring him in
before something else happens.

743
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:40,572
-But he doesn't even have the gun.
-You think he can't get another gun?

744
00:53:47,413 --> 00:53:50,610
He was wearing jeans
and a green T-shirt, I think.

745
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,129
You're doing the right thing.
You know that, right?

746
00:53:57,933 --> 00:54:01,482
-I feel like shit.
-You'll feel worse if someone else gets hurt.

747
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,932
Oh, my God.

748
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:11,168
When that cop asked me if I knew about
the 7-Eleven thing, I said I didn't. But I did.

749
00:54:11,653 --> 00:54:14,042
-Is that really bad?
-It's not great.

750
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,603
But you're telling the truth now, right?
So don't worry about that.

751
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:20,844
They wouldn't make me testify against him
or something, right?

752
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:24,448
That's not up to me.
But, anyway, that's a long ways off.

753
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:28,084
Okay, 'cause I don't wanna
do anything like that.

754
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:31,967
-Why are you still protecting this loser?
-Because she loves him.

755
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:38,042
And we understand that, Claire.

756
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:42,049
I really wish
you'd told us about this sooner.

757
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:44,363
How long did you know
about the embalming fluid?

758
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,047
Not that long. And I tried to tell Nate.

759
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,328
When the fuck
did you try and tell me about this?

760
00:54:49,413 --> 00:54:51,688
She's telling you now, all right?

761
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,931
Okay, I'm sorry.

762
00:54:58,013 --> 00:54:59,332
I'm sorry.

763
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:04,971
When you're ready, we're gonna get in
the car and drive down to the station.

764
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:10,405
A couple of detectives there are gonna
ask you pretty much the same questions.

765
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:14,205
-Will you be there?
-Yes, I'll be there.

766
00:56:33,053 --> 00:56:34,532
English
