1
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,867
I just remembered, I owe you money.

2
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,736
Well, thank you for sparing me
the awkward confrontation.

3
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:56,417
- Are you starting to feel exploited?
- Yeah, but in a good way.

4
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,092
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:05,737
- Are you looking at my balance?
- It's okay. Size isn't everything.

6
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,897
Funny.

7
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,770
So does bad music make people deaf...

8
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,408
...or do deaf people have
really bad taste in music?

9
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:16,052
Well, there is Beethoven.

10
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:18,527
- Come on, let's go.
- What the fuck is that shit?

11
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:19,765
- Hurry.
- My receipt.

12
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,813
- Come on, that's all right, just...
- Look, it's all yours.

13
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,563
Do you think you can do
that kind of offensive shit in public?

14
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:30,287
- We're sorry, man, we didn't...
- Oh, he's sorry, huh?

15
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,760
Look, Pete, let's go.

16
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,727
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you!

17
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:39,960
Fuck! Run!

18
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,078
Help!

19
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,316
The other one got away.

20
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:56,715
Fucking freak!

21
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:59,753
Fucking pervert!
Read a Bible, you pervert!

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,477
Johnny, come on. Come on,
let's go. Come on.

23
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,703
Okay, here we go with Uncle Nate.

24
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,663
- You got him?
- Just about.

25
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,498
- Put your hand under there. There we go.
- All right, I got him. I got him.

26
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,097
Okay, but don't hold him
like he's a football.

27
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,578
It's more like you're carrying
a watermelon.

28
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:33,902
- All right.
- See?

29
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,983
- Okay.
- Adjust, adjust, adjust. There you go.

30
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,262
Hey, there, little guy.
Who looks just like his daddy, huh?

31
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,579
When a baby's born
it always looks more like its father...

32
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:47,375
...which is nature's way
of establishing paternity.

33
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:49,179
We're hoping he grows out of it.

34
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:54,248
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he will.
Oh, yes, yes.

35
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,614
David, come meet Augusto.

36
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:00,008
I just have to get Mr. Perlmutter
dressed for his viewing.

37
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,251
David, please, come take
one look at him.

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,010
Nate was an extremely gassy baby,
always crying.

39
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:09,961
David, on the other hand,
hardly ever made a peep.

40
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,363
When are you guys gonna grow up
and make this woman a grandmommy?

41
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,041
Well, certainly not until after
Mr. Perlmutter's got some clothes on.

42
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:42,831
You know, it's kind of funny,
me coming back to school in a hearse.

43
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,313
It's hilarious.

44
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,073
This sucks.

45
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:53,472
Does everybody know?

46
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,142
I don't know. Who'd you tell?

47
00:04:56,354 --> 00:05:01,949
No, I mean, like, did they make
an announcement or something?

48
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:06,268
Don't you think you would've gotten,
like, a couple of cards if they had?

49
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,141
No.

50
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,465
It's not cool to OD.
Freaks people out.

51
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,386
Who gives a fuck what
these people think?

52
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,259
Everyone's too obsessed with
what people think about them...

53
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:20,217
...to think about anyone else.

54
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,256
You're a freak.

55
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:25,692
Yeah, well, so are you.

56
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,129
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

57
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,012
- That's the guy who OD'd.
- Yeah, it is.

58
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,296
What the fuck are you looking at?

59
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:47,521
What, you called me over here to show
me a picture of you and the gravedigger?

60
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,127
I need your key back,
because you've crossed a line...

61
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,607
...and I don't feel like
I can trust you anymore.

62
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,717
- You think I took that picture?
- I will not play this game with you!

63
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,556
I won't deal with you
when you're off your meds...

64
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,716
...because I don't even know
who you are.

65
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:11,314
For someone with so much animosity
towards the psychiatric profession...

66
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,434
...you sure love to push pharmaceuticals.

67
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:16,395
Makes sense, as you're no stranger
to medication yourself.

68
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,434
You're sick, Billy. You have to
stay on your medication...

69
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,438
...or you get scary, okay?

70
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,713
You're not scared of me.

71
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,273
I'd never hurt you. You're the most
important person in my life.

72
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:33,269
Yeah, well, did you ever stop to think
that maybe that's fucked up?

73
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:41,666
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Just...

74
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:44,784
Just take the meds.

75
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,778
Okay. I promise.

76
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,098
Now give me the key.

77
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:57,615
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda.

78
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:01,294
I just... I just told you I'd take
the medication!

79
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:06,451
Jesus Christ, you don't have to be such
a bitch! When did you turn into Mom?

80
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:13,097
Okay. I don't give a shit.
You want your fucking key?

81
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,096
Great. Here, take all the fucking keys.

82
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,049
I could have an extra copy at home.

83
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,486
Yeah, I could always change the locks.

84
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:23,886
Do you know how easy it would be
to break into this place?

85
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,082
I'd like you to go now.

86
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:32,444
Get your wet suit, clothing, robes.
Take them.

87
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,038
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda!

88
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:45,240
I told you I would take
the medication, please.

89
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:51,798
You have to take care of yourself now.
I can't do it, not anymore.

90
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,437
Please, Brenda, you're the only person
I can talk to.

91
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,479
You're the only one that hears me.

92
00:07:56,682 --> 00:08:00,435
Billy, you have to get a life
of your own, okay?

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,349
Please.

94
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,587
You probably read about it.
It was on the news...

95
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,827
...what happened to Marc.

96
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:26,986
Yes.

97
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,626
The coroner still has his...
They still have him.

98
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:38,863
In situations like this,
when there's been violence...

99
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,340
...the family may prefer
a closed casket.

100
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,972
- No.
- Honey, I think he looks pretty bad.

101
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,536
I have to see him.

102
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,930
I brought some pictures,
so you'll know what he looks like.

103
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:05,012
Wasn't he such a beautiful boy?

104
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,527
Why does a thing like this happen?

105
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,359
Come on, now, we all know
why this happened.

106
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,720
That is not a reason.

107
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,637
It's the only reason.

108
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:24,917
If he wasn't...

109
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:31,322
He'd be alive today.

110
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:35,074
You know, I was always
so worried about AIDS.

111
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:39,633
I never even thought that just being
out on the street...

112
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,751
What is wrong with people?

113
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,359
Could've told him this happens.

114
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,915
I would've too if he'd ever just
talked to us about it, ever come out...

115
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:53,429
...and told us what he was.
- Well, what do you expect, Marcus?

116
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,512
You can't even say it.

117
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:13,817
Hey, Dave.

118
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,381
I'll be right with you.

119
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:25,577
Okay, okay.

120
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:30,330
- Jesus.
- Oh, boy.

121
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:31,615
Okay, Cinderella...

122
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,970
...we're gonna have to work overtime
to get you ready for the ball...

123
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:39,568
...because men don't make passes
at girls with big gashes.

124
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:43,804
That was funny, right?
Daddy's Mr. Funnyman.

125
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:48,610
Let me just run Augusto upstairs,
and I'll be right back down to do him.

126
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:52,925
I can handle this, Federico. Why don't
you take the rest of the day off?

127
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:54,968
That's a pretty tough job, Dave.

128
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,728
The skull's all shattered up there.

129
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,204
You might have to rebuild
the tissue on his cheek.

130
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,127
I can do it.

131
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,316
Hey, thanks, man.

132
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,915
I'm so damn tired I can barely
see straight.

133
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,919
- Get some rest.
- You bet. Good luck.

134
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:16,752
Let's go, buddy. Let's go, buddy.
Let's go.

135
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:22,549
And I told him not to come around
for a while.

136
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,996
- That's it?
- Oh, what else could I do, Nate?

137
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:30,189
You could talk to the police.
You could get a restraining order.

138
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:34,269
I don't need you to tell me how to handle
this. That is so arrogant and patronizing.

139
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,193
I just need you to listen to me.

140
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,385
You can't just wait for the next
fucked-up thing Billy does.

141
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:42,060
You need to do something now.

142
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:45,788
Do you think that was easy for me,
just cutting him off like that?

143
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,782
Do you even comprehend
what it's like...

144
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,787
...to be responsible
for someone your whole life?

145
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:55,265
Do you even get the concept
of loving somebody that much?

146
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,903
Yes, I get that concept.

147
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,382
He's sick.

148
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,972
He's not just sick, he's dangerous.

149
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:13,093
He built a bomb. He broke into our hotel
room and took pictures of us in bed.

150
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,689
- What's he gonna do next time?
- I took his key away from him.

151
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:20,526
Yeah, well, he didn't have a key
in Vegas. That didn't keep him out.

152
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,974
I'm sorry. I know you don't trust
your parents...

153
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:28,053
...but I really think they're right on this.
He needs to be somewhere.

154
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:38,720
This is so not how I need you
to be right now.

155
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:47,560
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna discuss this with you.

156
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,724
In fact, you know what?
Why don't we just take some time off?

157
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,438
You dump Billy,
so now you're gonna dump me?

158
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,242
Don't you fucking analyze me!

159
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:01,510
You might as well throw away your key,
because I changed the lock.

160
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,346
Where's Claire?

161
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:21,341
Well, she claims to be at a movie,
but what do I know?

162
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:24,827
Nobody ever tells me
what's really going on.

163
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,460
That boy who got beat up
on the street...

164
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:37,459
...was he doing something?

165
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,134
He was getting cash.
Didn't you read the paper?

166
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:44,620
Yes, I just thought you might
know more about it.

167
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,900
Do you like the hen?

168
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,452
Yeah, very much.
What did you stuff it with?

169
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,491
Chestnuts, bread crumbs, celery.

170
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,096
Do you wanna know
all the ingredients?

171
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,608
No, thanks.

172
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,646
Are you going out tonight?

173
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:09,288
No, not tonight.

174
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,411
Are you?

175
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:14,605
Me? No.

176
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,639
But, you know...

177
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,523
...sometimes I do see Hiram
on occasion.

178
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,366
And I know you don't like that...

179
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:30,283
...but I also know you love me
no matter who I see in my private life.

180
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,796
Well, that's good, Mom.

181
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,310
Why'd you drop jazz vocals
sophomore year?

182
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:53,986
Because the music teacher
was a crackhead.

183
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:55,829
I'm serious, Claire.

184
00:14:56,035 --> 00:15:00,504
So am I. He got busted and fired,
and then jazz vocals was discontinued.

185
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,067
Do your homework.

186
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:09,380
What happened
with the literary magazine?

187
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,018
Censorship. I wrote this totally,
like, harmless...

188
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:17,425
...like, cartoon story about this girl
who can make people's heads explode...

189
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:21,095
...and apparently it was
too disturbing to publish.

190
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:23,257
The debate team?

191
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,698
They debated what the prom theme
should be.

192
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:30,772
I mean, God, the people in this school,
they have the mentality of teenagers.

193
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,170
- You are a teenager.
- Yes...

194
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,456
...but I actually think about things
beside trying to figure out...

195
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,855
...how to puke after lunch
without anyone noticing.

196
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:44,369
So, what do you do for fun?

197
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:48,206
I don't know. What do you do for fun?

198
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:54,408
I go bowling with my friends.
I take hikes with my girlfriend.

199
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,569
- I bake.
- You bake?

200
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,609
Your turn.

201
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,763
I read.

202
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:09,006
I go online and make up
freaky cyber identities.

203
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:12,003
You know, sometimes
I'm a Scientologist.

204
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,160
Sometimes I'm a young, Christian wife.

205
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:19,353
What about friendships that are
based on the truth? Any of those?

206
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,788
Sometimes I hang out with
Parker McKenna. I kind of like her...

207
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,956
...even though she's pretty much
a split-personality freak.

208
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,826
Dating anyone?

209
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:38,223
Dating? You mean, like,
getting drunk and screwing?

210
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:43,747
- Lf that's what it is.
- Yeah, that's what it is. No, I'm not.

211
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,663
Keith, got a minute?

212
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,588
Yeah, sure. What's up?

213
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:54,178
I wanna put you on security
for the Marc Foster funeral on Thursday.

214
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,139
Okay, why?

215
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,177
The wackos turn out for these things.

216
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,174
- Why me?
- Come on, Keith.

217
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,579
You're a good, smart cop,
and you use your head...

218
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:06,502
...before you use your gun, all right?

219
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:10,940
So it has nothing to do with the fact
that I'm gay, right?

220
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,535
What do you wanna do,
sue me for discrimination...

221
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,412
...or show up and protect
this kid's family?

222
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:29,853
Oh, God, I look like something
Chef Boyardee makes.

223
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:32,965
So you never told your parents
you were gay either?

224
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,049
Oh, please, they knew.

225
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:39,243
I just didn't want my dad making me
feel guilty about it all the time.

226
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,964
Maybe he could've accepted it
if you'd given him a chance.

227
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:47,365
You heard him.
He thinks it's my fault I'm dead.

228
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,558
That's not what he was saying.
He was saying it's a sick world.

229
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:53,836
- I'm the one who was sick.
- Shut up.

230
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:58,558
So I liked men.
I never should've given in to it.

231
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:00,956
It's not what God intended.

232
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:04,357
I could've had a family and a normal life.
You could've too.

233
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,955
That life would've been a lie and
unfair to your wife and children...

234
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,035
...who would've hated you.

235
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:13,195
Not if I never looked back.

236
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:15,347
Not if I had faith.

237
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:18,830
God challenges us like this,
so we'll choose good...

238
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:22,224
...so we'll triumph over evil.

239
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:24,787
Only thing is, so few of us do.

240
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,586
It's not a choice.
God already made the choice for you.

241
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,704
That's just liberal propaganda
to justify your own depravity, Jim.

242
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:42,940
No matter how nice you fix me up,
I'm still going to hell, and you know it...

243
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:46,101
...because you're going there too.

244
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,805
Brenda, pick up the phone.

245
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:08,166
Don't just lay there and say, "Fuck you. "

246
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:12,723
Okay, I'm sorry I pissed you off.
I know you're under a lot of pressure...

247
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,604
...but so am I.

248
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,802
So let's talk about it, okay?

249
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,080
Call me.

250
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:29,156
Hey.

251
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:34,474
Yes, this is Fisher & Sons.
Can I help you?

252
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,558
I'm terribly sorry.

253
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:41,713
Yes, we can pick up the body...
The deceased.

254
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,956
Which morgue?

255
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,957
A residence, okay.
What's the address?

256
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,945
- Robbie?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did my tree hit you?

257
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:02,425
- Do you have a moment?
- Well, I don't know, Ruth.

258
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,305
I got a whole big bunch of ferns
out back I gotta cut up...

259
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:09,219
...so you can make some more of those
beautiful, one-of-a-kind arrangements.

260
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,179
How did you tell your parents
you were...

261
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,106
Into flowers?

262
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:20,334
Well, it was obvious from the beginning.
My first word was "perennial. "

263
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:25,541
How did you tell them you were gay?

264
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,774
What makes you think I am gay?

265
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,973
Just because I have
a refined aesthetic...

266
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:32,741
...you make assumptions
about my personal life?

267
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,569
I'm so sorry. You're not gay?

268
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,128
Yes, I'm gay.

269
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,571
But I certainly don't see
how that's any of your business.

270
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:44,376
Do I ask you about
your intimate sexual life...

271
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,250
...even though it is on full display
in the workplace? No, I do not.

272
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,883
I tolerate the repercussions,
but I don't pry.

273
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:55,289
I'm sorry. I'm asking because my son...

274
00:20:55,492 --> 00:21:01,042
Oh, dear Lord, save it for Geraldo.

275
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,286
Someone in the family shows signs
of homosexuality...

276
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:08,366
...and suddenly it's a national crisis.
Coming out to my parents.

277
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:14,400
Honestly, why don't you tell me the most
horrible moment from your intimate past?

278
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:20,672
- It was horrible?
- It's none of your business.

279
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,998
I'm sorry I offended you, Robbie.

280
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,106
That is a shitty place for the lily.

281
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:42,227
Mr. Jacoby?

282
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,655
Oh, fuck.

283
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:45,259
Jesus, Billy, you fucking psycho.

284
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:13,209
Did I get you?

285
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:16,882
Come on, man, it's paint.
Why aren't you laughing?

286
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:18,410
I don't think it's funny.

287
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,288
Oh, no, it's just plain fun.

288
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,084
You know, if you mix up the letters
in "funeral," you get "real fun. "

289
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,558
How much do you love that?

290
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:33,521
You stay away from my sister.
She's just a kid.

291
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,756
Now, that's kind of ironic,
don't you think? You telling me that.

292
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:45,350
What'd they tell you?

293
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:52,952
They tell you I made a bomb?

294
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,588
They tell you who it was for?

295
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,945
I know you wrote things
about your family.

296
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:01,344
Liar!

297
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:04,832
Don't fucking lie to me.

298
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:09,464
He thought he was such a genius,
everybody thought.

299
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:12,264
He even had Brenda fooled,
which blows my mind.

300
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,029
Well, okay, she was young.

301
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:18,704
- Are you talking about Dr. Feinberg?
- No, Trevor, you fucking moron.

302
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:23,138
Trevor. Perfect fucking Trevor.

303
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,261
He thought he was the king of Brenda,
which is such adolescent shit...

304
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:31,250
...as if you could know somebody for a
few months and replace their whole life.

305
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,816
Their family.

306
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:37,292
Brenda's not allowed to love anyone
as much as she loves you?

307
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,609
Able.

308
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:42,733
She's not able.

309
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:47,575
You know what? You're right.

310
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:54,051
Bren never even told me about Trevor.
She doesn't trust me.

311
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,844
You don't get to call her that.

312
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,804
You call her Brenda.

313
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:01,048
You know, she broke up with me today.

314
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,606
- Really?
- Yeah. Took away my key.

315
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:26,635
Well, it's probably for the best.

316
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,036
You and Brenda was never a good idea.

317
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,315
Yeah, tell me about it.

318
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:43,111
Listen, I gotta go, so you take care.

319
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,575
Hey.

320
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,339
Hey.

321
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:09,102
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, just...

322
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:12,538
...give me a second to recover.

323
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:14,811
Still bad, huh?

324
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:20,013
It's just fucking tiring
trying to act normal all day.

325
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,493
I know what you mean.

326
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,964
So, what's the stupidest thing
anyone's said to you today?

327
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,723
Packy Walker told me that he once
had to get his stomach pumped...

328
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:39,606
...because he ate his dog's
deworming pills.

329
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,563
He thought they were ludes.

330
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:46,998
Well, isn't it comforting to know
that being miserable...

331
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,960
...is still better than being an idiot?

332
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:16,266
All right.

333
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:20,588
You wanna hear the most horrible
moment from my intimate past?

334
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:24,308
No, sister, I do not.

335
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:27,988
I was married to my husband
for 30 years.

336
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:33,661
I never slept with another man until I
started having sex with my hairdresser.

337
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:46,699
And the first time my hairdresser
friend and I had intercourse...

338
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:50,691
...he asked me to pleasure
myself, so he would know...

339
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:54,291
...you know, how I did that.

340
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:59,653
And I couldn't.

341
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,850
Because I had never pleasured
myself in my life.

342
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,334
I was 52 years old.

343
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:12,372
And I had to learn how to...

344
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:14,331
Masturbate.

345
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,608
From a hairdresser.

346
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,449
Oh, my.

347
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,486
Oh, my.

348
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:30,966
Well, Ruth, thank you for sharing that.

349
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:35,477
But I'm still not gonna tell you
about coming out to my parents.

350
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:39,915
- Why not?
- Because I never did, cupcake.

351
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:42,677
My daddy would've never spoken
another word to me...

352
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:46,475
...and my mother would've just gone
insane, right there on the spot.

353
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,229
How do you know?

354
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,551
A child knows what his parents
need him to be.

355
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:57,068
My mother is one of those women that
never did anything but raise children.

356
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,073
So, if you came out wrong,
like the opposite...

357
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:03,152
...of what she was trying to make
you into, then, you know...

358
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:06,231
...her whole life is a failure.

359
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:10,226
I'm not like that.

360
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,739
Did he ever actually threaten you?

361
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:21,744
Telling the new boyfriend you wanted
the old boyfriend dead...

362
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:25,620
...while you're playing with a knife.
Yeah, that seems like a threat to me.

363
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,534
How come you never told me
about Trevor?

364
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,934
It's such ancient history.

365
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,652
You said you'd never been
serious about anyone.

366
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:45,610
I was 18.

367
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:49,844
- Did you love him?
- Yes.

368
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:52,409
So, what happened?

369
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:55,251
Billy got sick.

370
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,443
Trevor went to Yale without me.

371
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:00,404
Billy got rid of him
because he was jealous.

372
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:04,961
Everyone was jealous of Trevor.
He was ridiculously gifted...

373
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,398
...one of those people everybody
secretly hates...

374
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:12,561
...because he's good at everything
and always gets what he wants.

375
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:17,434
- Well, he didn't get you.
- Oh, please. He could do better.

376
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:22,636
He did, actually. The woman he married
won the National Book Award last year.

377
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:26,078
You know, you're
ridiculously gifted too.

378
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,276
You could be one of those people
who has everything.

379
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:44,343
If you don't wanna deal with this,
I might have to wanna call your parents.

380
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,703
Well, you might have to wanna call
my parents...

381
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:49,584
...but unfortunately, they're
in South Africa at the moment.

382
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:51,867
I have absolutely no idea
how to contact them.

383
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,459
Would you stop fucking around?

384
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,257
I love you, and I'm sure
whatever you feel about me...

385
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,220
...you don't wanna see me dead.

386
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,379
Are you okay?

387
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:13,018
No.

388
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:16,174
Do you want me to take you
to a doctor?

389
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,175
What, now you think I'm crazy too?

390
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,374
No, no.

391
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:28,213
Goddamn it, why are you
shutting me out?

392
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,090
I just wanna be alone, okay?

393
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:37,844
I just wanna go to sleep.

394
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:44,049
Well, good night.

395
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:33,942
Why didn't you tell me about
your relationship with Gabriel Dimas?

396
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:39,707
I guess I just wasn't in the mood
for a lecture on inappropriate friends.

397
00:33:39,948 --> 00:33:41,539
What makes you think I'd do that?

398
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:45,738
Well, some people don't think
he's the greatest influence.

399
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:48,412
And what do you think?

400
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:52,538
I think that I'm as much of an influence
on him as he is on me...

401
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:56,131
...so it's not like it only goes one way.

402
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:57,739
Right.

403
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,012
Relating to another person is a way
that we relate to a part of ourselves.

404
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:09,851
It's like, he's, like, an extreme version
of me, you know?

405
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:11,807
I can see that.

406
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:18,121
But what he's going through,
it's so much more.

407
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:21,323
But I understand, you know?

408
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:26,887
Feeling like you've got this shadow
over you all the time.

409
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:31,002
What's your shadow?

410
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,997
Death, I guess.

411
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:43,195
Death and silence.

412
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,032
Is that crazy?

413
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:48,793
What's the silence?

414
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,392
I don't know.
It's, like, sadness...

415
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:00,783
...or fear, maybe.

416
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,703
It's, like, you know, everybody's
so scared...

417
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:06,746
...that they're gonna say
the wrong thing...

418
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:10,024
...because, like, you know,
when you bury someone...

419
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:13,302
...that's, like, the most sensitive time
in a person's life.

420
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,899
So it's, like, my family,
they're just so careful.

421
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:20,463
It's like they almost become invisible.

422
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,855
That was heavy.

423
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:36,659
What's going on?

424
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,775
Nothing. I'm just being a freak.

425
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:45,650
You don't have to be afraid
that you'll say the wrong thing.

426
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:48,848
That's just it. I'm not.

427
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:53,283
I mean, I do say the wrong thing.

428
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:56,485
But, it's, like, this is gonna
sound stupid...

429
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,485
...but, like, I talk so much shit
all the time, you know.

430
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:05,958
And that's just another way
to not say...

431
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,638
Whatever.

432
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,517
To not say what?

433
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,556
I'm not here for the school
or for your mom.

434
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:25,442
I'm just here for you.

435
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:30,030
This is confidential, right?

436
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:43,553
Gabe didn't OD by accident.

437
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:47,345
He did it on purpose, I think.

438
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:50,868
Well, most ODs aren't really
just accidents.

439
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,459
Right, so, what can I do
as the friend of a person...

440
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,262
...who would do something like that?

441
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,781
Like, I know all the "I can't save him"
stuff, and I went to the websites.

442
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:06,935
And it's all, like, what you can't do.
So, what can I do?

443
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,103
Try not to make yourself invisible.

444
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,055
This isn't about me.

445
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,698
That's not a very good start, is it?

446
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:28,128
At least my tie can be straight, right?

447
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:32,045
You should've left me
the way I was.

448
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:35,564
Let the world see me
for who I really am...

449
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,525
...an abomination of nature.

450
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:39,808
Shut up.

451
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:42,646
Who you are is nothing
to be ashamed of.

452
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,205
That's a little hard to buy,
coming from somebody...

453
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,243
...who cruises for dick on the Internet
and has unsafe sex with prostitutes.

454
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,642
They made a shrine at the place
where you died...

455
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,394
...with pictures of you and flowers.

456
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,358
People go there and hold candles
in your honor.

457
00:37:59,564 --> 00:38:02,839
- What people?
- Your friends, your community.

458
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,237
Bleeding-heart faggots
with nothing better to do.

459
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:09,150
Guys who fucked me when they were
drunk and then never called me back.

460
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,913
There are people who love you.

461
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,116
But not as many as hate me...

462
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,912
...and you.

463
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:27,231
Nice job.

464
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:30,629
Man, that is the best work
you've ever done, David.

465
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:36,109
- Thanks.
- Nice, very nice.

466
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:45,221
Hey, there's, like, 200 homos
outside. Oh, shit.

467
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:48,223
Already? It's only a quarter of.

468
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,621
You'd think the family wouldn't want
all of that coming in here, you know?

469
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:54,414
All of what?

470
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:58,620
There's this one guy,
he's dressed like Jackie Kennedy.

471
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:02,374
You think this guy's mother
really needs to see that today?

472
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:07,334
How'd you get those abrasions
on his cheek so smooth-looking?

473
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:10,972
I used diaper rash cream.
You left some.

474
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:17,485
You know, Rico, I'm a homo.

475
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:24,682
I may not dress like Jackie Kennedy,
but I have sex with men.

476
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:38,118
Don't... Don't talk to me
about that. All right?

477
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:41,993
Why should I hide it from you? You
change your baby's diaper in my house.

478
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:44,995
You show me a videotape
of your wife giving birth.

479
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:47,715
Where I come from...

480
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:51,912
...if men need to do that sometimes...

481
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,678
...they don't talk about it.

482
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:57,187
They don't leave their families.
They're men.

483
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,666
I am a man!

484
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:10,585
So I took the height of tree A and
divided it by the length of shadow B.

485
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:15,147
So do you see how I got
to tangent C?

486
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,501
Since when were you such a trig bitch?

487
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,904
Don't get me wrong.
I know it's totally pointless.

488
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:26,701
Just somehow, teaching you
makes it seem more interesting.

489
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:29,338
It must be the power.

490
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:35,457
Well, you are...

491
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:39,653
...a very stimulating teacher.

492
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:46,453
I love your grasp of the material.

493
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:51,084
Well, maybe we should grasp
the next one.

494
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,445
Which one?

495
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,449
Number five.

496
00:40:57,493 --> 00:40:59,528
Come on.

497
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:14,082
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

498
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:16,675
Allergies.

499
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:19,319
Hey, come on.

500
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:26,037
I'm scared.

501
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,514
It's okay.

502
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:35,712
I'm scared too.

503
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,227
I'm scared you're gonna disappear.

504
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:45,825
I'm not gonna disappear.

505
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:52,426
What are you scared of?

506
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,747
I'm scared I'm not gonna finish
my math homework.

507
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:04,622
Hey, I told you.

508
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:13,133
I'm scared that you...

509
00:42:13,343 --> 00:42:14,776
...are too good for me.

510
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:18,810
Oh, you're crazy.

511
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:30,454
I finally find a woman I wanna commit to,
and she makes it totally impossible.

512
00:42:30,656 --> 00:42:33,533
You think that's a coincidence?

513
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:36,248
What is that supposed to mean?

514
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:40,001
Maybe if she made it easier,
you wouldn't be so eager.

515
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:44,999
I need more garlic.

516
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,289
You've always been bored
with the girls you could have...

517
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:52,207
...and fascinated with
the ones you couldn't.

518
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:56,679
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?

519
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:09,074
Your brother's gay, isn't he?

520
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,631
I think that's a question for him.

521
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:17,398
Has he told you?

522
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:19,511
No, he has not told me.

523
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,549
But it's obvious. Everyone knows.

524
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:26,184
Am I supposed to say something?
I tried to discuss it. He wouldn't let me.

525
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:28,145
I guess he doesn't wanna talk about it.

526
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:30,502
It's not good for him
to skulk around like that.

527
00:43:30,712 --> 00:43:32,623
He's very tense. It's not good for him.

528
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:35,424
- Breathe, Mom.
- I know how to breathe!

529
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,179
I don't appreciate you blaming me for
all your problems, thank you very much.

530
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:44,775
Your carrots are burning.

531
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:48,814
Haven't you seen a little girl
called Bunny?

532
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:51,613
- About your age,
- No,

533
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:53,700
- A new girl,
- No,

534
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:55,301
With a dress, just like yours,

535
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:59,176
Look, there's no point
in questioning the children,

536
00:44:14,615 --> 00:44:17,253
What are you doing here?

537
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,166
I know what to do.

538
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,210
I know how to fix it.

539
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:25,964
Yeah? Fix what?

540
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,167
Oh, it was a big mistake.

541
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:32,163
But I'm gonna fix it, okay?

542
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:35,480
Oh, my God, Billy, what have you...?

543
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:40,483
- Did you hurt him?
- No, no, no, I fixed it.

544
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,197
- Oh, God.
- See, I can't be him anymore.

545
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:46,041
He's somebody else now.
I did it for you.

546
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,272
Now we can bury him.
And the best part is...

547
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:51,074
...now the nurse won't
ever be able to find him.

548
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,076
You've lost a lot of blood.

549
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:56,668
- Let me get a towel.
- We just have to get yours now.

550
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,990
This way, you'll be safe from her too
for the first time.

551
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:04,709
Then we can bury them,
and you and I can be new people.

552
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:08,064
And we can forget about everything
bad that they wrote.

553
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:11,150
I don't want us to be new people.

554
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,343
I like us the way we are.

555
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:17,624
Well, I already did it, Brenda,
so you have to do it too.

556
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:21,224
Okay.

557
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,825
Give me the knife.

558
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,980
- I wanna do it.
- No, you did yours. I should do mine.

559
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:30,062
Nathaniel saved Isabel on the sailboat.

560
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:31,777
It's a book. It's fiction.

561
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:34,861
He saved her for the first time.
She always saved him before.

562
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:38,610
Nathaniel and Isabel are not real.

563
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:49,332
I need to do it.

564
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:57,209
Billy, get off!

565
00:45:58,613 --> 00:45:59,762
Billy, get off me!

566
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:04,767
I'm warning you. This is gonna hurt.

567
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:15,600
Yes, hello. I need an ambulance.

568
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:10,982
- It's in the Bible.
- Your son's burning in hell.

569
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:13,579
- God hates fags.
- God hates morons.

570
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:16,933
- The wages of sin is death and AIDS.
- Amen.

571
00:47:17,622 --> 00:47:19,737
You leave these people alone,
or so help me...

572
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,896
- It's my right to be here.
- This is America.

573
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,256
It's my right to tell the truth. God killed
Marc Foster, and I'm here to celebrate.

574
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,931
God just shoved your stomach into
your lungs, and I'm here to celebrate!

575
00:47:32,176 --> 00:47:35,372
- Look, God just got you in the face.
- What's wrong with you?

576
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:37,332
He started it.

577
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:39,603
- You all right?
- That man ought to be arrested.

578
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:43,009
- We'll take care of it. Watch yourself.
- I demand that man be arrested!

579
00:47:43,212 --> 00:47:46,680
This is a funeral. Show some respect.

580
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,883
- What happened? Did something happen?
- No, nothing happened.

581
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,994
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

582
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:12,671
Damn, you messed that guy up.

583
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,316
No, I'm sorry for how I've been.

584
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:18,754
I'm just...

585
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,827
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:22,596 --> 00:48:27,110
You know, I have to work not to be
worrying about you all the time.

587
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:29,952
You could get yourself killed if...

588
00:48:30,913 --> 00:48:34,745
- If what?
- Lf that's what you want.

589
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:38,788
- That's not what I want.
- Are you sure?

590
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,820
Yes.

591
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:48,258
I'm sorry for how I was with you
when we were together.

592
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,896
I don't know why it's so hard for me.

593
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:54,062
It's hard for all of us.

594
00:48:56,503 --> 00:49:00,176
But you know that you're right, that
you're a good man. For me it's like...

595
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,098
...I agree with them, you know?

596
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,654
Like it is my fault,
and I should be able to fix it.

597
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:09,409
- There's nothing to fix.
- But it's not who I wanna be.

598
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:12,325
I wanna be the guy at church
with the kid on his knee.

599
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,930
You can have a kid
on your knee, David.

600
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:19,133
That guy probably hasn't slept
with his wife in five years.

601
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:26,845
I feel like my father would hate me
if he knew.

602
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,167
You told me he did know.

603
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,280
And he never said anything.

604
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:33,638
Did you?

605
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,633
Would you shut up? My mother'll
fry your balls for breakfast...

606
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,557
...if she catches you in here.

607
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,157
Nice.

608
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:59,951
So is that pretty much what you eat
in a funeral home?

609
00:50:00,157 --> 00:50:02,511
Yeah, why?

610
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,082
Hey.

611
00:51:20,925 --> 00:51:23,802
I had Billy committed.

612
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:50,669
Mom?

613
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,429
Are you okay?

614
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:57,588
I have a terrible headache.

615
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,504
- Well, maybe we can talk later.
- What?

616
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:03,460
What?

617
00:52:04,508 --> 00:52:06,862
I'm gay.

618
00:52:07,826 --> 00:52:09,578
Why didn't you ever tell me?

619
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:12,937
- I am telling you.
- Before, before.

620
00:52:13,144 --> 00:52:16,135
- Don't you trust me?
- What do you mean? I'm telling you.

621
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:19,541
But I've tried to discuss it with you
several times.

622
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:21,697
Look, I just wasn't comfortable, okay?

623
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:24,209
- What does it matter now?
- Why not?

624
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,775
- When I was clearly trying to be open?
- You know, Mom...

625
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:33,172
...you may be trying to be open now...

626
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:36,570
...and that's great.

627
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:39,647
But that's not how you've been
for all my life.

628
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:42,327
You and dad, no one talked
about anything.

629
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,608
None of us are like that, except Nate...

630
00:52:44,812 --> 00:52:48,769
...and that's just because he has
no other way to distinguish himself.

631
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,084
I've always loved you.

632
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,922
I know you love the part of me
that's your son.

633
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:59,160
What part of you isn't my son?
You're all my son.

634
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:01,796
I don't think you know me very well.

635
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,036
Well, whose fault is that?

636
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:08,032
I'm sorry.

637
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,789
And, you know, when you've tried to
bring it up before or now even...

638
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:22,914
...it's like you've decided
you should know who I am.

639
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,988
You're willing to see me how
you look at something horrible...

640
00:53:26,195 --> 00:53:29,584
...like a corpse, because it's
your job, your duty.

641
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:32,068
It revolts you,
but you make yourself bear it.

642
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:35,070
Well, you're wrong.
You don't revolt me!

643
00:53:35,272 --> 00:53:40,139
I don't choose which part of you I love,
like some kind of chicken!

644
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:48,576
It was just so much easier
when you were little...

645
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,544
...and you would tell me everything.

646
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:56,742
And when you were upset,
I could always fix it.

647
00:53:57,383 --> 00:54:01,533
I don't know how to take care
of you anymore.

648
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,248
Just let me...

649
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,529
Just let me take care of myself.

650
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:09,651
But do you? I'm afraid that you don't.

651
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:11,856
I do.

652
00:54:12,057 --> 00:54:14,012
I will.

653
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:27,241
Well, that's all that I wanted to say.

654
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:29,520
All right.

655
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,128
We're having veal.

656
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:48,437
Well, Mommy still loves you.

657
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:51,519
Does that make everything better?

658
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:56,349
- Yeah, I didn't think it would.
- What are you still doing here?

659
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,711
I could've come out to every mother
in the world, and I'd still be dead.

660
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,627
Oh, what, you're gonna interrupt him
and his matching love stud?

661
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:19,708
Both of them will be in hell
with us, by the way.

662
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,946
But something tells me they're gonna
have a lot more fun.

663
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:25,218
Stop, stop.

664
00:55:25,428 --> 00:55:27,577
Make me.

665
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:37,732
Please, God, help me.
Take this pain away, please.

666
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:41,934
Fill this loneliness with your love.

667
00:55:42,141 --> 00:55:45,371
Help me, God. Please help me.

668
00:55:53,796 --> 00:56:46,550
