1
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,669
Damn, this house is cold.

2
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:16,146
Shit, Hattie,
it's like a goddamn icebox.

3
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:21,911
Well, no wonder.
Girl, are you crazy?

4
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,158
We live in the desert.
It gets cold at night.

5
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,238
You plan on sleeping all day?

6
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,993
I was planning to get me some
breakfast before nightfall.

7
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,113
Come on, bitch.
Get your lazy ass up.

8
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,281
Come on, now,
this ain't the old folks' home.

9
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:45,916
Hattie.

10
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,716
Hattie?

11
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,236
I hate this client.

12
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,484
Every time she gets dumped by a guy,
she gets a puppy.

13
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,918
So now she's got, like, 15 dogs.

14
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:20,279
They're all male, they're all huge
and they sit there and watch...

15
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:23,048
...with their tongues hanging out
while I work on her.

16
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:28,960
It's like being in some live sex show
for Asian businessmen and frat boys.

17
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,010
Which I actually did for a while,
back in the '80s, to make some money.

18
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,285
I got this great thing going
with Ping-Pong balls you'd really like.

19
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,006
I'm gonna
show it to you sometime.

20
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:48,083
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I got some
hedge clippers and cut off your dick?

21
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,206
- What?
- Do me a favor, okay?

22
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,973
- Don't read that shit in front of me.
- You gave it to me.

23
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:57,167
- Yeah, come on, I'm late.
- I'm at the part with the doll.

24
00:03:57,374 --> 00:03:59,285
Why is your doll angry?

25
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:00,893
Because she got raped.

26
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:04,770
- Really? By who?
- By you.

27
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:08,088
Brenda, do you know
what "raped" means?

28
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:11,845
It means she was forced
into sexual intercourse against her will.

29
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,053
It's so cool. You're doing it to scare
them into leaving you alone, right?

30
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:19,891
- What do you want from me? I was 8.
- Did it work?

31
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:23,329
No, it didn't work.
I just got a whole new level of scrutiny...

32
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:26,052
...by a different set of vultures,
only they were women.

33
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,773
I'm leaving.
You still want a ride?

34
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,256
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

35
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:49,252
What are you doing today?

36
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:54,893
Well, the cabinets.
I'm gonna try to organize the cabinets.

37
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:56,502
Good.

38
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:05,340
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

39
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,464
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah.

40
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:11,179
Bring the Lincoln Town Car
around front.

41
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,458
So you're the other Fisher boy, huh?
The one from where, Oregon?

42
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,385
- Seattle.
- Right, with the health-food thing.

43
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:20,499
- Yep.
- I remember your dad talking about you.

44
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:24,621
I'm sorry to hear about him, man.
He was a funny guy.

45
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,699
Yeah?

46
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:30,786
- No, you don't pay.
- Don't pay?

47
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,181
Yeah. Your dad buried my brother
a few years back. It's in trade.

48
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,782
My father traded a funeral
for oil changes?

49
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,551
Yeah, guess so.

50
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:54,902
Bye, Mom.
Have a good day.

51
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:07,388
So would you like us to take care of
finding you a cemetery plot, Mr. Jones?

52
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:10,826
- Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
- Would you like a double plot?

53
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,428
What for?

54
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:18,465
Well, one for your wife, and one for you.
Next to each other.

55
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:21,987
It this what you do all the time?
Sell people their own graves?

56
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,546
- Yes, sir. This is my job.
- Don't try to pull that shit with me, boy.

57
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:29,067
I want a simple box, no frills.

58
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:33,271
You can't take advantage of me
because I'm old. I'll kick your ass!

59
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:36,907
Just a single plot, then.

60
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,837
No. Double plot.
Shit.

61
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,751
Will you want Mrs. Jones
prepared for viewing?

62
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,431
Yes, I wanna see her, but I don't
want you messing with her none.

63
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:56,033
I don't want you to cut her
or stick her or pickle her like an egg.

64
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,840
If you want a viewing,
I recommend...

65
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,160
That's my wife, boy!
I don't want you to touch her!

66
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,359
Mr. Jones, I can guarantee
that you will not want to see her...

67
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:09,362
...nor will anyone else,
unless she's been embalmed.

68
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,402
I would beg you to consider
what your wife would want.

69
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,641
She's dead, fool.
Don't matter what she wants.

70
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,040
Well, yes, sir, but...

71
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:22,436
After death, the body immediately
begins to decompose.

72
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:25,604
Much quicker than you might think.
The skin begins to separate.

73
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,439
There's quite an unpleasant odor.

74
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:31,441
Should you choose to forgo embalming,
my recommendation would be cremation.

75
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,725
As soon as possible.

76
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,763
That's just the way it is,
Mr. Jones.

77
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,006
I don't wanna burn her up.
I wanna see her.

78
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,162
Fine. You do understand, however,
that means she'll need to be embalmed.

79
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:56,290
- I ain't paying for that.
- Sir, the cost is minimal.

80
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:04,402
I will waive the embalming fee,
Mr. Jones. All right?

81
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,533
That was a good sermon,
I thought.

82
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,175
- Did you?
- You didn't?

83
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:02,341
- I didn't really listen to it.
- Hello!

84
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,816
Hello, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm Tracy Blair, David's friend.

86
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,422
Tracy.

87
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,091
I keep asking him
when we're gonna meet his fianc'ee.

88
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,453
- Does she go to another church?
- Yes.

89
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:15,382
What fianc'ee?

90
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,496
Tracy, I told you, Jennifer and I
had broken it off years ago.

91
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:22,459
You did?
So there's no fianc'ee now?

92
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,656
Excuse us.

93
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:29,055
- It's really a sore subject for us all.
- You're hurting my arm.

94
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,494
Ruth.

95
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:32,702
- Hiram.
- How are you?

96
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:36,906
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you been coming to church?

97
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,708
- I haven't seen you.
- I wanted to give us some space.

98
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,382
Please don't sacrifice anything
on my account.

99
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:46,058
Little late for that.

100
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,545
- I miss you. Can I see you?
- No.

101
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:52,742
Ruth, haven't you
punished yourself enough?

102
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,145
Shall we go?

103
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,659
- Hi, I'm David Fisher.
- Hiram Gunderson.

104
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,907
Nice to meet you.

105
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:05,065
- You're the hairdresser.
- It's nice to meet you, son.

106
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,746
- Don't call me that.
- David!

107
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,624
What?

108
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:15,987
- I'll go get the car.
- No, I'm coming with you.

109
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:20,229
It's good to see you.
You look well.

110
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:34,035
Okay, I hear you.
Jesus!

111
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:40,271
Who are you?

112
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:43,236
- I live here. Who are you?
- I wanna see my wife.

113
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:48,034
Oh, I'm sorry. We're not open yet.
Everyone who knows anything is gone.

114
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,678
I wanna see my wife.

115
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,231
Sir, I don't deal with the dead people,
so you're just gonna have to come back.

116
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,510
Bitch, I don't need
your permission.

117
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,876
Sir, you're just gonna
have to come back later.

118
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,399
- My foot.
- What?

119
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,516
Help! Help! There's a white girl
trying to cripple an old black man.

120
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,791
Honestly.

121
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:11,075
Look, sir, you can't go in there.

122
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,000
Hello?

123
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,640
Hello, is anyone home?

124
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,755
Yes, in here.

125
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,483
- Who's your friend?
- Hell if I know.

126
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:36,201
His wife died, and he wanted to see her.
I guess she isn't ready yet.

127
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:39,204
He was about to keel over,
so I helped him sit down.

128
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:42,678
Then I had to listen to him bitch
about public transportation forever...

129
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,878
...then he just, like, passed out.

130
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,318
Now I can't get his fucking hand
to let go.

131
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,160
- Maybe he died.
- Very funny.

132
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:52,280
No, he's still breathing and farting.

133
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:58,486
- Can you help me pry his hand loose?
- Sure.

134
00:11:58,689 --> 00:11:59,964
Is Nate around?

135
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,162
I just bought this fabulous antique chest,
weighs a ton.

136
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,205
- I'm gonna need a hand getting it home.
- No, I haven't seen him.

137
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:11,370
- I can help you move it, though.
- No. Thanks.

138
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:19,209
So I'm no good because the cabinet
moving thing's just foreplay for you...

139
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,290
...to fuck my brother?

140
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,610
No. I'm just not into babysitting
high-school girls.

141
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,322
- No offense.
- Let go of me!

142
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:31,083
Damn, what you all doing?
Trying to steal my watch?

143
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,365
Ought to call the goddamn cops.

144
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:37,204
Why? You're the one who's
breaking and entering.

145
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:39,850
Look. We've gotta go
move a chest.

146
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:43,293
Someone should be back soon
to let you see your wife.

147
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,136
- Hey, little girl.
- What?

148
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,087
You ain't fooling nobody.

149
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:54,649
Great. Thanks. I'll work on that.
I'll be, like, one minute to change, okay?

150
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,456
Are you gonna be okay here alone?

151
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,135
Everybody's alone.

152
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,611
You born alone,
you die alone, goddamn it.

153
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,458
I'm sorry about your wife.

154
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:32,295
You didn't know her.

155
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:42,134
Jessica Wilcox?

156
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:45,224
I'm Nate Fisher.
Nathaniel's son.

157
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,899
I wondered why I hadn't heard
from Nathaniel in quite a while.

158
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:56,660
I hate this. I hate that I'll never
see him again. He was such a kook.

159
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:59,138
A kook? Dad?

160
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:02,147
I don't think anybody
ever made me laugh like that.

161
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:04,385
He had such a sense of humor.

162
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:09,021
- So I hear.
- He was really proud of you.

163
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,662
- I'm Nate, not David.
- I know who you are.

164
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,500
You're the one who took off.
Your father really respected you for that.

165
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:20,591
Said he wished he'd had the guts
to do that when he was a kid.

166
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:28,032
Ms. Wilcox, did you have some kind
of arrangement with my father?

167
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:31,583
- Arrangement?
- In our ledgers, some of the funerals...

168
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:35,184
...were marked differently,
and your mother's was one.

169
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:39,434
It seems my father sometimes traded his
services for payments other than cash.

170
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:46,306
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but can I see some kind of identification?

171
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:51,112
- Driver's license would do.
- Sure.

172
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:01,069
Libra, huh?
I would've taken you for a Capricorn.

173
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,828
- You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,192
Better be careful.
Give you kidney stones.

175
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:27,680
Come on. Surely you wouldn't begrudge
your father such a minor indulgence.

176
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:33,282
- My father never smoked pot.
- Not in front of you, he didn't.

177
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:38,114
It's the finest organic.
Grown up in San Francisco by my son.

178
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:43,084
Take it.
It's your father's monthly supply.

179
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:51,404
How is your mother doing
with the grieving, David?

180
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:56,761
She's fine. As far as I can tell. You know
her, she likes to suffer in silence.

181
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,925
That seems to be a family trait.

182
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,325
You know, it's God's will
for us to live our lives fully.

183
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:07,646
Breathing in the joy around us,
not just shouldering the pain.

184
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,568
God wants you to be happy.

185
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,647
I call them "energy buns. "
They're my own recipe.

186
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,842
Well, not really. Adding the peppers,
I picked up on my honeymoon.

187
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,608
- Have you ever been to Brazil?
- No.

188
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,281
Oh, my God, Brazilians
are the most beautiful people alive!

189
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:24,721
They're like these fabulous mongrels...

190
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:28,049
...who've incorporated all the very best
attributes from every race.

191
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,050
I mean, all that
crossbreeding. Hello!

192
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:33,527
I had a half-breed mutt
who lived to be almost 20.

193
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:38,170
Then I got this purebred corgi, and its
hips disintegrated before it was even 2.

194
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:45,605
- Here you go.
- Fuck you, church freaks.

195
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:48,010
Well, enjoy.

196
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,094
Do you cook?
I hate cooking just for myself.

197
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,856
That's the worst part
about being divorced.

198
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,366
That and the whole
no-regular-sex thing.

199
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:02,331
David? Could I talk to you
for a moment?

200
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,527
- Alone?
- Excuse us.

201
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,255
- What do you want?
- Ruth won't talk to me.

202
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,529
I'm worried about her.
I was hoping you could...

203
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,378
You were fucking my mother
while my father was still alive...

204
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,094
...and now you want me to...?
- I understand if you're upset...

205
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,089
Understand this. Whatever you have with
my mother is between you and her...

206
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:28,134
...but I have no interest in helping you.

207
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,574
Table for one?

208
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,373
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

209
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,940
Did you know my father,
Nathaniel Fisher?

210
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:48,943
This used to be our storeroom...

211
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:54,094
...but when I finally got a loan from the
bank, I put an extension out the kitchen.

212
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:56,455
Your father buried my wife
seven years ago.

213
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:58,577
I had very little money
for the funeral.

214
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,095
He asked if he could have
this room as his own...

215
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,066
...and that would
be my settlement.

216
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:09,062
What did he do here?

217
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,266
I don't know.

218
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:17,738
- Stay as long as you like.
- How often did he come here?

219
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:20,224
Sometimes, we wouldn't see him
for months.

220
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,705
Sometimes, he was here every day.

221
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,728
Mrs. Fisher.

222
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,052
Good afternoon, Nikolai.

223
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,817
I don't believe I've had a chance
to thank you yet.

224
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:19,577
When Kroehner started pressuring
everyone to cut us off...

225
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:23,174
...most of our suppliers
just abandoned Fisher & Sons.

226
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,330
- You stuck with us.
- Of course I stick with you.

227
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,257
Here.

228
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,891
Thank you.

229
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,495
These flowers are not going
to plant themselves.

230
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,250
Such delicate skin.
You have Russian color.

231
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:43,457
I do?

232
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:46,262
You don't like the beauty you have?

233
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:55,133
The front door is open.
You can leave the flowers inside.

234
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:56,942
Okay.

235
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:04,941
Okay. That is where
that is going to have to stay.

236
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:09,377
- God, that shit was heavy.
- You wanted to help.

237
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,941
Oh, my God.
Is this yours?

238
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,502
No. That's Nate's, but he keeps
leaving it in my car.

239
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:21,426
- I love this book.
- You've read it?

240
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:24,461
Yeah. My friends and I were
all over it three summers ago...

241
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,939
...before they all turned into pretentious
drama nerds and abandoned me.

242
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:30,378
Thank God.

243
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:34,821
- What's your favorite part?
- Oh, they're too numerous to mention.

244
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,868
Where's that part where she, like,
stops speaking for a month...

245
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,662
...and just barks at them?

246
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,019
Brenda...

247
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,540
Brenda, I know you're angry.

248
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,628
Can you talk to me?

249
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:08,787
You know they put me in therapy
because I stole that foot?

250
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:11,065
Yeah. Nate told me.

251
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,745
God, I would love to go into one of those
sessions and just bark.

252
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,069
Just to see the look on his face.

253
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:25,065
So do you totally identify
with this book too?

254
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:28,350
Of course she does.
It's about her.

255
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:31,427
What?

256
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,074
She's Charlotte.

257
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,070
You're shitting me.

258
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,440
Is he for real?

259
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,994
Completely.

260
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,878
Oh, my God.

261
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,315
Oh, my God.

262
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,637
This is like meeting Gandhi or Jesus.

263
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,754
Don't tell me.
The book spoke to you.

264
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,271
Like it was written specifically for you.

265
00:23:57,682 --> 00:24:00,197
Well, yeah, in a way.

266
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,075
Have you been to the website?

267
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:04,513
- There's a website?
- Oh, yes.

268
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,395
There's a fan club.

269
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:10,762
Yeah. Those lonely little girls
desperate for something to emulate.

270
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:14,361
Apparently, they're not original enough
to come up with anything on their own.

271
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,239
Well, that's what I like to see,
drinking before sundown.

272
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,122
Hi, I'm Billy.

273
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:35,965
- I'm Claire.
- How do you know my sister?

274
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:39,639
Through my brother Nate.
They're dating.

275
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,367
Oh, yeah? Dating?
Like what, going steady?

276
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,765
He give her his ID bracelet?

277
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,962
She carve his initials in her arms
so they'd be there forever?

278
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,841
Yo, Bren.

279
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:57,087
You should've seen me
out on the ocean today.

280
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:00,250
All those Venice dicks
taking themselves so seriously.

281
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:07,326
- You surf?
- Me? Do I look like I surf?

282
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:09,849
Do I?

283
00:25:10,654 --> 00:25:14,124
You'll freeze your ass off
at this time of year, wearing that thing.

284
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,484
So? It's my ass.

285
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:20,610
Oh, fine. You wanna get pneumonia
again, go right ahead.

286
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,692
Claire, I should take you home.
I got stuff to do.

287
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:27,575
- That's all right, I'll take her.
- Great.

288
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,452
Oh, no, I've got time.
We just need to go right now.

289
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,648
If you have stuff to do,
don't worry about it.

290
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:36,088
Yeah, do your stuff.

291
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:38,175
I just have to take a shower.

292
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,212
So I'm walking along one day, and this
asshole stops me and asks if I'm all right.

293
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:00,412
He says I got a look.

294
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:05,696
He'd seen a man with that same
look once and had ignored it.

295
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:10,613
And that man had jumped out
a nine-story window.

296
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:17,377
Do you know the reconstruction
involved in a death like that?

297
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:24,617
This business gets under your skin.
It's like a fucking virus.

298
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:27,215
You can even see it on your face.

299
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,218
Smell it on you.

300
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:32,418
What the hell is this place?
This music?

301
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:36,423
Since when do you listen
to the Classics IV?

302
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,178
What did you do here?
Who the hell are you?

303
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:44,620
So many questions. Why couldn't you
ask them when I was still alive?

304
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,943
It's okay. I couldn't have answered
most of them anyway.

305
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:52,823
Unlike now.
Now I'm a fucking prophet.

306
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,463
Right.

307
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,059
You think I'm kidding, buddy boy?

308
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:05,624
That's one of the perks of being dead.
You know what happens after you die...

309
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,541
...and you know the meaning of life.

310
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:15,343
- That seems fairly useless.
- Yeah, I know.

311
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:18,148
Life is wasted on the living.

312
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:27,505
- Could've told me you were proud of me.
- You were never around for me to tell.

313
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:30,828
Which is exactly
what I was proud of you for.

314
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:35,795
Therein lies your Catch-22.

315
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,667
- So, what's the meaning of life?
- You really wanna know?

316
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:51,434
I don't know.

317
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,914
Will it fuck me up if I do?

318
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:45,561
Oh, David, you make
such a handsome deacon.

319
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:50,080
All those old stiffs.
Finally, a dose of Viagra to the place.

320
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh, I don't mean that literally.
Not like you'd need it.

321
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,765
Thank you, Tracy.

322
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,961
So... No fianc'ee, huh?

323
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,843
No, no. That's over.

324
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,167
But she broke my heart,
and I'm just not ready...

325
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,885
...or interested in any sort
of relationship now.

326
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:11,447
- Come on, any relationship?
- I'm just not ready.

327
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:14,212
And I doubt that I will be
for quite some time.

328
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:18,690
Well, what if Cindy Crawford
were to walk up to you and say:

329
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,770
"Just use me for sex"?

330
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:25,729
- I would say no.
- Liar.

331
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:36,888
Is it so wrong
to want a little human contact?

332
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:41,573
You're lonely too.
I can tell.

333
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,732
For chrissake, Tracy.

334
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,415
What does it take?
No.

335
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:50,893
Well, you don't have to be
so mean about it.

336
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:53,532
Apparently, I do.
I come here to feed these people...

337
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,377
...because I don't want
to talk to anybody.

338
00:29:56,578 --> 00:30:00,811
Do us both a favor. Go to a bar.
Pick somebody up.

339
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,494
- No. We just met.
- I know. I'm sorry.

340
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,653
I'm just so turned on by you.

341
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:19,378
Shut up.

342
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,578
- I have to go home.
- Hey...

343
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:31,174
- I wanna see you again.
- Good.

344
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:35,701
But I'm not some skank
for you to fuck.

345
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,943
If that's what you're into,
go and find that somewhere else.

346
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:41,420
That's not what I'm into, Claire.

347
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,096
I swear.

348
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:52,699
If you're lying, I swear to God,
I will kill you.

349
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,699
I will kick your ass.

350
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,341
You do not want to mess with me.

351
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:48,304
- That ain't her.
- Excuse me?

352
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:53,553
That ain't my wife. That ain't my Hattie.
What did you do with my Hattie?

353
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:56,110
Mr. Jones, with all due respect...

354
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,390
I don't want your respect.
I want my wife.

355
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,634
Sir, that is your wife.

356
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,988
- You married?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,516
She all young and pretty,
know how to treat you right?

358
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,472
Yes, sir.

359
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,912
You can't believe how lucky
you are.

360
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:24,154
How life can be so good
to you, right?

361
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,636
She gonna turn to that.

362
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:33,512
We all do.

363
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,078
Well, don't that piss you off, boy?

364
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,677
Not yet.

365
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:45,038
- He used this how long?
- Seven years.

366
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:49,560
It's weird how you keep showing me
rooms people used to live in.

367
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:55,682
I think it's fucking weird. He'd sit in this
sad little room, doing God knows what.

368
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,483
Why does it have to be sad?

369
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:01,759
Look around.

370
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:07,198
- I think it's fascinating.
- Really? Why?

371
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,802
It's such a mystery, you know?

372
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:15,083
- You'll never know what went on here.
- That's exactly what's driving me crazy.

373
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,927
So, what if you did know?
Had it all explained to you.

374
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,043
I bet it wouldn't be nearly
as interesting or fun.

375
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,045
Your father would be a lot more boring.
You enjoy this.

376
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,891
Come on, don't you pick up
on something?

377
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,880
I thought things left marks in people,
in places, in time.

378
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,129
What, you think I'm a witch?

379
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,649
You really don't get any kind of vibe
from this place at all?

380
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:47,171
You wanna know what I think?

381
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:52,886
I think your father...

382
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:57,726
...wanted someplace
that was just his and nobody else's.

383
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:06,970
Nate, if you didn't know him
when he was alive, you never will.

384
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:12,249
I don't want to be somebody who,
when I die, nobody knows who I was.

385
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,330
So don't be.

386
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,740
How are you doing, Mr. Jones?

387
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,695
I'm sitting here, holding my dead wife's
hand. How do you think I'm doing?

388
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:31,690
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

389
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:37,259
- Oh, hello.
- For Jones.

390
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:42,221
Mr. Jones, see the beautiful flowers
for your wife's viewing tomorrow?

391
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't know why you so excited.
They're just gonna shrivel up and die.

392
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,621
Well, thank you.

393
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:57,302
I'll see you out.

394
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:08,824
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but I'll have my sons...

395
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,986
...order flowers from another florist
if this behavior continues.

396
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,422
Which behavior?

397
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:16,507
This is our place of business.
There are grieving people here.

398
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:20,185
I can't have you skulking around
with that look in your eye.

399
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:22,221
What look?

400
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,985
That sex look.

401
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,426
Maybe you like it.

402
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:48,344
Lady wear red, she mean business.

403
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:52,512
This is just what was clean.

404
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:56,913
Lady, I can see it from here.
And I'm blind and deaf.

405
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:59,868
You need to get yourself laid.

406
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,994
Whoa. Time warp.

407
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,156
I told you.

408
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,837
It's pretty cozy.
For a morgue.

409
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:39,719
- It must be weird.
- You get used to it.

410
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,072
You ever done it with anyone here?

411
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,633
Yeah, right, and have
my mother walk in? No.

412
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:48,799
Wow, you look great!

413
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:51,802
- Shut up.
- Come on, seduce me.

414
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:57,484
There you go.
Oh, yeah. There you go.

415
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:00,040
Don't pretend
like you haven't done this before.

416
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:04,398
You are a natural. Look at you.
No, no, don't hide.

417
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:05,959
Wait.

418
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:10,724
Is this what you do?
You, like, shoot models and stuff?

419
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,600
Hardly.

420
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,721
Hurry, it's on a timer.

421
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,521
Just something to remember me by.

422
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,642
Hey, what do you think about Brenda and
your brother? Think they have a chance?

423
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:39,601
I hope so.
She's pretty amazing.

424
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,403
He'd be a real idiot to let her go.

425
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,967
Then again, he's capable
of being an idiot sometimes.

426
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:46,686
Yeah, so why is she into him?
Just hot sex?

427
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:50,169
I think he's really in love with her.

428
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,806
- How could he not be?
- Shit, I'm thirsty.

429
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:57,806
You got any beer?

430
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,811
- No, sorry.
- It's all right.

431
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:03,610
- I should be heading out anyway.
- Oh, okay.

432
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,134
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

433
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:11,129
- Let's do this again.
- Okay.

434
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:23,451
Okay. Mr. Boelson is all juiced up.

435
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:27,616
I'll be in around 7 tomorrow
to airbrush him...

436
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,889
...get him ready for the viewing.

437
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:35,455
Unless, you know,
you want me to do him now.

438
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,970
I was kind of hoping to get home
before Vanessa put Julio down.

439
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,854
That's fine. Good night.

440
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:48,701
Need any help?

441
00:38:49,782 --> 00:38:52,171
No, Federico.
Go home to your family.

442
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:56,094
Don't work too hard.

443
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,905
Mr. Jones.

444
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,502
Time to go home.

445
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:35,862
Who the hell are you?

446
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,704
I'm Nate. I work here.

447
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:47,622
- That's my wife in that box.
- I know.

448
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:50,784
- I'm very sorry.
- Fifty-six years I spent...

449
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:54,348
...sleeping in the same bed
with that woman.

450
00:39:56,353 --> 00:40:01,427
Fifty-six years of listening to her
talk about the same shit.

451
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,432
Day in, day out.

452
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:07,512
- It's late. Maybe I should drive you home.
- Shut the fuck up, boy.

453
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:11,390
- Let an old man speak.
- Okay.

454
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:16,228
She...

455
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:21,909
...chased me across the front yard with
a steak knife once. Tried to cut my ass.

456
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:25,308
We spent close to a year apart.

457
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:28,351
That time like a hole in me now.

458
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:36,717
She the only one who really knew me.

459
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,309
Your wife will always be with you
in your memories.

460
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,278
You love someone that much,
they never...

461
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,440
You sell that shit to somebody
who buying it, because I ain't.

462
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:52,716
You don't know nothing about love.

463
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:58,596
Some pretty little thing catches your eye,
next thing you know, it's been 56 years.

464
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:01,192
And you done shit all over yourself
in a movie theater...

465
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:04,042
...and she the only one
to help you clean it up.

466
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,314
That's love.

467
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,799
You don't know nothing.

468
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:22,805
I won't argue that.

469
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:28,956
Can I get you anything to drink?
I have beer, red wine, a little vodka.

470
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,478
No, just water, thanks.

471
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:37,045
I don't usually go out on a school night,
but you know how it is sometimes.

472
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:38,921
Yeah.

473
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:45,399
Here you go.
My ex.

474
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,920
We were together nearly two years,
then he dumped me for a 22-year-old...

475
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,520
...stand-in he met on location.

476
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:55,485
I think that's the only picture
I had of him I didn't tear up.

477
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:59,002
It's funny, you think
you know somebody, and...

478
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,690
I hear he's in AA now.

479
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,929
So are you in the business?

480
00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:12,405
No. No, I'm a lawyer.
I'm from Boston.

481
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:15,488
God, how refreshing.

482
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:18,004
You tend to forget sometimes,
living in L. A...

483
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:22,009
...that there's this world
outside the entertainment industry...

484
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:24,411
...and that's the real world.

485
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:29,050
So, what do you do?

486
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:33,609
- Production accounting. I told you that.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,296
It's okay.

488
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:39,690
So, Jim...

489
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:44,135
...what do you like to do?

490
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,977
- Can we sit down?
- Sure.

491
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,778
Had a little too much
to drink there, Jim?

492
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,061
- You okay?
- Yeah.

493
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:48,179
I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

494
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:49,538
It's okay.

495
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:52,310
I should never have lashed out
at you like that. It's...

496
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,626
I don't know
what's wrong with me. L...

497
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,220
I was holding a saucepan
the other day...

498
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:05,623
...and all of a sudden, I remembered
making creamed corn in that pan.

499
00:44:06,192 --> 00:44:08,581
Some night
when it was raining outside...

500
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:12,024
...and both the boys had colds and my
husband was on a call...

501
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,791
...picking up a body.

502
00:44:13,993 --> 00:44:16,905
And then yesterday,
I was cleaning out the cabinets...

503
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,503
...and I found a jar of baby food
in the very back.

504
00:44:19,754 --> 00:44:23,144
Strained carrots
from when Claire was a baby.

505
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:27,348
That jar had been sitting there
for over 15 years.

506
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:31,512
I am surrounded by these...

507
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:36,586
These relics
of a life that no longer exists.

508
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:55,916
We're here for the Jones viewing.

509
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,956
Right this way, please.

510
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,276
- Yeah?
- Oh, shit, Billy, did I wake you?

511
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:11,952
- I'm sorry. Fuck.
- Who is this?

512
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:14,198
It's Claire.

513
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:20,432
- Who?
- It's Claire. Nate's sister.

514
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:26,797
I just wanted to see if maybe you wanted
to hang out after school again today.

515
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:28,916
Not really,

516
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:32,919
Come on, Claire,
you're what, 16?

517
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:37,314
What do you think I am, a pedophile?

518
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,163
Well?

519
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,691
I don't know
what you want me to say.

520
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:12,850
I don't want you to say anything.
I just thought you should see it.

521
00:46:14,652 --> 00:46:16,768
Well, I've seen it.

522
00:46:16,972 --> 00:46:21,603
So Dad traded a room for a funeral.
No wonder we never had any money.

523
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,849
Didn't Dad ever say anything
about this place?

524
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:27,933
Dad and I never talked
about anything but work.

525
00:46:28,174 --> 00:46:30,642
That's exactly the relationship
you and I have.

526
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:35,171
Nate, people are allowed
to have private lives.

527
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,967
So what if Dad had a secret room?

528
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:39,212
I don't care if he brought
women here to fuck.

529
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:42,533
I don't care if he brought men
back here to fuck.

530
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:47,050
You think we should tell Mom
about it?

531
00:46:47,257 --> 00:46:50,534
Sure, why not? You won't be happy
until this whole family is in therapy.

532
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:56,288
That's kind of a leap.

533
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,135
I know you're pissed off
about a lot of shit.

534
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,331
But I didn't make any of that shit
happen. Right, I abandoned you.

535
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:05,100
Well, you know what?
I'm not your father. I'm not the one...

536
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,576
...whose responsibility it was not
to abandon you, so get over it, please.

537
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,051
Life is just too fucking short.

538
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:16,938
Thank you, Nate.
I appreciate your honesty.

539
00:47:17,142 --> 00:47:20,054
Wrapped, as it was,
in such a bouquet of condescension.

540
00:47:21,782 --> 00:47:26,937
If I were you, I'd pack this place up
before they start charging us rent.

541
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:25,502
Quite a hottie, huh?

542
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:27,385
This is Mom.

543
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:32,066
You have no idea how beautiful
she was, buddy boy.

544
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:35,388
I have no idea who you were.

545
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:39,073
I really wasn't that interesting.

546
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:42,633
No, I think you probably were.

547
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:48,590
I think you were this great guy,
who was funny and weird and high.

548
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:54,869
I was just always so afraid
of everything you did.

549
00:48:55,077 --> 00:48:56,556
Death.

550
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,268
I made the decision to become a fucking
undertaker because I thought it was...

551
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,276
...something you believed in.
Now I find out...

552
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,834
...you think running away
is the best thing I ever did?

553
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:14,795
- Maybe.
- I kept us from selling to Kroehner.

554
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,359
And I'm taking the funeral director's
license test next month.

555
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:25,159
Maybe I was just covering up for how
embarrassed I was when you left.

556
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,476
Is that why you left half
the business to me?

557
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:34,032
- To get back at me?
- Maybe.

558
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:36,957
Maybe I wanted to see if you
had the balls to go against me.

559
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:40,713
Or maybe I really wanted you to have it.
You'll never know.

560
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:45,077
Goddamn it! When are you gonna stop
fucking with me?

561
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,640
When are you gonna stop caring
what I thought?

562
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,798
"I never knew my father. "

563
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:55,564
Get over it, please.

564
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:59,005
Life is just too fucking short.

565
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:13,408
My brother is a very complicated man.

566
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:15,885
And very high-maintenance.

567
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,440
Don't get me wrong,
I love him dearly.

568
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,927
But I pity the woman
he ends up with.

569
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,526
See, that's the same thing
I'd say about my brother.

570
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,530
Nate is not even
in the same league.

571
00:50:28,732 --> 00:50:31,326
Was I crazy?

572
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,331
I mean,
Billy was really acting like...

573
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:37,604
Did you fuck him?

574
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:40,128
No.

575
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:43,089
Well, you dodged a bullet there.

576
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:45,973
Is every man alive a total asshole?

577
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:50,646
At some point or another.
Then again, so are we.

578
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:54,251
Come on, we gotta go.

579
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:59,207
I still cannot get over the fact
that you are Charlotte, Light and Dark,

580
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:01,806
You have to,
because it's very irritating.

581
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:12,898
- Mr. Jones is still downstairs.
- I know.

582
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:19,330
This silver has been in
your father's family for three generations.

583
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,140
I don't believe I've ever used it.

584
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,131
I'm going to put an ad in the paper
and see if I can sell them.

585
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:30,132
Mom, I found something
you probably should have.

586
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:50,381
- Where did you find these?
- In the office, among Dad's things.

587
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:54,462
Look at what a child I was.

588
00:51:58,066 --> 00:52:01,183
Your father was leaving for Vietnam.

589
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:04,140
He'd volunteered as a medic.

590
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:06,702
Your grandfather was furious.

591
00:52:08,507 --> 00:52:11,466
You don't remember
your grandfather, do you?

592
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:12,896
No.

593
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:16,666
He was a very unhappy man...

594
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:20,585
...and he wanted everyone else
to be unhappy too.

595
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,624
We were all living in this house.

596
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,547
You were a baby,
and there was no privacy, so...

597
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:34,950
Nathaniel and I got a room
at a motel.

598
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,671
Some seedy place in the valley.

599
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:50,672
And we made love like maniacs.

600
00:52:53,354 --> 00:52:55,915
Like it was the last time.

601
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:02,748
Your father took these pictures...

602
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:06,315
...in that dank little room.

603
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:14,754
Told me he kept them in his pocket
in Vietnam to protect him.

604
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,270
It's frightening
how much we change.

605
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,116
Are you staying for dinner, dear?

606
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:38,194
Yeah.

607
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:47,121
Mr. Jones. Probably should think
about heading home.

608
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:50,918
You've got a long day ahead of you
tomorrow with the funeral and...

609
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:53,763
Mr. Jones?

610
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,761
Mr. Jones.

611
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:03,756
Mr. Jones?

612
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:08,803
Oh, shit.

613
00:55:59,553 --> 00:56:44,108
