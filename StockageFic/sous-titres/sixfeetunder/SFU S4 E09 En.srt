1
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,791
- <i>I'll see if they need anyone at the store</i>.
- You know something, I need money.

2
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,311
- My rent is overdue and you're not helping.
- <i>You could sell something</i>.

3
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,353
How about you loan me some cashola
from your trust fund instead?

4
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,598
<i>You could sell me your Justice League</i>
<i>of America Versus The Alien series</i>.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>A guy on eBay sold one last week for 500</i>.

6
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,915
- For the whole series? That's bullshit!
- <i>Swear to God</i>.

7
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,396
The auction was rigged.
Besides, I need more than that.

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,911
<i>Wanna know what you could sell that'd</i>
<i>pay your rent for the next three months?</i>

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,159
- What?
- <i>Blue Twister, 1941, issue number one</i>.

10
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,910
- No fucking way. Can't do it.
- <i>It's worth three grand easy</i>.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,951
I know what it's worth, Norbert.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
<i>I'll give you 2,500 for it</i>.

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,310
- You just told me it was worth three.
- <i>So? How bad do you want to pay your rent?</i>

14
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,318
No way, I'm never selling it.

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,750
In fact, I'm going to be buried with it.
It's in my will.

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,597
<i>Yeah, right</i>.

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,597
<i>Larry? Larry?</i>

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,118
<i>Larry, you there?</i>

19
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,035
- Morning, fellas.
- Good morning.

20
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,548
Morning, Nate.

21
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,795
Rough night?

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,039
A little rough. I miss sleeping in my own bed.
I miss the boys, I miss Vanessa.

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,152
Not me, slept like a baby.

24
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,592
Dropped Maya off over Bettina's with Mom.

25
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,313
- How's she doing?
- Maya's fine.

26
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,592
If you want to know how my mother is,
she said call her and ask her yourself.

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,190
So when's she coming back?

28
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,711
I haven't the slightest idea.
Apparently, she still needs some space.

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,719
- You do want her to come back home, right?
- Of course.

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,753
Well, with all due respect,
why don't you get off your ass, go over there,

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,075
eat crow and bring her back home?

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,557
Because that's just what she wants me to do
and I'm not playing that game.

33
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,798
Yeah. Yeah, that's the way I'd play it.

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,078
You guys are more pathetic than I am.

35
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,478
<i>I woke up in the night and you weren't there</i>.

36
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,910
You were out here watching television again.

37
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,599
Yeah, I watched Jaws 3.

38
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,429
I drank too much green tea.
I kept having to get up to pee.

39
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,398
I am so glad we're not doing
that whole open relationship thing any more.

40
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,158
Me, too.

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,589
You are? Really?

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,117
You're not just saying that
because I said I'm glad?

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,752
No.

44
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,953
David, I have to come clean with you
about something.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,797
What?

46
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,392
I had sex with someone after we decided not
to sleep with anyone outside the relationship.

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,594
- We said we weren't gonna do that any more.
- I know, but I fucked up.

48
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,235
- So who did you sleep with? Javier?
- No. Celeste.

49
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,390
OK, bullshit.

50
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,032
I'm serious.

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,271
Celeste is a woman, isn't she?

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,912
She is.

53
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,350
But I've slept with women before.
You know that.

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,112
You're serious? You slept with Celeste?

55
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,709
It was just once. It was an accident.

56
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,477
You were walking by
and just happened to fall into her vagina?

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,991
It just happened. I'm sorry it happened,
but it did and I felt I should tell you.

58
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,232
You haven't secretly decided to switch teams?

59
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,475
No. No way.

60
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,517
OK.

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,391
But OK.

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,597
Edie?

63
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,474
What are you doing here?

64
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,670
Hello. I'm Edie's friend Anita.

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,353
I just needed to talk to her.

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,595
Is she, like, home?

67
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,473
- Yeah.
- Well, can I come in?

68
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,035
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Why the fuck not?

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,675
She's just kind of over you for the moment,
that's all.

70
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,871
Oh, I see. Why?

71
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,471
Because you were a lesbian for about
two minutes, then suddenly you weren't.

72
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,108
On top of that, she said you got all grossed
out by her pussy. That was totally not cool.

73
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,158
OK, for the record,
I was not grossed out by her pussy.

74
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,548
OK, pussy, per se, does not gross me out.
I just didn't know what exactly to do with it.

75
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,469
It wasn't personal.
It just didn't do it for me, you know?

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,556
I'll pass that along.

77
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,349
No, we weren't related.

78
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,119
We used to work at Hi-De-Ho together.

79
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,518
- Is that a grocery store?
- It's a comic book store in Santa Monica.

80
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,631
Did he have a family, someone locally
or out of state, we could contact?

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,591
We're pretty much it.

82
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,838
I guess that's why he designated me
to be the executor of his estate.

83
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,316
We were all in the West Co
Blue Twister Society together.

84
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,194
Blue Twister?
The guy who can turn into a human tornado?

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,951
Yeah, or shoot smaller tornadoes
from his fingertips with the strength of an F5,

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,911
the strongest tornado there is.

87
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,796
His name was Alan Talbot, a scientist doing
research in a machine called the Vortexicon.

88
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,435
It was a prototype
for a nuclear-powered particle accelerator.

89
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,995
- Something went horribly wrong.
- He turned into the Blue Twister.

90
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,955
I read it when I was a kid.
I had no idea he had a society.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,594
It's kind of an unofficial fan club.

92
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,511
Anyway...

93
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,996
..he wanted to be buried with...

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,359
..this.

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,996
It's issue number one from 1941.

96
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,634
It's extremely rare.

97
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,671
Extremely valuable.

98
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,832
Last thing he said before the shelf fell on him
was he wanted to be buried with it.

99
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,953
We were on the phone when it happened.
He made this noise like...

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
And then I hung up and called 911.

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,753
We're very sorry for your loss.

102
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,435
Oh, honey, that's terrific.

103
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,951
Marcie's lawyer poked so many holes in
the case, the Feds dropped the charges.

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,956
Wonderful.

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,675
I don't like lawyers,
but you give him a blow job if you have to.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,278
OK, sweetie, I'll talk to you soon. OK, bye.

107
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,711
- That's a relief.
- It certainly is.

108
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,069
You wanna help Grandma fold laundry?

109
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,908
- No.
- No? That's OK.

110
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,953
You just sit there
and be your adorable little self.

111
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,990
- We should get out and do something today.
- OK, what?

112
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,794
I came up with the zoo.
It's your turn to come up with something.

113
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,954
- We could go to the park.
- We've been to the park almost every day.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,275
Maya loves the park.

115
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,197
<i>We've been through thisl</i>

116
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,835
- Getting on your nerves, aren't we?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,348
- Like us to leave?
- I didn't say that.

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,235
- Are you sure?
- If I wanted you to leave, you'd know it.

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,190
Think big, Fisher. Think different. Something...
The sky's the limit.

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,630
I'm tired of coming up with all the ideas
in this marriage.

121
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,992
- This isn't a marriage.
- It's starting to feel like one.

122
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,838
I don't suppose
you want to make up with your hubby?

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,511
I'm not ready.

124
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,271
What if I told Nate to take Maya back
to daycare for the next couple of days?

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,595
- That's a start.
- What would you like to do?

126
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,553
No, you're missing the point.
What would you like to do?

127
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,872
George is always talking about his travels.
I thought we'd have adventures together.

128
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,356
- So far he hasn't taken me anywhere.
- So?

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,439
- Let's go on a road trip.
- Now you're talkin'.

130
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,870
- Where do you wanna go?
- Someplace exotic.

131
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,791
God, I love you!

132
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,348
- What, you can't handle that?
- Come on.

133
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,799
You can't, can you?

134
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,437
- Come on, Bren. I just came over here to...
- To what? Fuck my brains out?

135
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,473
You know what? You're right.
I can't handle this right now.

136
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,318
I need to know what you feel for me, Nate.

137
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,669
- Do you feel anything?
- Yeah, of course I do, Brenda.

138
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,958
God, look. I just spent the past year
dealing with losing somebody, OK?

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,468
Losing everything I committed myself to.

140
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,239
It wasn't even that good, when I'm perfectly
honest with myself, so I don't want...

141
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,432
- You want me to be available for sex without...
- No, I don't want anything, OK?

142
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,950
- This is too intense! I have a daughter now.
- That is so lame.

143
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,118
- What is lame about having a daughter?
- Using that as an excuse.

144
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,996
- I could be part of both your...
- No, you couldn't.

145
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,517
- I have to go.
- Yeah, fine, go.

146
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,795
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Just go, go, go.

147
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,998
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Vanessa, it's me.

148
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,510
- <i>Hang on. Juliol</i>
- No, no, no, wait.

149
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,154
- <i>Hi, Papi</i>.
- Hey, Julio.

150
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,910
I wasn't done talking to Mommy.

151
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,918
- <i>She doesn't want to talk to you</i>.
- She doesn't?

152
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,350
- <i>No</i>.
- OK.

153
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,709
How's my little man?

154
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,955
- <i>Good</i>.
- Yeah, yeah.

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,471
- <i>When are you coming home?</i>
- Soon. Papi's just been busy at work lately.

156
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,512
- <i>I love you, Papi</i>.
- I love you, too.

157
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,557
Hey, baby.

158
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,191
Nice!

159
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,110
So, where are we going?

160
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,958
- Rosarita Beach.
- Mexico?

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,309
That's not too far, is it?

162
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,351
Four hours, tops.

163
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,595
It's your trip, you're driving.

164
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,949
OK, then you're the navigator.

165
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,679
I did all the research.

166
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,556
I got a map from the internet and a list of all
the haciendas and I made us a reservation.

167
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,592
It's the off-season and everything's reduced.

168
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,191
Yeah, what the fuck? Let's go to Mexico!

169
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,794
It's not like I have to cross a bridge every day.

170
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,832
I never have to cross bridges, but...

171
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,872
I think about crossing them constantly.

172
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,757
You're talking metaphorically.

173
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,679
No, I'm talking about literal bridges.

174
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,712
Did anything bad ever happen to you
on a bridge?

175
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,671
No.

176
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,917
Did anything bad happen
to someone you love on a bridge?

177
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,990
They collapse all the time. If you Google
"bridge collapses", you get a thousand hits.

178
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,431
And you're worried that if you cross a bridge,
it'll collapse?

179
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,870
- Yes.
- That's a phobia, Byron.

180
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,911
I know that.

181
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,548
I want you to try something for me.

182
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,871
I want you to imagine

183
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,471
that you're walking down the street
and you come to a bridge...

184
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,397
- But I wouldn't, I would go around it.
- You can't. Going around it's not an option.

185
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,229
- I don't like this.
- It's just a short bridge.

186
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,994
Just imagine...

187
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,873
you're walking across it...

188
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,795
and it doesn't collapse.

189
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
Now you're on the other side, safe and sound.

190
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,235
- No, I'm not.
- You're not?

191
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,078
No, halfway across, I jumped off.

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,992
Are you taking any medication at the moment?

193
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,429
40 milligrams of Prozac.

194
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,115
OK, I have to check in with my supervisor,
Dr Kee, OK?

195
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,754
So we'll be right back.

196
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,674
I don't think he's suicidal.
I think he's phobic and I think he has OCD.

197
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,671
I think you might be right.

198
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,592
I'll up his Prozac and see if that helps.

199
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,393
I'd like to address his behaviour.

200
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,513
- Want to force him to walk across a bridge?
- No.

201
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,790
Yes, gradually.

202
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,194
You've got a real knack for this, Brenda, but
you can't just force someone who's phobic

203
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,834
- to face their fears.
- Why not?

204
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,352
You have to be more patient. Someone like
Byron might never get over his phobia.

205
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,439
Then what is the point
of continuing his therapy?

206
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,358
Maybe it's the one thing
that keeps him from jumping off a bridge.

207
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,999
I think we can do better than that.

208
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,919
Hey.

209
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,748
- Hey, did you hear?
- Hear what?

210
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,758
Professor Pope. She got in a car accident.

211
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,635
- She's dead?
- No. No, she just suffered internal injuries.

212
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,753
- She's gonna be out for at least a month.
- But she's going to be OK?

213
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,636
Yeah. Well, I mean, that depends on
your definition of "serious internal injuries".

214
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,028
If she punctured her gall bladder, she'll be fine.
Apparently we don't even need it.

215
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,279
But, if it's her liver or lungs
or something more vital, then it's not so good.

216
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,633
What if it was her labia?
Wouldn't that be totally tragic for her?

217
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,709
Why are you looking at me like I'm a retard?

218
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,479
Because I swear, Russell, sometimes you are.

219
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,116
And for your information,
labia are not internal organs.

220
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,717
Hello, everybody, my name is Billy Chenowith.

221
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,274
I'll be your sub for the rest of the semester.

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,992
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

223
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,919
..until then, you guys are unfortunately mine.

224
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,032
Hey.

225
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,869
- Oh, God, I feel so guilty.
- Why?

226
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,911
For being alive.

227
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,357
I wanted Lisa gone.
I just wanted her out of my life.

228
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,595
But you didn't make it happen.

229
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,433
- It should've been me.
- Oh, God, no.

230
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,031
No. Nate, too many people
love you and need you.

231
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,398
Your family, Maya.

232
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,558
I need you, I need you so much.

233
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,040
That's the problem.

234
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,312
You're so full of holes.
You're this gaping bottomless pit of need.

235
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,319
You neurotic, tedious, self-absorbed bitch!

236
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,918
Hey!

237
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,394
- Move it!
- Fuck off, you stupid bitch!

238
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,477
<i>He turns waste into black gold</i> -
<i>oil and gasoline</i>.

239
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,552
<i>The amount of waste out there is enormous</i>.

240
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,390
<i>12 billion tons of solid waste produced</i>
<i>each year in the United States alone</i>.

241
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,036
<i>It takes the nation's dump trucks</i>
<i>323 million trips</i>

242
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,435
<i>to carry all that trash</i>.

243
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,029
<i>But some say there's more than rubbish</i>
<i>in the landfills</i>.

244
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,030
<i>Brian Appel's company believes there are</i>
<i>riches</i> - <i>a renewable energy resource</i>.

245
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,675
<i>We open this valve</i>
<i>and the oil comes out from here</i>.

246
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,999
<i>They're turning waste into fuel and they've</i>
<i>invented an ingenious new technology</i>...

247
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,517
That's OK.

248
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,789
That's OK, that's OK.

249
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,795
Life is a series of accidents.

250
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,836
One after another.

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,154
OK. Well, now we know
the reason it was so cheap.

252
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,397
- It's a dump.
- It's not a dump.

253
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,877
It's rustic.

254
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,759
It just needs a little maid service, that's all.

255
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,473
- At least we can see the ocean.
- Well, there's that.

256
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,597
I made a terrible decision
and brought us to a horrible place.

257
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,393
Oh, come on, it's Rosarita.

258
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,829
We're in a foreign country, Fisher.

259
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,271
Horrible and terrible are underrated qualities
when travelling in a foreign country.

260
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,632
- They often lead to fun and adventure.
- Really and truly?

261
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,070
Know the saying, "You can't make
chicken salad out of chickenshit"?

262
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,429
I don't believe I've ever heard that one.

263
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,871
Well, I'm here to tell you, you can and I have.

264
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,791
I was in Patagonia for a while. Unbelievable
how cheaply you can live down there.

265
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,195
Then I got amoebic dysentery.

266
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,392
My grant money finally ran out
so I figured, time to head back to the States.

267
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,639
That's when I got the call from Dean Perelli
about filling in for Carolyn Pope.

268
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,673
The fact that Carolyn Pope is tenured
blows my mind.

269
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,280
What can I say? Shit definitely rolls uphill.

270
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,311
You don't think she's any good?

271
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,592
Well, she's strictly academic.

272
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,672
Muffin?

273
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,636
How's Brenda?

274
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,269
We haven't spoken in almost a year.

275
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,233
I guess you could say
we're officially estranged.

276
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,316
What's going on with you?

277
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,392
I don't know. I guess I'm depressed.

278
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,831
I don't think it's clinical, but...

279
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,715
.. I just can't seem to have a normal,
healthy relationship with another person.

280
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,799
Right. Get in line.
Nobody has normal, healthy relationships.

281
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,472
My theory, which is yet to be put into practice,
is to pick someone slightly less crazy than you.

282
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,835
Society propagates this vision of people
hooking up and staying together forever.

283
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,350
In reality,
how often does that actually happen?

284
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,313
I think it all comes down
to basic animal chemistry.

285
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,390
If you get the chemistry wrong, it's bleach
and that shit that makes bleach explode.

286
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
- Right, I think it's ammonia.
- Ammonia.

287
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,031
Yeah, I hear you.

288
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,912
You know, I think, like, you start out

289
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,919
with whatever your fucking parents
and their sick-fuck gene pools stick you with,

290
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,236
but if you see enough shrinks for long enough,

291
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,919
when you get your cocktail right,

292
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,996
then you can

293
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,032
get over yourself, have a life.

294
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,795
I wonder if there's a cocktail that can
make you compatible with someone else.

295
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,356
I sure as shit hope so.

296
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,436
Dig in, guys.

297
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,638
- These are mushrooms?
- Giant portobellos, the best.

298
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,636
The filet mignon of fungi.

299
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,355
If you wanted a filet mignon,
why not just eat a filet mignon?

300
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,199
Do you know how many units of caloric energy
it takes to make a single calorie of beefsteak?

301
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,708
No, but I've a feeling you're about to tell me.

302
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,108
78 calories of fossil fuel
for every calorie of beef protein.

303
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,152
The meat industry,
along with most of the agribusiness,

304
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,839
is completely and utterly unsustainable.

305
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,077
- So we shouldn't eat meat?
- Meat isn't the problem.

306
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,839
It's how far away from the table
food is produced.

307
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,635
If it's produced locally,
it's not just fresher, it's less wasteful.

308
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,798
I used to work at a food coop in Seattle.
We used to hunt for chanterelles.

309
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,870
I read somewhere
that mushrooms are grown in dung.

310
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,515
- Everything organic is grown in dung.
- What do you think fertiliser is?

311
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,599
These, I believe,
were grown in sheep dung in Ventura.

312
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,073
Evening, gentlemen.

313
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,317
David, care to join us for dinner?

314
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,911
- George grilled some portobello mushrooms.
- They were fertilised in sheep dung.

315
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,591
No, thanks. I'm going home to my husband.

316
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,471
You guys have fun.

317
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,150
I know it's a period piece
and a presidential biopic,

318
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,273
but what most people don't realise
is that William Howard Taft,

319
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,589
aside from being the fattest president ever,
was also, like, this underdog and a rebel.

320
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,837
He was kind of like the Eminem of his day.

321
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,398
Yeah, Sean Penn would be totally awesome,
but would he be willing to put on 150 pounds?

322
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,790
Yeah. All right. Yeah, listen, man, I gotta go.
I'll check you later.

323
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,628
- Hey, Bren. I haven't seen you in a while.
- Yeah.

324
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,030
- What can I do for you?
- I need a little something.

325
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,995
- What you want? Brownies, catch of the day?
- What do you recommend?

326
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,237
The catch of the day is this pale green shit
from Mendocino.

327
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,592
- It's very sticky, very nice, not too skunky.
- Sounds good.

328
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,192
Thanks.

329
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,351
- We don't eat dinner together any more?
- I thought you were working late.

330
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,119
Well, I'm not.

331
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,355
I'm sorry...

332
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,275
I just ate the last piece.

333
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,990
- But you want me to fix you something?
- No, I think I'll go to Fat Burger.

334
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,951
Alone.

335
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,359
You guys want to play three-handed bridge?

336
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,958
No.

337
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,951
Not me. I'm gonna turn in early. I'm beat.

338
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,037
Yeah, I think I really gotta give Maya her bath.

339
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,917
What the hell was that?

340
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,873
- Whoever the fuck you are, we can see you.
- Yeah, and we've got a gun.

341
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,708
And a phone! So if you don't step out
from behind those drapes...

342
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,912
- We're gonna fill 'em full of holes!
- Don't shoot. No shooting.

343
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,035
- It's you.
- You don't have a gun.

344
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,789
No, but unless you got a good fucking reason
for breaking in...

345
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,638
- I'm calling the cops.
- What the hell is going on?

346
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,557
- Where's Maya?
- In the playpen...

347
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,750
Run for it.

348
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,069
I think you broke my arm.

349
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,518
What the fuck are you doing in my house?

350
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,877
Get up.

351
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,315
You broke in
to steal your dead buddy's comic?

352
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,955
- It was his idea.
- Shut up. It's worth four grand.

353
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,468
Maybe four-and-a-half.

354
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,478
And he wasn't my buddy. I didn't even like him.

355
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,195
- That's it. I'm calling the cops.
- Don't bother, Rico.

356
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,190
I don't care if you liked him or not. His last wish
was to be buried with this. That's what we'll do.

357
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,235
So put it back.

358
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,633
Get the hell out of my house
before I change my mind and call the cops.

359
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,389
I think you broke my fucking arm, dude.

360
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,434
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

361
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,034
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

362
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,396
That's cool with me.

363
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,829
Hey, don't forget your bag of tea.

364
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,157
- This water isn't very hot.
- It's a lukewarm tub.

365
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,554
- Have some of this?
- I don't like tequila.

366
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,910
You know that cold, rubbery lobster dinner
we just ate?

367
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,872
It was probably seething with bacteria.

368
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,392
Couple of swigs of this, we won't be fighting
over who gets to ride the porcelain bus.

369
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,157
We've been in here over ten minutes
and it's not getting any warmer.

370
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,671
- I've half a mind to complain to the manager.
- Go for it, Fisher.

371
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,117
- Do you speak English?
- Yes. How may I help you?

372
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,755
The heater in the Jacuzzi
doesn't seem to be working very well.

373
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,555
I'm sorry, we turn it off after sunset
during the off-season.

374
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,153
My friend and I are paying guests of your motel
and we would like the heater on in the Jacuzzi.

375
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,517
Whether or not it's the off-season
is none of our concern.

376
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,155
You can turn the damned thing on
or give us a full refund.

377
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,829
We can't give you a refund for the room.
You've checked in.

378
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,869
Then we'll check out

379
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,118
and I'll call the credit card company
and have them refuse payment.

380
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,798
I'll turn the heater on in the Jacuzzi,
but only for one half-hour.

381
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,991
Thank you very much.

382
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,999
I don't know what you did in there,
but this baby is cooking like a lobster pot!

383
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,231
Gimme some more of that.

384
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,391
What do you think?

385
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,519
Just remembering the first time I realised
what Dad really did in this house.

386
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,036
I had this dog, Yippie. I found him underneath
my bed and he was already dead

387
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,870
so I wrapped him up in a blanket
and I brought him downstairs to the prep room.

388
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,436
I thought maybe Dad could fix him,
you know, bring him back somehow.

389
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,150
Then I realised
there were all these bodies down there

390
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,151
and they were all dead.

391
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,036
Dad was fixing them, but not bringing anybody
back. He was making them more presentable.

392
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,831
I always thought they were so sad and alone
in the dark down there.

393
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,793
They just needed someone
to come and sit with them.

394
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,831
Yeah, I thought that, too.

395
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,834
Sometimes I still do.

396
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,951
That's you.

397
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,997
That's me.

398
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,755
Where's Dad?

399
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,390
He's not here.

400
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,591
Is this for class?

401
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,677
No, I'm not sure what it's for yet.

402
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,711
Maybe it's just for me.

403
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,072
I love that little coffin refrigerator.

404
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,197
Thank you.

405
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,198
I mean, I still always think about acting out,

406
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,233
but, now when I get in the car and take a drive,

407
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,956
instead of picking up a hooker,
I just go to the Krispy Kreme.

408
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,238
So now I'm addicted to Krispy Kreme
and I'm 40 pounds heavier and...

409
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,796
even my wife doesn't want to,
excuse my French, fuck me.

410
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,234
I'm sorry, someone here tonight
reeks of marijuana.

411
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,394
It's not AA.

412
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,431
No, but it's still against the rules.

413
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,439
I think you should leave
and come back when you're straight or sober.

414
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,677
You're right.

415
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,550
I'm sorry, but...

416
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,034
.. I really need to be here.

417
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,632
I'm...

418
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,071
I need to be here.

419
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,353
I'm really scared about what'll happen to me
if I leave so please don't make me leave.

420
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,269
Thank you.

421
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,870
Hey, buddy boy.

422
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,277
Yippie's dead.

423
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,160
Can you fix him?

424
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,953
I'm sorry, kiddo, but I can't.

425
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,436
I'll tell you what we can do, though.

426
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,069
We can give him a real nice sendoff.

427
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,240
We need something of yours to put in with him.

428
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,757
- He has my blanket.
- Something more personal.

429
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,997
I know. Why don't you climb in with him?
That way he'll never be lonely.

430
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,990
Nate, I'm sorry,
but I have to take something with me.

431
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,873
Being alone for eternity
sucks like you wouldn't believe.

432
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,118
I need something really personal,
like a piece of me.

433
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,192
- I've decided it should be Maya.
- No.

434
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,718
Nate, you know what Dad used to say?
We all have to go sometime.

435
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,272
- Who are you supposed to be?
- Death Man.

436
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,231
I wanted to be the Grim Reaper,
but the folks at Marvel had a copyright on it.

437
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,475
Sorry, kiddo,

438
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,511
you're all coming with me.

439
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,588
I could stay if you want me to.

440
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,679
Yes.

441
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,797
Nobody stays.

442
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,308
Including you.

443
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,318
Sit.

444
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,991
I'm allergic to dogs.

445
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,758
Now, there's the man I married.

446
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,109
Who wants the end piece?

447
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,352
Honey?

448
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,197
Buddy boy?

449
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,790
He liked a lot of things.

450
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,389
His comic book collection, of course.

451
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,113
The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

452
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,712
Every movie that Halle Berry was in,
except Monster's Ball.

453
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,558
For some reason,
he didn't like Monster's Ball.

454
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,309
It's like these guys hit 15
and got stuck in some kind of time warp.

455
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,351
It's kind of scary, isn't it?

456
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,712
It's just depressing how alienated they all look.

457
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,308
Well, from us maybe, but...
Iook at them, they're a community.

458
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,796
This is who they are.

459
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,796
Her name would maybe have been Linda...

460
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,229
- Are you crying?
- No, no.

461
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,071
OK, you know something?
You're acting like a serious freak.

462
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,311
Maybe I am a serious freak.

463
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,312
I don't know what the hell's going on with me.

464
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,351
I love this.

465
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,359
I feel like Butch and Sundance.

466
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,471
Isn't this beautiful?

467
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,470
Going on a beach with a horse...

468
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,996
You want to know what I think?
I think you should just move on.

469
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,590
- You do?
- How long were you two together?

470
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,633
- Since high school.
- That's a long time.

471
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,390
I know a lot of mammals mate for life,
but most primates don't.

472
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,637
We're human beings, not primates.

473
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,515
We share 98.8%
of the same DNA as a chimpanzee.

474
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,156
We're more closely related to them
than they are to gorillas.

475
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,954
Maybe your time with her is over.
You're young enough.

476
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,195
Just go find another one.

477
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,757
Oh, my God, you guys folded my undies.
That is so fucking sweet.

478
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,150
- Is she still living here?
- Evidently.

479
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,993
- Weren't Edie and Anita supposed to be here?
- They were supposed to be, but they're not.

480
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,031
I think it's because of me.

481
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,878
- I thought we were gonna take pictures.
- Dude, nobody brought a camera.

482
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,309
Here, feed the pigeons.

483
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,277
This sucks. Wanna go see a movie?

484
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,512
Not really.

485
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,311
Wanna get something to eat?

486
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,352
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, me neither.

487
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,791
We could drive over to LACMA,
check out the Arbus exhibit.

488
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,037
Why don't you go ahead,
then report back to us?

489
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,077
OK, maybe I will.

490
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,358
Later.

491
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,910
So I heard something.

492
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,909
- What did you hear?
- It was from Edie and Anita.

493
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,988
They said something about
you never having an orgasm.

494
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,759
Edie did a piece on it last night
at Nuts and Jolts.

495
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,519
She did?

496
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,111
"A straight girl wanted to eat my pussy,
but then she changed her mind."

497
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,634
- She said that?
- Verbatim. It was kinda cool, though.

498
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,428
- God, I am so fuckin' embarrassed right now.
- Nah, don't be.

499
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,473
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- No, listen, really, don't be.

500
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,038
- Is it true, though?
- Yes, I changed my mind.

501
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,591
No, I meant about the orgasm.

502
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,155
Because if it is, it's totally cool.

503
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,637
Believe me, most of the women I've been with
have had a hard time.

504
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,718
But I heard about this new technique and
I've been looking forward to trying it out.

505
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,358
Would you like me to try it out with you?

506
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,832
OK.

507
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,349
- I was watching that.
- Too bad.

508
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,790
- You trying to pick a fight with me?
- Maybe I am.

509
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,231
- I thought we were OK about Celeste.
- We were, now we're not.

510
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,273
You can't just be OK with something,
then not be OK for no reason.

511
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,472
Maybe I've had time to think it through
and it's not digesting well.

512
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,034
Take a Tums, why don't you?

513
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,831
I fucked Sarge.

514
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,559
- Who?
- The veiny guy from La Habra.

515
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,797
Who didn't secretly want me
to have women's breasts!

516
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,308
Wait. When did you fuck the veiny guy?

517
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,158
After we agreed not to fuck anybody else.

518
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,196
Why would you ask me not to fuck anybody
if you were gonna fuck somebody yourself?

519
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,234
Because I didn't want you to fuck anyone else.
I wasn't planning on fucking anybody either.

520
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,671
- Well, how was that fair?
- I could do it without it meaning anything.

521
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,632
Believe me,
I can do it without it meaning anything, too.

522
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,155
- What's that mean?
- I wouldn't do it if it meant anything

523
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,918
because I love you.

524
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,875
You are not getting off that easy.

525
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,040
Look, I fucked Celeste, you fucked veiny guy
from La Habra. Tit for tat, we're even.

526
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,632
You don't get to say the word tit to me. Ever.
I'm taking a shower.

527
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,070
Yeah, well, don't blow anybody
while you're in there.

528
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,355
- Pretty good, huh?
- Oh, my God.

529
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,677
You know what it's called?

530
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,595
It has a name?

531
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,191
Grinding the corn.

532
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,271
Grinding the corn?

533
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,791
What's the corn?

534
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,315
You know, with, like, a mortar and pestle.

535
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,798
Only you push the pestle against
the rim of the mortar, not in the bowl.

536
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,437
Yeah.

537
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,712
Hi, Maya.

538
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,318
Come in.

539
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,230
<i>Is he going to be OK?</i>

540
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,709
- It's not my fault, is it?
- Of course not, Fisher.

541
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,955
Probably something wrong with it.

542
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,949
I think I'd like to go home now.

543
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,309
English
