00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
EVERYONE'S WAITING

8
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,288
She's crowning. She's crowning.

9
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,410
Okay, you're doing great.

10
00:01:57,448 --> 00:02:00,368
Just relax. Easy.

11
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,868
Breathe.

12
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:06,856
You're doing fine. Just keep breathing.

13
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,133
Why isn't she crying ?

14
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:20,546
She just needs a little help
getting her airways open.

15
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:24,100
- She's not breathing !
- We're gonna help get her breathing.

16
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,222
Okay...

17
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:40,033
- Is she alive ?
- Yes, she's alive.

18
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,634
Where are they taking her ?

19
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,059
She's so small. So tiny.

20
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,542
Only 2 Ibs. 4 oz.

21
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,209
A very kind nurse told me she's
seen plenty of premature births

22
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:11,749
And she could usually tell which ones...

23
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,232
I don't know if I could...

24
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,655
I-

25
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:21,866
I can't take another child dying.

26
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,284
Anyway, I'm at Cedars-Sinai.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,927
Brenda's in room...

28
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,693
913.

29
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,946
Poor thing, her mother
won't be back until tomorrow.

30
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,322
It's only me here.

31
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:45,033
I'm sure you'll want to come too.

32
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,634
Okay, bye.

33
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,359
I hope you're okay.

34
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:58,082
And I hope you will please
call me and let me know you are.

35
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,190
I know you're mad about
me taking the keys,

36
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,655
But don't be stupid, claire.

37
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:04,603
Yeah, the world is fucked up,

38
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,120
But you ending up in a wheelchair
isn't going to make it any better.

39
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,209
You're too smart.

40
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,932
You're too good.

41
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,378
Don't waste that.

42
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:22,035
Okay, I just turned into my father...

43
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,866
Like exactly. That was my father.

44
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,777
This is what you do to me.

45
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,866
Call me please.

46
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:37,768
When you said go away,
I didn't think you meant "Go away ! "

47
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,978
This is bullshit and you know it.

48
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:42,622
So this is what happens
when I really need you.

49
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,265
It's nice to know I can
depend on you in a crisis.

50
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,518
This is for us.

51
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:51,011
No, this is for you,
you arrogant macho fuck !

52
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,335
You think everybody's supposed to
be so fucking strong all the time !

53
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,603
You can't stand to
see me weak like this.

54
00:04:56,622 --> 00:05:00,287
You're revolted by me.
"This is for us. ". Fucking liar !

55
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:02,579
I meant all four of us,
you fuckin' idiot !

56
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:05,276
- You never even wanted those kids...
- That's not fair.

57
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,013
...and now you honestly think you
can take care of them on your own ?

58
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,327
You're not up to being
a single parent, Keith.

59
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,991
Well, you're not up to
being a parent at all.

60
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,344
You are using this as
an excuse to dump me,

61
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:17,663
Which you've wanted to do ever
since Anthony and Durrell came here !

62
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:19,790
Don't touch me.

63
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:21,682
Come here !

64
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:24,254
- God !
- David, I love you.

65
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,376
But I am those boys' father,

66
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,423
And right now I have to take
care of them, because you can't.

67
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:34,198
You are sick, and I don't
think you can get well here.

68
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:44,006
Jesus, when am I gonna find a
fucking medication that works ?

69
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,386
She has a pretty severe lack
of surfactant in her lungs,

70
00:05:57,592 --> 00:06:01,306
But she is breathing
steadily with a ventilator.

71
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,996
I wanna see her. Why hasn't
somebody brought her in ?

72
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:07,930
Well, she's in an incubator, and she's
hooked up to monitors, a feeding tube.

73
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,395
Then why doesn't
somebody take me to her ?

74
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,766
She's my baby. You
can't keep her from me.

75
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,841
We're still looking for sepsis,
possible bleeds in the brain.

76
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:19,480
- Oh god.
- Most babies born before 30 weeks

77
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:23,362
Experience cranial bleeding
with varying degrees of severity.

78
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:26,381
- When can I see her ?
- As soon as she's ready.

79
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:29,193
I promise you someone
will come take you to her.

80
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,234
Oh god.

81
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:36,738
Don't you worry.

82
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,494
Willa is going to get
through this and be healthy,

83
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:43,133
And she's going to
be home with you soon.

84
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:52,567
And Maya is gonna be home with you too.

85
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,901
I know you don't like kiwi...

86
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:24,189
But, really, I think you need
to give it a second chance.

87
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,372
What ?

88
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:32,000
Was that pushy ?

89
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,855
No.

90
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:41,878
No, it's just I'm eating fruit salad

91
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:45,977
In bed with a naked frat boy
who voted for George Bush.

92
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:52,568
We're listening to what sounds
suspiciously like... christian music ?

93
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,132
It is christian music.

94
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:56,981
What ?

95
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,714
I just hear songs on the radio

96
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,765
And if I like them, I buy the cd.

97
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,540
Oh my god,

98
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:07,423
You might be the most deeply
un-Hip person I've ever met.

99
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:12,653
Ah, seeing how being hip is
primarily an adolescent concern,

100
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,906
I'll take that as a compliment.

101
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,686
You know, if you really are christian...

102
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:24,367
Um, I should probably
tell you I had an abortion.

103
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,902
That's okay...

104
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,071
I sort of paid for one.

105
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:39,357
Well i... didn't really pay for it.

106
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,010
I still have to send her the check.

107
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:53,498
God, I feel like I'm trapped underwater.

108
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,944
And it's not just Nate dying.

109
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,859
I mean, I have absolutely no idea

110
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:01,892
What I am supposed to do with my life.

111
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,934
Don't you still wanna be an artist ?

112
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,734
Yeah.

113
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:18,395
But I'm scared that
maybe I'm not good enough.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,789
Is that true ?

115
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:25,775
- Maybe.
- So get better.

116
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:30,968
I really don't want
to go back to school.

117
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,709
I mean, even though it's art, I still
feel that I'm just being programmed.

118
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:37,324
Just take pictures. If you're
good enough, you'll find out.

119
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:40,108
And if you're not,
you'll get good enough.

120
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:44,207
Or you'll find out you can't.

121
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,501
But I bet you are, though.

122
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,465
Maybe I should take
pictures of you naked.

123
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,734
Okay.

124
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,249
Okay.

125
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,390
But you have to promise that you
won't post them on the internet.

126
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,629
I might want to run for
public office some day.

127
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,000
- Are you serious ?
- Yeah.

128
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,300
Aren't you ?

129
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:49,348
Too bad you don't
believe in anything...

130
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,568
Or you could pray.

131
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,029
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

132
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,597
Fuck !

133
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,517
<i>Come on, charles. You're our hero !</i>

134
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,738
<i>- I'm no hero.
- Sure you are.</i>

135
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:26,090
<i>You've gotta snap out of it. You
have to remember the good times !</i>

136
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,782
<i>- Like when ?
- Like over there !</i>

137
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,835
Uh, boys...

138
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,990
I'm gonna be taking off for a few days.

139
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:40,150
- Why ?
- Well-

140
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,398
'Cause y'all are splittin' up,

141
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,215
And you're gonna leave us
with him. That's why.

142
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,586
- Like we don't know.
- Durrell.

143
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:52,098
- I'm not leaving,
- Yeah, well, why you have a suitcase ?

144
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:58,133
look...

145
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,520
I have to go away for now...

146
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:08,793
Because there's a funeral
directors' conference in portland.

147
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,647
Do you want me to bring
you something back ?

148
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:15,337
Yeah, bring me a silver Escalade.

149
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,422
Durrell, I promise
you I am coming back-

150
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,501
I heard that before !

151
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,164
Are you gonna bathe yours ?

152
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:40,300
Fuffle with it.

153
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:44,112
- Tulips.
- Pretty !

154
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,323
You leave your door open like that ?

155
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:48,436
We were just outside picking flowers.

156
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:52,159
Ruth, it isn't the '50s
anymore, no matter how you dress.

157
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,679
So you're ready to go,
you little monkey ?

158
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,403
No !

159
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,252
- No ? !
- Go where ?

160
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:03,901
Well, back to Brenda's of course.

161
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,943
Brenda said you agreed to that.

162
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,473
Well, yes, but I thought Brenda was
staying in the hospital a little longer.

163
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,957
Brenda's not the one who's sick,

164
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,835
And anyway, she can't
really visit the baby after 10:00 p.m.

165
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,567
So she's coming home tonight.

166
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,317
And the baby's staying in the
hospital an extra couple of weeks.

167
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:34,243
I suppose I'd better
go pack her things then.

168
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,900
That would be helpful, Ruth.

169
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:47,163
So he says the house
alone is worth $2 million.

170
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,609
So 25%, I should be entitled
to half a miion dollars.

171
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,666
- What "should be" ? You are.
- Are we gonna have $1 million ?

172
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:56,478
Mm-Hmm, someday, if you eat your eggs.

173
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,323
You know, I could put half of that
down as a deposit on the new place,

174
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,261
Spend 100 or so on upgrades.

175
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:04,825
The rest would tide us over
until we got things going.

176
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,165
Yeah. You really think this could work ?

177
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,746
You know what, Rico ?
I liked when I helped you out

178
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,184
with that funeral yesterday.

179
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,737
It was sort of like being a nurse,

180
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:16,596
But without all the blood
and bedpans and pills...

181
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,760
And I got to wear better clothes.

182
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,586
Julio, please, eggs.

183
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,915
Augusto thinks they're gross.

184
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,884
Well... they are kind of gross,
But eat 'em anyway.

185
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:28,780
All you gotta do now is get
the Fishers to buy you out.

186
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,958
Or sell...

187
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,259
Preferably to someone who just
wants the house and the land

188
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,475
And wants to shut the business down.

189
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,404
What ?

190
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,174
Nate left his part to Brenda.

191
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,231
I don't think she wants to
be in the funeral business.

192
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,069
I think David's going kind of nuts.

193
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,388
He needs to get out.

194
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,167
Plus, who needs the
competition anyway, you know ?

195
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,867
<i>- Hello ?
- Hi.</i>

196
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,374
I just thought I'd check in with you.

197
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,275
How are you doing ?

198
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,111
<i>Any news about Willa ?</i>

199
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,460
No, and I'm fine.

200
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,000
Doesn't sound very convincing.

201
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,075
Well, I'm sorry, George, but
I have enough to worry about

202
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:23,348
Without having to convince
you how I'm feeling.

203
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:27,775
- Another bad day ?
- Yes, it's a terrible day.

204
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,567
Brenda's mother came and took Maya.

205
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,559
Now I'm alone.

206
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,672
I'm finally completely alone.

207
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:41,155
Oh, honey.

208
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:42,920
<i>You're not alone. You have me.</i>

209
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,765
George, I have to go. David's here.

210
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:53,230
I can't be at home right now.

211
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:56,968
Where will you go ?

212
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,324
Here.

213
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,859
Go put your things upstairs then.
I'll make you some cereal.

214
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:14,177
Would you like it in your yellow bowl ?

215
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,129
Mom, I don't think I've eaten out
of that yellow bowl

216
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,989
Since I was a little boy.

217
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,631
Yeah, put it in the yellow bowl.

218
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,957
Yeah, uh,
I'm looking for Claire Fisher.

219
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:37,597
This is Dennis at New Image

220
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:40,087
And I'm just calling to find out
where I should

221
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:42,989
- Hello.
- Hi, Claire Fisher ?

222
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:43,824
Yeah ?

223
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:47,477
I need an address to send
your application package to.

224
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,308
Are you from the temp agency ?

225
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,373
No, I'm from New Image.

226
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,931
'Re a stock photo production
house in New York city.

227
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,241
What kind of application ?

228
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:03,274
Photographer's assistant.

229
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,846
It's like a training position.

230
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:08,513
About a quarter of our staff
photographers started out as assistants.

231
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:10,865
Really ?

232
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,015
Uh, really.

233
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,184
All I could think of is maybe
the gallery owner from my show

234
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:21,649
Is the one who suggested me. Or maybe
it was Billy. Yeah, he would do that,

235
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:25,466
Partly just to make me feel
guilty for dumping him. Fuck that.

236
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,555
And the pay is shit, I'm sure.

237
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:31,105
But it is a job, New York city !

238
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,978
I actually could move up to
become a staff photographer,

239
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:38,246
Although I'm not gonna get my hopes
up like I did about that grant.

240
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,678
It's wonderful to hear.

241
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:43,081
You couldn't pay me to
live in New York city.

242
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,959
Would you like a bowl of cereal ?

243
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:52,203
Um, no thanks.

244
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,992
I'm not sure who designed
the stained-Glass window.

245
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,551
I heard it was a somewhat
influential artist.

246
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,551
Uh, what about the water
problems in the basement ?

247
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,053
Oh, big repair job less than a year ago.

248
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,095
They completely redid the plumbing as
well as all the underground drainage.

249
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,232
- What did I tell you ?
- Wow !

250
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,565
Yes, apparently, there was
some sort of a... a problem.

251
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,818
Eh, when everything gets backed up,
Then blood comes out of the toilet.

252
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:24,044
Yeah, that happens.

253
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:27,213
Can we get a copy of the
work report and the guarantee ?

254
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,692
- Yes.
- Great.

255
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,856
I will have the seller
fax that over to you.

256
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,715
We could put an espresso
bar in this nook.

257
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,757
You know, I always wanted to do that,

258
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:41,706
But David thought it
would be disrespectful.

259
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,325
Great.

260
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,311
Very nice.

261
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:54,030
I can't say she's out
of the woods for sure.

262
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,114
You'll have to watch
and see how she develops

263
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:59,217
To know if there's any
permanent brain damage.

264
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:04,217
But, from a physical standpoint,
She is doing remarkably well.

265
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,912
Thank God.

266
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,344
She's been taking your milk from
the bottle all the time now, right ?

267
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,198
- Right.
- Then I think we can

268
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,898
Permanently remove that feeding tube.

269
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,114
When can I take her home ?

270
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,316
Well, I'd like to keep
her another 24 hours

271
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:20,386
After the tube comes out
just to be on the safe side.

272
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:25,006
So there's absolutely no sign
of spina bifida or down's ?

273
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,363
Definitely neither of those.

274
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,197
And you checked
for every possible problem

275
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:29,733
That the triple marker
could have found ?

276
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,433
And I can't find anything.

277
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:34,576
Nothing that would be
apparent at this point anyway.

278
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,482
Great. So she'll seem normal for a while

279
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:39,449
Before whatever's fucked
up about her shows up.

280
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:42,341
Well, that's positive
news, isn't it, sweetheart ?

281
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,196
Shut up, Marge, you fuckin' idiot.

282
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:46,881
The fact she was premature

283
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,698
Has something to do with that
blood test and you know it.

284
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,388
There's something wrong with our baby.

285
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,942
You should never have had her.

286
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:58,881
- Oh God.
- For Christ's sake, Brenda,

287
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:02,872
There's something to feel good about.
Don't shit all over it !

288
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,012
Thank you, doctor.

289
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:14,933
<i>I got him</i>

290
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,012
<i>Don't ever do that !</i>

291
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,377
<i>- What ? Do what ?
- Pop up like that.</i>

292
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,386
<i>- Like this ?
- Don't !</i>

293
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,114
Ruth ?

294
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,479
The back door is open.

295
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:34,780
Yes, I suppose someone could just
come in and murder me in cold blood,

296
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,080
- Which would be a blessing.
- Ruthie...

297
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,902
It just takes time.

298
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,226
Liar.

299
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:47,104
That's what everybody
always says and it's a lie.

300
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,761
Each day I feel worse,

301
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:54,071
More empty, more dead.

302
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,794
I barely even remember
my life before Nate.

303
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:01,846
I was practically a
child when I had him.

304
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,151
How can I live without him ? I can't.

305
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,432
Yes, you can... for Maya.

306
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,841
They've taken Maya.

307
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,686
I will probably never see
her or her sister again...

308
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,808
If her sister even survives.

309
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,442
Ruth...

310
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,869
I promise you, you
will get through this.

311
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:32,200
I don't wanna get through it !

312
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,564
This is the worst thing that
can ever happen to anyone.

313
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:42,569
This is hell, George, hell,

314
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,099
And I just want it to end.

315
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:48,447
Then let me take care of you.

316
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:51,494
Let me make sure you don't
go through this alone.

317
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:55,954
You did it for me.

318
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,747
Now it's my turn.

319
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,742
To do what ?

320
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,475
Feel helpless while you
watch me lose my mind ?

321
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,489
Just... let me hold you.

322
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:24,287
Absolutely not !

323
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:27,071
This is my family's
business and I won't sell it.

324
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:30,479
So... buy me out.

325
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,310
Fine !

326
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:36,109
But I hope that you're aware that
this place Is probably worth $2 million.

327
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,038
I had it appraised.

328
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:40,958
So what do you want to
do with your part, Brenda ?

329
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,827
I don't really care.

330
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:48,167
Sorry, David, I don't.

331
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,475
You know what ? I don't
really care either.

332
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:59,794
Why am I fighting for something
I've always been ambivalent about ?

333
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,832
Habit.

334
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:07,174
So... we put it on the market ?

335
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,085
Sure. Why not ?

336
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,706
Cool.

337
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:21,307
I mean, if we can make
that kind of money,

338
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:22,926
Why hang on to it ?

339
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,432
I have no reason.

340
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:28,689
We've been clutching so desperately
to the past, and for what ?

341
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,701
Because that's when there was hope.

342
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,548
Um, I'm going over to Ted's tonight.

343
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,616
Take a sweater ! Oh... damn !

344
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:57,372
- What is she doing ?
- I have no idea.

345
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,015
Mom ?

346
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:09,424
Maya's monkey !

347
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:13,297
She loves this monkey !

348
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,490
I have to wash it.

349
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,405
I think it's great.

350
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,940
I mean, think of what we can do
with your portion and my savings.

351
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,715
We could finally buy a house.

352
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,090
We could buy a house now.

353
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,649
But we could buy a house and
you could go back to school

354
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:45,856
And become a lawyer like
you've always dreamed.

355
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,095
I don't think I ever really
even wanted to be a lawyer.

356
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:51,227
I think I just wanted to
have sex with Harry Hamlin.

357
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:54,724
I'm serious. You can be
whatever you wanna be, David.

358
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,612
- So can you.
- Exactly.

359
00:24:57,968 --> 00:25:00,612
We could really buy a house,
couldn't we, with a yard ?

360
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:03,696
We could get the boys
a dog and a tire swing.

361
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,598
Those boys don't want a tire swing,
they want a tv the size of a wall.

362
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,660
So do you think you're
rea to come back home soon ?

363
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,247
- Because I do.
- Maybe.

364
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,801
Good.

365
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,392
Man, those are big teeth.

366
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,035
Whoa, look at the wolf
brain made into asphalt !

367
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:52,294
- Wow !
- But it looks like poop !

368
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,895
Cool.

369
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,007
No, it's not cool.

370
00:25:57,101 --> 00:26:00,871
And you saying it is just
makes it even more not cool.

371
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,876
I think it's cool.

372
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:11,589
Thank you, Anthony.

373
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:38,130
I've never never seen you act this way !

374
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:41,284
- So ?
- Yeah, so it has to be analyzed

375
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,096
And diagnosed and turned into an
example of some kind of pathology.

376
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,129
I mean, this is the Chenowith family.

377
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:49,489
Oh god, Billy ! Have a drink !

378
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:55,478
That's what you are
born into. I'm sorry.

379
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,694
Aren't they funny ?

380
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,450
Oh, dear, she's having guests.

381
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,027
Mom, she knows we're coming.

382
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:10,487
- I called her.
- I can't go in. I'll wait in the car.

383
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,567
Mrs. Fisher,

384
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:17,093
I think Maya would be very
happy to see her monkey.

385
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,013
And to see you.

386
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,698
- Oh, hi.
- Hey !

387
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:42,332
Come on in. Everyone's in the kitchen.

388
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,820
- Mrs. Fisher.
- Hi.

389
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,811
Hi. Ted.

390
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:49,337
This is Billy, Brenda's brother.

391
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:52,454
- Oh, Billy.
- Ted.

392
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:55,215
I've heard a lot about
you. Nice to meet you.

393
00:27:56,957 --> 00:28:00,792
Yeah, nice to meet you too !

394
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:05,698
What-What is that ?

395
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,088
Do you, can you tell me ?

396
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:11,633
Can you tell me ?
Does the monkey know ?

397
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,438
You're so pensive, what
are you thinking about ?

398
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:18,625
Oh, just how much it sucks
that we have to get old.

399
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:21,644
Oh Claire, please,
don't get maudlin on me.

400
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:28,085
So Brenda tells me you're
planning on moving to new york ?

401
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:30,813
Uh, maybe.

402
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,776
I've applied for this,
like, entry-level position

403
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:38,395
At this, like, stock photo house...

404
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,193
.. New Image.

405
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,334
- Impressive.
- Not really.

406
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:45,893
It's just a lame gofer job
like I used to do for you.

407
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,771
No, it isn't.

408
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:52,001
You could easily go on to become a
soulless advertising photographer.

409
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,015
And with your gifts, hmm,
I'm sure you probably will.

410
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:03,062
And I'm the one who recommended you.

411
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,672
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,790
Claire, it doesn't matter
who fucked Russell.

413
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,603
I still believe in you.

414
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,575
Jesus, Olivier,

415
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,871
That's so nice of you.

416
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:18,716
Thank you so much.

417
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:21,289
Calm down. I mean, you
just popped into my mind

418
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:24,397
Because I'd just seen
you at that junior show.

419
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,374
Maya,

420
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:33,712
Don't you want to show
grandma your okapi ?

421
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,674
- Okapi !
- Yes !

422
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,904
I don't believe I've
ever heard of an okapi.

423
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:42,411
Oh, the okapi is the only known
living relative of the giraffe.

424
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:45,308
Its young really don't seem
to imprint on the mothers,

425
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:48,482
So they nurse from many
available lactating females.

426
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:51,646
We just went to the zoo this week.

427
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,331
So, uh...

428
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,101
How long have you and Claire been...

429
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,918
- Together ?
- Uh...

430
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:11,213
Well, we met, I guess it was about..

431
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:13,806
Four months ago.

432
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:15,307
Well, we..

433
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,298
We really didn't hit it
off that great at first.

434
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,021
- Really ?
- Yeah.

435
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,974
I was there when she
got the call about Nate

436
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:25,069
And I spent most of that night
In the hospital with her.

437
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:30,041
That's how my sister met her brother.

438
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,590
The night his father died.

439
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:34,487
Really ?

440
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:41,257
What are you saying, it
like runs in the family ?

441
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:47,717
I am so...

442
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,177
Jealous of you.

443
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,168
Excuse me a second.

444
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,971
She looks much stronger.

445
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,783
Oh, she is. She's much stronger.

446
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,665
No, she's not.
She's barely moving.

447
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,393
She's a very calm baby.

448
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,985
I think she's blind.

449
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,238
She gets stronger every day.

450
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,013
Oh, she's fierce when she nurses.

451
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:26,966
I'm covered in bruises.

452
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,004
Nate had a big appetite.

453
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,731
Is she gassy ?

454
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,309
No, not overly so,

455
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:36,299
But she's always hungry.

456
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:38,173
That's because she knows
she doesn't have much time.

457
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,773
She wants to get it while she can.

458
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,368
So you're really going
to sell your legacy ?

459
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:05,509
- Your birthright ?
- Yeah, and good riddance.

460
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,964
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
You never had it in you.

461
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:10,119
Neither did you. The only
way you could handle it

462
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:14,166
Was to have a secret room over
a really bad indian restaurant.

463
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,936
And you don't think
you have a secret room ?

464
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,107
What do you think being
gay is, you fucking freak ?

465
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,961
Fuck you.

466
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,614
What did you just say to me ?

467
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:29,656
Leave me alone, dad.

468
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:32,454
Who do you think you are ?

469
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:39,614
You think you can just
walk away from this ?

470
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,849
Are you really that stupid ?

471
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:48,144
- It only gets closer, david.
- Shut up.

472
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,102
You don't exist.

473
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,810
<i>the window washer's been right outside</i>

474
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:59,067
<i>This whole time watching
me change my stockings.</i>

475
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,274
yes, I will call you later.

476
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:04,730
Okay, bye.

477
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,112
<i>Actually, he's pretty cute.</i>

478
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,746
Dark hair and good build.

479
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:14,226
<i>- What are you watching ?
- Hello, mr. Clean.</i>

480
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:17,746
<i>- I don't know. It's always on.
- I've been a very dirty girl.</i>

481
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,671
Isn't it weird this isn't gonna
be our house anymore ?

482
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,992
I guess I'll move in with Ted,

483
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:36,459
Although I really hate his apartment.

484
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,651
Mom, what are you gonna do ?

485
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,958
I suppose I'll move in with George.

486
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,934
- Yeah ?
- He's offered.

487
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,557
Well, is that what you want ?

488
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:54,054
I'll never have what I want, never.

489
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:03,362
- Hello ?
- Is this Claire ?

490
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,691
Yeah.

491
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,867
This is scott in accounting
at new image.

492
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:09,943
I need you to send me your
social and address in New York.

493
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,995
I don't have an address in New Nork.
I live in California.

494
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:18,832
That's gonna be an awfully big commute.

495
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:21,856
Does that mean I have the job ?

496
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:25,049
I have you down as starting
work on december 7th.

497
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:28,261
You do ? Oh my god, mom !

498
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:33,394
Hello ?

499
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:36,119
I can give you my social now.

500
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:38,932
Can I give you my in New York
address a little bit later...

501
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,413
- Like when I actually have one ?
- Sure.

502
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:55,968
I called off Escrow.

503
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:58,810
You did what ?

504
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:01,236
This is my family's business,
Rico, and I won't sell it.

505
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,184
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:08,720
Well then, you have to buy me out.

507
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:11,527
I don't have that kind of money.

508
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,448
So, what ? I'm just fucked ?

509
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:22,352
Maybe you can find someone
to buy your share out.

510
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,182
Nobody's gonna wanna pay
half a million dollars

511
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:26,816
For 25% of this business,
you fuckin' moron !

512
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:28,814
If they have that kind of money,
They're gonna want to

513
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:30,124
Open up their own place.

514
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:32,532
Something smaller. Something
they can finally call their own

515
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,968
And run the way they want
without a bunch of idiots

516
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:37,203
Always getting in their fucking way !

517
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:48,086
Oh, just throw it out.

518
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,233
Really ? I always liked this on you.

519
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,256
It itches.

520
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,700
My entire life I've been
wearing clothes that I hate.

521
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,586
I've been meaning to ask
you, how is Maggie doing ?

522
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,121
I have no idea.

523
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,490
Maggie left over a month ago.

524
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,912
Left ? Where did she go ?

525
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:15,240
I don't know.

526
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:16,872
You don't even know where
your own daughter is ?

527
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,660
Ruth, please, don't sensationalize it.

528
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:23,007
George, don't talk to me like
you're my father or my teacher.

529
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,930
Do you have any idea how much
I hate it when you do that ?

530
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,509
I saw Maggie...

531
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,139
Just before Brenda gave birth.

532
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,792
And she was completely irrational.

533
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:39,613
She was very very angry.

534
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,972
- With you ?
- No

535
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:44,067
I think she was angry
with the state of her life.

536
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,867
She just chose to take it out on me.

537
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:47,904
What state of her life ?

538
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,173
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

539
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:54,063
- You didn't ask ?
- No, I didn't.

540
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,021
She told me she would call
me when she got settled.

541
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:01,541
Look, this is not the
first time it's happened.

542
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,827
I don't think I can move
in with you, George.

543
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,114
Why not ?

544
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:16,214
Because

545
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,662
Don't get me wrong,
You're a good, decent,

546
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:20,188
Man with a big heart.

547
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:23,543
But there are walls around that heart

548
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,881
Walls behind walls behind walls.

549
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:30,303
And I can spend a certain
amount of time around that,

550
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,569
But I cannot live with it, not anymore.

551
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,649
Oh, don't look so sour.

552
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,538
It doesn't mean I won't go out with you.

553
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:46,765
We can have a lot more fun this way.

554
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:49,476
Believe me...

555
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,612
I could use a little fun.

556
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:58,434
Father, we thank thee for
these and all thy blessings.

557
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,325
Amen !

558
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,601
Not so fast.

559
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:06,349
We thank thee for the
gift of this food...

560
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,343
And please thank the animals who
gave their lives so we could eat,

561
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:14,829
For the love we feel for each other,

562
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:16,904
Even when it's hard,

563
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:19,501
Especially when it's hard.

564
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,633
And finally for these two boys...

565
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:32,713
Who came into our lives
and made us a family,

566
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,579
And who have given us a home

567
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,827
Every bit as much as we have them.

568
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,208
- Amen.
- Amen.

569
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,095
- Amen.
- Amen.

570
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:00,889
She can't breathe.

571
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:03,084
She can't get any oxygen to her brain !

572
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,181
- Why can't you love her ?
- Because she's damaged...

573
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:15,855
And nobody will ever be able to fix her.

574
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,259
Ever.

575
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,200
I talked to my accountant today.

576
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:34,317
Between the two of us,
we can buy Rico out.

577
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,025
Keith, I can't let you do that.

578
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:40,933
- That money is yours.
- That money is ours...

579
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,010
For our new house.

580
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,991
I don't know if you've realized,
but that house you grew up in

581
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:49,163
Is a pretty great fuckin' house.

582
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,988
You don't find this depressing ?

583
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:56,068
I don't think it has to be.

584
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,567
I think we can make it into
something pretty spectacular.

585
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,892
- You're serious ?
- Yeah.

586
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,466
I am.

587
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:14,776
Maggie, Dr. Peterman will see you now.

588
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,409
Okay, thank you.

589
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,452
Just give me a second. Sorry.

590
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:24,046
This is Maggie.

591
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:26,487
Thank heavens you still have
the same cell phone number.

592
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,950
Ruth ?

593
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,198
I have to ask you something.

594
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:34,664
Sure.

595
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:37,144
You were with Nate the night he...

596
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,425
Yes.

597
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,023
Was he happy ?

598
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:46,755
He was...

599
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:50,198
Feeling, I think, that his
life was very complicated.

600
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,174
I'm not talking about his life,
I'm talking about that night.

601
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:54,754
Was...

602
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,413
Was he happy ?

603
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:02,738
He was.

604
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:09,801
Good.

605
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:15,133
Were you ?

606
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:18,837
Yes.

607
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:25,067
Yes, I was happy.

608
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:27,334
Good.

609
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,467
Thank you for that.

610
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,734
It helps.

611
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,082
Ruth...

612
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,132
I'm sorry.

613
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:53,213
I have to go.

614
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:05,469
We're not asking you
to give us anything.

615
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:07,780
We're just asking you to
let us buy you out over time.

616
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:10,549
We'll pay you as soon
as we can. I promise.

617
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,504
Okay.

618
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:16,484
Look, my dad left me a ton of money.

619
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:19,584
Plus, Nate had life
insurance, believe it or not.

620
00:43:21,022 --> 00:43:23,213
So take your time.

621
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,272
Thank you.

622
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,041
Come on, we're family.

623
00:43:29,638 --> 00:43:31,155
Yeah, we are.

624
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,110
Yes, we are.

625
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:44,364
- Hello.
- Hello, Ruth.

626
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:46,959
- How's the baby doing ?
- She's good.

627
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,277
I have new photos !

628
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,438
Thank you.

629
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,167
My goodness !

630
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,264
Look at those eyes !

631
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:06,442
What do you mean ?
Do you see something wrong ?

632
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:10,786
Oh no, it's just that it seems
like she sees more than we do,

633
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:14,734
Like she's a very old soul.

634
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:18,495
You poor dear.

635
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:21,558
You're still worried
about her, aren't you ?

636
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,131
She seems good.

637
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,630
Every visit to the doctor goes fine.

638
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:30,476
I just can't shake the feeling

639
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,999
That something' going to go wrong,

640
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:36,110
- Something is wrong.
- You're all alone.

641
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:42,568
If my experience is anything to go by,

642
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:46,801
Motherhood is the loneliest
thing in the world.

643
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:50,980
Nathaniel wasn't even
here when Nate was born.

644
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:53,571
He was still in Vietnam.

645
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:55,940
Even when he came
home and David was born

646
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:57,784
And having terrible asthma,

647
00:44:57,881 --> 00:45:00,727
Nathaniel was never really here for me.

648
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:04,420
Whether it was the war or just
him, I don't think I'll ever know.

649
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:10,093
- You know Nate and I were
- I know, I know.

650
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:14,017
I know he loved you
the very best he could,

651
00:45:15,154 --> 00:45:17,633
And I know you needed more.

652
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,672
So did I.

653
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,094
And I hope and pray
that you put everything

654
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:29,999
Everything behind us
and let me help you,

655
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,269
Because I know you're gonna need it.

656
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,882
Thank you.

657
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:41,267
I will need it.

658
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:44,017
I do need it.

659
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,202
- Do we have to move ?
- No.

660
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,516
We're gonna keep living here.
Maybe we'll move, eventually,

661
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,592
If things go well.

662
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:01,940
But I like this house.

663
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:04,073
What if you got to have your own room ?

664
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

665
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,462
To the...

666
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:13,616
Future.

667
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:15,753
Yes, baby.

668
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:37,621
Mom.

669
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,167
I don't know why I keep looking at this.

670
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:52,639
It certainly doesn't
make me feel any better.

671
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,084
God, I would give anything if I
could make things different for you.

672
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,300
I would too.

673
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:26,569
You know what ?

674
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:30,934
I don't think I'm gonna go to New York.

675
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,580
Olivier says it's a crappy
place to work anyway.

676
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:39,914
And I have no idea how to go
about finding a place to live.

677
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:42,147
You would do that ?

678
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:46,090
You would... stay here for me ?

679
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:52,578
Yes.

680
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,467
Absolutely not !

681
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:06,031
Go. Live.

682
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:07,693
I'll unfreeze your trust fund.

683
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:10,389
Take it and find whatever
life has in store for you.

684
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:13,634
Well...

685
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:15,904
Are you still gonna move
in with George ?

686
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,944
No

687
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:19,069
No, I'm moving in with Sarah.

688
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,899
She's back from Costa Rica ?

689
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:23,590
No, Bettina's house-Sitting,
but I'm moving in anyway.

690
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,727
If Sarah doesn't like
it, it's too fucking bad.

691
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:29,645
Mom, really, I can wait.

692
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:32,745
Claire, I stayed home to
take care of a sick woman,

693
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:35,514
And I've always regretted it.

694
00:48:35,676 --> 00:48:39,047
I don't regret you or any of my children

695
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:41,617
Or... Nathaniel even,

696
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,669
But I do regret

697
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,649
Never giving myself any choice.

698
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:51,158
I won't let you make the same mistake !

699
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,213
Mom.

700
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,262
Oh, my little girl.

701
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:20,099
Maya ?

702
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,751
Maya, are you okay ?

703
00:49:56,491 --> 00:49:58,538
She's beautiful.

704
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,312
She's so beautiful.

705
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,880
Hi. We've never met. I'm Nathaniel.

706
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,360
I love her so much.

707
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,971
And I always will.

708
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:15,356
You have to promise me
you won't listen to this

709
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,088
Until you start to drive
away tomorrow morning.

710
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:22,244
I can't play it tonight at
my big farewell dinner...

711
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:25,942
That you won't even come to ?

712
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:29,400
everybody's gonna want a piece of you.

713
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:32,976
I'm sorry, but...

714
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,193
I don't want to share you.

715
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:39,178
That's sweet.

716
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,137
And strangely possessive.

717
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:50,907
I want you to promise me something too.

718
00:51:51,747 --> 00:51:53,688
I want you to promise

719
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:57,675
That if the corporate warmongers
decide we have to invade Iran

720
00:51:57,966 --> 00:51:59,805
- And they reinstate the draft...
- That's not gonna happen.

721
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:02,329
- ... That you will move to Canada.
- It's not gonna happen.

722
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:06,590
Probably not. But, if they do...

723
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,051
Promise me...

724
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,402
That you won't go get
your head blown off

725
00:52:12,522 --> 00:52:15,171
So Halliburton and
Bechtel can get richer.

726
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:17,940
I promise.

727
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,643
You're too smart. You're too good.

728
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:30,233
Don't waste that.

729
00:52:38,915 --> 00:52:41,525
I promise.

730
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,996
- A what ?
- A meth lab.

731
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:51,463
Marcie, get serious !

732
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:54,894
I don't even know what that is.
It's illegal and she's pulling your leg.

733
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:56,339
We'd make a lot of money.

734
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,009
So could opening our own
professional assassin service,

735
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,163
- But that's not gonna happen either.
- Why not ? I think I'd like that.

736
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:06,736
- We could steal people's kidneys.
- Oh, God,

737
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,525
No ! It's too messy.

738
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,185
I heard on NPR

739
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:16,393
About those people that go in
and clean up violent crime scenes.

740
00:53:16,702 --> 00:53:19,721
- They make a shitload of money !
- No !

741
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:23,125
I'm not going to clean up
someone else's violent crime.

742
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,202
We just have to accept it.

743
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:28,567
There's nothing else. We
have to become hookers.

744
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:33,257
I'm thinking of starting
a day-care service.

745
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:36,108
- Seriously ?
- Yes, for dogs.

746
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:43,697
Well, I wasn't aware
such a thing existed

747
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,451
Until Nate worked in
one briefly last year.

748
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:51,243
But apparently a lot of people
will pay you a lot of money

749
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:52,836
To babysit their dogs.

750
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:55,836
Let's face it, dogs are a
lot easier than children.

751
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:58,008
They just are.

752
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,950
No offense, honny.

753
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,430
There's George.

754
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:06,628
Hi, George. Come join us.

755
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,991
Georgie porgie. He hates me.

756
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:20,910
<i>Claire, hi, this is gavin at new image</i>

757
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:23,472
<i>And I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...</i>

758
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:25,874
<i>New image has been
bought by stock options,</i>

759
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,091
<i>And they're consolidating
their operations, and...</i>

760
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:33,785
<i>Well, they're in Chicago, so I hope
you haven't headed out here yet.</i>

761
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:36,944
Sorry.

762
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:42,289
Aw, who cares ?

763
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,353
Go anyway.

764
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,505
What, are you crazy ?

765
00:54:48,597 --> 00:54:50,850
I'm gonna move to new
york city without a job ?

766
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,082
Mom gave you the money, you're
gonna land somewhere. You'll be fine.

767
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:57,173
You're talented, you're smart,

768
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,197
- You're ready.
- What if I'm not ?

769
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,716
Claire, you want to know a secret ?

770
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,558
I spent my whole life being scared.

771
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,947
Scared of not being
ready, of not being right,

772
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,138
Of not being who I should be.

773
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,176
And where did it get me ?

774
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:21,197
What should I tell everyone tonight ?

775
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:23,138
Nothing !

776
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:27,404
You can't stay here !

777
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:37,111
You've done a great job.

778
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,537
And this is video game central.

779
00:55:41,475 --> 00:55:44,364
I've made it to Moscow on
"Tony Hawk underground. "

780
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:47,518
- That'll come in handy.
- You can't imagine the

781
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,396
respect it bought me.

782
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:51,220
Boy, what have you done in here ?

783
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:53,845
Well, we replaced the
jalousie windows place

784
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,680
- With these double-Hung windows.
- That looks great.

785
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:01,242
It's like I never lived here.

786
00:56:01,682 --> 00:56:02,799
Maya

787
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:05,185
<i>- There's so much space, though.
- Just beige, though.</i>

788
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:07,833
Beige beige beige.

789
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:10,909
- I love this.
- This is the

790
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:19,252
-  Three fours.
- Does it hurt to have a baby ?

791
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,654
Yes, it does.

792
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,850
It's beautiful I admit it,
but it's a little intimidating.

793
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:26,872
it's gay.

794
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:29,587
This is a 100% gay kitchen.

795
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:31,940
This table looks sort of out of place.

796
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:34,035
David says they keep
meaning to get rid of it.

797
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,268
I suppose they'll get around to it.

798
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:41,415
Oh my God, you remember that
one dinner that he came to

799
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,996
And he was high on ecstasy,
which he had taken by accident ?

800
00:56:45,303 --> 00:56:49,517
- What's ecstasy ?
- It's medicine.

801
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,654
I must have missed that one.

802
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,537
Nate kept groping my
breasts through the meal.

803
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:55,741
I was mortified.

804
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,696
I walked in on the two of you in
much more mortifying circumstances.

805
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:02,374
Okay, that we will not get into
with younger ears at the table.

806
00:57:02,928 --> 00:57:05,113
- Tell me.
- What, tell me !

807
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:10,885
I just remember I don't know,
I was in seventh grade,

808
00:57:11,102 --> 00:57:13,937
I think Nate was probably a
junior in high school...

809
00:57:14,442 --> 00:57:17,157
And he had started that new wave band

810
00:57:17,253 --> 00:57:19,709
With Sam Hoviak and Tom
Wheeler, do you remember ?

811
00:57:19,776 --> 00:57:21,091
I do.

812
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:26,263
He had the worst hair. I
mean really big, bad '80s hair

813
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,593
With all this spray and lacquer in it.

814
00:57:28,762 --> 00:57:30,958
And I was sitting next to him at dinner,

815
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:33,284
And I saw something move,

816
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,460
And it was a spider.

817
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,550
It had spun a web in his hair.

818
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:39,534
- I swear.
- Sick !

819
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:45,399
And I didn't say anything because
I knew how cool he was trying to be.

820
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:47,894
And...

821
00:57:48,259 --> 00:57:51,341
I wanted him to be that
cool. I wanted him to be...

822
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:55,170
The coolest brother
anybody had ever had.

823
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:06,592
To Nate.

824
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:13,184
To Nate

825
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,187
To Nate.

826
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,056
To Nate.

827
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,166
To Nate.

828
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,903
To my first-born.

829
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:27,972
- To uncle Nate.
- Yeah, to uncle Nate.

830
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:33,033
Can you say "to daddy" ?

831
00:58:33,207 --> 00:58:34,993
To daddy.

832
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:38,629
To Nate.

833
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,487
May he rest in peace.

834
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:23,355
Hey.

835
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:27,284
Get up.

836
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:31,228
Come on, everybody's waiting.

837
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:54,034
I have no idea how to do this.

838
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,761
You just say "goodbye. "

839
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:04,878
And just say "I love you. "

840
01:00:07,089 --> 01:00:08,398
I'll miss you.

841
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:11,321
Oh god, I'm gonna miss you so much.

842
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,513
Be happy.

843
01:00:23,997 --> 01:00:25,576
I am.

844
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,751
Mom.

845
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,914
My sweet baby girl.

846
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:39,589
Don't let them work you
too hard at your new job.

847
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,491
I won't.

848
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,803
Mom, I really hope
you can come and visit.

849
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:49,109
I'll try.

850
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:53,361
Claire.

851
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:58,475
I pray you will be filled with
hope as long as you possibly can.

852
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,188
Thank you for everything.

853
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:12,132
And thank you for giving me life.

854
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:15,763
You gave me life.

855
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:17,843
Oh, God, I don't want to go.

856
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,302
Yes, you do !

857
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:22,745
What, are you trying to sneak out on us ?

858
01:01:22,938 --> 01:01:25,052
- Bye, aunt claire.
- Bye.

859
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:27,782
Bye, Anthony.

860
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:34,244
- You gonna come visit me in New York ?
- Yes.

861
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:36,459
Could you...

862
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:38,920
Get me something from the
fire department museum ?

863
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:41,655
- It's in Brooklyn.
- Durrell.

864
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,861
Durrell's going to be a fireman.

865
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:46,283
Did you know my dad used to be a cop ?

866
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:47,939
I did.

867
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:49,822
He looked really good in his uniform.

868
01:01:51,705 --> 01:01:53,150
Come here.

869
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:03,609
I want to take a
picture of everyone.

870
01:02:06,782 --> 01:02:09,613
You can't take a picture
of this. It's already gone.

871
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,884
So as the blood is
draining out of the body

872
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:15,810
