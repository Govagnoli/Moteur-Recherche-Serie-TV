1
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:51,105
Mr Williman's last statement
may be offensive,

2
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:55,783
it may contain expletives
or matter of a dark nature.

3
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:02,583
When Mr Williman expires,
you may hear what is known as a death rattle

4
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,147
or a snort or a cough of some sort.

5
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,063
Some fellas bleed from the nose.

6
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,183
It's not common but it happens.

7
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,711
Or he may just appear to fall off to sleep,

8
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:17,428
with his eyes either open or closed,
it can go either way.

9
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,833
I'm sorry if this is troublesome to you folks

10
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:25,912
but if, when this is all over, you tell me,

11
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:30,469
"Officer Paddick, it happened
just like you said it would,"

12
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:33,107
then I figure I did my job.

13
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,348
We don't want any surprises.

14
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,425
Any questions?

15
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,348
There's no explanation.

16
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:48,432
There's no excuse.

17
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,343
I can't lay here and tell you there is one.

18
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:03,822
But if anybody thinks the state of Texas

19
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:08,025
is teaching anybody anything
by putting this poison into me,

20
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:11,588
they're even dumber and crueller than I am.

21
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:19,066
And you're all gonna cry in the same wet hell
that I'm going to for doing this.

22
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:23,311
You're gonna eat shit,
you're gonna vomit blood forever.

23
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:29,104
Because this isn't right.

24
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:52,145
You're all pigs.

25
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:58,825
You're all fucking pigs
slipping out of God's ass

26
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,309
and I would cut all your throats if I could.

27
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:04,389
I hate this motherfucking...

28
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:21,743
Nate, it's Brenda again.

29
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:24,068
If you're there, pick up.

30
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:28,311
You must be at work. OK,
well, if you want me to stop calling,

31
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:32,551
could you just tell me,
otherwise I'll keep trying. I'm really worried...

32
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:54,701
...at 89.9. The Greater Palm Springs area
at 89.3.

33
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,984
Oxnard, Ventura, Carpinteria at 89. 1.

34
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,388
Lemon Grove at 89.9...

35
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:06,665
But we don't want to get the paper every day.

36
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,863
No, it's not about the money.

37
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:12,428
It's... Look, we don't care
how free you make the paper,

38
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:15,385
we don't want all that paper in the apartment.

39
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,993
Yes, that sounds a great saving...

40
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:21,469
We're not interested.
Is there coffee for me, too?

41
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,664
What was that?

42
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:33,102
I can't stand listening to you
deal with those telemarketers.

43
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,304
You have to be so
damn nice about everything.

44
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:41,108
- She was just trying to do her job.
- And you're trying to do yours.

45
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:43,189
This coffee tastes like shit.

46
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,830
- Keith.
- What?

47
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:49,502
- Can you hear the tone in your voice?
- Don't start again.

48
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:52,863
- I'm serious.
- There is no tone in my voice.

49
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:56,110
Yes, there is.
It's same tone you used in San Diego.

50
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:59,543
- I'm sick of talking about that.
- The same tone...

51
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,506
When are you gonna get it that
you're the one who fucked up in San Diego?

52
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,783
It was my family business.

53
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,906
- I stuck up for you.
- I don't need anybody sticking up for me.

54
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,945
You always turn shit around
and make it about me.

55
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:15,382
You can't face it that you were out of line.

56
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:18,425
- Being on your side is out of line?
- If I don't want you on it.

57
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,306
This is the difference between you and me.

58
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:23,992
I want you on my side, I need you on my side

59
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,593
and it's the one thing that I never have.

60
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:30,672
- That is not true.
- Everything I do is too weak or too nice.

61
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:39,542
You don't really like me.
You're not for me.

62
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:41,709
I look at you and all I think about is

63
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:44,631
how I can help you be
whatever it is you wanna be

64
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,743
between now and the day you die.

65
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:51,343
- You look at me and all you see are problems.
- That's not true.

66
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,384
I'm so fucking sick of it.

67
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,788
God! Why should I stand for this?

68
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,586
Why should this constant abuse
be what I call love?

69
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,624
Don't touch me.

70
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,792
Remember, nothing to eat or drink
after midnight tonight.

71
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,141
Have you arranged for a ride?

72
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:18,947
I was just gonna take a cab, I thought.
You know?

73
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:21,632
I'd prefer it if a family member takes you home.

74
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:25,222
Nobody in my family would wanna do that,
I don't think.

75
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:27,468
- You sure?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:31,747
You have a friend who could help you?

77
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,590
No.

78
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,431
Well, we really don't want you to drive yourself.

79
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:46,182
This has been the longest month
of my whole life.

80
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,066
- I can imagine.
- Yeah? Get this.

81
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:52,230
I lost my job to go to my father's execution.

82
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,822
Isn't that the most pathetic thing
you've ever heard?

83
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,945
My stupid boss told me
I shouldn't go and I did.

84
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:02,224
- Where did you work?
- A used-car dealership.

85
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,265
It's OK, I'll get another job. It's just so dumb.

86
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:09,628
- You did the right thing.
- Now I'm out of a fucking job.

87
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:11,743
Thank you, right thing.

88
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:19,105
Work can be difficult
with regards to something like this.

89
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,030
You don't know.

90
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:24,861
And on top of that, I'm out like $700

91
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:28,588
because I had to pay to ship his body
back from Texas.

92
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:35,912
Miss Williman, will you be
wanting a service for your father?

93
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:39,582
- Or we could just...
- No. I want a service for my dad.

94
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,988
I thought Father Jack talked to you.

95
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,467
- No, he didn't.
- He told me he did.

96
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:49,711
He did, Rico. He talked to David.
I forgot to tell you.

97
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:53,109
- He called yesterday from St Bart's.
- That's my church.

98
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,711
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

99
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:03,629
I don't want the fact
that he killed a bunch of women

100
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,904
to be the only story
anybody ever tells about him.

101
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:11,231
I mean, he was a kid once.
He had a life. I've seen the pictures.

102
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,264
And he wasn't such a bad dad.

103
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:17,704
My brother got the shit beat out of him a lot
but he never beat me.

104
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:23,031
Well, excuse me one moment, Miss Williman.

105
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:27,102
I'll find the other Mr Fisher
and we'll figure this thing out.

106
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,348
- Thank you.
- OK.

107
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:44,187
I bet if my dad wasn't a murderer, you'd be
saying all kinds of sweet things to me.

108
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,511
Like how hard this must be for me
and shit like that.

109
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,703
No, I know how hard it is for you.

110
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:55,349
I'm sorry, I've been having
a hard time myself lately.

111
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:05,343
Show me what the choices are for the box
while we wait.

112
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,669
OK.

113
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,029
They're little people.

114
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:28,305
They fall into the pipe here
and they go down through the pipe

115
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:32,187
and then they break apart
into a bunch of little pieces over here

116
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,384
and then they disappear.

117
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:40,072
And then slowly,

118
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:45,745
very slowly, they get put back together
and come out the other side.

119
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,943
So, show me the boxes.

120
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:58,505
Yeah.

121
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,187
There are a lot of affordable choices

122
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,987
so you don't have to worry,
you don't have to spend a lot.

123
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,228
That's good cos I don't have a lot.

124
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,582
Like almost nothing.

125
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:18,263
I talked to David.
Everything's been taken care of.

126
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,426
I've made stuffed cabbage rolls.

127
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:31,591
If anybody wants some for dinner,
they're in the sky-blue Tupperware.

128
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,703
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

129
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,948
It's such a beautiful day today.

130
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,707
No.

131
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,382
- Oh, dear.
- What?

132
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:47,631
- It's one of Lisa's Dr Peppers.
- She doesn't drink Dr Pepper.

133
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,982
Maybe not in front of you.

134
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,024
Put it back in the fridge...

135
00:11:56,433 --> 00:12:00,949
- I can't leave Maya.
- We'll get her after things have cooled down.

136
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,069
Why did I ever get myself into this?

137
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:08,152
You wanted love and he made you believe
he could give it to you.

138
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,981
That's what Nate does.
You've always known that. He's toxic.

139
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:16,549
- I should have brought Maya with me.
- Maya's on her own journey, Lisa.

140
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:19,107
This is about you.

141
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,468
It'd be wonderful
if someone could take her to the park.

142
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,265
Well, I think that's it.

143
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:33,028
If any of you need me,
I've left the number by the phone.

144
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,908
So, what are you guys doing tomorrow?

145
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,944
Same old shit.

146
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,783
- I'm busy.
- Me, too. Why?

147
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,951
Nothing.

148
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:59,549
- Where's Mom going?
- George's.

149
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:03,511
Oh, yeah.

150
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:09,504
The original title of this famous poem

151
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:12,989
was He Do The Police In Different Voices.

152
00:13:19,913 --> 00:13:21,665
The Waste Land.

153
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:25,504
That is a much better title.

154
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,424
Well, we're still a genius, even with one wrong.

155
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,144
I'm dead already.

156
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:03,907
- Ruth?
- No more questions.

157
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,784
Do you...

158
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,630
move this fast with everybody?

159
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,425
No.

160
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,545
But then I've never met
anybody like you before.

161
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,584
I don't want you to get away.

162
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,103
I'm not going anywhere.

163
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:28,590
I guess I do feel like the stars
are moving a little faster lately.

164
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,705
Like in those movies
where they speed things up.

165
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:39,022
And the stars stream across the sky in stripes,
they're moving so fast.

166
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,305
But...

167
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,743
But what?

168
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:59,832
My daughter-in-law's
been missing for over two weeks,

169
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:04,389
my granddaughter may be without a mother
for the rest of her life.

170
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:10,986
I'm just very aware of how important it is
to enjoy what life gives you...

171
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:15,432
when it gives it to you.

172
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:20,228
Who knows, George,
you may be my last chance at finding love.

173
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,906
And you may be my last chance to be happy.

174
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,069
You've been happy before.

175
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:32,104
Not like this.

176
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:57,742
Russell, stop calling
or I'm gonna change my number.

177
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,986
- You actually hit him?
- Of course not.

178
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,069
I just swotted him away.

179
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:22,230
See, I don't see why you two
stay together if it's always that bad.

180
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:27,745
- It's not always that bad.
- But even if it's that bad for a little while...

181
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:30,353
You know, me and Vanessa,

182
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:32,509
we've got the kids to think about.

183
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:34,908
Gay couples have no reason to stay together?

184
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:39,504
No. I'm saying I don't see how
anybody stays together without kids.

185
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:43,546
- It was a compliment.
- It doesn't sound like a compliment.

186
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:49,142
We got something chunky here.

187
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:51,184
A clot, I don't know.

188
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:54,661
All gone.

189
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,022
- Hello, comrades.
- Hi, Arthur.

190
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,270
So, this is the gentleman
who murdered all those women.

191
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,702
- Yep.
- Only to be murdered himself

192
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:06,664
by the state of Texas.

193
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,189
- You're against capital punishment?
- Certainly.

194
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:16,146
It fails to deter other criminals
and mistakes are often made.

195
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:19,788
- Innocent people die.
- Innocent people die cos of guys like him.

196
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,505
What did he do anyway?

197
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:25,228
- He made one woman eat broken glass...
- Don't tell me.

198
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:28,788
- It's bad enough things like that happen.
- I agree.

199
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,621
- But, Rico...
- If he did something like that to Vanessa,

200
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:36,712
- I'd happily flip the switch.
- What about the value of human life?

201
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:40,348
He cashed in the value
of his human life a long time ago.

202
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,544
He's a dorito, crunch them, don't make more.

203
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,024
You get worse.

204
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,348
Nate.

205
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:51,226
Maya's having a nap,
I'm gonna go for a quick run.

206
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:53,548
- Who's watching her?
- Claire.

207
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,152
- Who's this?
- It's Mr Williman.

208
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,863
Remember? With the daughter.

209
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:06,507
So what the fuck are you doing?
He came in here already embalmed.

210
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,942
He looked like a tangerine.

211
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:11,223
I thought this was a better colour.

212
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,504
I agree.

213
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,387
Oh, God, now what?

214
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,466
Hi.

215
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,582
- Your father's service is tomorrow, right?
- I know.

216
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,749
I wanted to

217
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:38,383
talk to you about flowers.

218
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,302
Well, we'll take care of that.
It's part of the package.

219
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:48,791
But, I mean, what kind of flowers do you like

220
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,508
or do you think we should have?

221
00:18:54,273 --> 00:18:57,504
I only asked cos, you know, you're a man.

222
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:04,188
Well, we have a florist
who does all the arrangements.

223
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:09,309
It'll be a nice selection and variety.
Nothing pink, don't worry.

224
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,832
OK.

225
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:17,707
Do you

226
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:20,392
wanna go get some coffee or something?

227
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,867
I haven't eaten anything yet today.

228
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:28,225
Thank you, but I'm kinda busy.

229
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:34,862
Is your wife around?

230
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,869
No, she's not.

231
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:40,747
I think you should go,
I was just about to go out for a run.

232
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:44,066
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,703
You don't have to be sorry.

234
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,028
I don't know where else to go.

235
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,829
I don't have a job,
I just sit around all day and stare at the walls.

236
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:56,943
It's OK.

237
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,424
Look, I'll see you tomorrow.

238
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:05,582
It'll look great, don't worry.

239
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,741
- Nothing pink.
- Right, nothing pink.

240
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,824
Thanks.

241
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,908
Get the cordless.

242
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:37,944
I know. I know what you mean.

243
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:41,984
Then one day it isn't charged up
and you need it.

244
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,342
This one has more torque.

245
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:47,544
How much torque
does a guy like me really need?

246
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,671
This one feels good in your hand. Try it.

247
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,430
See what I mean?

248
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,225
I do.

249
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:03,669
George, I wonder if
we shouldn't just get married.

250
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,544
- Are you serious?
- I am.

251
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:10,381
- Because I've been thinking the same thing.
- You have?

252
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:16,905
I don't mind telling you I'm lonely
and I've been lonely for a long time and I...

253
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:19,592
Ruth, I think...

254
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:23,750
I think it's a wonderful idea.

255
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,023
- You really do?
- Yes.

256
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,026
I don't want to come to places like this alone.

257
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,711
Neither do I.

258
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:36,144
- That's what life is, coming to places like this.
- Yes.

259
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:38,388
- It's awful.
- I know!

260
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,466
So let's get married. What the hey?

261
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:44,708
I want to, that's what I'm saying.

262
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,664
Me too.

263
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:03,630
I've been married before,
you should know that.

264
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:06,312
Of course, you have two grown children.

265
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:09,912
- More than once.
- How many times?

266
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:13,791
Six.

267
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:19,032
- I should have told you before.
- No, I'm glad you didn't.

268
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:34,986
Get the cordless,
I'll help you make sure it stays charged.

269
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,104
It's a deal.

270
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:55,226
Excuse me. You didn't happen to see
a dog on the beach?

271
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,025
No, I'm sorry.

272
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,631
Gosh darn it.

273
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:01,107
- You lost your dog?
- Not me, my wife.

274
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:05,305
- What does he look like?
- He's a chocolate lab. Wanna see his picture?

275
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:07,662
No, I didn't see him. I'm sorry.

276
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:10,030
Good luck.

277
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:29,023
- What are you doing here?
- I've been calling and calling.

278
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,268
I wanted to know that you're OK.

279
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:33,383
Well, I'm not.

280
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:37,346
But there's not a lot we can do about it so...
Thanks anyway.

281
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,429
I'm trying to be your friend.

282
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,905
Sorry, were you there
the night that you kissed me?

283
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,909
Do you know how that makes me feel?

284
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:47,671
- My wife's gone.
- I know.

285
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:51,388
I can't imagine
what you must be going through...

286
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,186
You have no concept
of what I've been going through.

287
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,303
I haven't slept in days,

288
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,072
I've been to Gaviota State Beach five times.

289
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:03,823
I been driving up that fucking PCH
putting up flyers on telephone poles.

290
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,750
Then let me help you.

291
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:09,388
- Why the fuck would you wanna help me?
- I care about you.

292
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,631
- I can't just turn that off.
- Sure you can, you've done it before.

293
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:17,309
- Sorry.
- Just give her to me.

294
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,072
- I couldn't get her to sleep.
- Just... Thanks.

295
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:35,427
Do you think you could give me a ride?

296
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,908
I have to go get an abortion.

297
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,785
Sure.

298
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:51,505
It's so good you've kept up with your chorus.
It must be a wonderful outlet.

299
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,783
It is. It's...

300
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,744
What?

301
00:24:55,793 --> 00:25:00,105
Well, there are times
when you're in the midst of all these voices,

302
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:04,863
being carried along, and all you have to do
is get to the end of the song.

303
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:09,031
For a few minutes, it's that simple.
Just get to the end of the song.

304
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,791
That's kind of a relief.

305
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,544
From the rest of life?

306
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:15,745
Yes.

307
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:26,309
I think Lisa's dead.

308
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:32,184
- I do, too.
- I hate to say it but I do.

309
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,224
I just feel like she's gone.

310
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:39,428
For a while, I imagined all kinds of things.
Her showing up...

311
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,429
I know.

312
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,510
She was a part of our family.

313
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:47,670
- Maya's my niece.
- She was such a sweet person,

314
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,432
why should something like that happen to her?

315
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,145
Why is life like that?

316
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,624
Thanks for the tea.

317
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,828
David...

318
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:13,465
Yeah?

319
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:15,504
I've been seeing someone.

320
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:18,464
George, yeah. We've noticed.

321
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:20,390
It's going pretty well.

322
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:23,425
- Good. He seems a nice enough guy.
- He is.

323
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:25,623
I've...

324
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:30,986
I've been thinking maybe I could think about
even settling down with him.

325
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:33,752
It would be time, maybe, to try that again.

326
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,753
That depends on what you mean
by settling down.

327
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:40,512
Well, getting married.

328
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:44,831
- Don't you think I deserve to be happy?
- Of course.

329
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:49,264
But you've only known him for a few weeks.
Why do you have to rush into it?

330
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,304
Because.

331
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:54,982
When I'm with him, life is full of possibilities

332
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:59,345
and I haven't felt that way in so long,
I've forgotten what it feels like.

333
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:02,942
- I don't want to forget that again.
- It's your decision,

334
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:06,542
I just don't wanna see you get hurt, that's all.

335
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:22,428
- Sushi.
- Like what?

336
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:27,467
Like spicy tuna or yellowtail,
I don't like it when it gets too baroque.

337
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:31,586
Like frozen spider roll of the 10,000 secrets?

338
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,306
- Yeah. I don't need that.
- Me neither.

339
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,224
What else do you like?

340
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:42,864
I don't know.

341
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:20,027
It has different orchestrations...

342
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,950
Hey, David.

343
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,949
Do you wanna get something?

344
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:28,824
Lunch or a drink or something?

345
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,228
Yes, please. God, thank you, yes.

346
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:43,582
Susan, Denise, Pam, Claire.

347
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:48,108
- See you later.
- I'll be here.

348
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,269
Ms Fisher? Good afternoon.

349
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:20,627
Dr Simpson.

350
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:24,188
Before we begin the procedure,
I'm going to do an ultrasound.

351
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:39,545
You'll feel a little pressure,
it won't be too uncomfortable.

352
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,024
I see you chose Twilight.

353
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:58,382
I don't know.

354
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:01,345
- The sedation.
- Oh. Yeah.

355
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,509
That's Twilight.

356
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:07,102
You're not really gone
but you're not really here.

357
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:09,944
That sounds good.

358
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,143
You're going to be OK.

359
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:15,792
- Am I?
- Yes.

360
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:19,303
We're gonna take good care of you,
don't worry.

361
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:44,625
OK. OK, you're fine.

362
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:08,425
- Are you her ride?
- Yeah.

363
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:10,145
Some instructions.

364
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:13,822
A bath, no tampons, just Motrin, pads
and get some rest.

365
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,068
You'll feel better by tomorrow.

366
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:18,263
Thanks.

367
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:21,111
Mary, Hayley, Bethany, Rosa.

368
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:26,743
What do you think?

369
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,830
I think it's a wonderful book.
You should be proud.

370
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,188
- "University of Maryland Press."
- My alma mater.

371
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:40,782
- It really is a different way of seeing things.
- Isn't it?

372
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,631
To me, California has
always been here,

373
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:46,665
but to you, it's just stopping by.

374
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,351
Yeah.

375
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,103
I'm thinking we should slow down
on the marriage plans.

376
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:59,704
I don't want anything else to change,
would that be OK with you?

377
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,392
I know I must seem confused.

378
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,424
It's only because I am.

379
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:08,505
Ruth, I'm here if you want me.

380
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:13,068
I don't have any other prospects
and I don't want any.

381
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:15,263
So there's no rush.

382
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,911
Thank you.

383
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,429
- Why isn't there a picture of you?
- I didn't want one.

384
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,464
It's about rocks, not me.

385
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:38,826
It just feels like it ought to be the end.

386
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:43,552
I'm so tired of having
the same fight over and over again.

387
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,104
I hear what you're saying.

388
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:52,024
I'm so bored of this kind of unhappiness.

389
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:55,426
I think I'm ready for some new unhappiness.

390
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:01,630
There are all kinds of things I could say but...

391
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:06,027
Go ahead, say them.

392
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:08,064
No, I...

393
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:11,191
What?

394
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:13,947
Say it.

395
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,542
I want you to know,

396
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,583
more than anything, David,

397
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:25,423
that I take you and your situation
with Keith really seriously

398
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:28,306
and if you can be happy with Keith,

399
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,106
I want you to be, you know what I'm saying?

400
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:34,426
I do.

401
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,472
Thank you.

402
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:22,062
- Hey, how you feeling?
- A little bit better.

403
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:26,190
It just feels like really bad cramps.

404
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,110
- You need another pad?
- No.

405
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,542
- Another Motrin?
- No, thanks.

406
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,991
So, what do you think of my new house?

407
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:38,070
- It's kinda gross, isn't it?
- No, it's cool.

408
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:43,502
- And it's kinda gross.
- I know. See? I know.

409
00:34:43,553 --> 00:34:47,546
I used to wonder when I'd get there,
to the grown-up place.

410
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:51,023
Almost got there with Nate.

411
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:54,228
And then here I am.

412
00:34:56,713 --> 00:35:00,023
- You're still in love with my brother, aren't you?
- No.

413
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,712
No.

414
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:05,028
Only in the way that I always will be

415
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:10,511
but not in the way of thinking about him like,
"God, when am I gonna see Nate again?"

416
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,430
you know what I mean?

417
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,270
Yeah, I do.

418
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:17,109
I am worried about him, though.

419
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:20,423
I know.

420
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:23,033
He's so fucked up with Lisa being

421
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:27,463
wherever she is.

422
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:31,982
You know what's weird about Lisa?

423
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,548
- What?
- Well, I think she really liked me...

424
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:39,711
- I'm sure she did.
- She was fucked up, too, don't get me wrong.

425
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:43,143
Just a different kind of fucked up
from our family.

426
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:45,548
Like a mostly friendly kind of fucked up.

427
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:50,465
- You miss her?
- I guess, yeah.

428
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,108
- Sorry if that's...
- No.

429
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,863
It's totally right.

430
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:07,908
Well, I'm going to make some pasta.

431
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:14,185
I was just gonna do it with olive oil,
nothing too aggressive.

432
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:16,984
You want some?

433
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,713
No, I don't think I can ever eat again.

434
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,503
Hey, it's Nate.

435
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:15,232
- Tell me when you want me to stop.
- I don't want you to stop.

436
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,784
I want you inside me.

437
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,544
No, no, wait.

438
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:48,148
- I like it like this.
- Yeah.

439
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:51,265
OK.

440
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,063
- Fuck me.
- You'll wake the baby.

441
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:13,071
I don't care, you're fucking me so good.

442
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:17,702
Fuck me. Fuck me till
I can't remember my name.

443
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,744
Just fuck me.

444
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,706
Fuck me.

445
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:48,790
Who will separate us from the love of Christ?

446
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:52,143
Will hardship or distress or persecution

447
00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:56,429
or famine or peril of the sword?

448
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:57,906
No.

449
00:38:57,953 --> 00:39:02,663
In all these things we are more than
conquerors through Him who loves us.

450
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:09,232
For I am convinced that neither death nor life
nor anything else in all creation

451
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,741
can separate us from the love of God.

452
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:17,867
Carl Williman was a part
of God's good creation.

453
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:22,227
Susceptible to sin, yes, but worthy of grace.

454
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:27,072
May his soul and the souls
of those whose lives he took

455
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:32,631
find peace in the infinitely
complicated and eternal life of God.

456
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,504
I knew her at St Bart's.

457
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,310
Yeah.

458
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:46,423
She was pretty fucked up.

459
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:49,984
Seems like it.

460
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,425
- So I came out of the closet.
- And that was good?

461
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:59,748
Yeah.

462
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:03,388
- And I'm in a committed relationship.
- With Keith?

463
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:08,112
Yeah. That's supposed to be
a good thing, too, right?

464
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,144
That's what I've heard.

465
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:13,310
So, shouldn't my life be better?

466
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:18,344
Truth and relationships don't make life better,
they make life possible.

467
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,512
So you think I should stay with Keith?

468
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:29,791
I think you should do whatever brings you
deeper into the reality of your life.

469
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,188
The reality of my life.

470
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:37,353
Yes, but not the life you think you can have,
the life you've got.

471
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:51,265
Hi.

472
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:53,349
What you doing?

473
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:57,181
I am just checking things out,
you know, keeping track.

474
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:02,507
I had a really good time last night.

475
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:06,591
And I think we should...

476
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,783
I think we should do that again.

477
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,586
I don't think that's such a good idea.

478
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:14,670
- How come?
- I just don't.

479
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,105
I'm sorry.

480
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:37,268
Are you serious? You're gonna cry?

481
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,544
I can't help it.

482
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:43,264
Come on.

483
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:47,022
Have you seen
what kind of fucking world this is?

484
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:52,067
You see what people do, what your
fucking father did, now you're gonna cry?

485
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:55,310
"Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."

486
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,344
You don't get to cry.

487
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,793
Where were you last night?
I was looking for you.

488
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,869
- To watch Maya?
- Yeah.

489
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:24,024
I was busy. Sorry.

490
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:30,383
- Can I have these?
- Sure. I don't care.

491
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:39,262
- That's weird.
- What?

492
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:43,431
Russell used to say the whole house
smelled like the colour wheel.

493
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:46,192
- Yeah?
- He liked it here.

494
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:50,112
Well, somebody should get something out of it.

495
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:01,664
Nate, maybe you could give Brenda a break.
She's only trying to help.

496
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:08,631
Things between me and Brenda are
a lot more complicated than you might think.

497
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:12,387
Yeah, I'm sure I could never imagine.

498
00:43:23,713 --> 00:43:26,068
So what went wrong?

499
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:29,108
Well, the first one was Susie

500
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:33,305
and we just got married too young, that's all.

501
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:35,264
Wasn't anybody's fault.

502
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,702
Number two.

503
00:43:37,753 --> 00:43:41,951
Gloria, yeah, that one was my fault.

504
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,983
I screwed around.

505
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,264
- I know better now.
- You better know better.

506
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:50,304
Number three.

507
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:53,186
She was the one I was screwing around with.

508
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:58,872
Tanya. We were at Rutgers, my first job.

509
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:00,904
Assistant professor.

510
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:05,068
She cheated on me all the time.

511
00:44:05,113 --> 00:44:07,149
How do you not see that coming?

512
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,988
Andrea died.

513
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:15,751
I'm sorry.

514
00:44:16,593 --> 00:44:21,303
Cheryl, that one was only for nine months.

515
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:23,389
And Doris,

516
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:27,024
the last one, died.

517
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,062
I'm so sorry.

518
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:32,230
Well, if you marry six people,
a few of them are gonna die,

519
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:34,389
that's the odds.

520
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:38,149
And you're ready to try again?

521
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:40,229
With you? Of course.

522
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:44,105
Why? You don't want to?

523
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:47,428
No, of course I do, George.

524
00:44:47,473 --> 00:44:49,623
I think.

525
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:52,185
But

526
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,749
you had all these women.

527
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:58,823
Let me tell you something.

528
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:02,184
One time,

529
00:45:03,313 --> 00:45:05,463
one time I bought a house,

530
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:10,507
this was back in Massachusetts
when I was teaching at Amherst,

531
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:14,944
and the house was built over a stream.

532
00:45:14,993 --> 00:45:17,348
Literally over it.

533
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,509
It had been a mill at one time

534
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:23,432
and someone had taken the wheels
and grinding stones out

535
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,668
but it was still over the stream.

536
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:30,665
And after we moved in
I wanted to put a new floor in the kitchen.

537
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:33,706
So?

538
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:38,065
So I tore up the old floor,
ripped up the linoleum,

539
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,104
pulled up the plywood.

540
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:44,031
Then I pulled up one of the original boards.

541
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:48,505
This 200-year-old pine board.

542
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:53,066
And there was the stream,

543
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:55,104
not two feet underneath me.

544
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:59,867
I'd always known it was there
but there it was.

545
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,904
You know-really.

546
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:05,464
There it really was.

547
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:11,504
This live, sparkling water,

548
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:15,387
flowing right underneath my house.

549
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,104
That's how I feel about you.

550
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:31,431
What?

551
00:46:31,473 --> 00:46:33,429
Did I say something wrong?

552
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:35,191
I'm sorry.

553
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:37,872
You make me miss Nathaniel, though.

554
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:39,790
I'm sorry.

555
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,585
It's OK.

556
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:44,429
I miss a few of mine, too.

557
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:54,788
He was like, "I'm paying your rent,
I bought you all this shit,

558
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:58,109
"I expect you to have dinner with me
whenever I want."

559
00:46:58,153 --> 00:47:00,144
And I was like, "No."

560
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:06,303
Glad we could be here for you.

561
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,344
Yeah, me too.

562
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:14,270
But you gotta treat my sister better or
she's gonna leave you like I left that Anthony.

563
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:16,383
She will.

564
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,424
You guys are out of popcorn.

565
00:47:29,353 --> 00:47:31,071
Oh, God.

566
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:35,272
Overruled it.
Said they'd be too high in carbohydrates...

567
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:40,504
We have to talk.

568
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:43,704
What is it? I've had a fucking day from hell.

569
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:48,152
I don't want us to be together any more.

570
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:55,226
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yeah. I'm breaking up with you.

571
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:57,104
- Wait a minute.
- No.

572
00:48:57,153 --> 00:48:59,462
Just give me a few days to find a place

573
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:03,347
then you can find somebody
more whatever it is you like-mean.

574
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:07,864
- We should go to therapy and talk about this.
- It's not a discussion.

575
00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:11,986
There's nothing to talk about,
it's never been right between us.

576
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,991
- We can stop wasting each other's time.
- Don't.

577
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,103
Or what? You'll hit me?

578
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:19,747
- No.
- I'm sick of being scared of you.

579
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,909
I hate it.

580
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:23,944
I absolutely fucking hate it.

581
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,064
Lise?

582
00:50:14,993 --> 00:50:16,949
Lisa!

583
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:21,710
Lisa, where are you?

584
00:50:22,593 --> 00:50:24,743
I'm right here.

585
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:33,548
Where are you?

586
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,949
I don't know.

587
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:43,392
None of this turned out the way I wanted it to.

588
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,628
You know that, right?

589
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:48,312
I wanted to love you, I did love you.

590
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:51,072
And I just felt like we were beginning to...

591
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,067
I know we were, I know it in my heart

592
00:50:56,113 --> 00:51:00,982
and I feel like I had this
once-in-a-lifetime chance and I fucked it up.

593
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:04,910
Nate, I'm not a chance, I'm a person.
