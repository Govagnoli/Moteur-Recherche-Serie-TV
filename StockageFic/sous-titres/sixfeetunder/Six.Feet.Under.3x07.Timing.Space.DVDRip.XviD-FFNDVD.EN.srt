00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,717
(Radio on, indistinct)

2
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:35,520
(Lisa) The paediatrician's number's
by the phone.

3
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,206
The teething biscuits are on the counter.

4
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,240
I left two bottles of milk in the fridge
and five more in the freezer.

5
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:46,360
- You must be proud.
- I kinda am. I'm sorry. I'm proud.

6
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,401
Are you sure
you guys are gonna be OK today?

7
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,245
Honey, believe it or not, I know what I'm doing.

8
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:59,315
Have fun. Go to your cooking zoo.

9
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,005
- It's a food show.
- Whatever.

10
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,277
Have a good time. You've earned it.

11
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,879
Bye, baby girl. Be good to your daddy. Hm?

12
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,518
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,317
I feel guilty leaving her with you all day.

14
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,597
Honey, it's OK. We'll be fine.

15
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,276
What?

16
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:29,366
You never really thought
you'd have a wife and a kid, did you?

17
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:32,160
I never thought I'd be a funeral director either.

18
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,522
- Love you.
- We love you. Go.

19
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,880
Well, what do you wanna do today?

20
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,243
We could fill some things up, dump them out.

21
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,676
Maybe then we can poop.

22
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,957
What do you say? Huh?

23
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,998
(! Electronic classical music)

24
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,521
Arthur, you wrote this music?

25
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,276
- You actually wrote it yourself?
- Not exactly.

26
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,363
You are so multifaceted.

27
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,319
Not really. It's just a theme by Debussy.

28
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:16,519
But I've developed it somewhat,
put a drumbeat underneath it.

29
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,558
Just for fun.

30
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,404
It's nothing much.

31
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,483
Arthur, that's amazing.

32
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:25,917
It's nothing, really. Anybody could do it.

33
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:30,722
No, it really is.
You're a very talented young man.

34
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,327
Where's the button to make it play again?

35
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,484
I love that little tune. It's so haunting.

36
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:40,236
- Actually, Ruth, I need to get going.
- So soon?

37
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:44,405
- I thought I might take a run this morning.
- I didn't know you ran, Arthur.

38
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:48,156
Well, I haven't ever before, actually.

39
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,277
But I thought I might give it a try.

40
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,876
I seem to have gained some weight lately.

41
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:56,646
- But you look fine.
- Thank you.

42
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,480
People and their weight nowadays,
it's such a strange fascination.

43
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,282
I see you all the time round the house
and you look fine, just fine.

44
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,879
- Thank you.
- Well, I...

45
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,244
- Where are you going to run?
- Pardon me?

46
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:19,916
- Where are you going to run?
- Oh. Pan Pacific Park.

47
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,958
Pan Pacific Park? By the tar pits?

48
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,204
Yes. They have a little path there, for running.

49
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:30,162
Oh, well, that's perfect for you, then.

50
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,675
Good. Well, have fun.

51
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:37,641
And thank you
for sharing your music with me, Arthur.

52
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,117
It's very rhythmic.

53
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,318
OK, so long.

54
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,157
(! Electronic Debussy theme)

55
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,837
(Maya gurgling)

56
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,479
Fuck.

57
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:35,879
(Nate) 'Listen, Lise, I got some bad news.
Brenda's dad died. '

58
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,999
- What?
- Brenda's father died.

59
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,119
- Oh, shit.
- 'Yeah. '

60
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:46,399
- Would it be OK with you if I went to the...
- (Slurping)

61
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,803
Can you make any more noise?
I can still hear myself think.

62
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,520
- Funny.
- What?

63
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,877
Would it be OK with you
if I went to his funeral?

64
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:57,724
Of course.

65
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:02,363
She was there with me when my father died.
It feels like I should check in with her.

66
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,637
Then go, you totally should.

67
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,962
- Are you sure?
- 'Yeah. '

68
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:10,241
- OK.
- 'You'll leave Maya with your mom? '

69
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll figure it out.

70
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:15,999
Tell her not to give her any more cheese.
She's already constipated.

71
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:19,437
Tell her to go easy on the Nuk.
I don't want her to get buck teeth.

72
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,205
- I love you.
- 'Love you too. '

73
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,398
- You having fun?
- Not yet.

74
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,438
- 'Bye-bye. '
- Bye.

75
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,482
- Brenda's dad died?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,087
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

77
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:35,800
The funeral's up in Malibu in a few hours.

78
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,680
- Where's Mom?
- I don't know.

79
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,197
She just left.
Said she needed a new gardening hat.

80
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,841
She seemed kind of weird.

81
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:48,436
- How can you tell when Mom's weird?
- Good point.

82
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,160
Can you watch Maya for me today?

83
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,516
20 bucks.

84
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,161
- I can't.
- Why not?

85
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,243
Russell and I are going to the art store.

86
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,039
- Claire.
- Nate.

87
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:06,121
This isn't The Matrix. The rest of us
who don't have babies, we're real.

88
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,676
"Watch my baby, watch my baby."
Jesus Christ.

89
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,278
Fuck.

90
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,441
Fuck.

91
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,478
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

92
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:24,442
I thought I could drop Maya off
with Todd and Dana's nanny, but I guess not.

93
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,516
- You should give Vanessa a call.
- Vanessa?

94
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,558
Yeah, she's at home with the boys today.

95
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,201
- She'd be OK with it?
- Of course, she loves babies.

96
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,159
I'd be a couple of hours.
I'd drop her off, pick her up.

97
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,445
- Do it.
- All right, thanks.

98
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,523
You'll have to pay her.

99
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,526
- Well, sure.
- Great.

100
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:48,925
Keith, tell me you're not really
planning on wearing that.

101
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:53,995
- What's the matter with it?
- It covers up all your good big... parts.

102
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,844
- My good big parts?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,924
Take that thing off
and go put on something better.

104
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,640
Maybe your silver DKNY T-shirt.

105
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,444
Is this a brunch or a fashion show?

106
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:08,036
I want everybody to be jealous
of my beautiful boyfriend. OK?

107
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:11,966
I have two things going for me in this world
and you're one of them.

108
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,965
- What's the other one?
- All right, one.

109
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,724
You knew that sweatshirt was a bad idea
when you put it on.

110
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:23,043
- I guess.
- You're so wilful sometimes.

111
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,521
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

112
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,604
We could just skip the brunch, stay here.

113
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:31,115
I could be wilful all afternoon.

114
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,795
You make a very strong case.

115
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:39,083
But I really want a mimosa. I'm sorry.

116
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,838
Your loss.

117
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,756
(Coughing and spluttering)

118
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,122
(Hacking and spitting)

119
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,198
Up we go.

120
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,363
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

121
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:35,285
It's so cool you're leaving the baby for a while.

122
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,764
- You sure it's all right?
- It's perfect. It breaks up the day.

123
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,879
- What's that smell?
- That's pudding.

124
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:46,886
I tried to make rice pudding
but the milk was weird.

125
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,640
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

126
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,203
The place is a total mess.
I was just starting to clean when you called.

127
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,477
It's so hard to pick up with two kids.

128
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:01,406
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- I don't think you can.

129
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:05,360
I know it seems having two kids
would just be twice as hard,

130
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:10,401
but it's like three times or four times
as much to do.

131
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:15,202
I don't know how that is, the math,
but somehow it all adds up.

132
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,080
- Of course.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,482
You're lucky, you just have one.

134
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:24,156
Lisa's such a good mom.
I bet she does everything right.

135
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:27,324
She's... good, yeah.

136
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:30,962
Yeah. I get so tired sometimes,
I could almost cry.

137
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,645
(Screaming on TV)

138
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,917
Whatever happened to Barney?

139
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,403
When it was just Barney,
things were simpler then.

140
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:45,083
Let me just go put this stuff down
and then I'll take her off your hands, OK?

141
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:50,116
(Baby crying)

142
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,842
Man, I could so go totally broke in this place.

143
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,245
Every time I come here I feel
like Augustus Gloop in the chocolate room.

144
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,960
- You know who I'm talking about?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,522
When I was a kid
those Oompa Loompas used to freak me out.

146
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:09,276
My mom always made us watch it
and we cried every time.

147
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,125
It was like she didn't even care.

148
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,635
- Parents are freaks.
- Word.

149
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,679
I felt so bad for Charlie.

150
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:21,561
He's so poor. It's a fucking nightmare.

151
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:24,041
- Wow.
- What?

152
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,396
It's cobalt blue.

153
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:32,442
Just think, this is the natural part of the earth
that's this colour blue.

154
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,001
- Like Olivier said.
- Yeah.

155
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,835
It's an element. You add oil to it
and make pictures with it.

156
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,720
Like cave people. I love it.

157
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,844
- You should buy it.
- Yeah, right.

158
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:51,245
I'm not even really a painter.
I'm not gonna spend... What, 50 bucks?

159
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,801
It's a little tube of paint.

160
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:57,203
If I'm gonna paint
I'll buy the cheap five-dollar shit.

161
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,841
- You should get it.
- No way.

162
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,481
- Get it.
- No.

163
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:06,645
- I'll get it for you.
- No, I don't need it. Come on.

164
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:09,406
- Get it.
- No.

165
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:13,718
OK. Jesus. Sorry.

166
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,164
What are you doing back here?

167
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,961
To tell you the truth, I don't really know.
What's up with Vanessa?

168
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,316
- Nothing.
- You're sure?

169
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,638
Uh, yeah.

170
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:36,358
She's been down in the dumps
since her mom died, but other than that, why?

171
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:41,435
I don't know, Rico. I got there and...
I don't know how to put this.

172
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:46,880
She had this really intense energy going on
and there's no way I could have left Maya.

173
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,400
You didn't feel safe leaving Maya at my house?

174
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:53,723
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you trying to say?

175
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,965
- (Arthur) Hello, gentlemen.
- Look who decided to come back to work.

176
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,680
Do you need someone to watch Maya today?

177
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,126
(Nate) Um...

178
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,727
Cos I love infants.

179
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:06,758
They smell so sweet.

180
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,241
No, Arthur, I'm OK.

181
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:13,280
- I'm gonna take her with me, but thanks.
- Never hesitate to ask.

182
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,603
I used to watch my cousins all the time
and they were Mormons.

183
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,926
- Mormons?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:25,315
OK, I'm gonna wash up and get to work.

185
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:32,078
- Rico, I'm sorry...
- No need to apologise, Nate.

186
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,721
I was just trying to do you a favour.

187
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,918
Well, thanks.

188
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,319
No, thank you.

189
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:50,081
So let it be said of me when I am gone,

190
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:53,961
"He lived by the light
of the ten thousand things.

191
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:59,923
"His heart with starry sparks
was thus sustained

192
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:05,121
"And love and meaning
passed through him and fled.

193
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:11,720
"To carry joy from dark to dark
was joy enough for him.

194
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:15,041
"The man is dead."

195
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,839
(Laughs)

196
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,997
I just have some pictures.

197
00:16:55,967 --> 00:17:00,085
This first one is of Dad and me
in the back yard...

198
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,842
standing next to my hole to China.

199
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,764
(Chuckles)

200
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:10,561
I was five years old,
trying to dig a hole to China.

201
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:16,160
He never, ever told me
I couldn't actually get to China.

202
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:21,001
He just kept digging with me
until I got bored.

203
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,284
It was a good day.

204
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,444
The second one is of the whole family

205
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:36,481
with Dad at the APA conference in 1984.

206
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:43,324
They gave him an award
and he got up there and made all these jokes

207
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:47,724
about Jimmy Carter needing Adlerian therapy.

208
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,485
(Laughter)

209
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,518
I didn't get the jokes.

210
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,922
I was proud of him that night.

211
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,358
Proud that he was my dad.

212
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,758
This last one...

213
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,998
Come on, Billy.

214
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,316
It's just a really good picture.

215
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:44,397
Oh, my God. Hey.
Welcome to my humble abode-a-lair.

216
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,438
- Oh, neat.
- Sorry we're late.

217
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,559
Fuck that. Your timing is perfect.

218
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,963
- Keith, it's great to meet you.
- Thanks for having us over.

219
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,363
You kidding? The pleasure's all mine. Rrrrr!

220
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,479
- Hey, everybody, it's David and Keith.
- (All) Hi!

221
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:02,405
So come on in, come on in.

222
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:05,041
Grab a mimosa, have some quiche.

223
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,885
The quiche is in quotes. I'm not a total idiot.

224
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,476
Whatever you do, don't look Trixie in the eye.

225
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,644
- Who's Trixie?
- My little pooper dog.

226
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,121
You are my little pooper, aren't you?

227
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,886
Don't look her in the eye.
She'll freak out and poop.

228
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:24,876
We're talking spraying poop.
Seriously, don't even look at her.

229
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:26,724
You got it.

230
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:32,000
By the way, we're playing Leading Ladies.

231
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,038
Best of luck.

232
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:39,677
- He just put something on my back.
- No, it's a game.

233
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,319
Leading Ladies.

234
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:46,725
Everybody is a leading lady. You have
to figure out who you are by asking questions.

235
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,201
"Am I this? Am I that?"

236
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:53,638
Come on. You can decide to have a rotten time
or decide to have fun.

237
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:56,485
You sound like a camp counsellor.

238
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,599
All right, I'll have fun.
Let me see who you are.

239
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,319
Oh, that's good.

240
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:05,205
I hope that poem was satisfactory, Margaret.

241
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,715
I seem to remember Bern liking it.

242
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:12,158
And I seem to remember Bern thinking
you were an absolute asshole.

243
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:13,925
Mom, chill.

244
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:17,926
Billy, your Uncle Marv is here
for his own complicated reasons.

245
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,516
He deserves to have
his own complicated experience.

246
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:25,162
Thank you, Marv. It was a perfect poem.
You did your duty.

247
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,596
You can now get the fuck out of here.

248
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:29,683
Shhh, please.

249
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:33,356
- Brenda.
- See you.

250
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,398
Billy.

251
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:38,718
Oh. Hey.

252
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,804
He never forgave your father
for being a success.

253
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,405
Or giving up Hanukkah.

254
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,722
(Brenda) It's better...

255
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,997
- Nate?
- Hey, Margaret.

256
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,756
So sorry to hear about Bern.

257
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:57,437
Nate, please, don't give me
that funeral home shit. Come on, now.

258
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:01,082
- Did Brenda call you?
- No, I read it in the paper.

259
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,687
You just came here under your own steam?

260
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:08,676
- Yeah, I guess so.
- That's so strange.

261
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,641
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey.

262
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:14,676
Hey.

263
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,126
Hey.

264
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,681
(Margaret) We're going to be
at the condo later.

265
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,764
Just the family. Just a little dinner.
Right, Billy?

266
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:26,241
Yes, Mother, it's all taken care of.

267
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:30,519
Tragedy. It's the one thing
our children are really good at.

268
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:36,243
- I mean, my children.
- It's OK, Mom.

269
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:42,237
- So can you join us?
- Thanks, but I need to get back to the house.

270
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:45,597
- You can stick around for a little bit?
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,842
Let's go round here.

272
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:51,362
- Don't be...
- I won't. I won't.

273
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,159
(Door closing)

274
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,563
Oh, Arthur, hi.

275
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,399
Hi, Ruth.
Did you have a good time stalking me?

276
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,799
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please.

277
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:23,435
If you like following people so much,
why don't you join the CIA?

278
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,478
Or the Moonies?

279
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:30,476
Or why don't you go to the actual fucking moon
and mind your own moon business?

280
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:33,121
You... freak!

281
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,920
Hi, Ruth. Did you have a good morning?

282
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:41,599
Oh, yes, Arthur, thank you. It was wonderful.

283
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,877
Thank you so much for asking.

284
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:50,002
I'll be right back. I have to go upstairs.
My hair feels funny.

285
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:53,005
OK. Bye.

286
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:02,619
- Keith seems like a lot of laughs.
- Oh, stop.

287
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:04,738
He's just a little out of his element.

288
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:08,303
Completely. I love that he even came.
It's so not his type of thing.

289
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:10,339
What's his type of thing?

290
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,941
I don't know. He likes to cook and work out.

291
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:16,786
He loves old movies.
He's probably doing very well.

292
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,582
- Tell me, am I a black widow?
- I don't know.

293
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:24,780
- Am I known for my figure or my face?
- Turn around, let me see the sticker.

294
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:31,702
I don't know.

295
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:35,867
- Am I an Oscar-winner?
- I don't know.

296
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:39,617
- Am I blonde?
- I don't know.

297
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,899
- Are you really gay?
- Yeah, I'm really gay.

298
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:45,621
- (Dog yelps)
- (Shouts of horror)

299
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:48,899
Linda, goddammit, don't look Trixie in the eye.

300
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:50,506
Put that dog down.

301
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:58,657
Hey.

302
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:05,386
- Baby's first funeral?
- Hardly.

303
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,100
Yeah, I guess not.

304
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,778
How you holding up?

305
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:15,740
Let's not talk about me
or my dead father.

306
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,779
For 30 seconds, anyway.

307
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,227
OK.

308
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:23,065
What do you wanna talk about?

309
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:27,979
Tell me something about Maya.

310
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:33,659
Oh.

311
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:37,781
She's beautiful. Aren't you?

312
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:40,342
She discovered the telephone the other day.

313
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:43,425
- It's become her favourite new toy.
- Yeah?

314
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:47,541
Yeah. She accidentally speed-dialled
my neurologist's office yesterday.

315
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,898
They thought there was a stroke victim
on the end of the line.

316
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,539
I can't believe you came.

317
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:03,303
Of course I came.

318
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:09,826
- Hey, Vanessa?
- 'Yeah? '

319
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:14,464
Hey, I just talked to Nate
and he told me he came by.

320
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,500
- Yeah, he did.
- 'What happened? '

321
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:23,305
I don't know. Don't tell him I said this, baby,
but he seemed kind of out of it.

322
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:26,739
You sure nothing else was wrong?

323
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:30,019
Rico, remember how paranoid we were
the first year with Julio?

324
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:33,947
We wouldn't leave him with anybody.
Maybe that's how new parents are.

325
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:39,500
So... So you feeling OK?

326
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:44,338
- Yeah, I feel fine.
- 'You sure? '

327
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:50,782
Yeah, Rico, just come home.
The kids are just bouncing off the walls.

328
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:54,707
- 'All right, I'll be home soon. '
- OK.

329
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:56,739
- 'OK, bye-bye. '
- Bye.

330
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:07,939
It was three months from the day the doctor
told him he had it till the day he died.

331
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:09,979
Three months.

332
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,337
Stomach cancer's fast.

333
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:15,698
Gastric cancer's the technical term.

334
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,986
It was everywhere.
All up and down his alimentary canal.

335
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:25,025
It was fun learning all the jargon.

336
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,059
I know what you mean.

337
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:31,499
I never knew I had a medulla oblongata.
Now I could draw it for you.

338
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:35,148
Along with everything else in my head.

339
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:41,580
Do you have a scar?

340
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:45,619
Is that a rhetorical question?

341
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,544
Can I see it?

342
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,019
Sure.

343
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:54,977
It's, um...

344
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,179
Wow.

345
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,098
- Bren, it's OK.
- (Sobbing)

346
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,259
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, I know.

347
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:21,106
I'm at my father's funeral. I'm emotional.

348
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,584
You know this is the place
where we were supposed to be married?

349
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:35,780
I know.

350
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:48,147
Has every leading lady found herself yet?

351
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:52,500
I'm Kristy McNichol, but I think
that's always been painfully obvious.

352
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,220
- I'm Madonna.
- Of course.

353
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:56,145
- Barbara Stanwyck.
- Louise Fletcher.

354
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,748
- Keith doesn't know who he is.
- Oh, really?

355
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:02,427
- Shit.
- Get over here.

356
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:04,982
Get over here.

357
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:09,463
- This'll be fun.
- About face.

358
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:12,306
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's a good one.

359
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:17,217
Go ahead and ask us all the questions
you want. We're here to help.

360
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:21,181
- Am I dead or alive?
- You're alive. I think.

361
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:25,301
- Am I blonde or brunette?
- Brunette. You were blonde, but it was wrong.

362
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:28,226
Keith, we saw her at Chalet Gourmet
with Ben Stiller.

363
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:30,259
I remember Ben Stiller.

364
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,185
You know this. He knows this.

365
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:35,186
Remember when we walked out on Timecode?

366
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:37,219
- Yeah?
- She was in that.

367
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:39,304
- Mickey Blue Eyes.
- Basic Instinct.

368
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,498
- Waterworld.
- Yes, Waterworld.

369
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:45,780
(All) Waterworld. Waterworld. Waterworld.

370
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:48,388
Waterworld. Waterworld.

371
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:53,297
Waterworld. Waterworld. Waterworld.

372
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,097
I have no idea.

373
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,378
If the man doesn't know,
he doesn't know.

374
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,625
Jeanne Tripplehorn.

375
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:07,136
Who wants a margarita?

376
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,218
It's a stupid game anyway.

377
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:19,984
- Watching him die...
- Yeah?

378
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,901
It was like watching somebody
get washed out to sea,

379
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:26,781
only they're sitting right there in bed.

380
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:30,503
A wave comes, takes them a little away.

381
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:34,261
Another wave comes, takes them a little away.

382
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,583
Every wave is a day.

383
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:41,861
Little by little, off they... Off they go.

384
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,779
Can I tell you something?

385
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:53,660
Sure.

386
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:56,937
I don't wanna put you in a weird position.

387
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:03,585
I'm already in a weird position.
I've lived my whole life in a weird position.

388
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:07,259
I've missed you.

389
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,299
Through this.

390
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,099
I've missed you too.

391
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:25,621
It's not like I don't know
how much being with you changed me.

392
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:28,580
How much you woke me up as a person.

393
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,939
I wouldn't be who I am today
if I'd never met you.

394
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,147
I certainly wouldn't floss every day.

395
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:45,498
- Are you keeping up with that?
- After every meal.

396
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:54,143
It changed me too.

397
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,179
Yeah, how so?

398
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:07,265
You're the first person I've lost
where it really cost me something.

399
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:12,026
That's why I haven't been with anyone since.

400
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:16,338
- Nobody?
- It's too scary.

401
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:18,697
The thought of screwing it all up again.

402
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:25,425
- You'll find somebody.
- That is so not the answer.

403
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:35,296
- You know what I think?
- About what?

404
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:39,136
- I don't know. Life.
- What?

405
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,263
I think it's all about timing.

406
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,303
I think timing is everything.

407
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,544
I think you might be right.

408
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,619
(Seagulls crying)

409
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,504
(! Dan Wilson: Come Home Angel)

410
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:11,381
- What's in here?
- Just open it.

411
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:14,465
Am I forgetting some weird anniversary
or something?

412
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:19,423
Like our 17-week anniversary
or something like that?

413
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:25,301
Oh, my God. You're such a freak.

414
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,499
- When did you even get this?
- Magic.

415
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:33,182
What am I even gonna do with this,
you dumbass? It cost 50 bucks.

416
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:38,256
I don't care what you do with it.
I just wanted you to have it.

417
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:41,063
I have a theory that every now and then

418
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:44,145
a person should get what they want,
when they want it.

419
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:48,061
- Keeps you optimistic.
- It's a good theory.

420
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:50,144
But I've never been optimistic.

421
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,304
Maybe it's time to start.

422
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:56,857
It's a lot of money, though, Russell.

423
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,619
So what?

424
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:05,227
Money only fucks up art anyway, right?

425
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:12,617
I'd rather be poor and see you happy.

426
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,579
What?

427
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:32,860
Nothing.

428
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:35,978
I have to be careful now, right?

429
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,019
No.

430
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,819
- No.
- Yes, I do.

431
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:45,065
I have to be careful I don't get too used to this.

432
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,499
Go ahead.

433
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,899
Get used to it.

434
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:55,579
I dare you.

435
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:04,298
Do you ever talk to Olivier about us?

436
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:06,782
No. Do you?

437
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:09,058
No.

438
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:11,099
Why not?

439
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:17,906
No reason. I guess I just want there to be
certain things that are just ours.

440
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:21,577
Well, this is... This is just ours.

441
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:24,340
Cool.

442
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,179
Thank you for the paint.

443
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:30,219
Any time.

444
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:36,178
(Ruth, with organ accompaniment)
! Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes

445
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:40,744
! Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes

446
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:45,225
! Silver-white winters that melt into spring

447
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:50,783
! These are a few of my favourite things

448
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:53,342
! When the dog bites

449
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,822
! When the bee stings

450
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:58,302
! When I'm feeling sad...!

451
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,145
- You're really good.
- Thank you.

452
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:04,659
! I simply remember my favourite things

453
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:12,422
! And then I don't feel so bad!

454
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:17,064
Oh... Oh, hello, dear.
We're having a little singalong.

455
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,987
- I can see that.
- Arthur's really quite talented.

456
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:26,500
He writes his own computerised music
and plays the old songs too.

457
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:28,903
- That's great.
- Isn't it?

458
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:30,506
So unexpected.

459
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,857
Arthur runs too. You two should run together.

460
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:37,185
Maybe we will sometime.

461
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:39,901
He played as an accompanist
for a ballet company.

462
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:43,065
Mom, I'm gonna head home.
I'm just checking in.

463
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,306
- Claire said you seemed out of it this morning.
- No, I'm wonderful.

464
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:49,862
But thank you for being concerned.

465
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:53,218
- How was the funeral?
- It was OK.

466
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:56,340
That poor girl's family
has gone through so much.

467
00:35:56,388 --> 00:36:00,427
I know. Life comes and gets you, doesn't it?

468
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,584
It certainly does.

469
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:06,265
Good night, baby.

470
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,147
I'll see you later.

471
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:15,660
Arthur, from now on,
don't go running or whatever

472
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:19,064
before you find out from Rico
what he needs done for the day, OK?

473
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:21,941
- I hope it wasn't a problem.
- No, it wasn't.

474
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:25,503
- Just keep in touch with him.
- I will.

475
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:27,982
- Thanks.
- Bye.

476
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:30,383
(Arthur starts playing again)

477
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:35,183
! Cream-coloured ponies
and crisp apple strudel...!

478
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:37,219
(Trickling)

479
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:45,744
Are you ready to get out of here?

480
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:48,507
- Not really.
- OK, then I'm gonna go.

481
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:51,379
Keith, we can leave.

482
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:54,181
Or I can stay if it's just a little while longer.

483
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:59,186
It's gonna be another few hours.
These guys take their brunches very seriously.

484
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:02,425
- Then I'm gonna go.
- No, I'll go now too.

485
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:06,507
No, it doesn't have to be that way.
Really, David, I'll just go.

486
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:10,466
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I've got things to do.

487
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:12,499
Stay, have fun.

488
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:15,187
You can get a ride with Peter, right?

489
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,298
- Patrick.
- Right.

490
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,418
Sure, I guess.

491
00:37:19,468 --> 00:37:21,698
(Trickling continues)

492
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:25,820
- You're still peeing.
- Yeah, I know.

493
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,304
I had seven mimosas
and way too much coffee.

494
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,702
- See you back home.
- OK.

495
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,183
Hey, we missed you. How was the food show?

496
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,264
It was amazing.

497
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:53,141
You could taste all kinds of truffles.

498
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:57,227
- Like chocolate?
- No, the mushroom things.

499
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,578
They were two bucks for a paper-thin slice.

500
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:03,062
Oh, they were so good.

501
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:09,138
They tasted like chocolate and mushrooms
and soy sauce and everything all at once.

502
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,179
- It was amazing.
- Sounds like it.

503
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:15,585
Dana was stalked by this guy
trying to sell her a smoothie franchise.

504
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:20,577
He followed us round for an hour
with his little tray of smoothie flavours.

505
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:24,507
Dana finally had to kind of hit him.
How was your day?

506
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,743
It was, uh... It was OK.

507
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:31,821
I ended up just taking Maya with me
to the funeral. It all worked out.

508
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:35,224
- You took Maya?
- Yeah.

509
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:39,024
To see Brenda?

510
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:43,061
No. Brenda was there, but I took Maya
because I couldn't find anyone.

511
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:50,024
Nate, I would have come home and taken care
of her myself if I knew you were gonna do that.

512
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,302
- Why?
- Oh...

513
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,736
Did Brenda hold Maya?

514
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:13,746
No, she was sleeping
practically the whole time.

515
00:39:13,788 --> 00:39:17,064
- Did she look at her?
- Well, yeah.

516
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:19,224
Did she touch her?

517
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:23,665
- I guess, yeah.
- Oh, God.

518
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:27,223
- You swear she didn't hold her?
- Yes, I swear.

519
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,059
Would it have mattered if she did?

520
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:34,145
Do you care about me at all?

521
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,180
You and Maya are
the most important things in my life.

522
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:40,140
Don't let your old girlfriends hold our baby.

523
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:44,625
- I didn't, so what's the problem?
- It's not that complicated, Nate.

524
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:48,456
Anyone who knows other people exist
would have figured it out.

525
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:51,306
You think I'm still in love with Brenda? I'm not.

526
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,500
- You went to her father's funeral.
- After checking with you. You said it was OK.

527
00:39:55,548 --> 00:39:58,540
Why do you spend time with her?
Why can't you let her go?

528
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:02,103
- Whatever Brenda and I had, it's over.
- Bullshit.

529
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:05,026
It doesn't take anything away
from what we have.

530
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:09,220
That's bullshit. After you spend time with her,
you're different.

531
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:13,307
- How am I different?
- You're more like you used to be.

532
00:40:13,348 --> 00:40:15,942
I wish you were
more fucking like you used to be.

533
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:18,900
- I haven't changed at all.
- You used to have a life.

534
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,347
You had friends, a job.

535
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:25,337
You didn't focus on what's wrong with me
and how I'm constantly disappointing you.

536
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:31,179
I'm gonna take a walk. I brought this for you.

537
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:34,745
- What is it?
- A truffle.

538
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,256
- Lise, come on.
- Give me some goddamn space.

539
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:41,099
OK.

540
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:43,587
(Brenda) 'lt's weird. '

541
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,545
That's the man who gave us life,

542
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:50,820
who influenced us more than any other man
ever did or probably ever will,

543
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,063
and now he's just dirt in a jar.

544
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:59,304
I hated him for so long.

545
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:03,299
He did the best he could.

546
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,384
We all did.

547
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,744
- Hey, Daddy.
- Bren.

548
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:18,659
Wow.

549
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:22,703
This is what Nate faces every day.

550
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:31,776
I suppose now we have to do something
with your father's goddamn ashes.

551
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:37,304
Well, it is kind of traditional.

552
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,738
I can't face that. Not yet.

553
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:44,463
You don't have to. He's in no hurry.

554
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:52,466
You know, you've never felt
so much like my children before.

555
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:57,104
Having your father around
always took the edge off that sensation, I think.

556
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:04,027
But I look at you both now
and you're both so mine.

557
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:07,421
Thanks.

558
00:42:27,508 --> 00:42:30,068
When you were little children, Bren,

559
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:36,424
you used to start everything you said to us
with an "and" or a "but".

560
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:42,384
You'd say,
"And, Mom, can we go to the store?"

561
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:48,588
Or, "But, Dad,
when we were talking before, you said..."

562
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:54,179
I mean, you always started
with a conjunction like that.

563
00:42:54,228 --> 00:42:57,345
And then, Billy, when you started talking,

564
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:00,983
you did the same thing.

565
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,659
He learned that from you, Bren.

566
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:09,344
Your father used to say living with you two

567
00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:14,667
was like listening to the longest sentence
in the history of the universe.

568
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:19,386
And now there's no one to hear it but me.

569
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:35,742
Dear Carl and Cameron,
greetings from Cousin Arthur.

570
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:39,661
A baby-sitting opportunity passed me by today

571
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,268
and left me thinking of you two fellows.

572
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,867
I hope you're enjoying
spreading the gospel in Kansas City.

573
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,741
My internship is coming along swimmingly.

574
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:57,145
There's a dear, charming woman here
at the funeral home

575
00:43:57,188 --> 00:44:01,101
who is very kind and attentive.

576
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:06,942
Well, I suppose that's all there is.

577
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:18,464
PS. Keeping in touch would be a lot easier
if you got an email account.

578
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:29,698
- Vanessa?
- Yeah.

579
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:34,145
I was just thinking,

580
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:39,979
maybe, uh... maybe it's time for you
to see a doctor or something.

581
00:44:40,028 --> 00:44:43,259
- You know, get some medicine.
- For what?

582
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:48,386
For... I don't know. Your mood?

583
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:53,299
My mood is exactly how it ought to be, Rico.

584
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:56,943
When your mother dies,
you're allowed to be upset about it.

585
00:44:57,788 --> 00:45:00,382
- For how long?
- For however long it takes.

586
00:45:00,428 --> 00:45:04,057
Listen. Julio's parent-teacher conference
is Monday at four.

587
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:07,180
- Can you make it?
- I'm just worried about you.

588
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:09,979
You know that, right?

589
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:13,179
I'm just trying to let you know
that I'm here for you.

590
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:19,383
Will you be able to make it? If you can't,
I can cancel it or change it or something.

591
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:24,738
- I'll be there.
- Thank you.

592
00:45:57,748 --> 00:45:59,739
You don't have to worry about Bren.

593
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:03,136
I'm not worried about her.

594
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,537
You don't have to worry about Bren.

595
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:11,699
- No?
- No.

596
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:14,581
You've found your happiness, Nate.
She'll find hers.

597
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:16,983
It's just a matter of time.

598
00:46:18,348 --> 00:46:20,418
What if I haven't found mine?
