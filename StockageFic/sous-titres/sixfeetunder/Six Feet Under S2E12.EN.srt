1
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:56,966
Very beautiful.

2
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,090
The coronation time.

3
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:18,323
-Encyclopedia Brown, are you snooping?
-No, it was open.

4
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,768
"Fuck me harder, surfer boy,
with your fat little crooked cock...

5
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:28,002
"and your please-tell-me-you're-not-serious
shaved balls. "

6
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,291
-This is pretty out there, Bren.
-Not really.

7
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,683
Have you had sex with two men
at the same time?

8
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,082
You ever had sex with two women?

9
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,324
And once again,
you refuse to answer my question.

10
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,042
-Have you?
-Yes.

11
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,488
-How was it?
-Which time?

12
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,167
"He puts on his yin-yang baseball cap
and asks for her number.

13
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,005
"'Why?' she says. 'So we can date?"'

14
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,970
Well, she has a point.

15
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:58,442
"On his way out, he says, 'Late,'
in that stupid surfer way.

16
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,490
"She feels sad for about half a second...

17
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,690
"then the familiar relief
when she hears the door shut.

18
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:07,810
"Why does it always feel so good
when they leave?"

19
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,165
What? I love it. I think it's great.

20
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:14,529
Yeah. It's just really weird
hearing it out loud.

21
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,369
I don't care if you love it.
I didn't write it for you.

22
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,652
You know what I think?

23
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,008
You're angry with me
about sleeping with Lisa.

24
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,048
Yeah.

25
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,762
Maybe you're getting back at me by writing
about you being with someone else.

26
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,764
Nate, it's not that simple.

27
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:35,286
I started writing this long before
I found out about you and Lisa.

28
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,093
So tell me.

29
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,563
What else is in that computer?

30
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,891
Or this computer.

31
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,373
Taylor, someone very important
is coming over tomorrow.

32
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:01,250
A very important friend.

33
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,722
And we need you
to be on your best behavior.

34
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:06,850
You mean a social worker?
I've had them before.

35
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:11,085
Miss Pastorelli and Mr. Shipley.
He smelled like Fritos and coughed a lot.

36
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,649
Me and my mom, we used to call him
"Mr. Shit-for-Brains. "

37
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,611
I am sick and tired of your mouth, all right?

38
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,003
When you speak like that,
you're not showing any respect for yourself.

39
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:26,450
There are people in this world who'll
not respect you, without you adding to it.

40
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,047
You know what I'm talking about?

41
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:33,485
You're gonna be late for school.
Go brush your teeth so we can leave.

42
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:41,446
-Keith, I don't think...
-I don't want to hear it.

43
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,728
Because I'm white,
I couldn't possibly understand?

44
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:47,692
Because you'll start spouting that child
psychology bullshit you've been reading.

45
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,571
It's not bullshit.
It's called the "whole-child theory"...

46
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:55,488
and it's only the collective thoughts of some
of the greatest educators around, okay?

47
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:00,171
Letting her know
that we love her for who she is builds trust.

48
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:03,962
Constantly scolding her
for behavior we don't like, doesn't.

49
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,566
-I don't know how we'll raise a child.
-We just are, okay?

50
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,883
The board still hasn't cleared me
on the shooting.

51
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,091
We're going to get the guardianship,
and we're going to be good parents.

52
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:23,481
Taylor, how long is it going to take you
to brush your teeth?

53
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:33,884
I would like to go on record as saying...

54
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,692
I am in full support of you
going to art school.

55
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,644
Consider it recorded.

56
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,452
But I'm just taking a tour.

57
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,524
Let's not get our panties in a wad over it.

58
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:45,207
That's such an unpleasant expression.

59
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,965
I never got to go to college.

60
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,771
-Did you even want to?
-I did.

61
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:52,402
-I wanted to study French feminist writers.
-You're a feminist, Mom?

62
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,451
Feminism means being accepted
for who you are.

63
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,804
I wanted to be a wife and a mother.

64
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,249
I never gave anything up to be a mother
or a wife. It was what I wanted.

65
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,244
I thought you said you gave up college.

66
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,167
-Why is every conversation with you a trap?
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,012
Be a feminist. We can both be feminists.

68
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:12,768
Check it out, Cindy Sherman went here.

69
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:16,609
-And Billy Chenowith? I never knew that.
-Brenda's brother?

70
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:19,810
-The one in the mental institution?
-He's out.

71
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,483
-Is he cured?
-Who knows?

72
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,925
God, I hate my hair.

73
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,009
When I go to college,
I'm gonna cut it all off, like Felicity.

74
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,606
Have I met her?

75
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,242
Yeah, she was here for dinner once.

76
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,325
Federico? Are you all right?

77
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,850
Yeah, I'm fine, David.

78
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,371
You know her?

79
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,849
Abuelita. It means "grandma. "

80
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:56,330
-Federico, I'm so sorry.
-No, she's not really my grandma.

81
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:58,244
She's sort of adopted.

82
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:03,764
She lived by herself, right across the street
from me and Vanessa, before we moved.

83
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,606
I used to clean the leaves
out of her gutters...

84
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:09,491
and bring her trashcans
back up the driveway.

85
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,292
I mean, nothing big,
just when I was doing mine.

86
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,933
We used to invite her
to all the kids' birthday parties.

87
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,732
She used to sit in this folding chair...

88
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:22,362
just happy to be there,
with a big smile on her face.

89
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,006
That's sweet.

90
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:30,403
-Is that the pre-need she and I did together?
-Yeah.

91
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:36,371
Is this a new rule? Wear pajamas to work?

92
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:40,492
Sorry. I live at Keith's now.
I don't know where half my stuff is.

93
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,402
What?

94
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:47,208
She wants the Our Lady of Guadalupe
casket. I love that one.

95
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:57,771
Listen, we heard back from the Use-of-Force
Review Board about your shooting.

96
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,811
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this...

97
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:03,453
but you're being brought up on charges.

98
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,206
Turns out all the perp had was a toy pistol.

99
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:09,606
There's evidence to suggest
that if the perp hadn't died...

100
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,924
he might have invented
a clean-burning alternative to fossil fuels...

101
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,766
reducing our dependence
on imported energy sources...

102
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,889
thus ending the conflict in the Middle East...

103
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,851
and deflecting the horror
of the impending world war.

104
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,207
It's good.

105
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,247
They decided it was a good shooting.

106
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,527
Thank you.

107
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,206
Congratulations.

108
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,801
Well, the board ruled. I'm off the hook.

109
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,606
Thank God.

110
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:53,692
-I'll talk to you later.
-Love you. Bye.

111
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:02,765
Claire Fisher?

112
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:06,448
-How'd you know?
-You don't look like a Mujadeep Siddiqui.

113
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,322
I'm Henry. I'll be your cruise director.

114
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,892
-Excellent.
-Let's go.

115
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:17,530
So let me guess. You were, like, the one
total weirdo outcast at your high school.

116
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,809
Not the only one.
But definitely one of the top ten.

117
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,570
I think that's what all of us are.

118
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:28,771
I think every last freak of every last
California high school winds up here.

119
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:32,163
We're kind of the Island of Misfit Toys
of colleges.

120
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:36,802
-Can anyone take welding?
-You have to. It's a requirement.

121
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,885
How cool that welding is a requirement,
not fucking calculus.

122
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,441
Nobody'll be looking at my math grades
to get in here.

123
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,251
Even though you don't need the grades...

124
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,608
you gotta make sure
you rock the application thing.

125
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,684
-Yeah, definitely.
-No, seriously.

126
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:53,812
A lot of people want to go to school here,
so it's not like a sleepwalk to get in.

127
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:57,090
Your essay, your portfolio,
all that stuff counts.

128
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:59,609
Letters of recommendation.

129
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,526
-Who do you know?
-Nobody.

130
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:07,249
-I sort of know Billy Chenowith.
-He's okay.

131
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:12,044
I think everything he does Gregory
Crewdson did better, except years ago.

132
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:16,330
But the alumni thing
should work in your favor.

133
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:22,322
-This one's called "The Jesus Balls. "
-First year student.

134
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,052
No, that's fine.
We don't have to go out tonight.

135
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,122
Okay.

136
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,201
Although we did decide that we would
get together every other night.

137
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:02,362
But this is actually better,
because now we can go out Saturday...

138
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,570
then Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
of next week.

139
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:07,002
Wait.

140
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:10,447
Then we can't be together next Saturday.

141
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:15,727
So, truth be told,
every other day isn't a workable plan.

142
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,692
I think we should decide
on a number of days of a week.

143
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,207
Say, three days a week or four days a week.

144
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,761
-Three days a week.
-Right. Or four days a week.

145
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,048
And then choose those four days...

146
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,044
always making sure we include Saturdays...

147
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:32,523
because who wants to stay alone
on a Saturday, right?

148
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:34,565
Whatever you decide.

149
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:39,249
Nikolai, don't let me talk you into something
you don't want to do.

150
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,812
No. Is fine.

151
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:44,241
Good, let me go look at a calendar.

152
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,726
So, tell me everything.

153
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,286
What does the human Frymaster look like?

154
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,686
The crematory?

155
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:02,127
It's a big steel thing in a big room.

156
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,408
How does it work exactly?

157
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,606
The container is placed
on these chrome rollers.

158
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,532
Then a small door raises
and the body goes through.

159
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,844
Like how your tray disappears
through that thing in the cafeteria?

160
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,127
Yeah.

161
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,083
Actually, it's just like that.

162
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,692
And then?

163
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:27,523
And then, once the body is in there,
there's a button that's pressed.

164
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:28,688
Sounds good.

165
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:32,527
Even though the good rabbi said
I shouldn't, just burn me up.

166
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,805
-Who pushes the button?
-Whomever you specify.

167
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:39,651
Buddhists have a family member.
Some people choose no one...

168
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,008
in which case the person
at the crematory does it.

169
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,811
I'll take that guy.

170
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:49,051
I guess I'll be on my own
at that point, though.

171
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,886
What about family members? Your parents?

172
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,085
They just got to be total downers.
I told them to stop coming.

173
00:13:57,173 --> 00:14:00,722
They'll find out I'm dead
when the rest of the world does.

174
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,572
-Got any other friends?
-Yeah, I had some.

175
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,164
A lot of work, you know?

176
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:11,009
A lot of people freak out when you get sick,
and a bunch of people betrayed me.

177
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,733
Some people just got too crazy to deal with.

178
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:15,565
-What about a girlfriend?
-No.

179
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:17,962
I mean, yeah, I had girlfriends.

180
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,566
Relationships.

181
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:24,404
But I'd be in something for whatever,
like two months, two years...

182
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,041
and then it would just get too....

183
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:32,407
Nothing. Just "too. "

184
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:36,611
I'd start thinking, "I don't like this about her,
and I don't like this about her. "

185
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,412
Then I'd start to feel this thing
on the back of my neck...

186
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:42,724
like one of those SuperBalls,
and it would throb with the word...

187
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:46,806
"Leave. Leave. Leave. " And so I would.

188
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:50,972
And the second I got my life back,
the ball would disappear.

189
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:56,525
I suffer from that American thing big time.

190
00:14:56,613 --> 00:15:00,401
You know, always looking around
for someone better. Shopping.

191
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:04,282
-I think a lot of people go through that.
-No, they don't, man.

192
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:07,922
Okay? They don't.
Most people just pick someone.

193
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,492
I never looked at someone
and just said, "Okay, I'll take you. "

194
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:19,763
You can still connect with people.

195
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,729
No, I can't.

196
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,092
It's too late.

197
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,287
Listen...

198
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:35,284
I'm gonna make a commitment to you.

199
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:40,003
I am hereby committing
to come and see you every day, without fail.

200
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,163
You don't have to come
and see me every day.

201
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:45,766
No, I want to.

202
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,411
-Whatever.
-All right, until tomorrow, then.

203
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,684
You want me to bring you anything?
Magazines?

204
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:55,762
No.

205
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,726
May I help you?

206
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,247
-Are you the owner?
-Yes, I'm David Fisher.

207
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,405
Andrew Perez. I understand
my mother's funeral is to be held here.

208
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,087
-Yes, of course. I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

209
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:22,482
-Could we go over the arrangements?
-Of course.

210
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:26,532
Let me just get my associate. He helped
your mother with her pre-need contract.

211
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,682
Fine.

212
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,843
I was a personal friend of your mother's.

213
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:35,209
My family and I lived across the street
from her for many, many years.

214
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:36,612
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:39,448
Hello?

216
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,642
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you...

217
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,085
I'm, say, about a 55-minute drive
from Mission Viejo.

218
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,404
Where's that course
you and Jim played last winter?

219
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,649
Hold on. You got a pen?

220
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,532
Yeah, got it.

221
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,611
Yeah, thank you so much.

222
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,402
It was her time. She lived a full life.
Okay, you take care.

223
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,326
I'm an orthopedic surgeon,
and every May, we do a tournament.

224
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,847
Your mother was very proud of you.

225
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,087
She always said,
"My Andresito's a surgeon. "

226
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:24,243
She was a wonderful woman...

227
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:28,089
and I'd like to give her
a top-of-the-line funeral.

228
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,405
I like this one.

229
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,288
-Is it real mahogany?
-Yes, it is.

230
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:36,843
Your mother already chose a casket, sir.
It's in her pre-need.

231
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,366
She liked this one.

232
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,690
I'd like to give her something nicer.

233
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,923
Yes, well, she liked this one.

234
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,642
This looks like some kind of gangbanger,
low rider, I don't know what.

235
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,611
She chose this one
because she was living on a fixed income.

236
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,968
I have money, and I want to change it.

237
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,363
She liked this one,
and this is the one that she should have.

238
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,848
I'm offering your business more money.

239
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,926
Your associate has some kind of
conflict of interest that I don't understand.

240
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,686
I only want to give my mother the best.

241
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,844
I appreciate your concern, Mr. Perez...

242
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:20,130
and I'd be happy
to upgrade your mother's casket.

243
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:24,763
But legally,
we're required to fulfill her wishes.

244
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:32,889
I don't know what kind of
piece-of-shit operation you're running here.

245
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,486
I really don't.

246
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,451
I'm trying to do something nice
for my mother...

247
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,491
and you just won't get out
of my fucking way.

248
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,968
I'm going to go make a salad.

249
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:59,602
If you weren't legally bound to follow
Mrs. Perez's instructions, would you...

250
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:03,811
To be perfectly honest,
I'm not entirely sure we are legally bound.

251
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:14,247
All right, that should be everything.

252
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:21,089
Now, I will contact you as soon as I know
if we'll be able to do a viewing, okay?

253
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,131
No one should have to see him this way,
not even my mother.

254
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,727
My son is the one
who saw everything happen.

255
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:30,205
It was raining, and I had told my dad...

256
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:33,007
-that it was too slippery on the roof...
-Of the house.

257
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,607
My husband was fixing the roof himself.

258
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,809
But he went up there anyway.

259
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,086
You're gonna freak when you see him.
I saw him.

260
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,806
I'll be okay.

261
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:48,166
I turned him over, and I looked at him.

262
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:54,523
I know you're not supposed to touch them
because it might be a back injury and all.

263
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,922
And my mother started yelling
not to touch him.

264
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:59,208
I thought it might be a back injury.

265
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,244
But I turned him over.

266
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:07,768
You see, he fell face first into the pile
of bricks on the side of the house...

267
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,651
so, I saw him.

268
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:14,852
It's okay.

269
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:35,771
-What are you looking for?
-Anything that seems too funny.

270
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,050
Funny ha-ha or funny gay?

271
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,806
What about this?
You think I should put this away?

272
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:42,008
What is it?

273
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,243
Esquire's Things A Man Should Know
About Style.

274
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,485
Please. A book about fashion has to be gay?
Stop being such a bigot.

275
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,806
Spy Kids, Shadow, Shadow 2....

276
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,008
Here, Taylor.

277
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,962
-Put this away.
-The Wiz? You're kidding.

278
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:00,328
-It's a gay video.
-It's a kid's video.

279
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,924
Diana Ross and Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson's a scarecrow.

280
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,083
It's not like they'll not know that we're gay.

281
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:09,324
-We're two men living together.
-I don't want to seem too gay.

282
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,005
Or like we're trying to make her gay.

283
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:14,449
Right. Watching The Wiz
will turn her into a lesbian.

284
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:17,332
Don't be so naive.
That's the way these people think.

285
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:20,644
You ought to worry about it
making her want to have plastic surgery.

286
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,212
Y'all are crazy.

287
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:27,045
-Okay, now what about this?
-Okay, that's pretty gay.

288
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,845
So, thank you for hooking me up
with LAC-Arts.

289
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,730
I finally went and visited.

290
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,208
And actually, it was amazing.

291
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:42,885
Not just the facilities, I mean,
which were unbelievable.

292
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:45,168
They had this whole giant, like, kiln wing.

293
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,766
-What wing?
-Kiln.

294
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:51,247
But there were these,
I don't know, not cool people...

295
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,563
because they're not like the posers here...

296
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:56,690
-but the people there...
-How large is the student body?

297
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,646
I don't know.

298
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,568
But I just did my whole application thing.

299
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,928
And I just....

300
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,561
You just what?

301
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,201
I want this.

302
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:17,009
I really want to go there.

303
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:22,929
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

304
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,609
Actually, I do need to get
three letters of recommendation.

305
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:31,447
I'll be happy to write you one.
It just may take me a couple days.

306
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:34,811
No, I mean, they have to be
from, like, successful artists...

307
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,646
so I was wondering
if maybe you knew anybody who...

308
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:38,802
No.

309
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:42,002
I don't know those kind of people.

310
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,885
Is it your birthday or something?

311
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:54,603
Just going-away gifts from some of the kids
I've worked with over the past few years.

312
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:58,448
-Where are you going?
-Cutbacks.

313
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,491
Just one counselor
is going to serve the district.

314
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:05,043
Not me. Some other guy
who's been in the system longer.

315
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,526
-I can't believe they...
-Wanna get rid of me?

316
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:15,973
I think it was time to move on anyway.

317
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:25,165
I'm sure we'll find each other
at graduation, right?

318
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:35,131
No, of course.
Thanks for getting back to me.

319
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:38,131
Yeah, I do. Okay.

320
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,327
No, sorry, I don't know where that is.

321
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,365
How do I get there?

322
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:56,005
"Last thing at night
before I fall asleep: love.

323
00:23:57,173 --> 00:24:00,245
"First thing after sunrise: love.

324
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,048
"I was born searching for you.

325
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:08,048
"And when I go into the darkness
of my final goodbye...

326
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:10,843
"it will be with you, love. "

327
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,724
Well, what do you think?

328
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:19,173
Shouldn't you and Dad
be writing your vows together?

329
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,972
No, we're going to surprise each other.

330
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:25,768
He's at Esalen doing some rituals
to cleanse his boy energy.

331
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:31,005
I know he's going to be naughty and get
Ram Dass to help him write his speech.

332
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:34,722
I still don't understand why you have
to have another commitment ceremony.

333
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:37,566
Can't you just go to Hawaii?
Leave the rest of us out of it?

334
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:42,283
It's about understanding that we have a lot
of work to do, but we need to do it together.

335
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:45,046
Honey, do you know what a soul twin is?

336
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:48,569
Soul mates aren't enough?
I have to have a "soul twin" now?

337
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,247
Great, more fucking propaganda.

338
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,970
Brenda, soul twin only means...

339
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:59,930
that your father and I made an agreement
in another world...

340
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:03,483
to meet again in this world
and walk through it together.

341
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:07,202
And so now, we have to stop walking
alongside one another...

342
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:11,525
and turn and face each other,
and move through the world face to face.

343
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,002
But how will you see where you're going?

344
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:18,609
You know, all this sarcasm
only impedes your prana.

345
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:22,652
What's with all the New Age shit?
You and Dad dropping acid again?

346
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,530
Not at all, darling.

347
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,162
Something wonderful has happened.

348
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,930
After a lifetime of being blocked,
I've finally discovered my spirituality.

349
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:35,444
Great. Someone
who's completely not in touch with herself...

350
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:39,685
now has a whole new vocabulary
to not be in touch with herself with.

351
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,693
I don't know why you have to be so cynical.

352
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,491
It's just fear.

353
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:50,526
You and Nate have that thing, don't you?

354
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,730
I call it "the magnet. "

355
00:25:58,653 --> 00:25:59,768
Baby?

356
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:05,801
Brenda, I want to give you
a little piece of advice.

357
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:09,886
If you don't have that feeling, get out.

358
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,810
-Now.
-Of course we have that.

359
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:15,442
You think you're the only ones to have that?
God, the ego.

360
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:20,161
$149,000.

361
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:29,923
-A what? A hundred what?
-$149,000.

362
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,210
-And she left it to us?
-Yes, she did.

363
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,251
Which I'm gathering
is somewhat of a surprise to you?

364
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,883
Yeah, somewhat.

365
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:42,249
I love when this happens.
It's the fun part of being a trust attorney.

366
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,406
I have a couple of forms for you to sign
before you can collect your inheritance.

367
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,290
I'll be just a moment.

368
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:51,211
Oh, my God.

369
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,723
$149,000, babe!

370
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,730
That's like $150,000.

371
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:01,247
Jeez, all I did
was clean her gutters sometimes.

372
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,882
And all I did was give you some pasteles
to bring to her.

373
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:08,409
-Why would she leave all of this to us?
-I don't know.

374
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,609
You know, you went and saw her.

375
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:12,809
She counted on you
more than you even thought.

376
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,361
No. You, too. Okay?

377
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:19,128
This money is for both of us.
You're the one who made her the pasteles.

378
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,329
If I only knew
she'd leave us all this money...

379
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:24,610
I would have made her some alcapurrias
or something.

380
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:07,763
I read about a bike trip
where you tour the countryside of Vietnam.

381
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,411
It's in 2003.

382
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:13,968
In 2003, how you know where
we're going to be? How you know this?

383
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:16,851
That's right. We very well might be dead.

384
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,809
We're all going to die sooner than we'd like.

385
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:22,248
Maybe we should do some nice things
before we die...

386
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,052
like bicycle through Vietnam.
We could save up for it.

387
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,045
It would give us something
to look forward to.

388
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:46,051
-Two for Murder by Numbers.
-No, I don't like it.

389
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:49,809
-Is Sandra Bullock. Is a girl's movie.
-I thought we agreed.

390
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:53,249
I see Blade ll.
You go ahead and see the girl's movie.

391
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,891
Why did we even come together if...

392
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:58,409
We go to two different movies.
We get together later to eat.

393
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:02,122
One for Blade ll and one for
Murdering by the Numbers.

394
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:05,091
-All right. Here's your tickets.
-Thank you.

395
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,122
Next in line.

396
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,329
I'll meet you right here at 7:40.

397
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:12,052
-Then we'll have a nice supper.
-Okay.

398
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,406
In your eyes, I see myself.

399
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,043
My copious imperfections...

400
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:32,290
as well as the tattered shreds of my divinity.

401
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:37,048
All the joy I've brought you
and the pain I've caused...

402
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:42,324
and still you hold me in your gaze,
undaunted by what love demands of us.

403
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:46,571
You give me strength to see you...

404
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:50,769
only you, now and forever...

405
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,325
and I'm blessed.

406
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:57,401
And so, in the name of the four elements...

407
00:29:57,493 --> 00:30:00,087
and of the God Lingam
and the Goddess Yoni...

408
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,722
I now pronounce you,
Margaret and Bern Chenowith...

409
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,486
newly wed.

410
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:26,644
So what's your favorite part
about fourth grade?

411
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,322
Math is fun.

412
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,368
Really?

413
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,088
And recess.

414
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:40,802
-She's good at so much.
-Yeah, she sure is.

415
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,523
So, would you say
you two have a parenting style?

416
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,250
We've been reading a lot
about the whole-child theory.

417
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:56,572
Although we definitely like
to mix in a little common sense.

418
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:58,088
How so?

419
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:03,562
We certainly believe in setting limits,
but we try not to be too rigid.

420
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:13,407
I think that should just about do it.

421
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:17,691
Thank you for coming, Mr. Sherman, sir.

422
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:22,291
I'll need to have a conversation with your
supervisors about your work and so forth.

423
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:25,524
I'm my own supervisor.
I'm a business owner.

424
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,684
And, as my supervisor, I'd like to say...

425
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:33,527
that David Fisher is a great person,
and great to work with.

426
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:38,489
My supervisor is Sgt. Potts,
Northeast Division.

427
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:40,529
I'll phone him tomorrow.

428
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:44,765
I'll let myself out.

429
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:51,046
-Where'd you get your coffee table?
-Restoration Hardware.

430
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:55,126
God, don't you just love that store?
I swear, I could live there.

431
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:57,332
Okay, bye.

432
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,284
That man was totally gay.

433
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:11,008
That's an interesting theory.

434
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,649
I can't admit to something I didn't do.

435
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,883
Looks like you won't have to.

436
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,649
Justin's talking in there.

437
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,806
Justin's here?

438
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:28,252
Nikolai?

439
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,771
Please excuse me.

440
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,847
Nikolai, you don't really love me.
I know that.

441
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,127
You're staying with me...

442
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:40,444
because you feel obligated to,
and that's not fair to either of us.

443
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,525
So I'm breaking up with you
right now, okay?

444
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,491
Well, okay.

445
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,287
-I'm so sorry, please excuse me.
-Christ, lady.

446
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:17,612
Which Lisa?

447
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:24,325
So you really need to tell me
what happened.

448
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:28,043
Just think of it as a game.

449
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,169
Whoever talks first is the winner.

450
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,805
So you're next?

451
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,724
Yeah, I guess so.

452
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:45,608
-So, wasn't that ceremony unbelievably...
-Pitiful? Pathetic?

453
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:48,127
Or maybe a word
that hasn't been invented yet.

454
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:51,683
-Vomitrocious. Is that a word?
-I was gonna say sweet.

455
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,003
-I thought it was sweet.
-You're joking.

456
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:56,765
I kind of bought it.

457
00:33:56,893 --> 00:33:59,248
I mean, look at the two of them.

458
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,692
-Who else would have either one of them?
-Well, yeah.

459
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,491
And they recognize that.

460
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:07,531
For better or worse, they accept each other.

461
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,086
For better or for worse.

462
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,006
By worse, do you mean all the people
they randomly fucked...

463
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,162
Stop.

464
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,448
Please.

465
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:19,523
They're our parents, Bren.

466
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:24,203
It can't be good for us
to talk about Mom and Dad like that.

467
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,607
-I crossed the line?
-It's the way we've always been.

468
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:30,048
It's our family ethos.
I understand why you go there.

469
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,647
But I don't want to talk that way anymore.

470
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,293
I don't think
we have to perpetuate the negativity.

471
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,409
God, what happened to you?

472
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:45,042
Can't we just celebrate?
This is a celebration, right?

473
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,926
Yeah, whoopee.

474
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:53,730
Your vows were really, really moving.

475
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:56,930
I hope my ceremony with Brenda
can be that heartfelt.

476
00:34:57,213 --> 00:34:58,965
What we have now...

477
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:01,687
is based on real honesty.

478
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,445
And forgiveness.

479
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:09,288
That woman sees me. Always has.

480
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:13,366
-She knew you were with another woman...
-Many, many other women.

481
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:16,284
-Past tense.
-Wow.

482
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,923
And she not only dealt with the jealousy...

483
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:23,289
-but she even renewed your vows with you.
-Her idea.

484
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:27,370
So I sold the house, moved in.

485
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:31,526
I say, if life offers you a new beginning,
take it.

486
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,485
Thank God, you know.

487
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:44,928
I can't believe
I fell into that mid-life crisis trap.

488
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:49,368
God, what a fool a man will make of himself
for some new pussy, huh?

489
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:53,852
To growing up.

490
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,445
She forgave me.

491
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:00,205
Thank God, you know.

492
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,685
Are we even moving?

493
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:20,008
You forgot to push the button.

494
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:44,484
"The manner in which she opens her heart
to a moment of visual truth inspires me.

495
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,730
"I am simply amazed at the depth...

496
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,532
"of Claire Fisher's artistic clairvoyance.

497
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,372
"And as a LAC-Arts alumnus...

498
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:55,890
"it is with great pleasure that
I highly recommend her for your program. "

499
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,766
Thank you.

500
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,330
-You made up a lot of really cool shit.
-All true.

501
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:06,009
I still need to get two more letters.

502
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:09,927
This guy who works in my Trader Joe's
had one of his collages in a show at MOCA.

503
00:37:10,013 --> 00:37:13,449
-I could ask him to write a letter.
-Cool, that would be great.

504
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:18,084
When I went to visit my Aunt Sarah,
I met this painter, Fiona Kleinschmidt.

505
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:21,369
-You've heard of her?
-Sure, she's huge.

506
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,011
-Really?
-Yeah.

507
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:26,970
I think she had sex with my brother
when he was, like, 15.

508
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,926
-Devirginized him, even.
-Use it.

509
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:39,531
-This one is really hot.
-Yeah.

510
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,490
You're looking at me weird.

511
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:50,482
What?

512
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,086
You are so....

513
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,090
That I just wanna reach over and....

514
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:04,488
But I also want to do nothing...

515
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:09,044
because I wanna make sure I know you
for as long as I can without fucking it up...

516
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,365
which is, like, my special superpower.

517
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,768
That's why I don't want to touch you.

518
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,604
That's verbatim, moment for moment...

519
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:23,242
what I was thinking when I was looking
at you with the weirdness.

520
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,323
I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.

521
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,372
You'll never be able to see yourself
the way other people see you.

522
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,326
The way I see you. Which is a shame.

523
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,091
Because you are....

524
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:48,489
I really think
you have no idea how beautiful you are.

525
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:58,683
You got a double of this one.
Mind if I snag it?

526
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:01,972
It's fine.

527
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,766
I should go.

528
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:28,928
He's ready.

529
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:30,772
Who the fuck are you...

530
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:33,572
and how did you convince my mother
to leave you her savings?

531
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:35,609
I didn't convince your mother of anything.

532
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:39,288
That was my money she left you.
I sent her $2,500 a month.

533
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:42,924
And my attorneys have counseled me
that this is highly suspect.

534
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:46,130
She left you everything,
and yet I have no idea who you are.

535
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:49,046
You don't know who I am
because you didn't speak to her often.

536
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,966
-I called her every other Sunday, my friend.
-Yeah, I know.

537
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,886
We invited her to a barbecue
and she said she couldn't come...

538
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:58,045
because there was a chance
her Andresito might call.

539
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,691
Yeah, a chance.

540
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:05,205
Listen. You know,
I'm as surprised as you are.

541
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:08,567
Okay, I am as surprised as you are.

542
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:15,645
-You're sure everything's okay, ma'am?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

543
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,850
Thank you, you people can leave now.
We're fine.

544
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,166
You're sure?

545
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,005
They just came in!

546
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,613
You didn't walk into my house
without a search warrant.

547
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:36,253
-No, I did.
-This is bullshit. You can't do this.

548
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,449
It's the law
that we can enter your residence...

549
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:41,252
to investigate a domestic abuse call, okay?
Calm down.

550
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,846
We want to talk to the both of you.

551
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:46,130
I know the law. I know you can't come here
without a search warrant.

552
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:49,569
-Is your name on the lease, sir?
-Is that any of your business?

553
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:51,769
-You need to back up.
-This is my fucking house.

554
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:53,525
I'm warning you. You need to back up.

555
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:57,162
You can warn me all the fuck you want
'cause I know what my rights are.

556
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,845
Stop it.

557
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:01,968
Let go of him! Oh, my God.

558
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:04,605
Calm down.

559
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,805
Keith, easy.

560
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,850
Let him go. Come on.

561
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,446
It's over, all right?

562
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:16,043
What did you do?

563
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:39,487
She gave them to me when I was a boy.

564
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:45,363
It's nice that you kept them.

565
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:50,451
I haven't been to Mass in over two years.

566
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:56,930
These are my two boys.

567
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,647
This is Augusto and this is Julio.

568
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:02,964
They called her abuelita.

569
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:55,362
-Need some help?
-Sure, kiddo.

570
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:08,727
Thank you.

571
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:10,572
Thank you...

572
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:15,048
-for how you fixed up my father.
-Glad I could do it.

573
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,769
I lost my father a few years back.

574
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:21,047
-Really?
-Yeah.

575
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:24,250
The worst thing is how it comes up on you.
From nothing.

576
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,882
When my dad died, I still had
baseball tickets I bought while he was alive.

577
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:30,533
And, you know, when we all thought:

578
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:33,082
"Of course he'll be around next Sunday. "

579
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,847
Yeah, we never really went to games.

580
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:47,805
Mr. Fisher, you know,
if you ever need any help around here...

581
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,488
like cutting the grass
or like a part-time job...

582
00:44:51,573 --> 00:44:54,963
-I'd be more than happy.
-I'll keep that in mind.

583
00:44:58,893 --> 00:45:02,363
-Bye, Mr. Fisher. Thanks.
-Okay.

584
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:20,928
There was a person at both ATMs,
so I started my own line in between them.

585
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,244
Then this woman comes and starts
her own line behind one of the ATMs.

586
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,211
I said, "I already started a line. "
So, she goes....

587
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,963
-She goes what?
-She goes....

588
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:35,125
Bren, you know him?

589
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:40,164
-Oh, God, I think I've seen him around.
-What's up?

590
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,401
-Kyle.
-Nate.

591
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:45,765
Never caught your name.

592
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:47,605
-Brenda.
-Right.

593
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,851
This is the kind kind.

594
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,283
Both my connections totally dried up.

595
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:05,092
One of them got arrested,
and the other I had to blow off...

596
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:10,042
'cause he was an actor and made me go to
his one-man shows if I wanted to buy a bag.

597
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:14,169
Fucking beauteous day, huh?

598
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:15,768
Warm.

599
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,567
I'm actually getting burnt.
I'm gonna go inside.

600
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:19,972
-Ciao.
-All right.

601
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:22,806
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you, too, bro.

602
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:26,283
Good to see you again, Brenda.

603
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:41,282
What?

604
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,210
-Turn it on.
-Nate, please, come on.

605
00:46:52,293 --> 00:46:53,612
Turn it on!

606
00:46:55,973 --> 00:46:59,045
Fiction, my ass. Everything you've written,
you've actually done?

607
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:00,248
-No.
-All right, then.

608
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,324
Read this aloud, and tell me what's true.

609
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:04,449
-It's my writing, it's private.
-I don't care.

610
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,603
You can't be private anymore.
Tell me the truth.

611
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,888
Give it to me.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

612
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:12,124
Who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you?

613
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,653
You know who I am, Nate.
I'm the woman that fucked you...

614
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:21,169
in the closet of an airport
a couple of hours after I met you.

615
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:23,528
That's who I was the day we met.

616
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,166
-You really fucked two guys?
-You had sex with two women once.

617
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:29,811
Not when I was engaged to you.

618
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:32,612
You only had sex with one woman
when you were engaged to me.

619
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:33,728
Without a condom.

620
00:47:33,813 --> 00:47:36,691
Where'd you fuck them?
Did you fuck them in our bed?

621
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:39,083
Why didn't you break up with me?
Jesus Christ.

622
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:41,733
I don't know. I don't know why I did it.

623
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,963
I fucking wish to God I did.

624
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:52,045
Did you fuck your brother?

625
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:54,089
-Right, go there.
-Why not go there? Did you?

626
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:56,084
Did you fuck the rabbi?
I know you wanted to.

627
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,004
-No.
-I'll bet it was because she wouldn't.

628
00:47:58,093 --> 00:48:00,402
Just for the record,
you did it in Seattle before...

629
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:02,802
I was scared to death.
I just had a fucking seizure!

630
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:05,805
You wouldn't have told me about it
if you weren't forced to.

631
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:07,531
You know what? I felt safe with her...

632
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:10,173
which, frankly, is something
I have never felt with you.

633
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:12,483
-You felt safe with her?
-Yeah.

634
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:15,333
Yeah, because you were leaving
the next day.

635
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,646
-Oh, God.
-Nate, you created a human being.

636
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:21,042
There'll be another person
on this planet now...

637
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:24,284
a person who might have
a totally miserable fucking life...

638
00:48:24,373 --> 00:48:26,204
and curse the fucking day she was born...

639
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:30,047
because you are walking out on her
the same way you'll walk out on me.

640
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,852
Life doesn't have to be miserable
just because you are.

641
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:36,687
I know, weird shit happened to you.
You know what? It happened to all of us.

642
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:38,968
I'm sick to death of you
using it as an excuse...

643
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:41,408
to act like some fucking cunt from hell.

644
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:49,642
-How long have you hated me like this?
-I don't need to hate you.

645
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:53,130
You do a pretty damn good job
of hating yourself.

646
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,924
You picked me, you know?

647
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:59,889
Yeah? Only because I had no idea
how fucked up you really are.

648
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,008
That's bullshit.

649
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:04,244
You knew and loved it, because
it made you feel good about yourself.

650
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,403
Oh, God, you are so full of shit.

651
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:09,724
You just can't see it,
because you're so in love with the idea...

652
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,610
of Nate, the good guy, Nate, the hero...

653
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:14,890
Nate, the fucking saint
with the fucking great haircut.

654
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:17,885
The truth is, you'd run from real love
if it ever came at you...

655
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:21,090
Real love?
What the fuck do you know about real love?

656
00:49:21,173 --> 00:49:24,643
...and the neediness and the ugliness
and the responsibility.

657
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:27,645
You would fucking run and you know it.

658
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:32,361
The only reason you stayed with me
is because I was never really here.

659
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,683
You know what?
Take your ugly fucking ring.

660
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:42,890
Don't you throw that ring at me.
That's such a fucking clich.

661
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:44,326
I'll fucking barf.

662
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:47,532
There, barf.

663
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:26,404
-Hello?
-Is Nate there?

664
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,967
I'm afraid he's not.

665
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,566
Is this Mrs. Fisher?

666
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,645
-Yes, it is.
-Hi, this is Lisa.

667
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:36,891
-Lisa Kimmel, from Seattle.
-Why, hello, dear.

668
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:41,092
I'm so sorry I didn't get a chance
to speak to you when Mr. Fisher died.

669
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:44,085
-You were very much in my thoughts.
-Aren't you sweet.

670
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:48,405
What a surprise to hear from you.
How is everything in Seattle?

671
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:53,164
-Nate hasn't told you what's going on?
-He hasn't told me anything.

672
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:55,926
No one ever tells me anything.
It's part of being old.

673
00:50:56,413 --> 00:50:59,450
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now,
and you're a grandmother.

674
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:02,252
-No, dear, I'm afraid I'm not.
-You are.

675
00:51:02,453 --> 00:51:04,967
I just had a baby. Nate's baby.

676
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:07,008
It's a girl.

677
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:09,249
She was a couple of weeks early.

678
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,571
I named her Maya.

679
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,932
Told you I'd be here every day, didn't I?

680
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:09,285
You'll never believe this.
I just got a phone call from Stan.

681
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:11,603
Kroehner is filing for Chapter 11.

682
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:15,085
And there's
a federal investigation underway.

683
00:52:15,253 --> 00:52:18,165
-Isn't that great?
-Yeah, that's great.

684
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:22,003
I guess the good guys
actually do win sometimes.

685
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:25,691
Hold on, I got another call coming in.

686
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:31,172
Hey, baby.

687
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:34,362
Listen, I'm not gonna be home for a while.

688
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:38,526
-You want me to hold dinner?
-No, you and Taylor go ahead and eat.

689
00:52:39,253 --> 00:52:40,447
What's wrong?

690
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:46,890
I'll tell you about it later, when I get home.

691
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:37,844
English
