1
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,168
-Hey.
-Hi. I need to sit down.

2
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,005
Oh, God, I'm so fat!

3
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,008
So what papers do you need me to sign?

4
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,769
Don't tell me I forgot them.

5
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:27,005
I'm forgetting everything.
It's because of the hormones.

6
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,812
Which, by the way, made me
a complete freak the last time I saw you.

7
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,123
I'm sorry again for being so hostile.

8
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,130
How are you doing?
It's so good to see you again.

9
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:48,001
Hi, Lisa, I didn't know you were in town.
What's new?

10
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:52,965
-Doing the whole single-mom routine.
-Right, I can see that. Good for you.

11
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,044
Are you taking pictures these days?

12
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:59,490
No. I took some photos with a friend's
camera and I wanted to keep doing it.

13
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,643
So I went on eBay and I got my own.

14
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:05,885
But it was really just because I was bored
and it was kind of stupid. But....

15
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:09,324
I have to go to school. So I'll see you later.

16
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,369
I'll be out in a second.

17
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:18,888
Shit!

18
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,086
Okay, let's go.

19
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:32,688
Hey, you think your chair seems right
for that space?

20
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:38,169
You said you were kidding about
me not bringing my ugly-ass furniture.

21
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:39,322
It's so big.

22
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,927
It's a really good chair
for watching television.

23
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,241
I guess.

24
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:49,162
Maybe it is too big. I think it is. It's too big.

25
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:53,602
You know, I'll put it in storage
with the rest of my stuff.

26
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:57,767
Shit. I gotta return The Great Escape today.
I'm gonna be fucking late.

27
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:00,128
I'll return it. It's on my way.

28
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,973
I never get tired
of watching Steve McQueen.

29
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,165
I think I've seen every one of his movies
at least three times.

30
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,483
Yeah, some of them four times.

31
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,527
Wow, this is....

32
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,843
Since I want your name
on the birth certificate...

33
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:22,050
my lawyer says you need to sign away
all custodial rights.

34
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:24,525
-I thought....
-What?

35
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,252
I thought we were gonna be
more casual about this.

36
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,052
It's a baby.
It's hard to be that casual about it.

37
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,248
Right.

38
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:38,613
Maybe I should have my lawyer look at this.

39
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:41,446
It's just a formality.
Cut the bullshit and just sign it.

40
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,602
Okay.

41
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:50,125
-You know what's weird about dead people?
-Everything?

42
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,325
How they look so perfect.

43
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,331
I just want to mess this woman's hair up
a little bit.

44
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:57,846
Please don't.

45
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,486
When I die, I want to be one big mess.
That's what life is: messy.

46
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,009
Nate, I'm not accusing you.

47
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,962
It's better this way. We both know that.

48
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,326
I mean, I can't lie.

49
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:20,691
Of course, I would've loved to do this
with someone who wanted to be a father.

50
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,092
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:27,932
-I don't know what else to...
-But then I think how perfect this baby is.

52
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,481
And everything somehow seems right.

53
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,927
You know, somehow it's just so funny.

54
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,491
And you know, actually, I'm proud,
in a weird way.

55
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:42,213
-What do you mean?
-I mean, I'm having a child...

56
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:45,649
with the last person in the world
who would ever want a child.

57
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,403
Why aren't you wearing your casts?

58
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,565
I take them off.

59
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,292
It's time for me to go.

60
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,841
But you're supposed to keep them on
until next week.

61
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:13,767
-I'm calling the doctor.
-He say it's okay. Look. See?

62
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,569
Your left foot looks purple.

63
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:21,288
Is always like that. Is from bad circulation.
You know that.

64
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,011
I guess I forgot.

65
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:28,163
Okay, it's time to get this show
on the road, yeah?

66
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:35,723
I guess I could call a taxi...

67
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,209
-even though it's a total rip-off.
-I can drive you!

68
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,644
It was a heart attack.

69
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:46,250
He died just like that.

70
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:52,366
So you want
a traditional Thai Buddhist service?

71
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,922
If that's a problem,
we can go somewhere else.

72
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,846
There are very specific elements,
and if you can't do it...

73
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,447
Please do not behave this way.

74
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,407
You will have to excuse my son.

75
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:08,688
He and my husband
hadn't spoken in months, and...

76
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,731
Mom, please. Not in front of this person.

77
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:18,492
Okay, Mr. Fisher, if you know the procedure,
let's hear it.

78
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,283
Actually, I've only been here
for a year or so, and....

79
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:29,803
Although I did read Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance in high school....

80
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,724
That's probably my brother. David!

81
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:36,682
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop at Video West.
Some idiot ahead of me was writing a check.

82
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:41,085
I didn't even want to watch a movie
last night, but Keith got his way, as usual.

83
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:46,163
-This is...
-Bette and Phil Srisai. I'm David Fisher.

84
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,202
I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.

85
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,125
I'm so sorry for your loss.

86
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:55,403
Thank you.
We were just discussing my father's service.

87
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,610
I assume the deceased
will remain at the temple for three days...

88
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,411
before we have the service here?

89
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:03,769
Of course, Fisher & Sons will provide
all the requisite supplies:

90
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,367
the Buddha, the altar, the carpet-kneelers.

91
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,042
And you'll want some monks for chanting.

92
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:11,528
We prefer to use the ones from Riverside...

93
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:15,811
but if those aren't to your liking, we have
some good ones over in Eagle Rock.

94
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,482
Nikolai, your apartment is so....

95
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:25,886
It's very....

96
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:29,090
It has a lot of charm.

97
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,492
Thank you.

98
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:35,282
I still don't know what your big rush was.
You could've stayed with me until...

99
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,567
It was time.

100
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:40,168
But how do we know you're safe here?
You could be hurt by these ruffians.

101
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,368
I spoke to Yuri.

102
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,570
I tell him that February
is the biggest month for flowers.

103
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,121
He say he give me 30 days
to come up with the money.

104
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:49,966
-Are you gonna be able to do it?
-Yeah, sure, of course.

105
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,805
Well, that's nice.

106
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:55,443
Thank you for all the taking care of me.
You don't have to do that now.

107
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,012
You are done.

108
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:01,525
What about dinner?
You probably don't have any food.

109
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:04,685
I was gonna pack you lamb, but I forgot.
I'll go get the lamb.

110
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,163
No, I'll be fine. I get takeout from Eat-a-Pita.

111
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,731
Goodbye, Nikolai.

112
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,325
Goodbye, Ruthie.

113
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:37,523
I bet you Mr. Van Kirk
has sex with students in here after hours.

114
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:40,332
We should stake this place out later, okay?

115
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:43,813
-Claire?
-Oh, fuck.

116
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:47,924
-I think there was dust on the negative.
-No one's gonna notice.

117
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,129
No, I want it to be perfect.

118
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:54,207
-Claire, these are so sick!
-Thanks.

119
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,047
I've taken shots
of almost every single person...

120
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,647
that's come through in the past three weeks.

121
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,848
They're amazing.

122
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,892
It's like each one
is someone who's lying in bed with you...

123
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,690
telling you a little story
before you go to sleep.

124
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:13,726
I'm putting them together
for that thing for Foster's class.

125
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:17,123
-The fucking Spoon River Anthology paper?
-Yeah.

126
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:21,446
I just thought that since each poem
is from the perspective of a dead person...

127
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:25,208
that it would be a really interesting way to....
I don't know.

128
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,482
Show what the poems brought out in me.

129
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,930
Okay, that sounded really geeky.

130
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:36,847
No, that's genius.
You could really do something with this.

131
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,972
Yeah, right.

132
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,408
Claire, I have to tell you something.

133
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,527
I got into Yale. I heard yesterday.

134
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,441
You don't feel jealous or hate me, right?

135
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,801
No. You worked really hard for it.
Congratulations.

136
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,566
I know you didn't play the game
the way I did...

137
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,441
but I'm sure you'll get into UCLA,
which is a really good school, too.

138
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,368
Actually, no, I didn't make the cut.

139
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:11,485
But they sent me
a list of community colleges I could go to...

140
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:14,882
and said to try again next year.

141
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,043
So I'm looking at East Valley.

142
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:22,810
I'm gonna be a famous photographer
and make a gazillion dollars...

143
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:26,169
taking pictures of anorexic models
and fucked-up actors.

144
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:29,131
So maybe I don't even need
to go to college, right?

145
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,004
It's a joke. I'm joking.

146
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:35,364
But you could.
You should just become a photographer.

147
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:42,282
Because, truthfully,
East Valley is kind of a shitty school.

148
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,925
So there was that one
a month ago in the bookstore.

149
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:57,766
Then I met this other guy
at the Farmers Market.

150
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,969
That place has gotten so touristy.

151
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:04,445
And then there was this guy last week
at the Rose Café, who....

152
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:09,406
No, that doesn't count.
That was an almost one.

153
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,406
What exactly do you hope
to get out of therapy?

154
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,769
Melissa gave me your number
because I guess I'm....

155
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,686
I don't know.

156
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:28,531
It's not that I'm unhappy. I'm not unhappy.
I'm really not.

157
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,849
But I know that what I'm doing
is a little strange.

158
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:39,966
I mean, most people who are engaged
to someone they really love...

159
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,248
don't have sex with strangers.

160
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,931
-Or maybe they do.
-Does that matter?

161
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:54,242
I think I like the euphoria I get
from these encounters.

162
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,452
I'm just having a little trouble with anxiety.

163
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,088
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

164
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:08,764
It's like I'm coexisting
in these two separate realities.

165
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:13,404
There's my Nate reality,
and then there's this other reality.

166
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,884
And I would like to not feel
so anxious about it.

167
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:24,123
It's not guilt. It's just edginess.

168
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:29,048
So, that's it.

169
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:32,727
I'd like to not feel edgy. That's why I'm here.

170
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,202
Okay, so you would like...

171
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:39,571
to continue to have these encounters,
as you call them...

172
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:44,010
-but you would like to not feel edgy.
-Ideally.

173
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,443
I know what you're thinking.

174
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,044
You think that I'm afraid of intimacy...

175
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,966
so I'm trying to sabotage
my relationship with my fiancé.

176
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,886
Is that what I'm thinking
or is that what you're thinking?

177
00:14:58,973 --> 00:14:59,962
No.

178
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,325
I just wanted to clarify...

179
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:05,962
that I don't necessarily think
that what I'm doing is destructive.

180
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,564
It might even be healthy.

181
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,087
How so?

182
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:15,966
Maybe it's not good for me
to totally lose myself in one person...

183
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,441
and this is a way for me to have...

184
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:25,323
a completely separate,
private area that's my own.

185
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,047
Not his, not ours.

186
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,291
Maybe that's healthy for me.

187
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,331
Listen, I assume that Melissa told you...

188
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,927
one of my specialties is sexual addiction.

189
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:40,088
No.

190
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,331
I don't know how much you know
of this issue, but obviously...

191
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:47,691
it involves the sublimation of emotions
that are too painful to address.

192
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,804
It's the root of all addiction, really.

193
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:53,408
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you
because you don't need help.

194
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,327
You've clearly evolved beyond the need
for therapy. I'm actually in awe of you...

195
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,610
because I'd be fucking strangers
like a truck-stop whore on crack...

196
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,332
if I wasn't so inhibited
by my Judeo-Christian upbringing.

197
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:06,164
It's not down here.

198
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:09,723
We used to have a few Buddhas in here.
I can't believe we can't find one.

199
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:13,169
I've read all this stuff about Buddhism,
but it never stays with me.

200
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,289
Just know that everything is nothing.

201
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,841
Is that it?
I thought it was, "Nothing is everything. "

202
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,891
-It's the same thing, isn't it?
-I found one.

203
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:26,203
-It looks kind of girly, doesn't it?
-Sort of.

204
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:31,252
Think it's water damage. I'll get you
some stuff to clean him off, okay?

205
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,724
His little hat is cute, so pointy.

206
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,646
I wonder if anyone
poked their eyes out on one by accident.

207
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,928
Look at all these unclaimed cremains.

208
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,846
Can you imagine
having a member of your family cremated...

209
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,766
and then not caring enough
to pick up their ashes?

210
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:49,126
I think sometimes it's too hard
for people to acknowledge...

211
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:52,046
that someone they loved
is now just chunks of soot.

212
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,407
David Fisher. Hey.

213
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,851
Yes, I returned the videos.
Didn't I say I would?

214
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:06,446
Sure, swordfish is fine. Whatever. Bye.

215
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,891
You hate swordfish.

216
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:15,732
I know. It's funny.
Now that Keith and I are living together...

217
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,930
I find myself trying to be
so fucking agreeable all the time.

218
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:21,573
-Why?
-Because, if you aren't, things come up...

219
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:23,962
and you've no idea
how big the thing's gonna be.

220
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:27,762
It's like this constant negotiation.
You can never just relax.

221
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,446
Is that just a phase
or is it always going to be like that?

222
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,445
Don't ask me. Look, I have no fucking idea.

223
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,001
Maybe that's just what a relationship is.

224
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:42,403
Constantly doing things
you have absolutely no desire to do.

225
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,722
Nate, Brenda, come on in!

226
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,566
We have so many details to go over...

227
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,362
before the bridal shower on Sunday.
Isn't it exciting?

228
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:56,732
It's all too much for me.

229
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,249
Please, it's all for you.
I'd rather just cancel it.

230
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,925
Are you mad?

231
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,767
Lulu Smeigel cancelled her weekend
at Canyon Ranch just to be here.

232
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:08,892
Now, you must try one of these.

233
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,408
It's made from this incredible liqueur...

234
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:14,405
that comes from the most
poverty-stricken village in Belize.

235
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,882
-It's delicious!
-Right. Your trip.

236
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:21,248
-You look like you had a good time.
-It was fabulous!

237
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,327
Your skin looks good.
Did you have some work done?

238
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:28,326
Not at all. It's just happiness.
You should try it sometime.

239
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,122
Is Billy here?

240
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:36,611
No. When I got back, I found a note saying
he's staying with friends in Portland.

241
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,251
But he didn't leave a number.

242
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,324
Brenda, did he give it to you?

243
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,569
-No, he didn't.
-That's right.

244
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:45,486
He still has all that raging resentment
towards you.

245
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,169
Who are you hiding in the bedroom?

246
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,325
Let me guess. Another one
of your young South American gigolos?

247
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:55,326
Not at all, darling.
He's an aging intellectual from the Bronx.

248
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,650
Isn't this fabulous?

249
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,846
Bern and I are back, and better than ever.

250
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:13,322
So I realized I'd made a terrible mistake,
got on the next plane to Belize...

251
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,449
and begged your mother to take me back.

252
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,206
Come on, be honest, dear.
The whore dumped you.

253
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:22,682
Because I was subconsciously
pushing her away...

254
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,169
because I really love you.

255
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:29,403
The point is, the sex has been incredible.

256
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,364
Just like when we first met.

257
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:36,766
I'll never forget what you were wearing
the first time you walked into my office.

258
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,892
The tight Givenchy blue skirt with a slit
that went right up to my wazoo.

259
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:46,171
I knew immediately I was gonna have
some wildly inappropriate feelings for you.

260
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,845
And, boy, was I right!

261
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,012
Mom was one of Dad's patients.
It's actually kind of disgusting.

262
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:55,126
I was not a patient. I was in grad school.

263
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:57,965
I was an intern.

264
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:00,604
And the second I lay down...

265
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:04,083
I knew I was never gonna get up
off that couch.

266
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,368
We terminated therapy after a few months...

267
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:11,163
and waited the correct amount of time
before embarking on a relationship.

268
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,373
At least, that's what we tell everyone.

269
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,162
I'll give you a hand with that.

270
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:31,966
Okay, what?

271
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:36,532
I can't believe you just took him back.

272
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,723
Are you that scared of being alone?

273
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,647
God, you're so fucking depressing.

274
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,365
I love your father.

275
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,771
And I'm very happy. You noticed it yourself.

276
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:54,441
Maybe that's what's upsetting you so much,
that I'm so happy.

277
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:01,488
I'm sorry for whatever tensions this
engagement is bringing up in you and Nate.

278
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,690
But my advice to you...

279
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:08,732
is get your shit together
and don't blow it with this one.

280
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,487
Because you are a major handful.

281
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:22,210
Sorry. I noticed a coffee stain on the couch.
I was trying to get it out.

282
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,922
You still mad at me about the swordfish?

283
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,412
You should've told me you didn't like it
instead of waiting till I slaved over it.

284
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:35,690
-You're right. I should've told you.
-So why didn't you?

285
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,850
Because you scare me.

286
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,371
Shut the fuck up.

287
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:46,248
You want everything to be perfect,
all the time.

288
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,528
When it's not, you get upset.

289
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:52,764
I didn't get any sleep last night.
I'm too tired for this conversation.

290
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,416
Sometimes I feel like
if I don't do or say exactly what you want...

291
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:12,499
you might decide
you don't want to be with me.

292
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,385
That's just stupid.

293
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:18,701
Thanks.

294
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,503
When we were together the first time...

295
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:34,818
it seemed like all our problems stemmed
from my not coming out.

296
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:36,135
They did.

297
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:42,377
Now I think it was just easier for you
to make us believe that.

298
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:47,347
If everything could be blamed
on my not coming out...

299
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:50,146
then nothing ever had to be your fault.

300
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:27,863
What's under that arm right here?

301
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:31,019
-Hey, Nate!
-Hey!

302
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,178
-Say hello to Nate.
-Hello.

303
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:36,224
You didn't like that?

304
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:43,859
All right. Let's go.

305
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,098
Look, Vanessa's sister,
she's got this publicist...

306
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:54,220
and the first thing she does is get her
invited to some spa thing in Long Beach.

307
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,296
So?

308
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:59,141
So she took Vanessa and the baby.
Now my sitter's sick, so here we are.

309
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:01,695
Mrs. Hirsch needs to be finished by 1:00.

310
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:06,504
I have a kid, okay?
These type of things happen.

311
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:11,305
Anyhow, I gave Mrs. Hirsch the once-over.
She's a young breast cancer. Piece of cake.

312
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:15,300
-Hopefully I'll get a sitter in time to do her.
-That's not good enough.

313
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,862
My hands are tied here, okay?

314
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,620
Unless you take care of Julio
while I do Mrs. Hirsch.

315
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,301
-No...
-Come on, I don't see you doing anything.

316
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:30,016
Look, I can't. I have to clean a Buddha.

317
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:34,138
He looks like he's asleep.

318
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,381
He's not.

319
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,818
He's just blissed out
because he has the secret to enlightenment.

320
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:43,659
What's "enlightmintz"?

321
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:51,176
-I guess it's knowing everything.
-My dad knows everything.

322
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,140
Well, he knows a lot.

323
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:57,145
He knows everything.
How much do you know?

324
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,495
Not much.

325
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:17,896
-Ruthie? Did we have plans?
-No.

326
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,817
Does that mean I have to go away?

327
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:27,898
I do not need my house
to smell like fake lemons.

328
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:30,421
-It smells good already.
-No, it doesn't.

329
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:34,457
-I like everything the way it is.
-But I don't.

330
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:44,506
I thought I would.... Isn't this fun?

331
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:46,578
It's a surprise sleepover.

332
00:25:49,787 --> 00:25:51,778
Okay, let's do it, sure.

333
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:54,337
-Then let's get started.
-Okay.

334
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:59,537
First, we have to get this place into shape,
so we can have a nice, cozy, clean evening.

335
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,460
We're going to wallpaper?

336
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:04,619
No, silly. It's contact paper for the drawers.

337
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:09,575
Ruthie, why do I want little cherries
in my drawers?

338
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,141
It's hard to explain. You just do.

339
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,346
You failed me?

340
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:19,385
I'm sorry, Claire,
but I asked for a literary analysis.

341
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,504
-So you didn't think they were any good?
-That's not the point.

342
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:25,545
This is an English class.
I wanted something in English.

343
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,824
So you'd just prefer I download
some stupid crap off the Internet...

344
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:31,819
than do something that's actually creative?

345
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:36,061
I don't have time for this.
Would you just do the make-over?

346
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,181
I was really happy with Mrs. Sibley.

347
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,896
"The secret of woman, the soil.

348
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:51,737
"My secret: Under a mound
that you shall never find. "

349
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,737
Just so you know,
I put a lot of myself into this.

350
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,897
I wasn't just slacking off.

351
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,784
Look, I don't want to fail you.
Just give me some kind of paper.

352
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:09,303
I assume you need to graduate.
You are going to college, right?

353
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:12,424
-Yup, East Valley.
-Really? I went there.

354
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,735
David Fisher.

355
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,624
-Hey, it's me.
-Hi.

356
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:31,185
I'm calling to tell you we're having lunch
with Taylor and Karla on Saturday.

357
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:36,060
You can't just schedule things without
asking me first. That's not what couples do.

358
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:39,139
-How would you know what couples do?
-I watch TV.

359
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:42,384
Or at least I used to
when I had a comfortable chair to sit in.

360
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:45,220
Listen, I was in the middle
of five things at work, okay?

361
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:47,696
You know,
not everyone can always act so perfect.

362
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:51,462
Yeah, I know that. That's what
I was trying to tell you last night.

363
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:55,866
You should check with me
before you say yes to things.

364
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:58,336
-Are you available?
-Yes.

365
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:00,898
Then pretend I asked you first.

366
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:10,376
So I went the one time,
but I'm not going back to Dr. Michaelson.

367
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:15,023
-Are you annoyed?
-No, why would I be annoyed?

368
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:19,146
-You can do whatever you want.
-I'm sure she's good. She's just not for me.

369
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,386
You didn't tell me she was so serious.

370
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:25,786
I didn't realize you were looking for laughs.

371
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:33,105
I can ask around for more names.
My friend Paula's been to 40 shrinks...

372
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:36,623
although I guess that's not
the best endorsement for them.

373
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:41,019
I'm fine. I think I'm the only one
that can solve any of my problems.

374
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:44,020
Yeah, we are ultimately
stuck with ourselves.

375
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:46,582
It's so fucking puritanical...

376
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,864
how we're conditioned to buy into
the whole true-love-monogamy crap.

377
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:52,097
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.

378
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,582
So I've been thinking,
the next time that I feel adventurous...

379
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,623
what if I include Nate?

380
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,580
Not a bad idea.

381
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:07,697
You remember Terry from Orange County
I was telling you about?

382
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,097
-She has the lifestyle parties on weekends.
-Oh, right.

383
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:15,146
She and her husband are committed.
They have sex with strangers once a week.

384
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:19,015
They're really happy.
Monogamy just isn't for everyone.

385
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,665
I know. Look at my parents.

386
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:23,659
Actually, don't look at them.
That's what they want.

387
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,896
So maybe we could go to Terry's
this weekend and check it out.

388
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:32,455
Yeah, whatever. I'll give you the address.

389
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:35,744
-I hope you and Nate like it.
-I don't want to bring Nate.

390
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:39,536
I mean not yet. First you and I should go
and see what it's like.

391
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:55,943
Okay, what do you think?

392
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:58,585
It feels like a whole new place.

393
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,897
Yes, it really does.

394
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,059
Who am I kidding?

395
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,859
I can't stay here.

396
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:10,663
I'll never be able to stay here.

397
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,384
It's too dank. It will always be dank.

398
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm only human. I can only do so much.

399
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:22,823
Nikolai, this is crazy.
Why aren't you moving into my house?

400
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,057
I don't know, it's....

401
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:28,778
Why are you acting like we talked
about this? We haven't, have we?

402
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,778
I guess it's just been on my mind.

403
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:33,256
I like how things have been
for the past few months.

404
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:37,579
I like seeing you every night and morning.
I don't want to go backward, do you?

405
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,102
I love you.

406
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:52,700
I wish you didn't sound so sad
when you say that.

407
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:57,256
I wish I wanted to move in with you
and be with you all the time.

408
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,946
I want to want that more than anything.

409
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,059
But I don't.

410
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:08,462
Maybe I am the one with the problem.

411
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:11,861
Maybe I have been alone and cut off
for so long...

412
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:14,097
that I no longer know how to do it.

413
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:18,057
Maybe I am not capable of it.

414
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:23,140
Can't we go on as we were before accident?

415
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,703
I think I should go home.

416
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:39,905
Didn't Mom leave any real food for dinner?

417
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:43,303
No, there was just a note saying
she was gone for the night.

418
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:48,141
So why aren't you two
with your loved ones?

419
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,343
-Late shift.
-Shiatsu appointment.

420
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:56,145
-What's this?
-Give me that.

421
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:59,060
-It's this thing for school.
-I don't believe this.

422
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:01,824
David, look at these.

423
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,265
That's Mrs. Steiner.

424
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,300
Mr. Thomas. The Harrisons.

425
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,184
Mr. Benson.

426
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:17,501
Mrs. Orozco.
God, Rico did an amazing job on her.

427
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:22,064
-So do you think they're any good?
-I think they fucking suck!

428
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,615
Do you know
what kind of lawsuit this could cause?

429
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:27,175
What kind of stupid,
fucked-up child are you?

430
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:29,656
I was trying to do something
I gave a shit about.

431
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,260
What's going on here?

432
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:34,743
Nate, I heard you yelling.

433
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:38,264
-Someone please tell me what's going on.
-Nothing.

434
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:42,215
You were spending the night out.
Why are you back?

435
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,184
That's none of your business!

436
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:04,778
Hey, got some change?

437
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,020
Fuck you, too!

438
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:12,538
You're not listening to me.
I said this shirt feels funny.

439
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:16,415
-It scratches my neck.
-Too bad. It's the only clean one you had...

440
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:20,341
and I can't take your uncle's bitching
if he sees one little apple juice stain.

441
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:23,100
-I want to go back and get my yellow one!
-I said no.

442
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:26,145
-Turn around, now!
-You don't tell me what to do.

443
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:27,945
Mom!

444
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:36,226
-What are you doing?
-We gotta get out of here.

445
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,506
I had no idea
East Valley was so close to the freeway.

446
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:47,100
It's very convenient.

447
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:50,743
That's the Student Center.
That's where your mailbox will be.

448
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,135
Great.

449
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:56,226
I can go there and get letters
from people begging me not to kill myself.

450
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:59,297
I bet you some famous people went here.

451
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:00,900
Someone like...

452
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:02,780
David Spade.

453
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:10,222
Okay, there's way too many flyers
with the word "Baptist" on them.

454
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,503
Look, you can make extra money
as a phone sex operator.

455
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,623
Yeah, Baptist phone sex.

456
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:21,140
It says here
they have a really good arts center.

457
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,424
No, it's under construction.
It won't be open till 2004.

458
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:29,946
That's okay.

459
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:32,775
I need to start being more connected
to the real world.

460
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,586
I'm thinking about taking
some business courses.

461
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,743
-Mommy, we have to...
-Just shut up.

462
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:48,700
I need to think.

463
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,296
Okay. Nothing there. I think nothing's there.

464
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,179
Where have I missed?

465
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,699
-I don't want anyone to find anything.
-We have to tell the cops.

466
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:01,859
No, we don't!
We just got to pray nobody saw us.

467
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:06,178
It wasn't my fault. We can't help him now.

468
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,856
-We have to tell somebody.
-No, we don't!

469
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:12,701
God! I am so tired!
I am so fucking tired of this shit!

470
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,335
Why can't I ever have some fucking peace?

471
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:25,140
Baby, we can't tell the cops.

472
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:29,019
Okay? They'll take me away from you.

473
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:31,462
Do you want the cops
to take me away from you?

474
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:34,186
-No.
-Then we don't tell the cops.

475
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:39,142
Okay? This is our little secret.
Do you hear me?

476
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:41,900
Our little secret.

477
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,580
-Say it.
-It's our little secret.

478
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:59,255
Of course they're late.
I've got a turkey breast drying up.

479
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,383
I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

480
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:08,662
No, I didn't get any sleep last night
because you were kicking me for hours.

481
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:13,104
You know what? I have nightmares.
Is that my fault, too, like everything else?

482
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:22,423
-You're 40 minutes late.
-Sorry, something came up.

483
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,825
Hey, little girl.

484
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:33,265
Fuck, Bren, it's just that it's Saturday night.

485
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,945
You know, I thought we planned to
on Saturday night....

486
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,945
Yeah, I know you have
the shitty shower tomorrow.

487
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,823
All right. No.

488
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:50,219
Just stay at home
and take care of yourself, all right?

489
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:52,786
All right, bye.

490
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:03,099
Maybe you shouldn't jump so hard.
What if he catches us?

491
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,826
-I don't care.
-Taylor, that's enough.

492
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,546
My mom ran over somebody on Washington.

493
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:12,096
What?

494
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,979
It was an accident.
It was an old, bald white guy.

495
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,786
But we're not gonna tell anybody.
It's a secret.

496
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,821
But secrets are so stupid.
People always find out about secrets.

497
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,066
Oh, my God.

498
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,546
I was just kidding.

499
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,907
I got you, I got you good.

500
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,381
-Taylor, that's not funny.
-Yes, it is.

501
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,705
This is even more of a shitbox
than I remembered.

502
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,016
Do you want to get out
while there's time to run?

503
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:55,223
Are you kidding? This is fantastic.

504
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,177
Melissa, you made it!

505
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,021
Oh, crap.

506
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:03,065
Hey, Terry, look at you, girl!

507
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,778
Sex is so stupid.

508
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:18,896
This is like these parties
my parents used to have when I was a kid.

509
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:22,019
There was always
this really weird energy in the air.

510
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,540
Just like tonight.

511
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,619
Oh, yes, the heady haze of expectancy.

512
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:30,183
Everyone got really drunk, got all handsy.

513
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,981
Although I don't think they were
official sex parties, like this one.

514
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:39,065
We should mingle.

515
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:43,501
This shit's amazing.

516
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,465
I found it in my kid's room
and beat the crap out of him.

517
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:48,344
Don't get me started on my kids.

518
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:51,578
They leave the house at all hours.
I've no idea what they're up to.

519
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,135
If I think about it too hard, I could cry.

520
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:12,386
You like that?

521
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:21,265
Why are you getting so upset?

522
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:24,305
I'm saying, isn't it weird
that Taylor made up this story?

523
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:26,264
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

524
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:29,976
Because you were going on and on
about the coffee stain on your couch.

525
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,740
It was me, okay? I did it.
I'm sorry. It was me.

526
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:35,341
Now shut up already about the coffee stain!

527
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:41,826
Don't call her. Let's just forget it.
It's just this weird thing Taylor said.

528
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:43,977
I'm not calling her, idiot.

529
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,501
Hello?

530
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:10,258
-Can I help you?
-Hi.

531
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:13,817
You killed me.
It was about seven years ago, remember?

532
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,183
You drove Lisa to have me killed.

533
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:19,699
Don't get me wrong.
I don't harbor any bad feelings or anything.

534
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,300
I'm pro-choice.

535
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,062
At least I would be, if I were alive.

536
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:28,820
You killed me, too.

537
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:34,136
Actually, I was miscarried by the girl
who worked at that Starbucks on Fremont.

538
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:37,938
I don't think she was ever planning
to tell you about me.

539
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:43,344
Yeah, Mom was your first real girlfriend.
Then I came along.

540
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:45,816
You guys offed me and then broke up.

541
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:51,666
Excuse me.

542
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:57,299
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi.

543
00:41:03,347 --> 00:41:05,144
Who wants cookies and milk?

544
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,223
I know the secret to everything.

545
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:17,899
But you'll never know it,
because you killed us.

546
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:37,502
Hit-and-run at Washington and Third.

547
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:41,305
The vehicle's description
matches Karla's car.

548
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,498
The old, bald white guy was dead
before he got to Cedars.

549
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,859
Oh, my God.

550
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:55,503
-What do we do?
-What the hell do you think we do?

551
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,982
Marly and I were fighting night and day.

552
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,456
And then we came to one of these parties.

553
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:04,141
It was like we rediscovered each other.

554
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:07,542
And things have been hot between us
ever since.

555
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:10,016
Isn't that such a heartwarming story?

556
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:15,584
Some people just need a little extra help
to stay together, you know?

557
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,986
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-I'm for getting all the help I can get.

558
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:24,303
Marly, show the gals
that thing I got you for your birthday.

559
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:28,902
-This has given us another five years.
-This sounds good.

560
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:31,696
-Should we guess what it is?
-No, I'll tell you.

561
00:42:31,787 --> 00:42:36,303
It's this little gizmo that he got online
at a sex website.

562
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:40,825
You've just got to see it to believe it.

563
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:45,025
-I can't wait.
-I can. I'm gonna get another drink.

564
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,059
I can't find it.

565
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:52,860
I'll just kill myself if I've lost that.

566
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:56,543
-Why do I lose everything?
-You probably left it in your coat.

567
00:42:56,627 --> 00:42:59,266
I think we left them in that room over there.

568
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:07,342
I'll just go help Marly for a second.

569
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,976
Or you could come with us, if you want.

570
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:23,667
Sure, I'll help you.

571
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:51,383
I just saw Mr. Srisai's brother-in-law
put $20 in the casket.

572
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,976
It's traveling money for his journey.

573
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:58,022
Apparently, unlike the rest of us,
Buddhists can take it with them.

574
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:04,423
-Why am I giving Brenda napkin rings?
-Because that's all I had in the gift closet.

575
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:14,062
Hey, they're allowed to take pictures
of the dead guy, but I'm not?

576
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:17,743
-That's right. They're family.
-Claire, we're going to be late.

577
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:21,786
-I can't believe I have to go to this thing.
-All right, look, I'm sorry.

578
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:23,342
On the plus side...

579
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,500
I bet it'll take you two sips of punch
before you're completely wasted.

580
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,017
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

581
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:35,258
-More punch, anyone?
-Yeah, sure, I'll take another hit.

582
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,304
That brat's over an hour late.

583
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:43,300
For the life of me, I don't know
how she got so damn passive-aggressive.

584
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:46,742
Isn't that just being aggressive?

585
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:49,979
Are you sick, dear?
Or are you always this deathly pale?

586
00:44:57,387 --> 00:44:59,105
I'm not late, am I?

587
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,378
You most certainly are.

588
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:05,058
Ice-cold mini asparagus quiche, darling?

589
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,743
What are they doing
with those cups of water?

590
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,226
It's a cleansing ritual.

591
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:17,583
You rid yourself of any wrongs you've done
to the deceased.

592
00:45:21,587 --> 00:45:25,626
You really think that changes anything?
Pouring a little water into a bowl?

593
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:29,098
I don't know. Maybe.

594
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,380
I have to go.

595
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:36,385
Can you make sure
that the monks get home all right?

596
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,859
And you'll pour the water out
from Mr. Srisai's bowl?

597
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:47,384
You're supposed to do it over the oldest
tree you can find. I use the one out front.

598
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:50,016
I don't know why they bring
so many oranges.

599
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:53,224
But if there are any extra,
grab some for the prep room.

600
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,542
This punch is delicious.

601
00:45:58,787 --> 00:46:01,620
Your mother made it
with a liqueur from Belize.

602
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:05,304
It's some word with a tilde over the "n. "

603
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,620
So what's new?

604
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,498
Actually, I spent all night...

605
00:46:16,947 --> 00:46:19,700
doing it with this couple
from Orange County.

606
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:22,217
And I have absolutely no idea why.

607
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:27,061
It's one of those sex things, you know.

608
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:30,219
-Lifestyle parties.
-I don't know anything about that.

609
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:31,865
They had this...

610
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:35,776
little high-tech Japanese vibrator...

611
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:39,900
that stimulates the clitoris
through very low-voltage electrical shocks.

612
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:44,137
Anyway, they invited me, you know,
to go with them...

613
00:46:44,227 --> 00:46:47,105
and I thought,
"Now this would be crossing a line. "

614
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:49,747
Which I seem to be doing
more and more these days.

615
00:46:49,827 --> 00:46:53,979
Because you know what?
The lines are only in our heads.

616
00:46:54,627 --> 00:46:56,857
In actuality, there are no lines at all...

617
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,178
which is really fucking terrifying,
if you think about it.

618
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:03,899
What's so funny?

619
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:08,064
Nothing. Everything. This.

620
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:13,462
I want you to know something, Brenda.

621
00:47:16,227 --> 00:47:17,865
I love you.

622
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:24,026
I love you, because you are so independent
and spirited...

623
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:27,866
and you make no apologies to yourself.

624
00:47:28,187 --> 00:47:32,226
And you know you can't smother someone
or you'll lose them.

625
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:37,136
You accept Nate as he is,
and that is beautiful.

626
00:47:39,547 --> 00:47:43,256
I don't know how to do that. Not at all.

627
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:48,305
Maybe that's why I resented you so much.

628
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:50,743
But now I don't.

629
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:54,263
Now I admire you.

630
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,900
Thank you.

631
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:06,901
Thanks.

632
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:11,257
I have to go to the bathroom.

633
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:22,257
Claire, are you feeling all right?

634
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:24,939
Yeah, I'm just tired.

635
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:28,223
Let me feel your forehead.

636
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:33,660
It feels okay.

637
00:48:34,267 --> 00:48:38,340
I don't know why you should be tired.
You slept almost 11 hours last night.

638
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:43,460
I'm not really like want-to-go-to-sleep tired.
I'm just sort of like...

639
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,663
sick and tired of everything.

640
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:49,265
-What do you mean?
-Just all the lies we're fed.

641
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:52,976
The bullshit we're supposed to care about,
how everybody is so scared...

642
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:56,104
of anything that's different
from everything else.

643
00:48:57,987 --> 00:48:59,818
I don't know.

644
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:04,102
I'm gonna get some coffee.
Do you want some?

645
00:49:04,187 --> 00:49:06,064
I have to use the bathroom.

646
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:14,856
You must be Ruth. Bernard Chenowith.

647
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:18,463
-Oh, hello.
-I'm so sorry to startle you.

648
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,345
I was supposed to confine myself
to the master suite...

649
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:24,339
but Margaret doesn't like me
to use her bathroom.

650
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:27,579
She gets insanely territorial
about that damn bidet.

651
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:34,147
-It's nice to finally meet you.
-I know.

652
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:38,140
I don't know why Nate and Brenda
haven't arranged a dinner or something.

653
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:41,897
I could give you half a dozen reasons
just off the top of my head!

654
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:44,103
But I'd like to ask you something.

655
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:49,217
What steps have you taken
to treat your daughter's depression?

656
00:49:49,307 --> 00:49:51,741
I have no idea what you're talking about.

657
00:49:52,227 --> 00:49:54,343
Surely you must be aware of it.

658
00:49:55,187 --> 00:49:59,624
Now, if you're adverse to talk therapy,
there are scads of pharmaceutical solutions.

659
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:03,177
Either way, I'd be happy to recommend
the name of somebody she can see.

660
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,986
I'm sorry. I have to use the bathroom.

661
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,306
You're breaking up with me?

662
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,824
I don't think we have a healthy friendship.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

663
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:10,057
-Okay.
-I don't know how else to explain it.

664
00:52:10,147 --> 00:52:11,626
Don't bother, really.

665
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:14,540
I'm going through something.
I don't understand what it is...

666
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:17,460
but I need to be around people
who aren't like you.

667
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:21,457
People who have clear values, or something.

668
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:23,219
Okay, got it.

669
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:27,985
If I hadn't met you, I probably wouldn't be
doing all the shit I've been doing.

670
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,944
Not that I blame you, exactly.

671
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:32,820
Oh, brother! Just can it, sweetheart.

672
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:37,899
You can't stand to see the truth
about yourself, so I've got to take the fall.

673
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:42,499
Just do me a favor.
When you feel bad about this later...

674
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:45,818
you can skip the big apology
and trying to be friends again.

675
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:48,262
It was fun, but we should both move on.

676
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:59,826
So now you know what was really
going on with me that night in Seattle.

677
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:04,462
So is the Western medicine
controlling the seizures?

678
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:06,825
Not entirely.

679
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:13,544
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about this earlier.

680
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:17,425
I think I was just trying to not face it myself.

681
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:22,985
Lisa, I've changed.

682
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:29,138
I used to be this person who ran away from
responsibility, but I'm not him anymore.

683
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,136
I want to be a part of our child's life.

684
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,584
I really want to. I need to.

685
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:50,744
Is this about
you being a father for someone...

686
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,387
or is this about you being scared of death?

687
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,259
Does it really matter?

688
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,060
Maybe it doesn't.

689
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:06,941
This is going to take some adjusting.

690
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:14,296
Okay, maybe we can work out something.

691
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:19,739
-This is what you want, right?
-Absolutely what I want.

692
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:25,983
It's not like Brenda told you
this was the right thing to do, or something.

693
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:27,056
No.

694
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:30,337
She doesn't even know about it.

695
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:36,856
What?

696
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:41,902
Nate, you are so....

697
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:45,306
This is no good.

698
00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:49,016
-I just want to get away from you.
-I don't understand. What's going on?

699
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:53,020
I was so stupid to think
that anything could ever change you.

700
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:57,860
You don't want a child, so you agree
not to be a part of that child's life.

701
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:02,219
Then you decide you do want a child, and
you say you'll be part of the child's life...

702
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:05,936
with a total disregard for the person
you're supposedly sharing a life with.

703
00:55:06,027 --> 00:55:07,745
-All I said...
-Jesus, Nate...

704
00:55:07,827 --> 00:55:11,103
if you can't put anyone but yourself first,
how can you be a father?

705
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:12,256
You can't.

706
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:15,862
So do us both a favor
and stay out of our lives. Please.

707
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:39,935
