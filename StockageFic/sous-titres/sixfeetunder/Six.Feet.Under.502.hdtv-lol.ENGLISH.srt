Saison 5 Episode 2
"Dancing For Me"

2
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,139
Damn it.

3
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,719
- I'm gonna pull out!
- No no no! Don't!

4
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,291
- We're supposed to wait.
- It's okay.

5
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,258
- It's been long enough.
- You sure?

6
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,961
- Yeah.
- All right.

7
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:47,039
Why don't you put a
little man inside me?

8
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,388
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah, too much man, huh?

9
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,390
We've got a little visitor.

10
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,024
Hello, gorgeous.

11
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,400
Are you dancing for us?

12
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,857
- I'm dancing for me.
- Good for you.

13
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,669
Why don't we all get
a little breakfast ?

14
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,121
- Rain check.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,100
<i> On saturday, more than 300,000...</i>

16
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,010
I need you to sign this.

17
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,141
"Step-Parent petition"?

18
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,555
Yeah, if we go the surrogate route.

19
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,093
Then at the time of birth

20
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,629
The child's legal parents
will be me and the surrogate.

21
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,300
But then she'll sign away her rights

22
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,170
And you'll then adopt as co-Parent.

23
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,700
I only get to be co-Parent?
That doesn't seem fair.

24
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,000
We'll both be co-Parents.

25
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,843
It's just words.

26
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,163
I've already read everything.

27
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:49,808
Everything?

28
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,169
Yeah. I signed your form,
now you need to sign mine.

29
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:53,505
Okay.

30
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:03,286
We're really doing this, aren't we?

31
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:05,343
David.

32
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:07,595
No, it's gonna be great, I know.

33
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,387
I spoke to shirley
what's-Her-Name,

34
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,700
The adoption counselor. If we adopt,

35
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,800
She's supposed to fax over
an orientation schedule.

36
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,024
Mornings are better for me.

37
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,214
Nights are better for me.

38
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,472
Okay, we can do nights.

39
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,600
- I'm sure rog will let me go.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:30,202
This doesn't mean you
get to pick the name.

41
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:33,112
What are you talking about? I'm
being nice to you because I love you.

42
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,537
You're being nice to me because
you want to pick the baby's name.

43
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,661
The fact that jackson charles
Fisher is an excellent name,

44
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,423
And pretty much guarantees that our son

45
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:42,900
Will be playing third base
for the los angeles dodgers

46
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,852
Is completely a separate issue.

47
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,900
Look at you, always working.

48
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,605
That's because there's
always work to do.

49
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,486
What are you doing?

50
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:09,030
Just cleaning a bit up
here. One of the advantages,

51
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,573
Or disadvantages, of being tall

52
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,503
Is you can see dust where no one can.

53
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,500
That was my drying towel.

54
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm sorry. Should I use something else?

55
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,551
It's a little late now.

56
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,220
You know, you've been at sixes
and sevens with me all day.

57
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,022
George, the kitchen is my
territory. I have my ways.

58
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,983
So, what if I take
you out of the kitchen

59
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,843
And we walk down to that little
armenian deli and get a sandwich?

60
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,991
- It's 10:30 in the morning!
- okay.

61
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,438
I'll just make myself a sandwich.

62
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:48,050
Do we have any of that
spicy mustard I like?

63
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,799
If we do, it's in the
door where it always is.

64
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,782
I don't see any.

65
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:04,030
If it's too much of an imposition
to help your grandmother,

66
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,592
Then I'll make my own sandwich!

67
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:08,857
Just tip my chair over so
i can crawl to the breadbox!

68
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:10,791
Let me do it!

69
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,287
Ruth...

70
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,043
I can do it.

71
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,800
Here's a recent photo.

72
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,884
His suit's being cleaned.
I'll get that to you tomorrow.

73
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,450
You wanted us to handle
the memorial marker as well?

74
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:33,297
Yeah, the polished granite.

75
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,300
I put a post-It in the catalog.

76
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:39,300
Just his name- "Samuel wayne
hoviak. Beloved husband.

77
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,224
- Sam hoviak?
-  Yeah.

78
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,484
- Did he go to bonaventure high?
- Yeah, did you know him?

79
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:50,266
Well, yeah. I knew him real well.

80
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,455
I didn't even recognize him.
I haven't seen him in years.

81
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,904
We met in college. We
were both english majors.

82
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,499
How did you end up coming here?

83
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,061
Oh, I drive past all the time
on the way to sam's parents.

84
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,500
- Still on harvard, the same house?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,714
Again, I am so sorry.

86
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:17,600
If there's anything you need please
don't hesitate to call us day or night.

87
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:19,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

88
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,534
He was a buddy of yours ?

89
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,871
Yeah, yeah...

90
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,631
Me, him and this other guy

91
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,900
Were, like, best friends
all through high school.

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,454
I'm really excited about these.

93
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,421
Yeah, I went in a totally different
direction from the last series.

94
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:46,033
- I can see that.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,800
Yeah, I felt like I took the
collage stuff as far as I could.

96
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:55,284
And with these I was thinking
less about the process

97
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,276
I think simple emotional connection.

98
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:12,793
Well?

99
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,587
They're quite beautiful.

100
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,450
But I can't sell them.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,838
- What do you mean?
- Well, Claire, they're wedding photographs.

102
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,959
- Yeah, technically, but...
- And they're beautifully shot, but...

103
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,714
I'm an art dealer,
I know what people want.

104
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:30,359
And it's not pictures from
someone else's wedding.

105
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,499
Maybe if I took out some of the ones

106
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,800
That specifically
identify it as a wedding.

107
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,797
You know, make it a
little more ambiguous.

108
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,180
Do you think I should?

109
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:47,003
I would never ask you to
compromise your artistic vision.

110
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,962
Well, I can probably interpret my vision

111
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,812
In different ways, you know?

112
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,700
And I was kind of hoping
to get another show soon.

113
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:58,400
Yeah.

114
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:00,450
Sorry.

115
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,102
I still have a couple ideas
for the collage series.

116
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:10,565
You know?

117
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:14,300
All right, I'm having
a group show next month.

118
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,507
If you can bring me two pieces

119
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:19,489
From your collage series

120
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,279
I'll see what I can do
to find a place for them.

121
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,408
Just two?

122
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:26,697
The world is an evil place, Claire.

123
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,600
- Notice something different?
- About what?

124
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,078
No formaldehyde smell.

125
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm trying a new line of
chemicals- "Millennium new era. "

126
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,800
Less toxic exposure

127
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,119
So I'll live to see my grandkids.

128
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,859
Looks good, right?

129
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,865
Do you know who this is?

130
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,200
- Should I?
- It's sam hoviak.

131
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,154
Sam...

132
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,460
Oh my god, you're kidding.
Sam hoviak from high school?

133
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,997
- Wow, he got fat.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,800
I used to have such a crush on him.

135
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,239
- Really?
- He always so nice to me.

136
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:12,600
And he had such great shoulders.

137
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:17,371
- He was run over?
- Yeah, he ran over himself.

138
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:21,371
- How do you do that?
- I have no idea.

139
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,797
The adoption agency.

140
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,298
This is David Fisher.

141
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,200
Yes, shirley. How are you?

142
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,470
No fucking way.

143
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,890
Yeah, that's you.

144
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,263
Jesus, what a lardass.

145
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, I guess I ate too much pussy, huh?

146
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,527
Look at you. You used to be so
obsessed with your fucking six-Pack

147
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:47,800
I thought you were secretly gay.

148
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:50,565
Dude, I got fat. It's
not the end of the world.

149
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,803
You swore you'd never become a fucking
funeral director and look at you now.

150
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,500
At least I don't need a
golf cart to get around.

151
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,500
Oh, dude, harsh.

152
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:01,654
By the way, I always knew
you slept with sheila maddox

153
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,257
While she was supposedly my girlfriend.

154
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,505
The operative word there is supposedly.

155
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,935
You were too busy trying to
bajennifer kaufman to notice.

156
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:10,662
- I did bag jennifer kaufman.
- I knew you did.

157
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:13,700
And sheila knew it too. I
was merely comforting her.

158
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,015
Do you remember that?

159
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,208
Remember feeling like there was

160
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,467
Nothing in the world you
couldn't get away with

161
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,500
And it would always be that way?

162
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:39,106
Did you make a vegetable?

163
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:42,300
No, this is spinach lasagna.

164
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:44,900
I figured that would be our vegetable.

165
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,867
Well, I only asked because
sometimes you make a dish

166
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,900
And it's not until we're
almost finished eating

167
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,600
That you remember
it's still in the oven.

168
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,500
I guess I must have alzheimer's.

169
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,965
I wasn't being critical, Ruth.

170
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,792
Actually, I find all your
little quirks very endearing.

171
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:06,770
This is delicious.

172
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,833
- Thank you.
- What's in it?

173
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:11,900
Do you want me to list
all the ingredients?

174
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:15,300
Not if you don't want to. I was
just wondering what this spice is?

175
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,275
"Italian seasoning. "

176
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,400
I didn't know you could buy
it all mixed up like this.

177
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,969
"Basil, rosemary, marjoram,
sage, thyme, oregano. "

178
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,440
have to keep this in stock.

179
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,300
I'll make a note of it.

180
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,005
Do you know what they
call an italian hooker?

181
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,087
A pasta-Tute

182
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,996
Th kind of humor doesn't
really appeal to me, George.

183
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:00,194
Guess it's not that funny.

184
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,365
You're goddamned right it's not funny!

185
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,900
None of this funny! You
tricked me into marrying you!

186
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:06,929
You knew you were crazy
and didn't tell me!

187
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,235
And now I have to take care
of you for the rest of my life!

188
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,202
What did I do to fucking deserve this?!

189
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,300
You can really taste the rosemary.

190
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,303
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

191
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,700
- You don't belong in a place like that.
- I have to do my internship.

192
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,400
I've got to clock 300 hours.

193
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,263
But a free clinic?

194
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,320
You're going to have to hire an
armed escort to walk to your car.

195
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,065
You're catastrophysing.

196
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,493
Those places attract the
absolute dregs of society.

197
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,500
The most desperate
and the most dangerous.

198
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,601
The reason I charge $200 an hour

199
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,427
Is to keep those kinds of
people out of my office.

200
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,300
Well, thankfully I'm not you.

201
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,394
You know, I would like to work
with people who actually need help.

202
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,543
Really, Brenda, let me find
you a better internship.

203
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,468
One that's more suited to your talents.

204
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,005
I hate to let the fact
that I've slept with

205
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:04,072
Half of southern california's
psychiatric academia go to waste.

206
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:05,791
No thank you. I am fine.

207
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,100
What makes you think you're
going to help them anyway?

208
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,601
You're always talking
about doing cognitive work.

209
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:12,500
You live in your head.

210
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,394
How are you going to
relate to crack addicts?

211
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,100
Because I've had my own
struggles with addiction.

212
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:21,100
- Because we're all human.
- No, honey, we're not.

213
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,800
That's what you're going to learn.

214
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,465
- Hi.
- Hey !

215
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,400
- Hi, mommy.
- Hello, Maya.

216
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,642
How's my favorite little girl?

217
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:34,730
Hello, margaret.

218
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,630
Nate. Oh, look at you

219
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,600
And your happy little family.

220
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,625
Mommy just ordered chinese

221
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,416
- And it's going to be here in 10 minutes.
- Perfect.

222
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,716
My mom's trying to
convince me that I'm making

223
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,095
A huge mistake by
working at a free clinic.

224
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:52,144
- I think it's kind of great.
- Yes, let's all save the world.

225
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,823
Well, why not save the world?

226
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,954
I think you're both
being naive about this.

227
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,384
Well, sometimes that's
not such a bad thing.

228
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,301
I wanna go read "peter rabbit.

229
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,689
You wanna go read "peter rabbit?

230
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,210
<i>the time blame the deaths</i>

231
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,681
<i>Of million of fish in
north carolina waters...</i>

232
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,900
So, you want move up to my room?

233
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,600
I do but I should go.

234
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,434
It's completely private up there.

235
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,673
- Well...
- And no one minds if you stay over.

236
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,900
Am I interrupting anything?

237
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,152
No.

238
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,741
Of course not.

239
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,163
It's your house.

240
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,334
My wife's actually.

241
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,484
Do you remember sharon?

242
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,481
Of course.

243
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,600
We met at the wedding.

244
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, yeah, Nate and Brenda's wedding.

245
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,384
- It's nice to see you again.
- Hi.

246
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,549
So anything good on?

247
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,827
Oh, I don't know.

248
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:58,200
Something about fish I think.

249
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,136
- I should go.
- Oh, really?

250
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,669
- Yeah.
- You sure?

251
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:10,000
Tomorrow's my day off, so...

252
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,800
So what's the hurry?

253
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,556
I have a bunch of errands
to do in the morning.

254
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,900
- Okay, let me walk you out.
- No, I'm fine.

255
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,800
Stay here with George.

256
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,300
- Wanna have lunch tomorrow?
- Yeah. Great.

257
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah, give me a call.

258
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:29,821
Okay.

259
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:41,358
I'm sorry, baby, I'm
not gonna come tonight.

260
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,216
It's okay.

261
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,500
It's not the lithium. It's the seroquel.

262
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,660
It...

263
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,800
Sometimes it makes it
difficult to ejaculate.

264
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,300
That's okay.

265
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,925
I thought I was passed all that, though.

266
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,800
I hate this.

267
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,371
Billy, it's okay.

268
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,700
I came already.

269
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,131
Oh, so I don't matter, right?

270
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,321
No, of course not.

271
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:21,288
You're here purely to service me.

272
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,800
And now that you've
satisfied me, I must kill you.

273
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,600
Seriously, don't freak out about this.

274
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,136
It'll just make the next
time that much better.

275
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,501
I don't know. I just don't
want to name him logan.

276
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,700
Why don't you like logan?

277
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,795
You've got to be kidding me.

278
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:50,956
It's like a porn star name.

279
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,670
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

280
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,501
Why are you looking at me
like you're about to eat me?

281
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm just looking at
how beautiful you are.

282
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:04,800
- Shut up.
- I mean it.

283
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,860
You're starting to creep me out.

284
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,900
I want our baby to be part you, too.

285
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,772
Well, I think we're out of luck there.

286
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,400
Not if we ask Claire to
donate some of her eggs.

287
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,702
- Claire?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,200
Then the baby could be like a
combination of the two of us.

289
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,900
Or as close as we could get anyway.

290
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,836
Well, I guess I could ask.

291
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,400
I think it's a great idea.

292
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,500
Really?

293
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,101
Definitely.

294
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,938
I am the egg man.

295
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,900
Goo-Goo-Ga-Joob?

296
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,129
Daddy.

297
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,104
What's taking so long?

298
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,842
It's okay. Just calm down.

299
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,965
Excuse me. I'm Bren...

300
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,415
Hi, Brenda Chenowith. I'm
here to see Eileen Goldberg.

301
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,544
Brenda, hi. I'm Eileen.

302
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,600
- Hi.
- Follow me.

303
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,900
Try not to trip over any of our family.

304
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,136
So, this your office.

305
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,402
You'll share it with
mohan our other intern.

306
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:23,048
He's tuesdays and thursdays and
you're monday, wednesday and friday.

307
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:26,434
So hopefully you'll never meet,
'cause he's kind of a moron.

308
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:29,000
We have a staff meeting
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

309
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,294
Until then, maybe you could
read through some of these files.

310
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:34,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,857
I'm glad you're here. We need you.

312
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:43,907
- I'm glad I'm here, too.
- Okay.

313
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,995
I thought you had a lunch.

314
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:19,747
I do.

315
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm just waiting for
her to call me back.

316
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,367
I started the prep
work on the other body.

317
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,400
- I'll finish it up by tomorrow.
- Good.

318
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,302
Might be a long lunch

319
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,700
If you know what I mean.

320
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:33,480
well, good luck.

321
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,544
Yeah.

322
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,486
I really like this girl.

323
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,100
Nate.

324
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,265
- Oh my god. Tom wheeler. Hey.
- Yeah!

325
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,200
When I heard the funeral was
here I was hoping I'd seeou.

326
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:54,100
- Last I heard you were still up in seattle.
- Yeah yeah.

327
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,238
Well, no, I'm...

328
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:59,300
- Back here now. Working here.
- Really?

329
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,699
- You always swore that-
- Yeah yeah, I know.

330
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:05,917
But the funny this is I
actually like this work.

331
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,290
Wow. That's great.

332
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:10,444
That's great. I've got a software
consulting firm over in encino.

333
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,100
- Oh, great great.
- Yeah, it is good.

334
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:13,677
I've got a wife, three kids.

335
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,065
Basically turned into
my father.

336
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:19,202
Your father was a really
good guy as I remember him.

337
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,579
My dad never bought us beer.

338
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:23,504
Although, he probably
would have if I'd asked him.

339
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,700
My oldest- Can you
believe this?

340
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:28,465
He's 18.

341
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,300
He's going to college in the fall.

342
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,543
Man, we are getting up there, aren't we?

343
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,163
Man, it is really good to see you.

344
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:41,000
But, damn, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

345
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah.

346
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,465
Yeah, it's kind of hard
to believe sam's dead.

347
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,900
Yeah, I never would have thought
he'd be the first one to go.

348
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,702
So how does someone run over himself?

349
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,700
I don't know.

350
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:59,608
- Listen, I've gotta go pay respects.
- Okay.

351
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,789
- What do you say get a beer later, catch up?
- That would be great.

352
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:03,979
Okay. Good to see you.

353
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:10,864
He has good days
and he has bad days.

354
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:12,599
More bad than good.

355
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,100
Really?

356
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:16,210
Whenever I talk to him on
the phone he sounds great.

357
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,665
Well, your calls always help.

358
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,044
I thought I heard your voice.

359
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:22,895
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

360
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:24,300
Hi.

361
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,500
- You look so good.
- Well, I feel pretty good.

362
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:31,900
I guess sending thousands of volts
of electricity through the brain

363
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:34,247
- Must've done the trick.
- That's so good to hear.

364
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:37,300
Here, sit down. I made some iced tea.

365
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:41,663
Thank you.

366
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm, still having
problems with my memory.

367
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,100
Yesterday he forgot
our home phone number.

368
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,800
They needed it at the pharmacy

369
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:57,591
And he was hunting all over the
store for me like a lost little boy.

370
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,629
Gets pretty frustrating.

371
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:04,100
But, dad, that's normal. That's
not something to worry about.

372
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,565
Oh, I know. I know.

373
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:08,800
The doctor said it could
be a very long haul.

374
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,646
So, how have you been filling your time?

375
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:17,600
Oh, resting mostly.
And a lot of reading.

376
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,958
I just finished clinton's book.

377
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:21,710
- Oh, I've been wanting to read that?
- Really?

378
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,700
Let me get it for you.

379
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,300
Before I forget.

380
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,300
Well, he seems so much better.

381
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,907
With everything you said i
wasn't sure what to expect.

382
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm never sure what to expect.

383
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:40,900
Every day's a new adventure.

384
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:46,427
Hey, sharon. It's Rico again.

385
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,427
Obviously, we're not
going to have lunch today.

386
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:53,200
But, uh, why don't you give me
a call back so we can reschedule?

387
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:56,601
Okay? Bye-Bye.

388
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:00,717
Thanks for helping me with this.

389
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,100
It's not a problem.

390
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,628
Be nice to have something
feels remotely familiar

391
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:07,659
- At Billy's apartment.
- I can relate.

392
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,900
Of course, if you'd like to do a favor

393
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,570
- For me in return...
- What?

394
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,287
It's a big favor.

395
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:18,953
Okay.

396
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,264
Donate some of your
eggs to Keith and me?

397
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:35,865
- Like when?
- As soon as possible, I guess.

398
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I mean, we have to
find a surrogate first.

399
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:42,922
And then you would both have
to go on birth control pills

400
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,089
At the same time so your cycles

401
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,800
Would coincide.

402
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,274
Then there would be all
sorts of hormone injections.

403
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:52,500
And you wouldn't be able
to exercise or anything.

404
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,144
No drugs or drinking, of course.

405
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:58,687
Eventually, the eggs would be harvested

406
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,200
Through a needle
inserted into the vagina.

407
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,165
Your vagina.

408
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,600
It's like surgery.

409
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:16,465
Okay, I get it. It's asking too much.

410
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,600
I mean, I haven't
given that much thought

411
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:20,600
To my eggs.

412
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,800
But I'm not exactly sure I
want to give any of them away.

413
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,100
It really wasn't fair of me to ask.

414
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:29,900
- You're not mad?
- No, of course not. No.

415
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:33,567
Ev if it all worked out,
there would be the weirdness

416
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,106
Of having a niece that
you're also the mother of.

417
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,765
Yeah, that's really kind of creepy.

418
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:41,200
It could make thanksgiving
dinners a little awkward.

419
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,328
Everyone say hello to Brenda
Chenowith our new intern.

420
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,100
- Hi.
- Hello.

421
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,967
Hi.

422
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:55,800
Okay.

423
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:00,300
We're about to discuss the
case of one tanisha williams.

424
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,895
32 years old, habitual
abuser of crack cocaine

425
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:05,765
And occasional prostitute.

426
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:08,366
The state is seeking custody
of her 12-Year-Old child

427
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:12,500
After said child complained that her
mother tied her to the coffee table,

428
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Whipped her until she bled
and then sexually molested her

429
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,844
With a rolled up copy of "newsweek. "

430
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,000
All for the viewing
pleasure of her boyfriend.

431
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,800
I'm sure the kid's lying.

432
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:25,765
There's no way that
woman reads "newsweek. "

433
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,700
Is this the same child
with all the burn marks?

434
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,665
No, that's her sister.

435
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:35,375
Since the children
have been in foster care-

436
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,500
- You okay?
- Yeah.

437
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,031
No, I mean.

438
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:49,727
Don't feel bad.

439
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:51,808
You've got to be in a
strong place to work here.

440
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,700
I'm in a strong place.

441
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:56,765
Good.

442
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,331
<i>Hey, it's sharon.
I'm not in right now.</i>

443
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,392
<i>Please leave
me a message</i>

444
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:22,594
Excuse me. Have you seen sharon kinney?

445
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
No, sorry. Haven't
seen her around today.

446
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,400
Thank you!

447
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:41,942
Hello, Rico.

448
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
<i>Hey, vanessa.</i>

449
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,400
Listen, I'm sorry. I don't think
i can take the kids out tonight.

450
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,755
I didn't make dinner for them.
You said you'd take them out.

451
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:53,799
I know, I'm sorry. But a
friend of mine is missing

452
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:55,055
And I'm starting to worry.

453
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,600
<i>- What friend?
- Sharon.</i>

454
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,759
What, that woman you've been seeing?

455
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,300
<i>- Yeah.
- What do you mean she's missing?</i>

456
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:04,800
I don't know. She just disappeared.

457
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,700
I hope she's okay. Have you
started calling the hospitals?

458
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:11,200
Oh, man. I guess I should.

459
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,946
I'm sorry about the kids.

460
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,212
Don't worry about it.
I hope you find her.

461
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,900
And I'm sure she's fine.

462
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,100
<i>- Okay, bye-Bye.
- Bye, Rico.</i>

463
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,000
<i>City and listing?</i>

464
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:29,200
Yes, los angeles. County hospital.

465
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,765
This tea is interesting.

466
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,900
- What did you call it?
- Yerba mate.

467
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:40,100
You must find all kinds of
new things in your adventures.

468
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,200
What adventures?

469
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,400
I mostly see my hotel room and
the inside of doctor's offices.

470
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:48,900
Still, hawaii, san francisco, portland.

471
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:51,900
It all sounds so exciting.

472
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,600
I like it.

473
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:57,015
I get to set my own schedule.

474
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,748
Yeah, there are plenty of perks.

475
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,100
Are you dating anyone?

476
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:05,600
There must be men lined at
the door to see you. Doctors.

477
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,800
yeah, like
they're such prizes.

478
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,800
I guess men are the same everywhere.

479
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:18,926
Actually, I have been dating a doctor

480
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,865
In phoenix for a while.

481
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:23,400
- What's his name?
- Philip.

482
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,900
- Tell me.
- No, he's fine.

483
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,600
He's a little obsessed with his work.

484
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,500
But that's normal.

485
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,500
- Is it serious?
- Well, he seems to think so.

486
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,500
But...

487
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,127
I'm in no hurry to get married.

488
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:40,065
Good for you.

489
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,200
If you want my advice
and-

490
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,400
Lord knows I'm not one to give advice.

491
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:49,500
But I think you should know
exactly what you're getting into

492
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,496
Before you make that jump.

493
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,100
Marriage is hard.

494
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,663
I know this must be difficult for you.

495
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:06,820
My father.

496
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,800
Thank you for saying that.

497
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:12,000
Sometimes that's all I need to hear.

498
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:15,200
That someone understands.

499
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:20,600
You know, I don't usually
give advice, either.

500
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:25,400
But I think, if you look hard enough

501
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:28,500
You'll see that the man you fell
in love with is still in there.

502
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,690
Yes?

503
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,500
Hi, mom. It's me, Brenda.

504
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,622
You want me to make those calls for you?

505
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,052
Yes.

506
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,300
Oh, I feel awful.

507
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,622
Well, honey, those
people are so depressing.

508
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:04,189
mom, it's not that.

509
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,608
It's...

510
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,365
I don't
know. It's-

511
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,200
You know, it wasn't
really the job for you.

512
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,315
Yeah yeah, maybe not.

513
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15,600
<i>You just don't know how
to dress down like them.</i>

514
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,800
You must have been a walking target.

515
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,965
Yeah, mom, you're right, that's it.

516
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,376
And let us not forget,
you just had a miscarriage.

517
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,700
Well, I really don't see
what that's got to do with it.

518
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,965
Honey, you're still in shock.

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm so glad that you're more in tune

520
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:31,967
With my emotional state than me.

521
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,800
Well, I'm a very good psychologist.

522
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:38,250
<i>- I was being sarcastic.
- I know that as well.</i>

523
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,600
Well, don't forget to
send me a bill for $200.

524
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,700
<i>Oh, I won't.</i>

525
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,294
Somehow we end up in cambodia.

526
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,100
And it is like, "holy fuck"!

527
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:52,366
A world you never even knew existed.

528
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,584
We lived in a little tree
house up with the birds.

529
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, god. That sounds so amazing,

530
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,383
Just traveling like that.

531
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,960
You have to. It's your
responsibility as an artist

532
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,021
To try everything that
world has to offer.

533
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,718
We just went wherever we
wanted till the money ran out.

534
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,834
And get this. The best part was,

535
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,615
When we got back the first
piece of mail that I opened

536
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,700
Was this huge fucking check.

537
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:17,632
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, this grant is a godsend.

538
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,700
Gives us enough money
to live on for a year

539
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,642
While I get back to
work on my installation.

540
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:25,200
That is so great. God, i
wish I could get a grant.

541
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,776
Is this still the, uh, poultry thing?

542
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:31,161
Yes, but it's expanded
way beyond that now.

543
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:33,424
You need to come by our
new space and check it out.

544
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,150
- It's amazing.
- I would love to.

545
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah, we're still unpacking shit.

546
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,182
You know what I found
was that video we shot

547
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:44,212
When we turned the L.A. River red.

548
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,900
Oh no, not as daunting as it sounds.

549
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,700
It hadn't rained in months.
There was an inch of water.

550
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:53,200
But still it was, like,
this trickle of blood

551
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,700
Snaking through the city.

552
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:58,970
It was pretty cool.

553
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,100
I can't believe they talked
you into becoming a professor.

554
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,192
Well, associate professor.

555
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,500
But, uh, yeah, it's
not so bad, you know?

556
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:11,000
Got to pay the rent.

557
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,806
Well, you're a better man than me.

558
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,100
He is such an amazing teacher. Really.

559
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,765
Well, those that can't, do.

560
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:21,800
So, Billy said you're
working on a new series.

561
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,687
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,865
I just showed them to my gallery owner.

563
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,300
Who loved them, but he still
wants more of my old series.

564
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:31,650
He does? You didn't tell me that.

565
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:33,806
Yeah, I guess he thinks I'm a factory

566
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,300
Who's going to keep
churning out the same stuff.

567
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:41,300
So what about you, Billy? What
are you working on these days?

568
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,100
Well, molding
impressionable young minds.

569
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,900
Arguing for a decent budget.

570
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,516
Oh, god. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,328
I'm so glad I'm out of that world.

572
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:55,342
Me, too. I am never setting
foot on a campus again.

573
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,834
I mean, how do you even have time

574
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:00,232
To do your real work?

575
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,293
To be honest, I'm not exactly

576
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:04,200
Overflowing with ideas just now.

577
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,232
We all hit dry spots.

578
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah, that we do.

579
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,576
So how are you handling it?

580
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:16,900
- Handling what?
- Turning 40.

581
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,156
It's a couple months from now, right?

582
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,100
Yeah, yeah.

583
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:23,371
I think I'm handling it fine,
I haven't...

584
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:25,739
really thought
that much about it.

585
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,500
yeah, right.

586
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,900
Listen, um...

587
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,360
Can I ask you a personal question?

588
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,100
Sure.

589
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,657
Do you have a harder time now?

590
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,600
You know, like, getting wood?

591
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,077
Yeah. Yeah, occasionally.

592
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,548
Do you ever look at girls?

593
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,606
Young girls, like, 14-15?

594
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:53,814
You get that same feeling you
got when you were that age.

595
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,227
And then you're so fucking hard

596
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:58,400
It feels like it might break.

597
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,400
I have a daughter, tom. So I don't
look at young girls like that.

598
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,700
Liar. Look, I've got a daughter, too.

599
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,700
She's 13, of course i
don't look at her that way.

600
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,565
But she's got this one friend.

601
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,463
She comes over to the house all the time

602
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:13,015
And, jesus, fuck.

603
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,565
She is just so perfect.

604
00:37:15,742 --> 00:37:17,476
She's a child, tom. You cannot go there.

605
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:20,200
Look, Nate, I know she
is! I would never do that.

606
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,032
But, I mean, it's not even
the thought of actual sex.

607
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,640
It's just- It's that

608
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,600
That
young-

609
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,600
All that energy, you know?

610
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:33,421
It's likes she reminds
me of this part of me

611
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,520
That I've forgotten even existed.

612
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:37,100
- You know?
- No, I don't know.

613
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,435
Really? Nate, don't you ever
lie awake in bed at night

614
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:43,300
And just think, "jesus, fuck,

615
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:46,428
I'm going to be 40 fucking years old"?

616
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:48,896
No, I don't. I lie
in bed awake at night

617
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,500
Thinking, "thank you, god,
for letting me live this long. "

618
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,600
Are you, like, christian or something?

619
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:57,100
no.

620
00:37:57,582 --> 00:38:01,000
I've just had a lot of serious
shit happen to me in my life.

621
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,674
And I really get it now
that this doesn't last.

622
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:05,271
And I'm no different from anybody else.

623
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,765
Yes, indeed this will happen to me.

624
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:10,827
It is happening to me a
little bit each everyday.

625
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:15,000
And that doesn't freak me out.

626
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,670
If anything, it's liberating.

627
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,578
Okay, so I guess it
comes with the territory?

628
00:38:19,742 --> 00:38:21,636
I mean, your job.

629
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:24,400
No, I don't think it's the
job, really. It's just-

630
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,019
The job allows me to
practice being okay with it.

631
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,817
Yeah yeah, okay, so there.
You have to practice.

632
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:32,135
Okay? So you're really not okay with it.

633
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:35,476
- Of course, you have to practice.
- Yeah, but Nate...

634
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:38,100
It's just so fucking big.

635
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:41,230
I mean, it's all going by so fucking fast.

636
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,425
- Would you change anything?
- Like what?

637
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:46,766
Like who you're with or what you
do or what kind of person you are.

638
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,223
Because if you would, do it now.

639
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,100
Whoa, dude.

640
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:55,305
- That's really harsh.
- Look, this is it, tom!

641
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,500
This is all we have.
Right here, right now.

642
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:04,991
You know, I've got to go home.

643
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,442
I wanna be there
before Maya goes to bed.

644
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,500
- It was good seeing you.
- Yeah, man.

645
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,000
It was good seeing you. We
should get together sometime.

646
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,700
Yeah yeah, okay.

647
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,500
Yeah, give me a call.

648
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:25,083
So what's everyone up to?
Should we hit the concord?

649
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:29,900
I've been dying to go there.
You think we can get in?

650
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,021
Wolf could get his
publicist to make a call.

651
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,800
You guys are going to
have to do it without me.

652
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
- No!
- Yeah, I'm beat.

653
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,775
Yeah, right. You got another
party you're going to?

654
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:40,123
You don't want us slowing you down?

655
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,563
No, I still got to work on
my lesson plan for next week.

656
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,229
You serious? Come on, man.

657
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:47,024
Where's the old Billy I used to know?

658
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,200
He's going to the restroom.

659
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:54,690
Is he doing okay?

660
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:57,200
Hmm? Yeah. He's great.

661
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,600
- Why, you don't think he is?

662
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know. The Billy Chenowith
i knew wouldn't be going home early.

663
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,000
He'd have us out all night doing
something completely insane.

664
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:37,018
It's nice to have maggie here, isn't it?

665
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:39,270
Yes, it certainly is.

666
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:44,200
She's one of the few things I did right.

667
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:46,400
That and marry you.

668
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,765
You're a sweet one when you want to be.

669
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:54,100
It's easy to be sweet
when I'm married to you.

670
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:04,600
Good night, George.

671
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:08,300
Good night.

672
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,953
He had a tattoo.

673
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:36,256
Sam had a tattoo on his ass

674
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:39,567
That said, "U.S.D.A. Prime beef. "

675
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:43,700
- Well, it was 1982.
- Sorry my cruch is officially over.

676
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:48,449
If you can handle it from here,
i have a body waiting downstairs.

677
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,470
Wait a minute, I thought
Rico was handling it.

678
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,500
He had an emergency with sharon.

679
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:55,100
What kind of an emergency?

680
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,765
Uh, hi, I'm tom wheeler.

681
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:06,200
I first met sam in the 10th grade

682
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,900
When he talked me and Nate,

683
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,600
Who stands right behind you there,

684
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:13,251
Into cutting biology class.

685
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,900
Then we jumped out the
second story window.

686
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,500
Nate when first and sprained his ankle.

687
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,941
I landed without injury.

688
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,511
Until, of course, sam jumped on me

689
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:25,300
And gave me a mild
concussion.

690
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:27,698
At that moment

691
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,763
Or fates were sealed as best friends.

692
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:33,800
Best days of my life were
spent with these guys.

693
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:38,600
But as always happens as time goes by...

694
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,767
once we had people using an apartment

695
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:44,100
For purposes of prostitution.

696
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,400
But I kicked them right
out on their zadnek.

697
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:50,600
You don't think she's doing
anything like this, do you?

698
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:52,784
Oh, no. No no no.
She's just been missing

699
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:56,000
And I'm really worried that
something's happened to her.

700
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,100
Sharon, you in there?

701
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,300
I don't smell anything.

702
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:17,398
Hello.

703
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,500
Sharon?

704
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,569
Oh my god! What the fuck are you doing?

705
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,965
You're here!

706
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,524
You came into my
apartment. Are you crazy?

707
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,300
- He insisted I let him in.
- I was worried!

708
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:33,463
We were supposed to have lunch yesterday

709
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,278
And I've called you half a dozen times.

710
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:36,900
And you didn't even answer your door.

711
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,265
Look, I'm sorry.

712
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,500
I thought you could, you know...

713
00:43:43,278 --> 00:43:44,999
Take a hint.

714
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,376
Okay.

715
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:05,100
- Miss Chenowith.
- Brenda.

716
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,278
- Jackie.
- Hi.

717
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:09,900
- Hi, have a seat please.
- Thank you.

718
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,200
I typically award this internship
to my most promising student.

719
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:15,827
But apparently somebody
pulled some strings somewhere

720
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:18,800
And it's to go to you now,
so I guess that's that.

721
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,865
We have over 17,000 students here

722
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:26,100
From every possible ethnic
and socio-Economic background.

723
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,400
Quite a few of them end
up here needing our help.

724
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,800
- I understand.
- We deal with everything

725
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:32,926
From eating disorders to depression

726
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:35,452
To stress-Related
disorders. You name it.

727
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:37,800
It's not a walk in the park.

728
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,991
Are you ready for that?

729
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:45,600
Yeah, I think I'll manage.

730
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,900
- Anything else?
- It says you speak a second language.

731
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:50,650
Yes. French.

732
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:51,967
Ah, great.

733
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:55,000
We get a lot of people from
france here.

734
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:01,865
Hi.

735
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,431
I'm sorry I didn't call
first. I was just driving by.

736
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,797
Come in.

737
00:45:12,558 --> 00:45:14,414
Hey, uh, do you think

738
00:45:14,442 --> 00:45:17,018
I can take the kids
out to dinner tonight?

739
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,700
Rico, you can't keep
changing days on me.

740
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,759
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,000
Forget it.

742
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:27,600
What happened to
sharon? Did you find her?

743
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:29,800
She died.

744
00:45:31,634 --> 00:45:33,449
Oh my god, Rico.

745
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:39,600
Yeah, she died.

746
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:42,200
- What happened?
- She had a heart thing.

747
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:45,436
I found her in her apartment.

748
00:45:46,315 --> 00:45:48,300
Baby, that's so awful.

749
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:50,400
I'm so sorry.

750
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,700
I'm ill kind of reeling from it.

751
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:56,878
You know?

752
00:45:57,015 --> 00:45:59,065
It's so sudden.

753
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,948
Well, take the boys out for pizza.

754
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:03,100
You need them with you.
It'll make you feel better.

755
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,282
Do you think that you can come too?

756
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,330
Of course.

757
00:46:08,357 --> 00:46:10,800
Of course. Just give me a few minutes.

758
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:28,800
Finish your lesson plans already?

759
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:30,410
No.

760
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,700
I don't really have the energy for it.

761
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:42,959
I'm working on a new idea.

762
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,400
Yeah, I want to go back
to the collage stuff.

763
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:52,000
But on a much bigger scale.

764
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,377
Not just people as
fragments glued together,

765
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:58,012
But, like, the whole world.

766
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,413
Well, that sounds good.

767
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:05,365
Yeah, sort of capture the idea that...

768
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:09,769
everything we know is
just barely being held together.

769
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:18,054
- That's big.
- I know.

770
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:20,600
It's big. It's really big.

771
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:24,708
I'm just  trying to

772
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:27,300
I'm still trying to figure it all out.

773
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:31,845
Well, I'll let you keep working then.

774
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:48,400
So have you had an opportunity
to talk to Claire yet?

775
00:47:49,669 --> 00:47:51,600
Well, yes. Yesterday.

776
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:54,303
And you didn't tell me?

777
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:57,400
I wanted to give her another
day to think about it.

778
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:02,000
- And?
- She won't do it.

779
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:05,467
- Serious?
- She's strongly against it.

780
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:07,800
- That's weird.
- Is it, though?

781
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:13,118
Sometimes I think what's weird is
us trying to create our own child.

782
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:15,684
We're two men, Keith. It's not possible.

783
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,386
There's no way that we're
going to have a child

784
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:19,309
That's both part me and part you.

785
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:23,200
- I know that, David.
- Then let's stop pretending.

786
00:48:23,855 --> 00:48:26,600
Whether we have a child through
a surrogate or we adopt a child,

787
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:29,400
All that's important
is the child itself.

788
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:32,200
Okay.

789
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,600
- Really?
- Of course.

790
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:36,691
look...

791
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:39,800
I wasn't trying to be
selfish about any of this.

792
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:43,100
And I really can't
imagine anything greater

793
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,272
Than being able to look at our child

794
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:48,500
And see you in him. Or see you in her.

795
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,135
Hopefully you still will.

796
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:56,342
It was such a short visit, maggie.

797
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,465
I wish you could stay longer.

798
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,548
That's the good and
the bad part of my job-

799
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:03,100
I'm never anywhere very long.

800
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,317
Vanilla or chocolate?

801
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:07,500
I'd like the neapolitan.

802
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,972
We don't have that.

803
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,600
Of course we do.

804
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,700
- I had some yesterday.
- Yes and now we're out of it.

805
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,372
How can we be out of it?
That's what I like! Neapolitan!

806
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,720
Daddy, why don't you take a little
vanilla and a little chocolate?

807
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:24,136
- It's almost the same thing.
- No, it is not the same!

808
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:26,416
Neapolitan is chocolate,
vanilla and strawberry!

809
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:30,500
If there's no strawberry it most
definitely is not neapolitan!

810
00:49:30,705 --> 00:49:32,500
You see what I go through?

811
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,500
I'm sorry. It's just...

812
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:41,165
My life is so goddamned pathetic.

813
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:44,100
All I have to look forward to
is a fucking bowl of ice cream.

814
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,100
and I can't even get that!

815
00:49:52,674 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm sorry.

816
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:57,132
I'm trying not to be demanding.

817
00:49:57,214 --> 00:49:58,900
It's just...

818
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,681
Oh, my life is shit!

819
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,557
I simply don't know
how to deal with this.

820
00:50:04,598 --> 00:50:06,800
It's like having another child.

821
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:15,836
It's okay, daddy.

822
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,935
You're gonna have moments like
this. It's gonna get better.

823
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,200
Will it really?

824
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,400
Maggie, please don't leave.

825
00:50:28,965 --> 00:50:30,986
I'm not sure I can do this by myself.

826
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,400
If you leave tomorrow,
maggie, I just-

827
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:38,700
I don't know what I'll do.

828
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:45,077
Maybe I can stay a little longer.
