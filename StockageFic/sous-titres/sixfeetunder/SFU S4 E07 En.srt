1
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,111
What's the matter?

2
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,836
- I'm scared.
- Don't be. Everything's gonna be fine.

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,671
Come on, come on.

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,789
I'm almost done.

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,558
OK.

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,312
At first I just thought they'd go away,
but they never did.

7
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,508
They just kept growing and growing.

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,593
- I see you've had symptoms.
- Mainly indigestion, which I've always had.

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,598
Even as a child, I had a nervous stomach.

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,112
But there's also been vomiting and blood
in your stool? Why didn't you call me?

11
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,358
I knew we should.
Somehow I just kept putting it off.

12
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,590
We were supposed to go to Florida
next week to visit our son.

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,471
We haven't seen him in a year.

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,718
We were gonna call you as soon as
we got back but the pain got too bad.

15
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,149
I wish you had called me as soon...

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,196
Well, we'll just start doing some tests
and hope for the best.

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,674
What would be the worst?

18
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,231
That these are two tumours
which may have metastasised and spread.

19
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,470
What are the chances that's the case?

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,992
Let's just do the tests and hope for the best.

21
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,478
Claire?

22
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,471
Morning.

23
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,071
It's not very good.

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,112
I think Mom's machine's a little more low-tech.

25
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,835
Sometimes I miss the days
when coffee was just coffee.

26
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,873
I have a huge darkroom day today.
Hopefully, I'll be back in time for dinner.

27
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,559
Don't stay here any more. It's too much.

28
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,670
- No, it isn't.
- It is.

29
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
I was bad before
but now I'm starting to sleep.

30
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,472
I haven't had a panic attack in two days.

31
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,992
I've even cut down on all the Ativan
so you are officially evicted as of today.

32
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,590
David, are you sure? You seem...

33
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,555
- Jeez, this coffee really is gross.
- I don't know. I think maybe I should stay.

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,593
I don't need my baby sister
baby-sitting me any more, OK?

35
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,872
Hear those two cats
having sex in the alley last night?

36
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,718
They were worse than Mom and George.

37
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,550
- Why do they do it? It sounds so painful.
- I mean, they live in an alley.

38
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,195
They deserve some kind of diversion,
don't you think?

39
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,472
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes. You can't see me any more.

40
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,511
It's over. Goodbye.

41
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,351
Goodbye, Rico. Get outta here.

42
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,912
I am so stupid. I hid that pack of cigarettes
from myself so good I can't find them.

43
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,679
Did you look on top of the refrigerator?

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,391
I just want to say that I'm sorry,

45
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,912
but I just feel like this isn't right in some way
to my wife and to my kids...

46
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,111
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

47
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,470
This is not about fucking.
You made that plain and clear.

48
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,512
This is about just being friends.

49
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,629
I think I need more guy friends.

50
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,312
You tell me today when my lupus is acting up.

51
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,874
I gave you that money and I never heard
a word about you going to a doctor.

52
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,229
- Did you go to one...
- I got the damn lupus!

53
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,755
You never even liked me.

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,519
This was about
you needing to feel like a big man

55
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,438
and now that you got what you need,
you're done?

56
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,791
OK, just leave the gift that you promised Nicole

57
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,831
- and get out of here.
- Shit.

58
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,793
You didn't bring the "Jack The Pig" book
you've been going on about?

59
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,150
- I left it at work. I could bring it by tomorrow.
- Forget it.

60
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,910
She needs to learn -
people promise you things...

61
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,996
but then leave when they get tired of you.

62
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,716
She's George's new wife,
the one who came after you.

63
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,955
Jesus, lady, what the hell are you doing?

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,719
George'll kill you if you mess with his things.

65
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,194
You're snooping. You're too snoopy.

66
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,073
I was too snoopy and he got rid of me quick.

67
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,908
- You are some dumb cluck.
- Wanna know why George doesn't like

68
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,155
to be asked anything about his past?

69
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,475
Yes, I do. Tell me. Please, tell me.

70
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,189
What doesn't he want me to know?

71
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,149
Why can't I know anything?

72
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,554
All of these caskets are available
with customised inserts.

73
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,391
You can have your wife's name,
her favourite Bible verse, a family photo.

74
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,829
Is there one that appeals to you?

75
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,838
I don't know, son.

76
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,668
- You seemed to like the blue one.
- There's a lot of options.

77
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,508
I think that maybe you need
to take a little time to look.

78
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,794
I'll give you two a moment to decide.

79
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,796
You were meant to be here 40 minutes ago.

80
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,353
Maya's not used to daycare.

81
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,995
- I had to stay with her.
- No-one was here to meet the Morrisons.

82
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,918
- Well, where were you?
- That's not the point.

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,112
You were gonna talk about arrangements
with Mom. What did she want?

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,870
I tried to bring it up with her.
It always seemed like a bad time.

85
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,311
Fine. Then...

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,751
what do you want?

87
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,309
Pick the casket, then we'll talk about
who's gonna speak at this thing.

88
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,518
Dad, I need to know what you want here.

89
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,349
I want her back.

90
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,552
- I want things back the way they used to be.
- Yeah, well, it's too late now.

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,909
If you guys had faced the truth,

92
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,157
Mom would be alive
and we wouldn't have to fucking decide

93
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,192
about what casket she's gonna be buried in.

94
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,279
Apparently, the father never said a word to
anyone as the tumours kept getting bigger.

95
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,800
Man, I don't understand people.

96
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,197
I get it. Having to admit fucked-up shit
about yourself fucking sucks.

97
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,271
Come on!

98
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,393
- David's been cleaning again.
- So what? It relaxes him.

99
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,830
It's annoying. I could've used him
upstairs with the Morrisons.

100
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,872
I'm doing intakes. David's staying down here.

101
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,829
I know that David doesn't want
to be around people right now,

102
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,475
but if you've come back to the business,
then be back.

103
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,990
The two of you are acting like
you can do whatever the hell you want.

104
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,192
Why are we buying fake Windex
when only the real kind works?

105
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,071
I'll get some real Windex later.

106
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,950
Since there's nothing going on here,

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,039
would you mind swinging by the hospital
to pick up Mrs Morrison?

108
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,232
- I'm cleaning.
- That's fine. We'll figure something out.

109
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,308
Didn't I just have a rag? I must have left it
out there. I don't know where my mind is.

110
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,031
David can't take the van out.
The van is where it happened.

111
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,835
- That's fine. Then you go.
- Actually, Maya and I have to go to the...

112
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,269
- Maya's in daycare.
- That's right.

113
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,278
And there's this get-together once a month

114
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,437
where we get together
with the other parents.

115
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,355
Fine. I'll go.

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,837
Great. So long as you're out,
can you get the real Windex?

117
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,031
Anita?

118
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,152
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,671
Anita went over to Russell's so I just
decided to hang out and wait for you.

120
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,271
What are you hiding?

121
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,951
Nothing. It's one of my photos.

122
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,915
It's one of the ones I took of you.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,877
OK, so it's bad.

124
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,280
It's not. It's really good.

125
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
Then why can't I see it?

126
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,754
It's too good. It's like I can't believe
this actually came out of me.

127
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,268
It's so good, I don't want anyone to see it.

128
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,312
I'm not even gonna show it
at my crit tomorrow because...

129
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,477
I don't know... It's just for me.

130
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,676
- Is that crazy?
- Not at all.

131
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,078
- It's so beautiful.
- I know.

132
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,036
I love this shadow that
goes across your face. It's so cool.

133
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,392
You've got to show this at your crit.
What are you so scared of?

134
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,754
Look at my expression.

135
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,999
Nice to know that finally my hours of watching
"America's Next Top Model" have paid off.

136
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,437
- I definitely owe you one for this.
- I'll think about how I can collect on that.

137
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,151
- Are you available next Tuesday?
- Nate, I told you this is the last time.

138
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,189
You said that last week
and the week before.

139
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,470
No, this is the last last time.

140
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,556
All right, fine.

141
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,593
We'll never talk again...
until you call me tomorrow.

142
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,438
Oh, God. I don't know why I'm doing this.

143
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,111
It's all Joe's fault. If only he enjoyed
nice, normal, perfectly average sex.

144
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,392
Wasn't I a little above average back there,
at least for a few seconds?

145
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,830
As opposed to what I told you
about me and Joe.

146
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,269
- The "Hurt me, Mommy" stuff?
- Stop.

147
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,311
Give me a break, Bren.

148
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,397
- Excuse me?
- This isn't about Joe, it's about you.

149
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,274
- I of all people should know.
- What is that supposed to mean?

150
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,038
You and Joe move in together.
You get scared by the intimacy.

151
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,312
You have sex outside the relationship.
You can't fool me. I used to be Joe.

152
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,114
Well, this is all very illuminating.

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,152
What about you? Why are you doing this?

154
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,954
Why not? I'm at a place in my life
where I want to have some fun.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,877
Of course.

156
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,313
This couldn't be just another way for you
to avoid having a permanent relationship.

157
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,158
- What are you looking for?
- The condom.

158
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,909
I dropped it on the floor
when I took it off and I can't find...

159
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,715
Here it is.

160
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,231
Sperm is...

161
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,397
I don't know.

162
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,638
- It seems so tiny to be able to do so much.
- I know.

163
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,117
It's odd.

164
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,952
I'm going to be gone all day tomorrow.

165
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,632
OK.

166
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,476
I'm going to hunt for fossils in Cold Canyon
like I do every year.

167
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,071
That's nice. I know how much
your annual fossil hunt means to you.

168
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,236
You could come with me,
if you wouldn't find it too boring.

169
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,670
I don't know.
I have to return some books to the library.

170
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,557
You don't have to invite me.

171
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,637
I'm happy for you to do whatever you want
whenever you want

172
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,352
with whomever you want.

173
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,232
OK.

174
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,831
But I want to go fossil hunting
so I will go fossil hunting, darn it.

175
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,676
OK, now I'm starting to freak out!

176
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,188
- We'll find it.
- It's my favourite earring.

177
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,958
I know. You keep saying that.

178
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,593
When Javier gets here,
we'll figure something out.

179
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,349
Nothing yet, but I've got
five of Detroit's finest looking for it.

180
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,550
If it's in this auditorium, they'll find it.

181
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,436
It was given to me by the only person
who ever really loved me. Now it's lost.

182
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,111
Oh, God, when will someone
ever love me again?

183
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,515
The real me?

184
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,630
Everyone else has someone.

185
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,036
Here is the entire universe and here is me.

186
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,995
You're exhausted. You need to go back
to your room and get some sleep.

187
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,749
Please don't minimise my depression.
I would never do that to you.

188
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,550
Only one thing will make me feel better.

189
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,228
Just give me a few moments
and we'll blow out of here.

190
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,074
- Well, we're fucked.
- What do you mean?

191
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,510
Halfway through the tour,
she always gets depressed.

192
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,429
We go to whatever stupid gay club we can
find so she can get worshipped by the fags.

193
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,040
- We're going to a gay club?
- Yeah, dude.

194
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,275
Try to act a little cooler about it.

195
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,313
- Midwestern queers really creep me out.
- I know what you mean.

196
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,155
- Keith Charles.
- Are you still working?

197
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,191
<i>Yeah. Late night</i>.

198
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,109
I'm sorry, I just couldn't sleep and I...
It sounds like you're in a bar.

199
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,472
I am. I'm with Celeste.
She's fighting a severe depression.

200
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,789
- That's a gay bar.
- Dude, Celeste is looking over here.

201
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,992
- She's annoyed you ain't looking at her.
- Listen, I gotta go.

202
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,908
- I'll call you in the morning.
- <i>Sorry to bother you</i>.

203
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,430
If anybody gets mad,
tell them your wife's on her woman's time.

204
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,678
They'll feel bad for you that I'm such a bitch
when I'm on the rag. Night.

205
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,517
Your old lady pissed off? You could've
just told her you was at some fag bar.

206
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,439
There was no chance
of you taking home some pussy tonight.

207
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,471
Javier, I'm gay.

208
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,589
I have a boyfriend. I sleep with men, OK?

209
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,632
I have a lot of sex and it's really, really gay.

210
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,911
That's cool, man.

211
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,111
Well, that site back there was completely
picked over. I'll bet I know who did it, too.

212
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,993
Last year I caught this guy from USC
following me...

213
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,919
- George, I think I'm dehydrating.
- Nonsense.

214
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,112
- I'm about to dehydrate.
- Why did you drink all your water so fast?

215
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,151
I was thirsty.

216
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,194
Here, just have some of mine.

217
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,232
I asked you if you had water.
You said you didn't.

218
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,230
Because I thought, if you knew,
you wouldn't make your water last as long.

219
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,670
Let's talk about lunch.
I always go to the Inn of the Seventh Ray.

220
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,991
I'm going to visit my sister.
I didn't know we were gonna be in Topanga.

221
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,715
She lives a few miles from here
and I haven't seen her in ages.

222
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,028
Family is very important to me
even if it isn't to you.

223
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,238
Mom is hunting for fossils?
Why would a person hunt for fossils?

224
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,316
Because their husband does.

225
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,399
This is great. I was gonna ask her
to baby-sit for me tonight.

226
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,237
I'm busy.

227
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,833
- You're out a lot lately. Is this serious?
- No, of course not.

228
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,638
Maile's a girl I worked with at doggie daycare.

229
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,673
I've seen her a few times,
but she's just...just fun.

230
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,793
It's really weird you worked at a dog place
for, like, six seconds.

231
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,389
Well, it wasn't exactly my decision to leave,
was it?

232
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,514
People who write Op-Ed pieces
should be shot.

233
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,438
Hey, what time's the movie tonight?

234
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,472
Actually, I'm seeing Russell tonight

235
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,318
and I plan on staying over at his apartment.

236
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,715
It's purely a physical thing, but...

237
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,513
it's something very intense
I need to explore.

238
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,873
If you're having any emotions about it,
now is a good time to express them.

239
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,831
No, it isn't.

240
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,351
Look, do whatever you want.
So it'll just be me and Edie tonight.

241
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,954
I'm fine.

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,869
I've just been working on Mrs Morrison
for 110 years.

243
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,070
The tumour lady.

244
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,274
Her body's totally shot from the chemo
and the radiation. She's all crumbly.

245
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,311
Edie and I are going to the movies. Join us.

246
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,636
Girls night out? I'm there, totally.

247
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,390
I'm a lonely little Petunia in an onion patch

248
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,150
an onion patch, an onion patch

249
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,795
I'm a lonely little Petunia in an onion patch

250
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,674
and all I do is cry all day

251
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,549
- What the hell was that?
- My mother used to sing that to us.

252
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,748
Well, that explains a lot.

253
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,557
Why, when you move,
can you never find the things you want?

254
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,275
You just find things you regret bringing
and not throwing away.

255
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,392
- I never hold onto anything.
- Smart.

256
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,634
You should be proud of that.

257
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,672
I'm thinking of building shelves
in the other bedroom.

258
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,598
That's not one of those things
you need to know how to do

259
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,551
in order to be able to do it.

260
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,034
Let's finish settling in later
and watch bad TV.

261
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,789
OK, but we're gonna have to make
a decision at some point.

262
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,869
The office won't always be an office.
It's gonna be a nursery as soon as...

263
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,313
- You might already be pregnant.
- Oh, I'm not. I got it yesterday.

264
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,638
That's why you looked so sad
when you came home late after class.

265
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,275
Why didn't you tell me?

266
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,911
I don't know.

267
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,749
Well, look, it was only
our first time up at bat.

268
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,916
I'm sure this month it'll happen.

269
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,314
- Maybe it's for the best.
- Yeah, exactly.

270
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,669
We get another month of just the two of us.

271
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,314
We have to learn to appreciate those.

272
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,319
Yeah.

273
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,359
Well, it's definitely an improvement.

274
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,750
Yet there's still something unsatisfying
about these.

275
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,995
Does anyone know what it is?

276
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,479
They're technically good.

277
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,875
It's just that they're...

278
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,595
- finite.
- Elise, that is a beautiful way to put it.

279
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,919
They show us something, but they
don't leave us with anything to ponder.

280
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,430
All except...this one.

281
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,708
Claire, what do you think
this photograph is saying?

282
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,478
It's about being half-hidden,
what it means to come out of the shadows.

283
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,875
The woman in the photograph looks at us
like she wants us to come closer.

284
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,392
But we don't. She teases us,
almost like she's daring us.

285
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,477
But what is the dare? Ls it to touch her?

286
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,040
She looks like she knows we're scared.

287
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,958
But what's so scary
about this beautiful woman?

288
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,470
What's so scary about
getting close to someone?

289
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,070
Because we don't quite know the answer
to any of these questions,

290
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,236
the photo haunts us.

291
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,836
Nice work, Claire.

292
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,671
Does anyone else have any comments?

293
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,429
- Yeah. I'm really pissed off.
- Why is that?

294
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,199
Claire takes an erotic picture
of her girlfriend

295
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,949
and she gets an A
just because you're a lesbian. This sucks.

296
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,992
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Give me a break.

297
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,272
- Anita, tell her she's just my friend.
- She's not Claire's girlfriend.

298
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,276
That I know of.

299
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,911
Why isn't she answering?

300
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,911
I don't think there's anyone here.

301
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,951
I suppose you're right.

302
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,593
- Oh, my God.
- Sarah!

303
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,719
Honey?

304
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,959
Oh, for God's sake, Fisher!

305
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,433
I tell the children
to make the ugliest monster

306
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,516
and then we put their pictures on them.

307
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,233
They are sort of ugly.

308
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,068
- This one is really hideous.
- That's mine!

309
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,039
It's wonderful that you've become a teacher.

310
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,277
I'm just the crazy art lady
who comes in a few afternoons a week.

311
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,199
I don't have any actual certification
so the pay is pretty terrible.

312
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,834
Yes, but the last time I saw you...

313
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,790
I'm glad you've put your life together.

314
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,718
Wow, I had no idea.

315
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,551
George has just told me the entire history
of papier-mâchê. It was fascinating.

316
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,153
- May I use your bathroom?
- Let me show you where it is.

317
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,113
So I left five fucking messages for you
after I came back into town.

318
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,118
- Why haven't you called me?
- I don't know.

319
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,752
- You look funny.
- I was dehydrated earlier.

320
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,998
Now that I have you back, I won't let you go.
You have to stay for dinner.

321
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,875
I have a million questions for you.
You must have a million for me.

322
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,273
I've been having this funny feeling lately

323
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,834
so this morning I decided to follow him.

324
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,077
Fucking bastard!
I told you he'd do this to you one day.

325
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,396
Maybe there's a logical explanation.
Maybe he...

326
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,470
- Oh, my God.
- <i>What is it? What's going on?</i>

327
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,556
Rico's charity has a double D.

328
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,591
I will cut his balls off!

329
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,031
I need you take the boys tonight.

330
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,389
I need the house to be empty
when I talk to him.

331
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,919
I'll be here for hours.

332
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,511
This shit show's been on forever
and none of the regulars give a fuck.

333
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,518
- <i>I could come by tomorrow and get them</i>.
- Fine.

334
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,358
<i>Are you gonna be OK tonight?</i>

335
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,391
Don't worry about me.

336
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,277
<i>What if there is a handsome prince?</i>

337
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,359
- She's really pretty.
- <i>And he's a really good kisser</i>.

338
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,597
She's gorgeous, but in a really subtle way.

339
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,477
- What do you think?
- I don't know what makes a girl pretty.

340
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,317
I don't look at girls that way.

341
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,920
<i>From the producer</i>
<i>who brought you The Vanishing</i>...

342
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,158
When you were little, you went on and on
about how beautiful Jennifer Aniston was.

343
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,796
I was parroting what the culture
was telling me to think. I was 11.

344
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,116
- <i>Do you love me?</i>
- <i>Yes</i>.

345
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,549
<i>Then I have everything I need</i>.

346
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,159
<i>If you make a noise, I'll shoot</i>...<i>I'll shoot</i>...

347
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,509
If you even breathe,
I'll shoot you in the spine.

348
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,991
I have to get out of here.

349
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,231
- What's going on?
- I forgot.

350
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,592
Something I have to do at work
with the tumour lady.

351
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,677
You give Claire a ride home, OK?

352
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,918
<i>Do you have any idea what's it's like</i>
<i>to see your life fall apart?</i>

353
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,833
I'm just nervous.
It's Maya's first night with the new sitter.

354
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,397
She seems like a nice girl.

355
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,190
I used to baby-sit when I was a kid.

356
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,196
I hope you hid all your private papers.

357
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,993
You used to snoop around
people's private things?

358
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,999
All the time.
You wouldn't believe the stuff I found.

359
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,670
- Why do ugly people have dirty photos?
- I don't know.

360
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,794
One time, this widow brought in
the grossest photo of her husband

361
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,434
to help with the embalming.

362
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,234
- He was... You want me to describe him?
- Please don't.

363
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,598
- So how is it being back at work?
- It's the same old same old.

364
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,511
I'm trying not to let it get me down.

365
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,791
Right now,
I'm concentrating on having fun.

366
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,833
Really? What kind of things
do you like to do?

367
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,436
I woke up and the bastard was gone.

368
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,439
Stole $5,000 from me
and some Tiffany lamps.

369
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,838
- But I'd always hated those, anyway.
- You must have been so depressed.

370
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,757
This one? Are you kidding?

371
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,792
We went to Taos that night
and stayed a week.

372
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,594
Had a blast.
Julia Roberts and her husband live there.

373
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,633
We chased them around town
like they were wild boars!

374
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,389
- How were you able to do that?
- The only way you can show everybody

375
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,396
is to have the time of your life.

376
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,035
George, let's hear all about you.
You seem interesting.

377
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,278
Yeah. Ruth tells me you had a son
sending you boxes of shit.

378
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,072
- Bettina!
- What?

379
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,112
Like my daughter hasn't done worse to me?

380
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,630
Come on, you want to compare war stories?

381
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,671
Actually, no, I don't.

382
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,720
Do you have a TV?
There's a documentary on PBS

383
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,479
I wouldn't mind watching a few minutes of.

384
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,190
Oh, sure.

385
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,915
There's one in the other room
under that mess in the corner.

386
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,156
Having a hard night?

387
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,109
No, I just...saw some bad coming attractions.

388
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,278
That's a new one. So what can I get for you?

389
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,471
- Vodka gimlet.
- Really?

390
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,433
Yeah, my father used to drink them
when he wanted something strong.

391
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,356
Vodka gimlet coming up.

392
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,399
- Let's kick the shit out of him.
- No, let's kill him.

393
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,510
We could just hide in his car.

394
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,357
You want this?

395
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,712
The kitchen made an extra order
by mistake.

396
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,878
- You don't eat that many fried foods.
- No, not so many.

397
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,993
And spend a little too much on clothes,
I notice too.

398
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,031
Maybe a bit.

399
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,071
And you shave well.

400
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,112
None of the other guys
shave as well as you.

401
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,717
Fuck! I'm gonna fucking kill Javier.

402
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,752
Why didn't you tell me you were gay, bitch?

403
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,838
Calm down, they're the ones who told me.

404
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,519
Javier's got one big blabbermouth.

405
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,154
I think it's because he's got a crush on you.

406
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,590
Come on, he's married.
Javier's straight, isn't he?

407
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,996
Neil, I met on match.com.

408
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,031
The teacher I met on Salon.

409
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,591
Are these internet sites safe?
Do they screen these men?

410
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,959
Course not, thank God.

411
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,276
If there was screening,
none of us would make it through!

412
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,359
I remember I really liked
"Looking for Mr Goodbar" when it came out.

413
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,471
So is he never coming in to dinner?

414
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,634
George gets very caught up sometimes.
He's a very focused person.

415
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,798
It's a show about the Elgin Marbles.
How caught up can he be?

416
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,198
Tell me about the one you're seeing now.

417
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,231
His name is Bernie,

418
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,149
he's a freelance editor and he has a cat.
He's nice.

419
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,909
- He's a loser.
- Stop that. He's someone to do things with.

420
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,272
If all you can say is that
he's someone to do things with,

421
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,311
that's worse than being alone.

422
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,079
Well, I like him, so shut up.

423
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,788
I suppose we should be getting home.

424
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,831
George drives slowly at night

425
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,793
and he doesn't like me to talk
so he can concentrate.

426
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,756
You could stay here. The bed's pretty bad

427
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,916
and the guest room has a strange smell...

428
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,351
- We'll take it.
- You can have some more wine, then.

429
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,951
Then, bam, the lady was dead
because she let the tumour get so big.

430
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,639
- You listening?
- Course I'm listening.

431
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,468
"Bam, the lady was dead
because she let the tumour get so big."

432
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,116
Can you imagine? Something horrible
just growing inside of you?

433
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,438
Something terrible
just eating away at your insides?

434
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,313
Yes, actually, I can.

435
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,680
Oh, my God, this is so dirty!

436
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,194
What with your roommates and Maya,
I just figured...

437
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,674
I'm sure they clean it once in a while.

438
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,429
No, I meant this.

439
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,471
This is so dirty.

440
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,593
- I'll take one more for the road.
- Sorry, buddy, we're closing.

441
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,078
Shit.

442
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,511
I can't do this.

443
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,278
What happened?
You were, like, in heat before.

444
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,675
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

445
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,117
God, why do I always pick the crazies?

446
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,030
She's in a better mood.

447
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,799
Yeah, no gay clubs tonight.

448
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,469
Someone called for you on the stage phone
when you was in the can.

449
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,355
"Higwood Jablome"?

450
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,633
- I don't know a Higwood Jablome.
- That doesn't sound right. Look at it again.

451
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,717
"Higwood Jablome." Don't know him.

452
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,829
No, that's not a G, that's a Y.

453
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,235
And that's an E, not an I.

454
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,271
Oh, Heywood.

455
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,873
I don't know a Heywood Jablome either.

456
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,593
That's not how he said... Let me see.

457
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,395
- J-A-B-I-O-M-E. Ja-blow-me.
- I don't know this person.

458
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,353
- Say his name right. Maybe you do.
- OK, OK. Heywood Jablome.

459
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,391
Heywood Jablome.

460
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,037
- What's so funny?
- Say it again.

461
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,117
- Heywood Jablome!
- Sure, I'll blow you, K.

462
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,589
She seems sweet.
You two would make a lovely couple.

463
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,557
Well, she's just somebody to have fun with.

464
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,795
We don't have that much of a connection.

465
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,358
Cos you won't let there be one.

466
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,358
Nate, make a connection with her.

467
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,392
Nah, she's not ready to settle down.

468
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,272
Now, you, you were ready to settle down.

469
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,117
I'll say.

470
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,915
But I think you two could get together
and have a beautiful life.

471
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,277
You can have the life with her
you didn't give me.

472
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,312
- I gave you everything I had, Lis.
- Right.

473
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,358
Here's my advice to you.

474
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,836
Stop with the cheap motels,
stop sleeping with the crazy ex.

475
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,668
Try to have a real relationship with this one.
What's stopping you?

476
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,152
- The pain.
- What's that supposed to mean?

477
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,551
I can't ever again go through the pain
of starting a life with someone

478
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,070
- only to have it taken away from me.
- Please.

479
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,317
- That hurt.
- Life is pain. Get used to it.

480
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,195
- All right, so I guess that's it.
- Here we are.

481
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,191
Claire, what's going on here?

482
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,671
I don't know.

483
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,759
I mean, I feel like maybe you're into me,
but you're just confused, right?

484
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,119
Because I could be into you
if I knew you were into me, you know?

485
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,033
So I'll need you to say it.

486
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,311
I can't say it.

487
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,274
OK, look, this is what I know.

488
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,709
It's, like, you really inspire me.

489
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,274
I want to be with you all the time.

490
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,551
I feel like you're this really special person

491
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,672
who makes me feel like I am more special.

492
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,793
- OK, that sounded really stupid.
- No, it didn't.

493
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,311
This... I'm sorry.

494
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,390
- Hi.
- <i>Hey, soldier. Just checking in</i>.

495
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,749
Bren, can we have an honest conversation?

496
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,438
Oh, fuck.

497
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,040
<i>I'm sorry, one of us has to wake up here</i>.

498
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,231
It isn't good for you. It's not good for me.

499
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,478
It's keeping us
from really having anything good.

500
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,353
You know what? We deserve to be happy.

501
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,710
<i>From everything you say,</i>
<i>Joe seems like a good guy</i>.

502
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,150
<i>A little weird, but so are you</i>.

503
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,111
<i>Give him a chance</i>.
<i>Go be with him, really be with him</i>.

504
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,118
<i>Give yourself a chance to be happy</i>.

505
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,197
- What if it's too late?
- It doesn't have to be.

506
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,472
Tell him the truth. What we've been doing.
See where that goes.

507
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,076
That didn't work so well
when I told you the truth.

508
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,112
Maybe he's more mature than I was then.

509
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,230
Hold on a sec.

510
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,478
- Why aren't you watching the funeral?
- These things run themselves.

511
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,835
Where's David?
Now he doesn't even clean?

512
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,873
He wasn't feeling well this morning.
I told him to stay at home.

513
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,831
I'm working. I should go.

514
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,992
- Good luck.
- OK. Bye.

515
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,719
George seems nice, Ruth.
He reminds me of someone.

516
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,909
- Nathaniel.
- You must be joking. They're so different.

517
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,078
George is so academic
and Nathaniel was so...Nathaniel.

518
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,918
That jovial nature masking something else.

519
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,872
- Oh, that.
- Intense privateness,

520
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,876
that need to withdraw.

521
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,275
Maybe it's true what they say.

522
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,517
We all pick the same person
over and over again.

523
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,316
There's something nice about that.

524
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,756
Hey, let's move it.

525
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,030
Get a move on or we're gonna be late.

526
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,469
OK, great.

527
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,719
We feed breakfast burritos to the homeless.

528
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,799
Breakfast burritos on top of everything else?
Oh, my goodness.

529
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,719
The teaching, the dating,
chasing Julia Roberts like a wild boar.

530
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,671
How do you do it?

531
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,472
Ruth...

532
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,552
maybe you want to be
getting out a little more.

533
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,516
It's so much harder to do things
when you're married.

534
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,073
I hear you.

535
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,510
It's not like I've been able to have
a long-term relationship

536
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,189
and not subsume myself. I wonder why.

537
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,039
Mom.

538
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,471
Maybe that's our legacy.

539
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,229
But maybe it doesn't have to be.

540
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,951
- Hey.
- Hey.

541
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,790
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

542
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,830
It's just this sad story about this man
whose wife left him

543
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,077
because he couldn't control his eating.

544
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,591
Nothing the therapist or anybody did
could get him to stop eating

545
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,350
so she left him
and he had a heart attack and died.

546
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,108
Is this your way of telling me
that I need to cut down on my snacks?

547
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,791
I've done something bad.

548
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,909
I think I've been...

549
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,795
really, really scared
about my feelings for you

550
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,755
and it's caused me to act out

551
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,395
in old and familiar patterns.

552
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,396
Say it.

553
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,591
I slept with someone...

554
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,591
a few times.

555
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,831
This is my problem

556
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,190
that I am obviously
continuing to struggle with.

557
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,671
It's not you.

558
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,548
What are you thinking?
I need to know what you're thinking.

559
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,751
I'm thinking...

560
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,037
I am so fucked.

561
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,230
I never liked anyone as much as you

562
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,751
and I'm never going to like anyone
as much again, so...

563
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,793
that's it, it's over

564
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,831
and this sucks.

565
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,871
It doesn't have to be over.

566
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,515
It could be like...a new beginning.

567
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,551
Do I know this person?

568
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,514
No.

569
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,753
So what do you think of it...

570
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,995
being, like, a beginning?

571
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,631
Not much.

572
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,428
- What do you think it all means?
- <i>OK</i>.

573
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,597
Heywood Jablome.

574
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,359
Heywood Jablome. This is a tough one.

575
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,870
The obvious answer
is that he wanted to blow me.

576
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,319
<i>Sure</i>.

577
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,356
Freud would say that on some level

578
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,119
he wanted to blow me
whether he knows it or not.

579
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,154
I don't recall Freud's position on the
"Heywood Jablome" phoney message.

580
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,909
<i>How do I know if he's conscious of wanting</i>
<i>to blow me or not?</i>

581
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,235
<i>That is the question</i>.

582
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,192
It is and it is an important one.

583
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,836
I don't know, I guess I could
make some sort of pass at him.

584
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,228
What do you think I should do?

585
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,675
<i>Are you still there?</i>

586
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,029
- I don't want to do this any more.
- What?

587
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,117
<i>Us. This. Having sex with other people</i>.

588
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,835
We said if one of us was uncomfortable,

589
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,440
we could stop doing it.
I want us to stop doing it.

590
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,471
I don't remember that rule.

591
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,791
What's going on?

592
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,911
Oh, Keith, why did this happen to me?

593
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,234
What did I do
to deserve to have this happen to me?

594
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,669
- Nothing.
- <i>Oh, God</i>.

595
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,072
Let it out. I'm here.

596
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,791
<i>You're gonna be OK</i>.

597
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,597
<i>I'm here</i>.

598
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,868
- Where are the kids?
- Rico, I know everything.

599
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,877
About this woman.

600
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,193
About how often you call her,
about what you bought her!

601
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,231
I've done nothing wrong.

602
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,919
- I know you're sleeping with this person.
- I'm not sleeping with her!

603
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,349
I told you, I'm just helping Sophia.

604
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,874
Oh, my God.
I don't want this to be happening.

605
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,480
- But nothing is happening, nothing...
- Bullshit!

606
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,671
Bullshit! Bullshit! I saw her!

607
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,836
I sat outside that house!

608
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,874
I saw her face when she opened
whatever the fuck it is you left for her!

609
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,354
She loves you!

610
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,311
She doesn't.

611
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,192
Oh, my God.
You gotta get the fuck out of here.

612
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,835
- No, no!
- Yes, get the fuck out of this house.

613
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,839
Please, Vanessa, just try to understand this.

614
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,476
I do understand this. I understand it
a whole lot better than you do.

615
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,349
Edie, what are you doing here?

616
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,676
Claire, I just... I couldn't be away from you.

617
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,156
I have to be with you. I really need you.

618
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,997
- You left your wallet in my car.
- Oh, my God, thank you.

619
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,158
I thought I lost it this morning.

620
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,590
You know, maybe on some unconscious level,
you left it because...

621
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,949
OK, fine, I give up.

622
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,193
Let's just sleep together.

623
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,434
Now?

624
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,795
In a sec. I need to brush my teeth.

625
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,715
Last night,
it seemed like this isn't what you want.

626
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,557
It isn't.

627
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,036
- Come on, get undressed. Let's go.
- I don't understand what's changed.

628
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,798
Hold on.

629
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,311
Nothing has changed.

630
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,511
Part of me thinks this is what I want
and part of me thinks it isn't, but...

631
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,394
what if the part of me who thinks it isn't
is just scared?

632
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,756
And, after all, I do owe you one.

633
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,029
All right, you're on.

634
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,351
- Go away.
- Just let me talk to you for a few minutes.

635
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,595
- Please just let me in.
- Why?

636
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,919
Please.

637
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,311
Oh, I fell down!

638
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,795
You know what?
Maybe you and me and Maile

639
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,831
will do something fun this Saturday.

640
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,713
What do you think of that? Oh, I fell down!

641
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,231
Huh? She has two dogs.
You love doggies, right? Hello!

642
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,352
Oh, man, I can't wait till you start talking.

643
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,517
What the hell are you doing?

644
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,838
Calling Maile. I'm doing what you said.
Trying to start a relationship.

645
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,078
With that girl? Are you crazy?
That'll never turn into anything serious.

646
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,634
- But you told me...
- I was desperate.

647
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,478
I am so scared
that you're gonna go back to Brenda

648
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,670
that I'll do or say anything to stop it.

649
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,473
If you have a relationship with Brenda,
I'll really be dead.

650
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,672
Brenda's just sleeping with me
because she really loves Joe.

651
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,872
- That's what she does.
- No, it's different this time.

652
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,592
You love her and she loves you

653
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,313
and you should be with her
before it's too late.

654
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,991
This is giving me a bad feeling.

655
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,192
If I were you, I'd check that out.
It might be a tumour.

656
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,749
English
