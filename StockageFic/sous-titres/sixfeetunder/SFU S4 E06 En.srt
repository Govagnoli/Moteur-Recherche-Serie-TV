1
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,275
All right, let's go.

2
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,474
<i>Hi, no one's here right now. Please leave</i>
<i>a message and we'll get back to you</i>.

3
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,670
<i>Hey, hon. Oh, my God, we've been circling</i>
<i>LAX for about an hour and a half</i>.

4
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
<i>I'm so sorry I asked you to stay up</i>.

5
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,916
<i>So I'll be home, I don't know,</i>
<i>in probably about 45 minutes or so</i>.

6
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,918
<i>OK, see you soon. Bye</i>.

7
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,278
- What are you doing?
- I can't go to work like this.

8
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,154
- The bereaved will freak out.
- You can take more time off.

9
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,558
Four days of daytime TV is my limit. If I see
another weight loss triumph, I'll kill myself.

10
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,037
- We can go out to the beach.
- I can't. Rico's totally overwhelmed.

11
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,548
He dealt with the Thornton family nightmare.

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,478
- The what?
- The family of the body I lost.

13
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,832
- You didn't lose it.
- Well, horribly misplaced then.

14
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,350
For several days
in the wasteland of Echo Park.

15
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,996
I talked to Mitchell. He said the prints
off the van didn't bring up a match.

16
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,349
- So he doesn't have a record?
- I guess not.

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,392
I thought there
might be a camera at the ATM....

18
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,479
Keith, I think I'd like
to not talk about this any more.

19
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,359
- OK.
- I appreciate that you want to help.

20
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,315
It's enough that you came home for
a few days. You don't have to solve the case.

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,669
Maybe we should call off your birthday party.

22
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,111
- My mother's been planning for weeks.
- So your family has to understand.

23
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,152
- I don't want make a big deal...
- Pretending it was a robbery...

24
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,398
- I just don't want to upset everyone.
- You should tell your family.

25
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,431
Would you tell yours?

26
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,959
Look, I just want everything
to go on as planned.

27
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,030
OK, here we go.

28
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,868
- So I got Cassidy for tomorrow night.
- What's tomorrow night?

29
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,234
- David's birthday dinner or did they cancel it?
- Shit, I completely forgot. With everything...

30
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,559
It's OK, I got Cassidy. Julio's not in love
with her, but at least she doesn't smoke.

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,958
- Unless you think it doesn't matter if I go.
- You don't have to go if you don't want to.

32
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,234
Not if you want me to go.

33
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,714
Maybe for David, you know.

34
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,190
- Yeah, OK. Come here, baby.
- It'll be nice for us to do things together.

35
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,119
Oh, yeah, it's a real romantic evening -
dinner at the Fishers'.

36
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,911
Come on, Julio, let's go.

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,672
What's happening here with you?

38
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,633
Look at Garbo. She usually hates men.

39
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,309
So, food co-op, funeral home.

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,830
- Nothing with animals at all?
- Yeah. No.

41
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,318
- But they're all related in a way, you know?
- No.

42
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,349
Well, people in grief,

43
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,595
you know, they're a lot like dogs

44
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,679
in that you just have to be with them
in a totally instinctive way.

45
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,759
I never hired anyone with no dog experience.
How many you got at home?

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,396
I had one when I was a kid.
It was a terrier, but he died suddenly.

47
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,194
Mom got so upset
that she never let us get another one.

48
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,711
I learn fast. Why don't you give me a trial run?
What do you say?

49
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,958
- Thing is, hon, this job doesn't pay much.
- Well, I don't need much.

50
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,157
I can't stand to be around people
in pain any more.

51
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,228
Every time I walked by this place, it just...
it just always looked like life.

52
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,560
- Here's Maile.
- Thistle, Thistle. Speak, speak. Good boy.

53
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,556
Good boy.

54
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,714
- What?
- Just the slow murder of the middle class.

55
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,837
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,675
Are you sure you don't want
some tuna salad, dear?

57
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,111
- I just woke up.
- Japanese eat fish for breakfast every day.

58
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,717
Great.

59
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,355
So what's the dress code for this evening?

60
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,316
- Well, you know, academic cocktail attire.
- I don't know, dear. That's why I'm asking.

61
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,432
I'm going straight from the office
and I'm wearing this.

62
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,155
With which jacket?

63
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,839
- My brown blazer.
- But no tie?

64
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,916
That's right. This with a blazer.

65
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,396
- Morning.
- Morning.

66
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,589
- Good, there's coffee. Is this fresh?
- Yeah, I just made it. How are you?

67
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,511
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm OK.

68
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,518
- Are you feeling tired, dear?
- I'm fine, Mom.

69
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,155
- Like some lunch?
- No, thank you, I had a late breakfast.

70
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,988
- Your bruises look much better.
- Yes, because I'm fine.

71
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,915
Have they found the carjacker?

72
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,157
Since yesterday? No.
I'll let you know if they do, OK?

73
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,069
I was just wondering, if this person had a gun,
you didn't try to argue with him, did you?

74
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,111
No, Mom, I didn't try to argue.

75
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,358
If all he wanted was the van and
you let him have it, why would he hurt you?

76
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,628
I don't know. It all happened very fast.

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,708
Why, with so many fancy cars in this city,
would someone want that stinky old van?

78
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,958
- Are you finding a way to make this my fault?
- No, no. I am so sorry.

79
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,595
It's just...none of it makes any sense.

80
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,390
Sometimes bad things just happen
and it doesn't make sense.

81
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,195
But at least, you know,
I'm OK and it's over now.

82
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,037
All right?

83
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,355
- How's the scoring session?
- Brutal.

84
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,598
It's a medieval fantasy epic so I had
to blast out this inane heroic theme music

85
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,110
every time the good prince walked in.

86
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,628
- Five billion times.
- Here.

87
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,953
Thank you.

88
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,597
- I found us a house.
- A house?

89
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,633
I walked by this place.
I was gonna call you, but the guy had to go.

90
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,229
- I made an appointment for us tomorrow.
- OK.

91
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,397
It's extremely perfect. I think.

92
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,035
And big. And it's affordable.

93
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,755
Kind of. You know, I think.

94
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,879
- And this would be for, like, now?
- Yeah, first of the month.

95
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,952
- We'll need a place to put the kid.
- If there is one.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,198
I won't want to walk across the courtyard
when I have to change a diaper.

97
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,358
Are you ready for all this?

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,994
Yeah. Are you?

99
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,639
Yeah.

100
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,510
You don't think
we're just talking out of our eggs?

101
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,758
I'm not talking out of my eggs.
I'm talking out of my basket.

102
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,679
Did you want us to include
the cause of death in the obituary?

103
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,272
No, thank you.
Just say he passed away suddenly, please.

104
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,232
And did you want us to contact a clergy person
for the service?

105
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,432
- We already went over this.
- We did?

106
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,711
- We're atheists.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,550
- If I wasn't before, I sure as hell would be now.
- Of course.

108
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,554
- I polished his shoes.
- Thanks.

109
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,591
Hey, what happened to this guy?

110
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,430
She didn't want to say. Must've been a suicide.
Do you have his certificate? I can't find it.

111
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,473
I'm sure it's in the office.
Man, he must've been pretty desperate.

112
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,318
What an awful thing to do to your wife.

113
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,280
Hey, I've got to make a quick phone call.
Could you sew him up for me?

114
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,915
I'm gonna just go out here.
It's better reception.

115
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,795
<i>Hi, please leave a message</i>.

116
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,392
Hey.

117
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,431
Hey, it's me.

118
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,878
Listen, I can't do dinner tomorrow night.
I have to work.

119
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,311
But I'll call you later and we'll figure
something out, OK? OK, bye-bye.

120
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,632
Do you need some hangers?
My mom's got 6,000 under her bed.

121
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,070
No, that's okay.
I don't have anything nice enough to hang.

122
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,918
It should only be for a few days, hopefully.

123
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,509
Hot dress. Glad we're the same size.

124
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,994
I can't believe that cunt
changed the locks on me.

125
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,077
She really didn't want you
playing with her turtles!

126
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
This is the last one.

127
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,393
Thanks.

128
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,599
These are great. Totally apocalyptic.

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,990
Yeah, they're better than
my stupid self-portraits.

130
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,838
But I still feel like they're, I don't know...

131
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,319
pointless?

132
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,309
All these real horrible things happen
in the world every day

133
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,830
that have so much more impact than art does.

134
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,997
Like my brother getting beaten up
by some random asshole.

135
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,033
- It's horrible.
- But even if some old lady spits at you,

136
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,389
it seriously affects your outlook on things.

137
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,830
- Did an old lady spit at you?
- No.

138
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,872
I mean, yes, actually, but it doesn't matter.

139
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,833
But that's what's so great about what you do
or Aleksandra Mir's work.

140
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,431
It happens to people. It's not just some image
hanging on a wall doing nothing.

141
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,319
I think these images are doing something.

142
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,352
Is this because Carolyn reamed you out
for being vacant?

143
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,392
No, I want to make work that does something.

144
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,793
- We should make something together.
- Like what?

145
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,231
Like some kind of mixed media thing
in some space people have to be in.

146
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,714
- Like an elevator?
- Bigger.

147
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,356
Like a mall or something. We'd invite artists
who make totally different kinds of work.

148
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,109
- We'd do things while people walked around.
- To make it unavoidable.

149
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,720
- Yeah.
- I totally love that.

150
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,192
Hey, Rich.

151
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,511
Oh, good.

152
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,755
George, hello!

153
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,349
Ruth, this is the famous Dean Kekalos.
Howard, this is my wife.

154
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,550
The famous Ruth Sibley. Hello.

155
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,398
- Pleasure to meet you.
- No, the pleasure is mine.

156
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,796
We're grateful for the calming influence
you've had on George.

157
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,912
No, he's been the calming influence on me.

158
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,350
- Well, good for you. Good for you.
- Hey, Seamus.

159
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,913
Hey, Sibley, how are you?

160
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,033
Thank you so much for the geode nut dishes.
We just love them.

161
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,674
Terrific, terrific.

162
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,277
We'd been dating for six months, he calls me
from his car and starts saying something like,

163
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,108
"Maybe we should be seeing other pe..."
and he loses cell reception.

164
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,948
- Oh, my God.
- That was the last time I ever spoke to him.

165
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,278
- Did you call him?
- Yes. And I sent him several emails. Nothing.

166
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,154
"Maybe we should see other pe..."
The parting words of George Sibley.

167
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,398
He's a raccoon. He pulled the same move
on Delia in the Classics Department.

168
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,274
- He was sweet while we were dating.
- He probably met someone else.

169
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,917
When I heard he'd gotten married, I stopped
waiting for him to come out of the canyon.

170
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,914
- How many?
- Five. I had to do "Are you my mother?" twice.

171
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,155
How much sugar did you give him?

172
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,397
They pumped him up with Popsicles
over at Sammy's.

173
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,878
You have to work tomorrow night? After I killed
myself to get Cassidy, I had to cancel her.

174
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,192
Didn't you say you have
to work tomorrow night now? On the machine?

175
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,029
Oh, no, that was wrong.

176
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,230
I made a mistake.

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,193
David told me that and then changed it again.

178
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,277
What happened? Someone came back to life?

179
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,676
Man, they just kept changing the viewing time.

180
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,757
They kept changing their minds back and forth,
these people.

181
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,113
The mother wanted one thing, the wife another.
Calling all day, changing the casket.

182
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,119
- So I shouldn't have cancelled Cassidy?
- Can you get her back?

183
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,395
I hope so.

184
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,274
- Hear him going on about global warming?
- No.

185
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,108
He was making the point
that we don't have enough oil left in the earth

186
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,470
to generate the emissions
to create a greenhouse effect.

187
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,196
- Was one of your ex-girlfriends at the party?
- I don't think so.

188
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,438
A very thin woman
with a mysteriously international accent.

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,269
I did date a lady from
the Archaeology Department some time ago.

190
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,709
And how did it end?

191
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,228
Gosh, I don't really remember.

192
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,989
Did you lose cell phone reception
and never call her back?

193
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,077
- Did somebody tell you that?
- Did you?

194
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,317
I have no idea. It was a long time ago.

195
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,351
It couldn't have been that long.

196
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,988
As I recall, we just drifted apart.

197
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,031
That's not how she recalls it.

198
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,158
- Did you talk to her?
- I happened to overhear a conversation.

199
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,356
That's not the best way to get information,
now, is it?

200
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,078
In any case, the greenhouse effect
will definitely come to pass

201
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,069
if we start to burn coal
as oil supplies dwindle over the next 20 years.

202
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,752
But I don't think even we could be that stupid.

203
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,919
Hey.

204
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,832
Hey.

205
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,791
How are you doing?

206
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,717
Fine.

207
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,672
- How are you?
- OK.

208
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,109
This helps the bruises.

209
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,355
It's homeopathic, but it works.

210
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,839
Thanks.

211
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,077
I used it when I got the shit kicked out of me.

212
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,555
Stay. Stay.

213
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,751
Stay. Stay.

214
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,390
OK, go find him, go find him! Go on, go on!

215
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,230
Good dogs! Good doggies!

216
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,478
- Did you time it?
- The winner is Shakti at six seconds!

217
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,712
Down.

218
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,269
- So do you want to be a trainer?
- No, not really. Do you?

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,993
I used to. I really want to be a vet.
I'm waiting to hear from UC Davis.

220
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,430
- I'm sure you'll get in.
- It's pretty competitive.

221
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,157
- Think about being a trainer. You're good.
- Thanks, but...

222
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,589
I'm just enjoying doing this right now.

223
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,438
Teri said you used to work at a funeral home.

224
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,191
- Yeah.
- Kinda depressing?

225
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,639
Kinda.

226
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,315
- Would Teri mind if I brought my little girl in?
- You have a little girl?

227
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,158
Yeah, she's two and a half.

228
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,317
I didn't know you were married.
You're not wearing a ring.

229
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,352
I'm not...married...

230
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,952
any more.

231
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,229
Hey, Boo, good dog!

232
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,919
Claire would take pictures of whoever was
there. I'd interact with whoever showed up.

233
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,115
Maybe have instruments around. Jimmy could
make those whale installations around people.

234
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,550
- And videotape it.
- What would I do? String beads in the corner?

235
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,591
People could do that with you.

236
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,395
- Yeah, but what are we saying with this?
- I want to do something confrontational.

237
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,635
I mean, the world is ending out there

238
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,390
and people are getting cosmetic surgery and
watching debutantes get screwed up the ass.

239
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,116
- That's what my work is totally about.
- Screwing debutantes up the ass?

240
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,109
American bloat, our compulsion to consume
food, energy, and the rest of the world

241
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,549
until we're so fat, we literally explode.

242
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,558
Oh, that's what your work is about.

243
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,031
- That works with your idea of doing it in a mall.
- Good luck getting a permit.

244
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,153
It's hard to be creative with that kind
of negative commentary, fuckhead.

245
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,713
- I brought some AMT.
- Thank you, Jesus.

246
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,513
- What's AMT?
- Alphamethyltryptamine.

247
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,949
It's like X but groovier.

248
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,675
- Let's do it.
- Now? It's two in the afternoon.

249
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,236
You have to do hard drugs during the day
so you can sleep off the harsh landing.

250
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,271
It seems kind of early.

251
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,318
Oh, my God, a dining area.

252
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,954
This is not an area. No, this is a room.

253
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,798
- We could entertain.
- We're going to entertain?

254
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,628
I've always wanted to be one of those people
who throws fabulous dinner parties

255
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,309
where everyone sits around
discussing the nature of reality.

256
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,558
- This is definitely the house for that.
- I will need a set of hostess pyjamas.

257
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,070
- I'll need a set of matching pots and pans.
- OK.

258
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,353
- Am I sounding like Lucy Van Pelt?
- Lucy Van who?

259
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,110
Peanuts character. She always talked about
getting pans when she married Schroeder.

260
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,278
- Was he the genius?
- Yeah. He was the musician.

261
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,949
And she was an aspiring psychoanalyst,
actually.

262
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,030
Do you know something, Schroeder?

263
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,791
I think the way that you play the piano is nice

264
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,038
What would you say if one day
you and I should get married?

265
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,071
Yay! That was lovely.

266
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,037
- I think we should get all new bedding.
- I have really nice sheets.

267
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,277
I was thinking, you know, new house, new bed.

268
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,356
You are such a little bride!

269
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,871
OK, we get new sheets.

270
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,275
Have you got a condom?

271
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,311
Do we need one?

272
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,390
I don't know. Do we?

273
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,477
What are we waiting for? New house, new life.

274
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,994
Like, how many evildoers do you have to kill
before you become one yourself, you know?

275
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,152
Totally.

276
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,952
Smooth.

277
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,991
I'm insanely thirsty.

278
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,232
- So do you think we did it?
- I don't know. We might have.

279
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,952
Really?

280
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,509
Yeah, it's definitely possible.

281
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,798
- Why are you making those beeping sounds?
- Sorry, I'm programming my new cellphone.

282
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,788
Well, that's the one good thing
about getting robbed, right?

283
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,638
It's a great excuse for getting a new gadget.

284
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,310
I hope it happens again
so I can get a new Palm Pilot.

285
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,477
I've always been too, I don't know,

286
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,193
intimidated or something to say this,

287
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,950
but I seriously think you're, like, a total genius.

288
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,871
No way, man. Let me tell you something.
You are a genius, OK?

289
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,914
I was fully humbled by your brass-knuckle
baby sculpture. That was amazing.

290
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,875
God, this is so incredible!
You guys gotta come take a shower with me!

291
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,156
It's so, like, soothing.

292
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,514
- Where's Claire?
- I'll call her.

293
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,159
So, Keith, what's Celeste like, man?

294
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,191
Oh, my God, that's right.

295
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,389
Even Julio's like...

296
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,750
- I heard she's kind of crazy in real life.
- No, she's just in a crazy situation.

297
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,873
- They must have you working round the clock.
- The hours can get long.

298
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,553
Travelling around will be better
than sitting in the car trying to stay awake.

299
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,478
- Which cities are on the tour?
- All of 'em, seems like.

300
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,948
- I'm really looking forward to Austin.
- Very vibrant university town.

301
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,993
Boulder's supposed to be beautiful.
Miami I really want to see.

302
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,352
- After being a cop, it must be like a vacation.
- Yeah, I may not be making the streets safer,

303
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,393
but I feel like Celeste really inspires people,
you know?

304
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,911
I mean, the audiences go home
just so high to be alive.

305
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,554
It's kinda cool to be part of that.

306
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,515
<i>Claire, I don't know</i>
<i>if you have friends over there,</i>

307
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,473
<i>but dinner's started</i>
<i>and you should really get over here</i>.

308
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,757
Fuck! My brother's birthday party is tonight.

309
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,034
- My hair.
- Sorry.

310
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,193
- Mom, this is delicious. What is it?
- It's a pumpkin mulligatawny.

311
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,279
- It's in honour of David's love of Indian food.
- You love Indian food?

312
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,312
- He did as a child.
- I did as a child.

313
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,750
Sorry. Sorry. We were making art.

314
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,950
So, Nate, how's the new job?

315
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,835
It's amazing. Awesome.

316
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,189
Really? Working at a kennel?

317
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,277
It's not a kennel, it's a canine retreat.

318
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,629
What's so great about it?

319
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,873
It makes me feel like I'm 25 again
and life is simple

320
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,754
and nothing horrible has ever happened to me.

321
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,669
The great thing is that the dogs seem to care
as much about me as I care about them.

322
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,518
Sounds nice.
Maybe I should go work with dogs.

323
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,394
Seriously, we should all go work with dogs.

324
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,829
I've always preferred cats.

325
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,919
Mom, you should totally get a cat.

326
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,558
Why do you deny yourself so much?

327
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,998
I always had children.

328
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,831
We should all just let ourselves have
what we want in life.

329
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,440
As long as we're not greedy imperialists.

330
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,639
I mean, it's your birthday
and you just had this awful thing happen.

331
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,831
You so deserve to be happy.

332
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,119
Thank you.

333
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,789
Claire, will you help me clear?

334
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,628
I'd love to, Mom,
but I can't have it be just the women who clear.

335
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,437
Now it's just the women and people of colour
who are clearing.

336
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,071
Thank you, Nate.

337
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,875
He really gets it.

338
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,439
Oh, I met your friend the other day. Sophie?

339
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,040
- Sophie?
- I think it was Sophie.

340
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,153
A very outgoing kind of a person.

341
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,478
- Sasha maybe. Where did you meet her?
- She stopped by to say hello to Federico.

342
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,351
- Stopped by here? A friend of mine?
- That's what he said, I think.

343
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,598
Maybe I misunderstood.

344
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,669
- This is beautiful.
- Keith, nice.

345
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,553
I noticed your old one got chipped
when you got...

346
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,555
That old one was ugly.
This is a seriously upscale accessory.

347
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,992
It is upscale. Thank you.

348
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,155
Mine isn't meaningful enough.

349
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,670
- I'm sure it's meaningful enough.
- No, I want to make it better.

350
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,109
I'll give it to you later.

351
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,709
- That one's from me.
- That was very nice of you.

352
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,789
- What did we get him?
- A tie.

353
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,157
A gravy boat.

354
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,315
- No, it's a neti pot.
- A neti pot?

355
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,512
It's an ancient Ayurvedic instrument
for cleansing the sinus passages.

356
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,628
May I see that?

357
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,956
You fill it with warm water and add some salt

358
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,197
and then pour it through the sinus, like so.

359
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,994
- That's OK, I get it.
- Keep you from getting sick.

360
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,989
I've used one every day for 30 years,
hardly had a cold in all that time.

361
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,350
Every day? I've never seen you do that.

362
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,669
I do it in the kitchen
when I get back from my morning walk.

363
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,439
- You do that in my kitchen?
- Over the sink.

364
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,836
- Where do you keep your nostril pot?
- Neti pot.

365
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,835
- On the top shelf of the cupboard.
- So I won't know about it.

366
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,718
- Where it's out of the way.
- You want it to be one of your nasty secrets!

367
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,955
Ruth, that's enough.

368
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,869
Claire?

369
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,075
Could you help me find something tart?

370
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,638
Yeah.

371
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,390
This is my friend Jimmy.
He's a really amazing artist.

372
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,590
Yes, I am.

373
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,359
Jimmy, you're not wearing any clothes.

374
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,758
Is David all right? He barely ate a thing.

375
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,799
Well, it's a shock,
any kind of incident that gets physical.

376
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,437
Those bruises. Why'd anyone hurt someone
who was doing what they were told to do?

377
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,270
I don't know, Ruth. There's a lot more
insanity in the world than people realise.

378
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,313
Sometimes I'm surprised
it's just not total mayhem out there.

379
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,959
30.

380
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,837
31...32.

381
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,468
It totally smells like sex in here.

382
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,954
You missed a great show.

383
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,514
Somebody had better wash my sheets.

384
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,473
- How was dinner?
- It was kind of amazing.

385
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,274
I feel like I really connected with my family.

386
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,118
- I wish you'd been there.
- I wish you'd been here.

387
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,156
All these guys want to do is lick each other
all night. I just want to go roll in the grass.

388
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,909
Let's go.
We have some really amazing grass outside.

389
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,432
Tonight? Lsn't there any way
I can catch up with y'all in Portland?

390
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,677
Replace me for the whole tour? That's cold.

391
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,277
I just don't know if I can make it in tonight, dog.

392
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,554
All right. OK.

393
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,592
Thanks.

394
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,317
- Dog?
- "We should all be working with dogs."

395
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,712
God, they were all in full form tonight.
The neti pot?

396
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,428
- So do you have to go back tonight?
- I told him I didn't think I could make it.

397
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,268
Keith, I'm OK.
If I needed you to stay, trust me, I'd tell you.

398
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,472
I don't trust that you would tell me.
Look at the show you put on for your family.

399
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,718
- I don't want you to lose your job.
- They'll just put me on somebody in LA.

400
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,354
- You don't know that.
- So what?

401
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,755
You're more important to me than a job.

402
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,311
I want my pool.

403
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,470
- Come on, be real with me on this.
- I am, I swear.

404
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,072
If you lost your job because of me, it would
make me feel so much worse. It really would.

405
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,557
Good night.

406
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,837
You're going to sleep?

407
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,270
Unless you have something
you want to talk about.

408
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,231
No.

409
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,510
I just have to brush my hair.

410
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,677
And you want me to just lie here
and watch you?

411
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,992
No.

412
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,035
That's really beautiful.

413
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,675
That's perfect.
Just put your face in the light a little more.

414
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,636
Just a little bit more to the left now.

415
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,353
OK, try not to look sexually objectified.

416
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,151
You sicko!

417
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,437
Come here.

418
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,675
- Wait.
- You have to feel this right now!

419
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,109
- Wait! OK.
- Come here.

420
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,515
Oh, my God,

421
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,551
this feels amazing.

422
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,073
- Can you believe nature just makes this?
- Nature doesn't make it, the landscapers do.

423
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,272
But nature came up with it
and it's just lying around all over the world

424
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,436
for people to roll around in.

425
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,075
- No one ever does.
- It's so fucking sad.

426
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,710
Did you ever play rolling pin
when you were a kid?

427
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,632
No.

428
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,874
Wow, you can't even see the wound.

429
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,639
- Where was he shot?
- Point blank in the head.

430
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,034
They had him tied up for hours,
then they shot him in the head.

431
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,957
Could they tell from the autopsy if he suffered?

432
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,237
- I haven't seen the autopsy.
- I thought you were in on all of that.

433
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,990
No, we're just...
We just take care of the funeral.

434
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,151
Excuse me.

435
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,831
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

436
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,348
- Hello?
- <i>What are you reporting?</i>

437
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,118
I can't breathe.

438
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,151
<i>Please hold for a paramedic</i>.

439
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,958
<i>Are you starting a new home</i>
<i>or just making a new start?</i>

440
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,393
<i>We've got everything you'll need to make</i>
<i>your home a haven of tranquillity and style</i>.

441
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,077
- <i>Do you have a history of heart problems?</i>
- No.

442
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,839
<i>Are you clammy, cold or sweaty?</i>

443
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,440
- Yes.
- <i>Do you have a history of panic attacks?</i>

444
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,869
No, is that... Could this be that?

445
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,913
<i>Sure, shortness of breath without skin</i>
<i>discoloration or heart pain. Absolutely</i>.

446
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,873
<i>Have you been under</i>
<i>any unusual stress lately?</i>

447
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,718
- Yes.
- <i>OK, sir, just stay calm and relaxed</i>.

448
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,799
- <i>We'll have someone there shortly</i>.
- No, I'm OK. I think I might be OK.

449
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,992
- <i>Sir, to be safe we should send</i>...
- No, thanks, I think I'm OK.

450
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,752
David?

451
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,397
I'm here.

452
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,438
You OK?

453
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,471
Yeah, I'm fine.

454
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,990
You don't look so great.

455
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,511
I had a panic attack.

456
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,354
I called 911 because I thought I was dying.
How humiliating is that?

457
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,190
I thought I was dying
when I woke up this morning.

458
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,753
What were you on last night?

459
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,191
I don't even know. Some X-like thing.

460
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,599
I guess it was really strong.

461
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,232
Yeah.

462
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,675
It's fucked up to get carjacked.

463
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,112
- It was more than that.
- Yeah, I can see that.

464
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,151
It was more than this.

465
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,671
What do you mean?

466
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,751
It went on for hours.

467
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,677
At first, I thought he just wanted money.

468
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,713
Well, no, at first I thought
he was just this cute boy in distress.

469
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,234
It's OK, I've fallen for, like,
50 cute boys in distress.

470
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,511
But then it was like...

471
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,592
I tried to do everything right,
but it just made him want to torture me more.

472
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,671
Torture you?

473
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,879
He poured gasoline on me.

474
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,309
And he put a gun in my mouth...

475
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,312
long enough for me to think,
"My life is over and I know nothing.

476
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,515
"I don't even know how to go."

477
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,035
My mind kept spinning, trying to grab
onto something, but nothing was enough,

478
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,038
Not even Keith or anyone.
Nothing was enough.

479
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,958
I forgot to pray. Can you believe that?
I totally forgot to pray.

480
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,391
That's OK.

481
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,353
God saved you anyway, right?

482
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,236
<i>I'm not going back</i>.

483
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,795
I can't.
I'll go insane if I have to come back to this.

484
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,276
I don't know what to say.
He doesn't even want me to tell you.

485
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,199
- Well, OK then, it's not that bad.
- It is that bad.

486
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,276
You think he can't work at all?

487
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,914
I think he seriously cannot deal.

488
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,471
Maybe we can hire somebody.

489
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,559
I'm not sure having some stranger come in
is going to be all that helpful.

490
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,195
It would've been nice
if Mom hadn't fucked our only intern.

491
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,915
I've finally got a life I can stand.

492
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,676
He would do it for you.

493
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,309
Are you available for chopping?

494
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,957
If you so wish.

495
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,468
If I so wish? What does that mean?

496
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,513
I'd appreciate it if you'd just ask me directly.
"Will you chop the cucumber?"

497
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,755
- I did ask you directly.
- No, you didn't.

498
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,989
You were making a point of my not helping you
with dinner instead of just asking me to help.

499
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,034
- You've been very mean to me all day.
- I have not been mean to you.

500
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,914
- I've been upset with you.
- What have I done to you?

501
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,918
You embarrassed me in front of your entire
family instead of confronting me directly.

502
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,909
I did confront you directly. You made it clear
you did not wish to be confronted directly.

503
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,557
That is completely untrue. I answered every
question you asked me, as I always do.

504
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,397
You pretended not to remember something
that happened less than a year ago.

505
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,432
You forget things that happened yesterday!

506
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,351
Look, Ruth...

507
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,749
the past is not important to me.

508
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,316
I just want to be here in the present with you.

509
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,195
Yes, but there was a time when you wanted to
be in the present with that woman at the party.

510
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,959
She had no idea you were going to leave her.

511
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,232
She went from being in the present to being
in the past without realising it.

512
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,398
- You are really starting to sound hysterical.
- What changed for you?

513
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,796
- With that woman or your first few wives.
- It doesn't matter.

514
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,718
It does. Why would you leave so many...

515
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,117
Because they asked
too many fucking questions, that's why!

516
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,356
A very outgoing girl named Sophie, she said.

517
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,549
Oh, Sophia. Yeah, she's a young mother
from church that I'm helping.

518
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,029
A young mother from church?

519
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,995
I told Father Deegan I wanted to do
charity work. He gave me this family to help.

520
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,031
You know, like a big brother thing.

521
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:02,473
- How come you never told me about this?
- It was just between me and the Father.

522
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,952
And this outgoing young mother,
what kind of help are you giving her?

523
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,552
Just, like, cans of food, old clothes,
and toys and stuff, like, from the Fishers.

524
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,797
You're giving her stuff from the Fishers,
but Ruth doesn't know?

525
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:29,439
No, no, she knows. She just doesn't know
that Sophia is the young mother in need.

526
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,357
I don't know why
you would keep charity a secret.

527
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,554
- It's the way you're supposed to do charity.
- Come on, you tell your wife.

528
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,949
Well, the truth is,

529
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,675
this is something I started doing
when you were...

530
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,598
you know, not that easy to tell things to.

531
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,072
When your own family needed you,
you started helping someone else?

532
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,590
Sometimes it makes your own problems
seem less bad

533
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,632
when you help someone
who's got it even worse.

534
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,999
Hey.

535
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,592
Hi.

536
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,515
What are you...

537
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,237
- What's up?
- I don't know.

538
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,237
Are you OK?

539
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,917
I don't know.

540
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,756
Maybe it's just who I am.

541
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,511
Do you want to sit down?

542
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,357
I don't think that I can change.

543
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,315
I can't become
this totally different person living this...

544
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,397
simple, happy little life.

545
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,033
Neither can I.

546
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,589
English
