1
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:17,884
...following Wall Street's sharp rebound...

2
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,362
and boosted by a renewed hope
in a government plan...

3
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:23,172
to lift the banking sector
out of its doldrums.

4
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,251
In currency trade...

5
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,611
-Hey.
-Hi.

6
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,048
Me and my buddy,
we just moved in next door.

7
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,488
We were wondering who lives here.

8
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,844
Nice to meet you.
I was just about to get in the shower.

9
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:43,887
Come on in, I'll be out in a moment.

10
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,922
Nice.

11
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,131
-She's hot.
-Yeah, you're telling me.

12
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,971
I thought I told you guys
to wait in the other room.

13
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,329
We thought you might
need some help getting clean.

14
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,926
This is so cool.

15
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:14,406
-Yeah, you like this, don't you?
-Oh, yeah.

16
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,812
Let's move over here.

17
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,888
You're a nasty girl, aren't you?

18
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,246
You guys are the best neighbors I ever had.

19
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,842
David.

20
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,091
You're all wet.

21
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,732
Were you crying?

22
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,492
No, it was raining.

23
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,010
And, yes, I was crying.

24
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:39,572
I love you.

25
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:29,009
We get just about all the minerals
and vitamins that bones need...

26
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:30,811
from things like sunshine.

27
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:34,125
Didn't I ask you to clean up after yourself?

28
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,731
Why did you ask for an omelet
if you weren't hungry?

29
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,407
I was, but now my tummy hurts.

30
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,885
Again? Girl, you better eat some breakfast.

31
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:47,286
Maybe I'm full.

32
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,724
Eat half of it and you can watch MTV...

33
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:53,327
or don't eat and go to school hungry,
it's your choice.

34
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,290
That's good, bribe her.

35
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,324
Did I ask for your input?

36
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,444
-I gotta go.
-Go.

37
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,809
Your car is blocking me in.

38
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,488
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,328
What's wrong with me?
I'm taking care of Taylor...

40
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,564
I don't know where her mother is,
I haven't slept in two months...

41
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:25,292
since I shot and killed that man.
I'm sick of your shit.

42
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:27,807
I'm sick and tired of you
taking it all out on me.

43
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,202
This is way more than I signed on for.

44
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,969
I've got an idea. Find what's yours,
and take it when you leave.

45
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,487
Then I'll never have to
look at your ass again.

46
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,212
I have a better idea. I'll go right now.

47
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:43,366
If you find any of my stuff,
you can shove it up your tight white ass.

48
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:48,368
Who the hell you think you're talking to?
I know you didn't call my ass white.

49
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:56,687
My tummy hurts.

50
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,129
The answer is no, I'm sorry.

51
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:09,486
It's not like it's some stranger.
It's your sister.

52
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:13,242
It's not like it's Kabul. It's Topanga,
it's not even an hour from here.

53
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,688
You heard what was done to Nate.

54
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:19,207
I don't think anything was done to him.

55
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,966
In case you haven't hung out
with any 15-year-old guys...

56
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,805
they're like total hornswogglers.

57
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,282
It was a much more innocent time.

58
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:27,772
What, the '80s?

59
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,889
Your brother
was a much more innocent boy...

60
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,964
to say nothing of what happened to David.

61
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:34,408
He hiked three miles
down the canyon in pitch dark...

62
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:35,972
to get away from those people.

63
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:39,045
He cut his ear on a bramble.
The answer is no.

64
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:43,846
Have you thought at all about scaffolding?

65
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:49,049
When your house is falling apart,
you build scaffolding...

66
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,328
to support you
while you are doing the work.

67
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,371
And I think a great way
to build scaffolding...

68
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:58,002
is to revisit old experiences
but try them a new way.

69
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,645
So I'm going out there after school today...

70
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,805
and spend the weekend
and be back on Sunday.

71
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,730
I haven't even told Justin yet.

72
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,567
He doesn't know his father's dead.

73
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:20,409
Jewish tradition says
we have to bury him tomorrow.

74
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:24,325
You have had Jewish funerals
here before, right?

75
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:26,728
Of course.

76
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:32,204
We decided not to do this in our temple
because of the way Jeffrey died.

77
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:39,127
Jess, if you want,
I can do this with Jeffrey's mother.

78
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,170
Fuck it, I can do it.

79
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,844
What do you need to know?

80
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:49,567
He killed himself for no reason...

81
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:53,451
while I was at goddamn Gymboree
with Tess.

82
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,526
Tess is four.

83
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:59,085
While I was with her, my husband,
Jeffrey Shapiro...

84
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,406
who worked for the third best law firm
in LA...

85
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:05,610
and was three months away
from making partner....

86
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,565
He came home...

87
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:11,887
on his lunch break and he hung himself...

88
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:16,205
with his pants around his ankles
in our goddamn sunroom.

89
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:22,322
There's your fucking eulogy.
Can you say that in Hebrew?

90
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,811
So you'll be conducting the service, Rabbi?

91
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:37,044
I love my new place.
You have to come see it.

92
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:40,492
It's a condo, but it's like a hotel, too.

93
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,962
It's got a concierge and a bidet.

94
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:46,807
Get me one of those jumbo beers
on the side as well.

95
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:49,282
-I'll share it with her.
-Get your own.

96
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:51,045
Make it two, thanks.

97
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,163
To living alone, finally.

98
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,368
To bidets.

99
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,411
And to starting over, with us, sweetheart.

100
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:09,251
I think I was under much more
emotional pressure than I ever realized.

101
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,843
And I'm actually so sorry
for those awful things I said to you.

102
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,252
Thank you.

103
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:18,604
Aren't you sorry for hitting me?

104
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,684
Yes, that was insane of me, but...

105
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:23,162
No buts, Brenda. Just be sorry.

106
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:27,247
I know it was probably my fault,
but I don't want to know why.

107
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:33,445
So, now the headline.

108
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,329
That whore has moved in with your father.

109
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,641
Dad's seeing a whore?

110
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,088
The Whore of Tranquility Spa, Brenda.

111
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,846
Has your father said anything
to you about her?

112
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:45,208
What's in it for her, money?

113
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,808
I know she's not in it for sex.

114
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:50,691
Your father's not what he used to be
after years of Paxil...

115
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,843
Okay, that'll be fine, Mom.

116
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,008
All right, then. Let's talk about you.

117
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,767
You sure you want to lose
the focus just yet?

118
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:03,447
Come on now, what's up in your world?

119
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,564
Nate and I are getting married.

120
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:19,482
Is he smart enough for you?
Does he have what it takes, up here?

121
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,647
Like you? Like me?

122
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,809
No, Mom, he's not like us.

123
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:29,722
He doesn't think so hard he wants
to put a staple gun to his forehead.

124
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,168
I get it. He's uncomplicated.

125
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,572
I've been with a man or three like that.

126
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:41,090
But Bern always had me because I knew
he was much smarter than I am.

127
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:45,243
That's why it's still so hot with us,
all these years later.

128
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,926
And we're back.

129
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,804
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,963
So, how did he propose?

131
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,167
I asked him.

132
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:58,726
You didn't.

133
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,405
Yeah, I know, it's really funny.

134
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:07,930
It's almost as funny as the notion of you
trying to build a life on your own.

135
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:16,685
I don't see how he could kill himself
when he's got three kids.

136
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,731
-I don't think he meant to.
-He hung himself.

137
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:24,005
I talked to the Quincy down at the morgue...

138
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:28,326
and he says that the cops said
there was a porno playing in the VCR.

139
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:31,928
-And they found a bottle of Astroglide.
-What's Astroglide?

140
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,681
It's lube. Lubrication. For sex.

141
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,283
-Thank you, David.
-No problemo.

142
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:41,008
Wait a minute, I know about this.
He was doing autoerotic asphyxiation...

143
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,209
-like the guy in that band?
-You got it.

144
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,568
See, you cut off the air supply...

145
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:48,451
and that heightens the stimulation
in the ensuing orgasm.

146
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,082
Here's the giveaway:
they found a lemon wedge on the floor.

147
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,168
You keep the lemon in your mouth...

148
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,528
and at the moment of climax...

149
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,889
you bite down on it to wake you up,
so you don't die.

150
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:09,810
See, the lemon was lying
on the floor, untouched.

151
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,325
I'm calling to let you know
that Eddie and I broke up.

152
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,089
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

153
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:25,891
I broke it off with him.

154
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,006
All right, then.

155
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,965
Thank you for telling me,
I'm going to go now.

156
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,726
So, there's this part in my book...

157
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:50,283
where the main character
meets a high-class hooker.

158
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,489
Is this fiction, or nonfiction?

159
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:56,882
It's still kind of working itself out.

160
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:59,692
There's definitely someone based on you.

161
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,527
-Part of her is you.
-Excellent.

162
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,769
As long as she doesn't get raped
and murdered to pay for her sins.

163
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,162
I'm so sick of that tired old story.

164
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:11,608
She's way beyond conventional morality.

165
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:14,564
I can't wait to read it.

166
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,373
I jerked off a client the other day.

167
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:25,365
-I didn't know you did release.
-No, I don't.

168
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,364
He didn't ask me to.

169
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:37,367
So, I'm sure you can imagine
sometimes the guy gets a hard-on.

170
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:39,531
Normally I just ignore it.

171
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,922
So what, was this guy
just exceptionally hot?

172
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,651
No, not even.

173
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:46,128
So I'm giving the guy a massage...

174
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,250
he flips over, there's this hard-on.

175
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:53,048
It was kind of huge, but you'd never guess
by looking at the guy.

176
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:58,409
I could tell that he wanted me to touch it.

177
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:03,171
I thought, well, I would be crossing a line.

178
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:06,966
And then I did.

179
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,650
I crossed a line.

180
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,685
You are hilarious.

181
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:17,486
I mean, what is that?
Am I trying to be you or something?

182
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:20,087
I don't know. How'd you feel afterwards?

183
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:25,204
I was weirdly kind of inspired.
I wrote this really cool chapter about it.

184
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,927
-As long as it's all for your art.
-Yeah.

185
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:01,171
Aunt Sarah, hi!

186
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:05,003
Baby, is everything okay?

187
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:14,042
I thought we said
a "probably-maybe" about next weekend.

188
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:18,163
But this weekend is fine, it's just fine.

189
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,763
I thought it was this weekend.

190
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,692
I'm totally cool to go home
and come back whenever.

191
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:28,968
You're here, and you're mine.

192
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,643
I have to believe the universe sent you.

193
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,963
It's our annual Howl weekend.

194
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,408
-Allen Ginsburg Howl?
-Yes.

195
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,133
So you're down. Wonderful.

196
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:42,969
He was a dear friend.

197
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,608
We once shared a flat in Berlin...

198
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:48,969
until I got fed up with
the parade of Aryan starfucker boys.

199
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,527
I'm going to summon
his energy this weekend.

200
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,246
I'm expecting some visitors.
A wonderful poet named Basil...

201
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,408
and the painter Fiona Kleinschmidt,
have you heard of her?

202
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:06,005
A couple of freaks and some nasty hippies
from my druggie days.

203
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,811
It's going to be a riot.

204
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,849
Sure you don't want me to come back later?

205
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,572
Wouldn't hear of it.
I'll show you to your sleeping nook.

206
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,245
I love that bag.

207
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,168
-Why did you do that to me?
-Do what?

208
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,448
That. Just calling me and telling me that.

209
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:24,645
Hold on a second.

210
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,565
Mom, I'm on the phone.

211
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:29,213
Are you going to have supper?
I'm making pork chops.

212
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,091
No, Mom, I won't be having dinner with you.

213
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:36,091
Sorry. What do you want?

214
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,647
You called me.

215
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:43,366
I was calling to find out why you called me
to tell me you guys broke up.

216
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:44,762
You're my friend.

217
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:47,242
I thought you'd want to know
what happens in my life.

218
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,882
A month ago you didn't think
we should see each other anymore.

219
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,606
Things change.

220
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,890
Just what exactly is your agenda?

221
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:58,567
-I don't have an agenda, okay?
-Yeah, right.

222
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,284
-Wonderful.
-Great.

223
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:06,085
Thank you for sharing.

224
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,089
Shut up, just keep it shut.

225
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,446
I was just eating.

226
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:22,049
I spent most of the '90s thinking
that stripping was goddess work...

227
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:26,490
but I've come around to my original position
which is that it's just plain cheap.

228
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,290
I've always been astonished
at some of that pole work.

229
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:34,446
I once saw this woman, she could
hang upside down from 20 feet in the air.

230
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,328
She looked like an inverted Jesus.

231
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:40,805
It's the PVC boots.
They make your legs stick to the metal.

232
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,087
No way.

233
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,767
I would totally take my clothes off
on stage...

234
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:50,448
at least once, if I didn't harbor
a vague feeling of hatred about my body.

235
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,001
You're crazy, you have a beautiful body.

236
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,492
Thank you.

237
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,012
That's Nate.
Listen, the whole prostitute thing...

238
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,288
-he wouldn't be into it.
-Whatever.

239
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,246
-Hey.
-Hi.

240
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:08,362
Oh, God.

241
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,365
Where'd you get the hummus?

242
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,762
Sorry, incredibly rude and hungry.

243
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:16,446
This is Nate, my fiancé.

244
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,805
This is my friend, Melissa.

245
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,803
Cool. Where'd you guys meet?

246
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:25,883
Melissa's a client of mine.

247
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:30,126
So does Brenda
have all your auras aligned?

248
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,092
Chakras. Did you note the tone of mocking?

249
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,890
Have you guys ever heard
of autoerotic asphyxiation?

250
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,885
Cutting off your air supply
so you can come harder? Sure.

251
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:46,091
There's a name for it in
the fetish community. It's called breath play.

252
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,132
I read a thing.

253
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,010
We have this guy who died of it...

254
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,812
and it's weird
because it's definitely suicide...

255
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,203
but is it accidental suicide
or just plain old suicide?

256
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,281
He was indulging in something
he knew could kill him...

257
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:04,332
but even if it's accidental
it's still sort of on purpose, right?

258
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,244
What do you mean, "this guy we have"?

259
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,052
-Nate's an undertaker.
-Funeral director.

260
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:12,612
Did you note the tone of mocking in that?

261
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:17,569
Don't tell me you're a couple
that likes to bicker in front of others...

262
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:21,248
until it gets uncomfortable
and I have to leave and you guys fuck?

263
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:22,442
No.

264
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,292
No, not us.

265
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,242
Okay, you want to know my agenda?

266
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,446
My agenda is to
take you to dinner tomorrow night.

267
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,692
You there?

268
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,768
If I say yes, what am I agreeing to?

269
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,728
You and me having dinner,
maybe a little conversation, that's all.

270
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:03,442
Dinner?

271
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,771
We could make a plan,
but it seems a little soon after...

272
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:10,003
Would you just shut up and say yes?

273
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,402
Yes, I would like to have dinner
with you tomorrow night.

274
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,379
-How you doing, baby?
-Good.

275
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:42,867
How are you?

276
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:45,337
Be careful, Snoopy has an ear infection.

277
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,824
I brought tomatoes from my garden.

278
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:52,618
But I'm making the sauce, right?
Do you have fresh pasta or do I make some?

279
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,417
The Napa contingent can't make it.

280
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:58,659
Fernando's doing community service, again.

281
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,661
Who are you?

282
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,947
This is Claire, Ruth's daughter.

283
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,824
I didn't know Ruth had a daughter.

284
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:13,025
If I remember correctly,
you certainly knew she had a son.

285
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:21,507
-How is Ruth?
-How is Nathaniel?

286
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:27,502
My mom's great.
My dad is not so great. He's dead.

287
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,777
Shame. Hell of a guy, your dad.

288
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:35,616
So funny, fucking wicked.

289
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:40,181
I can still see him sitting here
at this counter...

290
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:44,227
hunched over his little rolling machine.
He used a rolling machine.

291
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:54,783
I'm gonna have my cell phone on,
in case you need to call me or anything.

292
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,426
Okay, have a good one.

293
00:23:56,508 --> 00:24:00,023
-You want another cup of coffee?
-If you make it, I'll drink it.

294
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:02,827
Be really careful
when you're taking down this plastic...

295
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,626
'cause of Julio's allergies.

296
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,666
-There's tons of dust all through here.
-Okay, I got it.

297
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,306
We know, honey.

298
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:13,138
I'm going to make some breakfast. Hungry?

299
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:14,866
That sounds good.

300
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:19,544
I moved your circular saw to the porch.

301
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:21,983
I know, man, I got it. It's cool.

302
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:25,977
Honey...

303
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,497
listen, if it gets too loud in here...

304
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:31,261
you can take the kids to the park.
You don't have to stay.

305
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:33,703
Okay, baby, I got it. Have a good day.

306
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:34,817
Okay.

307
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:39,339
Julio, turn that TV down.

308
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,780
There's a spray cleaner
that's much more earth friendly.

309
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,381
Maybe I'll order it.

310
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:58,504
Oh, god damn it!

311
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:01,144
Or we can keep using this.

312
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,378
I don't talking to you!

313
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:05,221
Are you mad at us?

314
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:08,344
Why the grumps, Mr. Cranky Pants?

315
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:11,061
Someone's in a real snoot.

316
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:14,379
-I don't think he's feeling well.
-I feeling fine.

317
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:19,177
I can't come to your house
for dinner tonight. I have other obligation.

318
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:23,024
We planned this three days ago.
I bought aubergines.

319
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:27,746
I can't. Stop with all the question, okay?

320
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:32,061
I'm not asking you questions.
I haven't asked you any questions.

321
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:33,787
So, tell...

322
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:36,540
what do you do with aubergines?

323
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:38,539
It's a Greek thing, it's like a....

324
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:50,540
It's like a lasagna.

325
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,305
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

326
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:08,181
Nothing would please me more, muffin.

327
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:18,060
Star sighting. I think I just saw
that Jewish "Friend" in there.

328
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:20,218
-What, Jennifer Aniston?
-The guy.

329
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:22,822
-Ross.
-Right. I'll be back in a couple hours.

330
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:25,297
-Hey, did you forget to shave?
-I was running late.

331
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:26,423
Really?

332
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,941
I'll thank you not to discuss
my facial hair any further.

333
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:32,098
Come here, let me check it out. Come on.

334
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:38,220
-What time's your date?
-Who said I have a date?

335
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,546
Tonight. Dinner.

336
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:43,946
It's a little soon.

337
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,907
The whole Oops-I-didn't-know-I-was-sexy
stubble look...

338
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,456
will peak at around noon tomorrow.

339
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,016
Believe me, I've perfected the art.

340
00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:55,781
Can you make it drinks after dinner?
You'll have more time.

341
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:59,144
-I can't discuss this now. I'm going out.
-Clothes shopping?

342
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:01,185
-No.
-Stay out of Structure.

343
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,384
Augusto's got a little cold...

344
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:13,101
so I'm gonna head home
and give Vanessa a little break.

345
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:14,826
Okay, that's cool.

346
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:17,579
I'll be right here, then.

347
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:23,700
You may be seated.

348
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:32,937
We are here today to mourn the loss
of Jeffrey Marc Shapiro.

349
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,864
Talmud says, "Better is one day in this life...

350
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:40,666
"than all eternity in the world to come. "

351
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:45,342
"And if they ask, you answer

352
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:50,464
"Damn the high-walled guard towers
of right and left

353
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,978
"Coast to coast, now, here upon a time

354
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,468
"where leaf shines, shimmers

355
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,179
"tokes to toasts

356
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:06,663
"Fear forever, nevermore"

357
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,707
And there you have it,
the crap of the moment!

358
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,547
It's not crap.

359
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:15,581
Look what just arrived.

360
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:16,817
Hi, Jill!

361
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:21,186
Hey, magic mushrooms, special delivery.

362
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:22,747
Throw them in the sauce.

363
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:26,582
No, no, sauté them first.
You guys, sauté them first!

364
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:30,747
Hey, do you have any of that THC butter
in the freezer from last year?

365
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:02,617
Hey!

366
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:04,697
Fuck!

367
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,187
What the fuck?

368
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,900
What the fuck is going on in here?

369
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:15,979
Just get out of here, man. Give me a sec.

370
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,387
Get out of here?

371
00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:20,665
This is my fucking house,
you fucking homo!

372
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,943
It's nothing. Just chill, Rico. Damn!

373
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:27,385
Are you out of your fucking mind?
My kids could have seen that! Vanessa!

374
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,306
She took the kids to the park.

375
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:33,176
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you out of your fucking homo mind?

376
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:37,580
Get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck is wrong with you, Ramon?

377
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,624
Do you have anything to fucking say?

378
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:43,781
No, I'm just going to get out of here
until you calm the hell down, okay?

379
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:44,937
Damn!

380
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,107
What the fuck?

381
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:53,105
What the fucking fuck?

382
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:57,618
-Rabbi?
-You can call me Ari.

383
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:00,821
I need to ask you a few questions.

384
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:05,382
As a funeral director, I want to ask
about death from a Jewish point of view.

385
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:09,666
Sure. But I warn you, Jews tend
to answer questions with more questions.

386
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:12,342
-I'll give you my card.
-I mean now.

387
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,543
We're going straight to the cemetery.

388
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,979
You could drive with me.

389
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,141
I'm coming.

390
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:36,618
-Mother.
-Baby.

391
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:42,945
I got this for you. It doesn't need
watering or caring about in any way.

392
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:49,258
So, Brenda, I had this vision
of your wedding at the Hollyhock House.

393
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:53,264
They're wonderful
as long as you bring in your own caterer.

394
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:56,181
Loulou Smigel's daughter
had her wedding there.

395
00:31:56,268 --> 00:32:00,022
Well, actually, I was thinking of somewhere
more beautiful and natural.

396
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:02,541
Oh, God!

397
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,137
What?

398
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,984
You know, your father and I got married
on the beach...

399
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:13,222
and we ran in the surf afterwards.

400
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:17,098
Yeah, I know.
You were barefoot, he wore clogs.

401
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:26,427
I think you're going to have to leave.

402
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:30,898
I've just got so much coming up right now...

403
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:35,259
and I need to go in my room
and sob for an hour.

404
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:41,863
Look, I could stay.
I'll massage your shoulders.

405
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,060
No, that....

406
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:49,106
It doesn't help me right now
that you're here.

407
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,147
Sure I can't make you
a cup of tea or something?

408
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:57,265
I'm sure. And, Brenda...

409
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:01,066
please don't tell your father
that you saw me cry.

410
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:04,344
Mom, come on, let me help.

411
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:08,307
I'm not Billy.
If you want to help me, just leave.

412
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:18,662
Okay.

413
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:35,257
Every time I get a headache,
I'm thinking this could be it.

414
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:38,699
You must be really scared.

415
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:40,665
Yeah, I'm going to die.

416
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:42,581
Yeah, me, too.

417
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:46,022
-Really, what do you have?
-A body.

418
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:57,386
Okay. Yeah, we're all going to die...

419
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:02,858
and maybe I'm going to die
before everyone else, maybe not.

420
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:09,057
So what's the Jewish answer
to what I'm supposed to do now?

421
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:13,576
I don't know what the Jewish answer is.
I know what I try to do.

422
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:16,546
I try to live my life...

423
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:19,622
every day in a way that honors God.

424
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:25,256
I don't even know if I believe in God.

425
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,864
Maybe it's time to find Him.

426
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,536
-Maybe God's a woman.
-Maybe.

427
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:38,540
There he is now.

428
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,787
Jeffrey Shapiro.

429
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,704
I'll wait here by the car.

430
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,343
Come and watch him be buried.

431
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:57,187
Jeffrey can't repay you,
so it's considered a great mitzvah.

432
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,381
Kindness, love, for its own sake.

433
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:05,344
Some people call that God.

434
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,184
What I'm saying is, yes, definitely,
forgive your mother and father.

435
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:17,738
I mean, we've all heard that before,
but what's become clear...

436
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:22,424
is that my family of origin
never really lived in a house.

437
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:26,023
They lived in this tent city, psychologically.

438
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:31,058
It's no wonder that my own house never felt
remotely like it was built on solid ground...

439
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:33,378
Shut up. Shut the mouth.

440
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:37,859
It was built on this quicksand
of emotional incest...

441
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:40,098
-if there is such a thing....
-Shutting it now.

442
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:42,907
Shutting it and stopping it.

443
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:46,424
But The Plan would call that
"old blueprinting"....

444
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:49,898
If you say another word,
I will stab you in the heart with a fork.

445
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:51,307
...that's about the size of it.

446
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:55,097
If there is a God in heaven,
He will surely shut your mouth.

447
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:57,304
You never stop renovating.

448
00:35:58,668 --> 00:36:01,341
Robbie, I have to tell you something now.

449
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:05,741
I do believe I've learned everything
I needed to learn from The Plan...

450
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:10,102
and I no longer feel the urge
to speak in building metaphors...

451
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:13,819
or talk about myself or my feelings
in this way...

452
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:16,461
any longer.

453
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:58,540
I don't know what kind of power trip
you're on, but it seems cruel, to be honest.

454
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:04,062
Oh, God, Keith, you poor thing.

455
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:10,826
-You mind checking on her one more time?
-Sure.

456
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:14,502
-Hi.
-Hey.

457
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:17,388
-How is she?
-She's in surgery right now.

458
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:21,427
I guess her appendix was huge,
but they got it before it burst...

459
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:25,865
and she's going to be fine. I'm just waiting.
It's been an hour and a half.

460
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:30,901
She kept telling me
her stomach was hurting...

461
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:33,422
and I thought it was some kind of game.

462
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,898
You can't be perfect all the time, Keith.

463
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:41,060
That's what life's about:
striving for perfection.

464
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:44,820
And when that fails,
accepting ourselves for being imperfect.

465
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:46,421
Not in my book.

466
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:54,421
-God, you are so self-righteous sometimes.
-Yeah, and you are a doormat.

467
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:59,307
Do I really come off as being a doormat?

468
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:05,707
-How is she?
-Great.

469
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:08,427
It went very smoothly. She's in recovery.

470
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:11,139
Good. When can I see her?

471
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:12,820
You can wait for her in her room.

472
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:15,980
When she comes out of her anesthesia,
she might be a little weepy.

473
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:17,786
Don't let it concern you.

474
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:20,537
Thank you.

475
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,820
-Oh, God, don't let her come over here.
-No, it's too late.

476
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:56,059
Beat these gourds!

477
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,180
No spectators!

478
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:32,062
Oh, my God, is there a lock on this thing?

479
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:36,498
They use this place as a meditation hut...

480
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:40,297
but it's been my safe-house
more times than I care to remember.

481
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,300
What fucking freaks.

482
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:47,141
Yeah, at least two of them
aren't your parents.

483
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,546
I'm their designated driver... every year.

484
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:54,622
Sorry.

485
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:57,743
It's better than getting a call
from the sheriff...

486
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,820
saying your parents are laying in the bottom
of Topanga Canyon...

487
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:03,376
and would I like a ride in a helicopter.

488
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:21,259
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Why not?

489
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:23,664
Because, you know, like...

490
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,300
people are having, like,
end-of-the-world sex...

491
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:31,705
and just, I didn't bring condoms....

492
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,145
Like I would even anyway.

493
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:36,747
Yeah, right.

494
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:38,537
No.

495
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:43,377
No. I mean, you're quite the fox,
I'm happy to report...

496
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:47,017
but, like, I would never just
hook up with somebody I just met.

497
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,427
Like, ever.

498
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,187
Seriously?

499
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,467
Seriously.

500
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:59,186
I get it. You're just trying
to let me get my guard down...

501
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:01,463
and then, all of a sudden, we're hooking up.

502
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:02,697
Wrong.

503
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:07,786
I'm 19, okay, Claire?
I've had the major life experience to know...

504
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:13,578
it kind of sucks to enter the body of another
human being you're not in love with.

505
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:21,147
Okay, what are you, like, straight-edge,
or all Jesusy or just gay?

506
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,657
None of those things, okay? Forget it.

507
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,503
Just lay down here with me.

508
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:30,663
We won't have sex.
That's all you have to know.

509
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:33,501
Whatever. Who said I even wanted you to?

510
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,348
I promise you, you're gonna be fine.

511
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:43,657
This is all going to be over soon,
and we'll have you back at home.

512
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:46,185
I'm sorry I got sick.

513
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:50,100
Baby, it's not your fault.
You kept trying to tell me.

514
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:53,428
I just wasn't paying attention to you.

515
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:57,419
In the future,
we need to have a code word, okay?

516
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,057
Okay.

517
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,505
Secret words you can use to let me know
when the pain is real...

518
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,226
and you're not just playing.

519
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:06,819
But it was always real.

520
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:11,262
I know.

521
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,300
Baby, I'm sorry.

522
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:19,224
I don't know why you guys are depressed.
I haven't gotten laid since September 11...

523
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:20,856
1985.

524
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:26,182
You laughed at the wrong part.
I'm just telling you. What a crowd!

525
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,907
You drinking NyQuil, ladies?
Sit up, come on!

526
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:31,422
Blonde Jews, everybody! Hip crowd!

527
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,944
Good to see you back
in men's clothes, Senator. All right.

528
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:38,100
Cousin Stu, right out of rehab.
Good to see you.

529
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:41,704
-The landscaper's here, thank God!
-So what's shiva mean, standup?

530
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,507
Jeffrey represented a lot of comedians.

531
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:49,546
There's one part I haven't told you.
I'm engaged.

532
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:55,979
Well, we couldn't go out anyway.
You're not Jewish.

533
00:42:57,028 --> 00:43:00,657
No, I didn't mean....
You would go out with me?

534
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:03,026
No, I just said I wouldn't.

535
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:06,339
-But it crossed your mind.
-I said, I would not.

536
00:43:06,468 --> 00:43:08,265
Well, then, why'd you say it?

537
00:43:08,348 --> 00:43:10,703
You thought about it. Come on.

538
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,537
Maybe.

539
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:14,938
You know, with your whole illness thing...

540
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:18,737
I have a bit of a messiah complex...

541
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:20,625
saving the men.

542
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,146
Yes, messiah complex.

543
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:28,265
You know, you can save me.

544
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:31,625
If that's what you need to do,
you can save me.

545
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:36,539
It's really good that you have someone.
If anything is going to save you, that will.

546
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,663
Yeah.

547
00:43:40,388 --> 00:43:43,300
I haven't told her
about my whole head thing.

548
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:47,978
How could you not tell your soul mate
something like that?

549
00:43:49,788 --> 00:43:52,507
I don't even know if she's my soul mate.

550
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:56,425
I get it. She's not your soul mate
but you're going to marry her...

551
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,907
I don't know what else to do.

552
00:43:57,988 --> 00:44:01,458
...because you have nothing better to do.
Great. That sounds good.

553
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:05,105
Hey, I don't even know
what a soul mate is, do you?

554
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:09,826
The person who makes you be
the most "you" that you could possibly be.

555
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:14,425
Maybe your soul mate...

556
00:44:15,628 --> 00:44:17,141
is the person...

557
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:21,062
who forces your soul to grow the most.

558
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,264
Not all growth feels good.

559
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:33,306
Hey, Melissa, it's Brenda.
I've been driving around for hours.

560
00:44:33,428 --> 00:44:38,138
You want to have a drink or something?
Call me if you get in tonight, okay? Bye.

561
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:39,981
Whatever.

562
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,345
-Like that?
-Oh, yeah.

563
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:20,900
Are you gonna fuck me?

564
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,899
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck you.

565
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:28,058
-I'm gonna fuck you hard.
-Yeah?

566
00:45:30,388 --> 00:45:33,300
-Harder than you ever been fucked.
-Oh, good!

567
00:45:36,148 --> 00:45:37,740
What's your name?

568
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:53,185
-Thank you for coming, Mr. Fisher.
-Glad to.

569
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,306
Did he want to die?

570
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,540
Did he want to leave us?

571
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:14,860
-How could he have wanted that?
-I don't know.

572
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:22,821
What do you think?

573
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:27,264
I don't think he wanted to die.

574
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,897
Nate, leave your clothes on.

575
00:46:40,108 --> 00:46:44,021
I'll get naked. You can go outside
and come back as a dangerous intruder.

576
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,425
Come on, I'm serious.

577
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:50,587
It'll be fun.

578
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:55,784
I'll pretend I'm asleep, and then you
can come in and have your way with me.

579
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:03,302
I don't really feel like it, all right?

580
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,858
Okay, you don't have to go outside.
Just do it from in here.

581
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:18,024
Hey, I've never seen you before.

582
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:21,545
-What's your name?
-Nate.

583
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,937
-My name is Nate.
-That's pretty funny.

584
00:47:25,828 --> 00:47:27,864
My fiancé's name is Nate.

585
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:47,939
I love you so much.

586
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,506
You're so soft, baby.

587
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:56,223
I love you. I love you so much.

588
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,503
Harder!

589
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,856
Come on.

590
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,265
Did the music wake you up?

591
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:58,136
No, I've been up for a while actually.
I took a walk in the canyon.

592
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:01,379
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-My God, it's gorgeous!

593
00:50:06,228 --> 00:50:08,742
We'll have a weekend soon,
just you and me, okay?

594
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:11,422
You come back
when there's not so much craziness.

595
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,784
The craziness was totally fine.
It was fun, actually.

596
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,217
Good.

597
00:50:19,068 --> 00:50:21,628
I love this song. It's so pretty.

598
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,863
You want a waffle before you go?

599
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:27,181
No, thanks.

600
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:33,986
Well, then, tell everyone
I love them and miss them...

601
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:37,501
and want them to get their butts here
super soon, okay?

602
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:39,738
Especially that mama of yours.

603
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,177
Yeah, right, like she would ever.

604
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:52,864
I think she hides inside of herself
because she's so afraid we'll reject her.

605
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:55,780
So let's don't, okay?

606
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:00,260
She's had enough heartache
for one lifetime.

607
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:09,256
-You can keep it, sweetheart.
-Thanks.

608
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:18,497
As soon as I figure out
which two are my parents...

609
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:21,625
I'm just gonna roll them up in a rug
and throw them in my trunk.

610
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,221
Let me know if I can help.

611
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:27,540
I think I'll start with some coffee. But
give me your number if you're taking off.

612
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:29,747
Seriously?

613
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:32,663
I figured I'd never see you again.

614
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:36,020
Well, you were wrong. I'll come into the city.

615
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:39,423
Okay, I'll write down my number.

616
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:48,340
So, you get the 8 x 10
and the 24 wallet sizes for under $20.

617
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:52,300
-Pedro is the spitting image of Ramon.
-Right?

618
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:55,903
And everybody said he looked just like me
for the longest time.

619
00:51:56,308 --> 00:51:57,866
Hey, morning, baby!

620
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,422
Hey! Hey, Graciela.

621
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:06,543
So, Rico, Ramon told me
why he's not finishing your house.

622
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:09,056
He did?

623
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:12,857
Yeah, just because
he has different taste in tile than you do.

624
00:52:12,948 --> 00:52:16,827
I mean, you could have returned
what he bought and got something else.

625
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,740
Yeah, I guess I could have.

626
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:23,537
I know, girl, it sounds crazy to me, too,
but you know how men are.

627
00:52:23,628 --> 00:52:25,823
Se ponen locos with that machismo stuff.

628
00:52:26,148 --> 00:52:29,618
I guess I just really wanted
to do my own house myself.

629
00:52:30,468 --> 00:52:31,583
My way.

630
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:33,977
You know how to do construction?

631
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:37,180
You know, I want to learn.
I got some books and...

632
00:52:37,268 --> 00:52:40,021
That's cool,
but just don't hold a grudge, okay?

633
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:45,184
I gotta go. Ramon is watching the kids,
and he's going to kill me.

634
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,463
-Okay, girl. Bye.
-See you guys later.

635
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:54,662
Baby, you're such a weirdo sometimes.

636
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:57,941
Whatever.

637
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:26,503
Are you even going to ask
about my weekend?

638
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:28,499
I wasn't planning on it.

639
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:34,216
-I had fun.
-I'm glad.

640
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,937
I found some slugs in the garden.

641
00:53:43,228 --> 00:53:44,343
Neat.

642
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:52,744
I'm gonna go take a nap.

643
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:13,541
English
