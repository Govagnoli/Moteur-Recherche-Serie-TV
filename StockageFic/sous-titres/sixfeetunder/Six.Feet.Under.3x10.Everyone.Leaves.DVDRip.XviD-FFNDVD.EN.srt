1
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:54,618
Come on, I'm open. Over here.

2
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,180
Pass the ball.

3
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,418
Come on.
My grandma can kick harder than that.

4
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,542
Shoo! Go, now.

5
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:18,906
Roderick, can I offer you
a slice of my buttermilk pie?

6
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:22,257
- Is that the same pie you made last year?
- Yes, it is.

7
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,377
Then... no, thank you.

8
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,702
Roderick, can't you be nice?

9
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,864
She's your aunt. You eat her sour pie.

10
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:32,865
Well, maybe I'll have one more small piece.

11
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,664
I'll have a piece of pie.

12
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,258
Dammit.

13
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,502
Aunt Jeanie, did you get stung?

14
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,663
Why, yes.

15
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:46,460
I got stung by a bee. It's not that bad.

16
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,941
She's allergic. I'm calling 911.

17
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,336
Hello. I'm calling from Bellvale Park.

18
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:57,982
My wife's aunt got stung by a bee.
She's having an allergic reaction.

19
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,824
- Aunt Jeanie?
- Do something.

20
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,665
Talk to them. Jeanie?

21
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,777
By the east entrance.

22
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,295
Where you walk down that little hill.

23
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,700
What's wrong with her? Is she gonna be OK?

24
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:15,342
She's gonna be OK, sweetheart.
Help's on the way.

25
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,576
That feels so good.

26
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:41,738
My God. Wow!

27
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:46,542
- That was nice, baby.
- Nice? That was amazing.

28
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:51,705
It's great that, you know, you wanted to.

29
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,337
Of course I wanted to.

30
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,664
I mean, it's been a long time since you...

31
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,335
I mean, it's great that you wanted to.

32
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,617
I have a surprise for you.

33
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,306
Whoa.

34
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:23,262
OK, but you're gonna have to give me
five minutes. Ten minutes, tops.

35
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:29,587
It's a different kind of surprise.
I signed us up for a dance class tonight.

36
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:38,141
A dance class? Really?

37
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:40,462
Salsa, tango, merengue.

38
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:43,180
Merengue.

39
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:47,300
Wow. My mom used to do that.

40
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:50,737
- She won trophies.
- Maybe I'll win one.

41
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:54,782
- I'm gonna go make some coffee.
- No, no.

42
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,818
I'll do it.

43
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,146
Julio! Augusto! Time to get up!

44
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,101
By dipping the sponge applicator
into cold water

45
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:09,105
and applying it to Barbie's
lips, cheeks and eyelids,

46
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:11,536
you get a flourish of glamorous colour.

47
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:14,818
I'm telling Taylor you took it out of the box.

48
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:17,586
When I was a kid, I used to have GI Joes.

49
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,983
They were always getting court-martialled,

50
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:25,737
which in my version meant that they had
to stand naked in front of the other dolls.

51
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,257
Is that something you wanna act out?

52
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:33,579
I think we've had enough excitement
for a while.

53
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:36,098
- The three-ways?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:42,095
- What about them?
- Maybe they're not the best thing for us.

55
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:48,336
Really? That wasn't you the other night
begging us to arrest and interrogate you?

56
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,378
I'm not saying they're not fun.

57
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:55,626
- So what are you saying?
- I'm just starting to feel weird about it.

58
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,943
- OK, fine.
- Fine?

59
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,262
- Yeah, whatever.
- That is so not fair.

60
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:05,016
You ask me to tell you how I feel
and when I do you just shut down.

61
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,342
I don't feel like talking about it right now.

62
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,220
You're tense
because we're going to see your father.

63
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,462
We're going to my great-aunt's funeral.

64
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:16,341
Where your father will be
and whose house we'll be staying at.

65
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,742
So? I don't have a problem with him.

66
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,857
Really?

67
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:24,820
I've been working on that stuff
in my individual therapy.

68
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,461
- Really?
- That's all I talk about.

69
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:31,260
How come you've never told me
about any of this?

70
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,901
Some things are
between me and the therapist.

71
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:39,066
- I tell you everything.
- Because you want my approval.

72
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,143
No, it's because I love you.

73
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:47,978
- The other gentleman, he's your brother?
- Yes. David.

74
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:52,657
- That's who helped me.
- He left this morning for a friend's funeral.

75
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:55,141
He sold me a casket.

76
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,779
- Yes, the Cameo Rose.
- It's not good enough.

77
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,938
Mr Fester, the Cameo Rose
is an excellent casket.

78
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:06,660
No, I want something nicer for Martha.

79
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,857
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

80
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:14,665
I know when we lose someone
we wanna show how much we loved her,

81
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,267
and we're at a loss as to how to do that

82
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:21,095
and we spend a lot of money
on something that isn't really necessary.

83
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:23,138
I don't care.

84
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:25,337
Don't you understand?

85
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:29,863
This is the last thing
I'll ever be able to do for my wife.

86
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:35,260
I was a bad husband.

87
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,265
Affairs and all that shit.

88
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:43,095
I got cancer, thought I was gonna die,

89
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,422
but I got better.

90
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:49,100
I got a second chance.

91
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,298
And I realised how much I loved her.

92
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,180
And it's been really good the last few years.

93
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:00,623
I just want to love her some more.

94
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,907
I owe her...

95
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:10,067
God, I loved her, I really did.

96
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:12,940
Of course you did, and she knew that.

97
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:21,946
She... was everything to me.

98
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,537
I am so sorry.

99
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:44,056
Nate, do you remember when
I used to make that casserole with the...

100
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:01,381
I used to do this for your father.

101
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:04,976
His shoulders would get so full of knots.

102
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:08,421
It's such a stressful job.

103
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,460
It's OK, baby. It's OK.

104
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:48,100
- You want the front page?
- No. I can't deal with depressing news.

105
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:55,744
I don't remember this book being so dark.

106
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:58,301
These kids in the orphanage
are being tortured.

107
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,226
That's the best part,
where they have to take a bath in iced water.

108
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,498
Isn't that kind of inappropriate for kids?

109
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:11,782
We're human beings. We all have a sick
craving for that kind of dark fantasy. Even kids.

110
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,739
I've got enough dark reality.
I don't need the fantasy.

111
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:17,901
Jesus.

112
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:24,179
Nurse Caterwaul's making Nathaniel and Isabel
cane each other.

113
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,536
Read that part out loud.

114
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,657
You're sick.

115
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:33,417
If you mean suffering from bipolar disorder
with psychotic episodes, then yes, I am.

116
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,380
This is good, Claire. It's lovely.

117
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:47,704
The blurriness,
the way the light seems too much.

118
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,898
As if there's a secret fire in her
spilling out for a moment

119
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:53,825
and you were there to capture it.

120
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,141
Excellent work.

121
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,982
Thanks.

122
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:05,660
It only turned out this way
because I accidentally dragged the shutter.

123
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,426
I was totally gonna reshoot it.

124
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,061
But he's right, it works.

125
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,098
It's really good.

126
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:15,741
I wonder how much of art is accidental.

127
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:19,826
Maybe Magritte,
when he was painting his Listening Room,

128
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:23,177
was like,
"Damn, I made the apple too big again."

129
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,177
Hello, I'm being clever over here.

130
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,297
- Shit.
- What?

131
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:33,185
The blade's dull. It's fucking up everything.

132
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,506
- Use another one.
- I got ten mats to cut. I don't have time.

133
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:42,222
- Why don't you just change the blade?
- I don't want to change the blade.

134
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:46,385
It's shit! I hate it! I hate everything! I hate it!

135
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:49,942
- It's shit! It's all fucking shit!
- Good.

136
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:55,135
A tantrum.
This is an opportunity to learn, people.

137
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:59,419
Russell, you hate your work
because you secretly hate yourself,

138
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,777
which means
you're still only thinking about yourself.

139
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,943
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

140
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:06,784
But I understand the impulse.

141
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,739
I once filled the trunk of my car
with all my latest work

142
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,778
and then lit the car on fire

143
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:14,864
and let it roll down the streets of Montmartre.

144
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:20,220
That's interesting, because everything you do
is just so fucking fascinating.

145
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,464
Such vitriol and such rage.

146
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:26,260
And why aren't you putting this into your work?

147
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:29,583
Olivier, if you know so much about art and life,

148
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:32,266
how come you ended up
being such a pathetic poser

149
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:37,700
who needs people half his age to prop him up
and make him feel good about himself?

150
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:48,336
He could have at least made the effort
to slam the door.

151
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:52,016
Young people
have absolutely no commitment today.

152
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,178
Go back to work.

153
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,546
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,862
- You OK?
- Yeah.

155
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,500
- Sorry about that. Just a little meltdown.
- Yeah.

156
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:14,142
- I can stay. Go another time.
- No. You're going.

157
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,978
You need a break. You deserve a break.

158
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,905
- You wanna get rid of me.
- No, of course not.

159
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,818
You wanna get to your sister's before dark.

160
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:29,779
I feel like a terrible mother for thinking this,
and I know I'm gonna miss her,

161
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:34,776
but I'm kind of looking forward
to a couple of days without Maya.

162
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:38,217
That's because you're a handful, aren't you?

163
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,904
- Did you make a list for me?
- A list? For what?

164
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,507
I don't know. Usually you make lists.

165
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:49,938
What time I'm supposed to feed Maya,
what I can and can't feed her.

166
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:53,457
- You already know all that stuff.
- Yeah. OK.

167
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:56,658
Don't let your mother bathe her.
She scrubs her like a potato.

168
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:59,267
I'll bathe her.

169
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,178
OK.

170
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:08,177
I'm gonna miss you.

171
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:14,263
- We'll walk you to the car.
- I don't want Maya to see me go.

172
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,457
I just don't.

173
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,935
- Well, goodbye, then.
- I love you.

174
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,018
Be good to Daddy, right?

175
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,217
I love you.

176
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,258
Bye.

177
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,260
- Arthur, are you busy?
- I'm putting away my socks.

178
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:50,866
But I've become confused
as to which is paired with which.

179
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,341
They all look exactly the same.

180
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:55,378
That's the dilemma.

181
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,658
Arthur, I really need to talk.

182
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:00,698
OK.

183
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:10,979
Quite frankly, I'd like to know how you feel
about the course our relationship is taking.

184
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:15,020
We've been on quite a serendipitous journey,
haven't we?

185
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:18,616
And where do you think it's headed?

186
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,737
Surely someplace divine.

187
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:25,342
Does that mean... you know... intimacy?

188
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:28,663
I love intimacy. Intimacy is my best friend.

189
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,696
Arthur, I'm so confused.

190
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:35,779
Do you find me at all attractive?
If you feel I'm too old...

191
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:39,536
Heavens, no.
You're the perfect age for me, Ruth Fisher.

192
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,578
- I am?
- Absolutely.

193
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:44,778
So how do you feel about us having,
you know, sex?

194
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:53,867
It's just that we've been seeing each other
for a while, and not even a kiss.

195
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,580
- Well, not since...
- Yes.

196
00:15:56,627 --> 00:16:01,143
I understand. Well...

197
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:08,867
I believe that sex can be...
when two become one.

198
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,735
It needn't always be painful,

199
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:18,019
but it is indeed a very slippery slope.

200
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:24,100
Arthur, have you ever had sex?

201
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,665
I think I have, in a sense.

202
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,820
Are there any other topics
you'd like to discuss?

203
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,340
No... No.

204
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,744
- Hello?
- It's this way.

205
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,465
- Yeah, I know the way.
- So what's the problem?

206
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,300
We're a couple, and it would be nice if
we could walk together like every other couple,

207
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,424
especially considering I'm about to walk
into a place filled with your every living relative.

208
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,859
So walk faster, then.

209
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,380
- Oh, please.
- Now what?

210
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,979
That's just tacky. No one wants to see that.

211
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,466
This ground is wet.
They should have put down more greens here.

212
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,583
David, it's fine.
Not everyone is such a perfectionist.

213
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,827
I'm not a perfectionist, just professional.

214
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,589
No one's gonna even see these here.

215
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,708
Let's hope these guys remember
to put your great-aunt in her casket face up.

216
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,344
Look, David, here come my folks.

217
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,824
- Try not to nag at me.
- I wasn't...

218
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,020
- Uncle Keith!
- Hey.

219
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,630
Look at you! You gotta stop growing so fast.

220
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,504
- David.
- You look so pretty.

221
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,702
- Thanks. It's my funeral dress.
- Nice.

222
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,299
- So you made it down?
- Yeah, of course.

223
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,863
It's good to see you, baby.

224
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,581
- You too, David.
- Thank you.

225
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,621
Wanna come sit with us?

226
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,786
Yeah, I'd like that.

227
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,148
Excuse me, are you the funeral director?

228
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,179
I'm the organist.
I was wondering if I should begin.

229
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,948
Actually, now would be a perfect time.

230
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,663
Something soft, perhaps Ave Maria.

231
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,225
Prayer card?

232
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,388
Hey. Just in time for lunch.

233
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,740
I know. I could smell curry
all the way from La Cienega.

234
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,623
- I cut up some papaya.
- Thanks.

235
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,578
You seem happy.

236
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,781
- Sorry.
- No, I like it. I like to see you happy.

237
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,620
- I'm glad you're here.
- I told you I was coming home for lunch.

238
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,786
No, here in general, staying with me.

239
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,140
- You just want me to pay half the rent.
- Can I get that in cash?

240
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,305
Fat chance.

241
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,502
- How was work?
- Two cancellations this morning.

242
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,622
- Sorry.
- No, it was great.

243
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,025
I got Raul to give me a massage.

244
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,743
Really? I would have given you a massage.

245
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,544
Yeah, but you didn't train for three years
in Thailand.

246
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,900
- This guy is amazing. You should see him.
- Schedule me.

247
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,621
This looks good.

248
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,823
Look what I got.

249
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,223
Wow. I didn't know there was a video.

250
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,465
Yeah. It's new, I think.

251
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,059
"Join Nathaniel and Isabel
on their fantastic adventures."

252
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,308
I'm not sure I would call
being repeatedly traumatised an adventure.

253
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,818
- We gotta watch it tonight.
- All right.

254
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,618
Thought I might find you here.
You certainly do keep to a schedule.

255
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,706
Hello, Arthur.

256
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,222
- Have you done the whites yet?
- I'm doing them right now.

257
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,501
I have some kerchiefs and undershirts to do.

258
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,142
Some people call them wife-beaters,
which I think is funny.

259
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,580
There's nothing funny about beating your wife.

260
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,748
No, of course not.
I didn't mean to suggest otherwise.

261
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,065
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps what?

262
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,182
Perhaps you'd prefer it
if our laundry didn't mix any more.

263
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,188
Honestly, Arthur,
I don't care what our laundry does.

264
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,224
What are you still doing here?

266
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,024
I'm waiting for you. I figured
you had to come back and get your stuff.

267
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,939
I was walking round campus cursing to myself,
bumming cigarettes off people.

268
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,187
- You don't smoke.
- I know. And I'm feeling kind of nauseous.

269
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,821
What's going on?

270
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,828
What was all that with Olivier about?

271
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,862
I don't know. I think I'm just going crazy.

272
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,901
Why?

273
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,660
Claire, I need to tell you something.

274
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,549
The words every woman longs to hear.

275
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,381
I'm sorry. I'm listening.

276
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,906
I fooled around with Olivier.

277
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,743
What?

278
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,907
- When?
- The day you went to Azusa.

279
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,669
You said nothing happened.

280
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,224
- You lied to me?
- Sorry.

281
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,987
What do you mean, fooled around?
What exactly did you do?

282
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,989
- Claire, I don't think you wanna know.
- Yeah, I do wanna know.

283
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,986
Claire, we had sex.

284
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,540
Russell, I trusted you.

285
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,425
You told me I didn't have to be careful.
You said I could feel safe with you.

286
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,181
I know, and I feel awful.

287
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,188
- So you really are gay?
- No, of course not.

288
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,666
I think I might be bi, but I'm not sure.

289
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,941
I'm just really... I'm fucking confused.

290
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,147
I'm sorry you're fucking confused.

291
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,227
But you sure didn't seem confused
every time we fucked

292
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,309
or every time you said you loved me,
which I was stupid enough to believe.

293
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,025
- I do love you.
- You show it by sucking your professor's dick.

294
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,619
- I already feel like an asshole.
- You are an asshole!

295
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,469
Thanks.

296
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,059
So what goes on between us
is not enough for you?

297
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,101
I don't know.

298
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,506
Have you ever had sex with a man before?

299
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,179
- No. Never.
- But you've obviously thought about it.

300
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,348
I was high, I'm fucking confused...

301
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,026
- I had to tell you.
- Well, thanks.

302
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,420
- You forgive me?
- No.

303
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,108
Fuck you.

304
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,864
- Claire...
- I don't ever want to see you again.

305
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,140
- Claire...
- Don't even call me.

306
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,181
Claire...

307
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,661
- Hey.
- Hey.

308
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,622
- Cute little girl.
- Thank you.

309
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,742
- So's your boy. How old is he?
- 16 months.

310
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,868
- Haven't seen you here before.
- I'm usually stuck at work. My wife takes her.

311
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,140
- How about you?
- Divorced.

312
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,906
No, it's actually really good.

313
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,747
- Really?
- Yeah.

314
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,021
I get Nick two days a week.
Get to take him to the park.

315
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,743
- That's great.
- Hey, Sarah.

316
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,027
Hey, Sarah, hang on.

317
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,669
I can't imagine seeing you
only two days a week.

318
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,701
You wanna talk to your mommy?

319
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,741
- Hello?
- Hey.

320
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,749
I'm at the park with Maya
and I wish you were with us.

321
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,578
Wow, that sounds nice. Hi, sweetie.

322
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,861
She's a little preoccupied watching a squirrel.

323
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,549
- I'm looking at the ocean.
- Yeah? Nice?

324
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,182
It's gorgeous.

325
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,188
- Lise?
- Nate? Nate?

326
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,346
I miss you.

327
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,858
Nate? Nate?

328
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,901
Lise, I'm losing you.

329
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,663
You know what your mom's doing right now?

330
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,985
She's looking out at the ocean.

331
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,543
You know what's more beautiful
than the ocean?

332
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,706
You. Oh, yeah.

333
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,827
My grandfather, my great-grandmother.

334
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,026
I didn't know they were buried here.

335
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,220
My grandfather was in the navy.

336
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,468
He brought the whole family from Chicago
after World War II.

337
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,546
We own all these plots.

338
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,787
- Are you going to be buried here?
- I don't know.

339
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,663
I feel so disconnected from my family.

340
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,903
It'd be nice if you and I
could be buried next to each other.

341
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,420
- Grandma wants to know if you're ready to go.
- Yeah, we'll follow you back to the house.

342
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,908
Taylor, how are you doing here?
Are you happy?

343
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,384
Grandma and Grandpa treat you good?

344
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,139
Yeah. Grandma thinks Grandpa spoils me,
but I like it.

345
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,109
He made me a bunk bed because I asked
him to. Even though I'm just one person.

346
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,540
I get to sleep on the top and the bottom
whenever I want.

347
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,026
- Grandpa isn't mean to you?
- How come you always ask me that?

348
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,063
- Don't you like Grandpa?
- Of course I do. He's my dad.

349
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,865
He was so happy you were coming.
He bought steaks. Said it was your favourite.

350
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,421
I think I should talk to my dad.

351
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,900
Yeah, talk to him. I think that's great.

352
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,910
And one, two, three and five, six, seven.
And one, two, three and five, six, seven.

353
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,862
Cross by me, five, six, seven.

354
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,061
Rico, you're so good.

355
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,581
- Very suave. You look so handsome.
- Thank you.

356
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,508
Dancing makes me feel sexy. Do I look sexy?

357
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,666
You look amazing.

358
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,145
Now we're gonna do an outside turn.

359
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,423
Open break. Back to basic.

360
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,064
I like that. Spin me again.

361
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,900
- No, we have to wait until he says.
- OK, whatever. I'll wait.

362
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,182
All right, everybody,
give yourselves a little applause.

363
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,982
Very good. Short break.

364
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,870
When you come back I'll teach you
how to do the cuddle position.

365
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,299
- Very good.
- Why do I like that?

366
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,742
- I need some water. I'm thirsty. Are you?
- Yeah, a little.

367
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,586
I spilled it.

368
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,066
- This is fun, huh?
- God, this is great. I love dancing.

369
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,785
You're so good at it.
We should go dancing every night.

370
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,948
- The kids might miss us after a while.
- Oh, yeah. The kids.

371
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,062
- You think they're OK? Shall we call them?
- They're fine.

372
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,739
They can come dancing too.
We'll all go dancing.

373
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,100
Shit, these shoes are so tight.
I shouldn't have bought them.

374
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,189
- But they look sexy, right?
- Very sexy.

375
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,188
OK, everybody. Back to your positions.

376
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,143
Come on, line up. Good. Back to basic.

377
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,985
This storm is exceedingly fierce, Nathaniel.
Hang on.

378
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,339
This really sucks.

379
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,501
I know.

380
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,667
It looks like drawings in the mall
by a third-grade class.

381
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,386
- I was really looking forward to this.
- Maybe it'll get better.

382
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,184
Isabel, you've saved me so many times.

383
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,188
Please, Isabel. Please don't die.

384
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,021
- He saves Isabel's life with a fucking tear?
- How did it happen in the book?

385
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,220
Persimmons and pineapples, Isabell

386
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,023
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
which makes sense.

387
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,220
Not some fucking magic tear.

388
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,500
Thanks to you.

389
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,868
- Curses.
- What? What is it?

390
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,663
Nurse Caterwaul.

391
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,224
Children...

392
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,101
I can't even watch this any more.

393
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,505
Billy, chill. It's just a video.

394
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,586
But they ruined it.

395
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,021
They're so fucking sanitised.
There's not any real danger.

396
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,825
And you can't have people say "persimmons
and pineapples" with an American accent.

397
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,941
What a piece of shit!

398
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,339
Hey. It's no big deal.

399
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,580
Yes, it is. It was Dad, you know.

400
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,229
- Dad what?
- Dad who gave us the book.

401
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,261
- Remember?
- Kind of.

402
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,064
He gave it to us for Christmas.

403
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,180
And now Dad's dead.

404
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,820
And our whole childhood sucked.

405
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,024
And Nathaniel and Isabel was the only
good thing we had, and they ruined it.

406
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,660
They didn't ruin it.

407
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,669
We still have it. We'll always have it.

408
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,543
We're so damaged, Bren.

409
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,225
We can go about our lives
and pretend everything's gonna be OK,

410
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,465
but it never will be, ever.

411
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,501
That's not true.

412
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,741
- We're getting better, both of us.
- You are.

413
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,629
- I'm not.
- Come on, you know you are.

414
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,509
I really don't feel like I am.

415
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,990
Those are just feelings.

416
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,661
This is just right now.

417
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,987
And the movie and Dad dying and me
moving in has brought up a lot of stuff for you.

418
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,583
You'll work through it. It'll get better.

419
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,906
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

420
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,864
You gonna help me?

421
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,266
Of course I'll help you. Stupid.

422
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,625
I'm so glad you're here.

423
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,225
I love you so much, Bren.

424
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,221
I love you too.

425
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,462
- Billy!
- What? What?

426
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,469
- Don't ever do that to me.
- It was just a kiss.

427
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,618
No, it wasn't.

428
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,946
I was just being affectionate. I love you.

429
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,142
- I gotta go.
- What? Brenda, wait. What?

430
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,227
No. OK, let's watch another video. Come on.

431
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,785
We'll watch a good one this time. Brenda!

432
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,062
- Sorry.
- You OK? Are you tired?

433
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,946
Maybe.

434
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,379
- You wanna rest?
- No.

435
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,987
Yes... and no.

436
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,428
Are you OK?

437
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,223
My heart's beating so fast.

438
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,783
- I'm so dizzy.
- Whoa.

439
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,428
- Baby, what's wrong?
- I need some air.

440
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,339
- I'm gonna take you to the hospital.
- No. In my purse. My pill thing.

441
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,706
- Jesus.
- The Zanex.

442
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,867
- Which one's the Zanex?
- The blue one.

443
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,060
Which blue one?

444
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,859
Just hold my hand, OK? Just hold on to me.

445
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,901
OK.

446
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,701
My mother says you won't leave.

447
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,629
I had to see you. It's driving me crazy
thinking you're mad at me.

448
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,104
I'm supposed to make you feel better?

449
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,347
I don't want this to end. I need this.

450
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,425
I need you.

451
00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:00,989
I'm sorry, I just can't be with somebody
who's this confused.

452
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,785
I know I'm confused, but the one thing
I'm completely sure of is that I love you.

453
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,702
And I believe you.

454
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,867
But I have been through this before.

455
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm not some nurse
who's here to take care of the misfits.

456
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,821
I'm sorry, but whatever it is you're going
through, you'll have to figure it out alone.

457
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,861
We should be together.

458
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,220
We're both crazy, we're both fucked-up artists.

459
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,420
I mean, we have to be together.

460
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,779
I don't think so.

461
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,259
- I'm gonna change your mind, I swear.
- Please just leave me alone.

462
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,622
I would cut out my heart and give it to you
in a box if it would change anything.

463
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,742
Well, it would, cos you'd be dead, OK?
Goodbye.

464
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,101
Claire?

465
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:13,502
- Did you get Taylor off to bed?
- Yeah. I can't believe how grown-up she is.

466
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,020
She politely informed us
that she's too old to play with Barbies.

467
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,743
And insisted she read us a bedtime story.

468
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,941
- She's smart. Doing well in school.
- Good.

469
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,619
She misses her momma,
but we deal with that the best we can.

470
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,230
She seems happy. I'm glad this is working out.

471
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,465
Of course it's working out.

472
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,829
- Lucille, can I help you in the kitchen?
- Sure, David. Thanks.

473
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,499
Dad, I need to talk to you about something.

474
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,020
Look, I...

475
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,381
I know things haven't always been so smooth
between you and me.

476
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,898
I've been working on some things in therapy.

477
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,302
I've come to realise that I was traumatised
by the way you punished me and Carla.

478
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,309
That was abusive. That was abuse.

479
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,944
- Abuse?
- I know you did the best you could.

480
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,541
You were probably repeating what happened
to you, but it did a number on me and Carla.

481
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,024
I'm to blame
for your sister's drug problems?

482
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,905
No, I wanna acknowledge the truth
about what happened so I can forgive you.

483
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,228
- You wanna forgive me?
- Yeah.

484
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,018
So we can have a real relationship
while we still have time.

485
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,427
What are you talking about? I disciplined
my children when they deserved it.

486
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,030
I gave you a home. I gave you food to eat.

487
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,823
I taught you how to be a man.
You wanna forgive me?

488
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:50,990
Get on your knees and thank me and maybe
I'll forgive you for being a goddamn faggot.

489
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,818
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- I said I wanna hear you thank me.

490
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,180
Who do you think you pushing, boy?

491
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,348
- Your son was only trying to reach out to you.
- Who the fuck are you again?

492
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,588
- I'm the man your son is in love with.
- It makes me sick to my stomach.

493
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,704
How the fuck can you act so goddamn superior
when everyone knows you beat your kids,

494
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,548
- Cheated on your wife?
- I did not. How dare you?

495
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,266
- Keith, you need to tell him.
- This isn't the place for you to say that.

496
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,019
- It's not my place?
- No, this is my family. Stay out of it.

497
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,821
Then I can't be here.

498
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,104
David...

499
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,224
Should have knocked his teeth out
for what he said to me.

500
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,261
You're pathetic.

501
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,427
It's a bit different
than the music Mommy plays, isn't it?

502
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,100
I couldn't stand hearing that one more time.
I'd tear my head off.

503
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,140
It's open. Come on up.

504
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,469
The pizza man.
Ready for your first taste of pepperoni?

505
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,263
Brenda, hey.

506
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,064
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go
and didn't have your number.

507
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,581
- No, that's fine. Come on in.
- Sure I'm not interrupting anything?

508
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,745
No. Lisa's gone. I'm just introducing Maya
to some music that doesn't suck.

509
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,107
- What's wrong?
- Billy.

510
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,309
Let me put Maya down in her playpen.

511
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,663
Ever since your father died,
I've just flitted from man to man.

512
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,099
I am so embarrassed.

513
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:56,749
I mean, look, you got married
when you were 19. That's how old I am.

514
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,705
You never even got to have your sexual 20s,
so why shouldn't you do it now?

515
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,344
You don't have to worry about us any more.

516
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,381
No.

517
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,706
Did you know I got pregnant
the first time I ever had sex?

518
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,541
My God.

519
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,265
- With Dad?
- Of course.

520
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,781
I thought you were gonna tell me I had
some love child half-brother somewhere,

521
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,628
which I don't think I could handle right now.

522
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,661
No, it was Nate.

523
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,782
Nathaniel and I had to get married right away.

524
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,345
Both our families were mortified.

525
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,983
It changed my life for ever.

526
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,821
Do you ever wonder how your life
would be different if that hadn't happened?

527
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,065
I used to. Not any more.

528
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,869
- Were you and Dad in love with each other?
- Yes.

529
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,583
Very much so at first.

530
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,260
Despite how we grew apart,
your father was the great love of my life.

531
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,499
At least you had that.
I'm beginning to think I never will.

532
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:19,580
You will. Everyone does. But chances are
it won't be anything like you expect.

533
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,103
I miss Dad, you know.

534
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,259
I feel like... I hate how I just took him
for granted my whole life

535
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,349
and now he's gone and it's too late for me
to ever really know him,

536
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,223
you know, like as an adult.

537
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,386
I miss him too.

538
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,629
There will never be another man
who will love me when I'm young and pretty

539
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,221
and always have that picture of me
somewhere in his heart.

540
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:57,062
Mom, you're still pretty. God, you're beautiful.

541
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,341
Why do you think all these men
are always hitting on you?

542
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:05,418
You're so sweet. But look at the men!

543
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,779
I'm sitting here crying over Arthur.

544
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,259
- What should I do about him?
- Run.

545
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,380
I feel sorry for him, though. He's so naive.

546
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,787
Yeah. I feel sorry for Russell too.

547
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,029
I mean, I hate him,

548
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,709
but I feel sorry for him.

549
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,145
Mom, why is it I attract
every screwed-up guy in the state?

550
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,780
Because they can see
what a kind soul you have.

551
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,549
That you're caring and sensitive.

552
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,980
It's the truth, Claire. You're an angel.

553
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,069
But the real question is, why do you like them?

554
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,025
It's like I'll fall for any guy
who shows any interest in me.

555
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,265
I guess we all wanna be loved.

556
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,509
It's hard to say no to that,
no matter who it's coming from.

557
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,508
Right from the beginning there was this voice
saying, "Don't move in with Billy."

558
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,946
What do I do? I move in with Billy.

559
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,060
So self-destructive.

560
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:31,346
Maybe you wanted to believe
the world is a better place than it really is.

561
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:37,101
- So I'm an idiot?
- No. Just a very positive person.

562
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,226
That doesn't sound like me.

563
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,708
It's scary to hope things will turn out good
because you risk being disappointed.

564
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:53,100
- Wow. You've really thought about this.
- No, I'm talking out of my ass.

565
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,266
I have no clue whatsoever.

566
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,748
Look, all I know is you're a good person
who deserves to be happy.

567
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,298
So are you, you know.

568
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,942
Well, I should go.

569
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,504
- Sure you're gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

570
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,541
You've got my number?

571
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,747
Thank you.

572
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,940
What are friends for?

573
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

574
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,784
- This isn't right.
- I'm gonna go.

575
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,543
I can't believe I just did that. You're married.

576
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,468
- Yes, I'm married.
- I'm sorry. I'm worse than Billy.

577
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,183
No, I was right there too.

578
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,540
I'm so fucking predictable.
I'm gonna leave now.

579
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,980
- You have a place to go?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

580
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,221
Hey, sailor.

581
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,786
- Patrick, I can't believe you're here.
- I got your message.

582
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,900
You sounded miserable.

583
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,941
Yeah.

584
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,221
I'll drive you home. You can tell me all about it.

585
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,384
I still can't believe you're here.

586
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,580
I can't sleep at night anyway.

587
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,585
Hey, Barb, it's Nate. Is Lisa there?

588
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,102
I don't know. She could be in traffic.
I'll try her on her cell.

589
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,586
Listen, if you talk to her first,
make sure she calls me.

590
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,621
Right. Bye.

591
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,462
Hey, Lise. You taking the scenic route up?

592
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:53,783
Anyway, Maya's sleeping. I just wanted
to hear your voice, know you're OK.

593
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,503
I love you.

594
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,541
Call me when you get this.

595
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,343
Hey, sweetie. Let's get you ready for bed.

596
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,706
- Come on. Up you go.
- No, leave me here.

597
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,741
I'm too tired to move.

598
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,109
Hello?

599
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,223
Hey, Lise. I was hoping to reach you.

600
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,619
It's late and I'm starting to worry.

601
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,822
I love you. Just... call me.

602
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,265
Call me. I love you.
