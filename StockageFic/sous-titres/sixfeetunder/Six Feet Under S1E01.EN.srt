1
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,368
Sleek, Sophisticated, Seductive,

2
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,570
The new Millennium Edition
Crown Royal funeral coach,

3
00:01:53,777 --> 00:02:00,012
Because your loved one deserves
the very best in style and comfort,

4
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,130
- Nathaniel Fisher.
- Nathaniel?

5
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,453
It's Ruth. Did you take your
blood pressure medication today?

6
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,173
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me.

7
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,214
I took it, What do you want
me to do, OD on it?

8
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,778
Oh, and I just realized we don't have
any of that soy stuff Nate drinks.

9
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:51,132
You know, since he gave up milk.
I don't know what it's called.

10
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,732
Why not just cut some milk with tap
water? He'll never know the difference,

11
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,217
Look, if you don't want to go, I'll go.

12
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,652
It's not as if I don't have enough
to do already.

13
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:01,659
I'm kidding, I'll get some.

14
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:06,458
But it has to be after I pick up Nate
at the airport. I'm already running late.

15
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,062
Nathaniel!

16
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,981
- Are you smoking?
- Nope.

17
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:14,017
- Yes, you are. I heard you.
- I'm not, No, I'm not.

18
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:18,421
Look, forget you'll give yourself cancer
and die a slow and horrible death.

19
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:21,184
You should not be stinking up
that new hearse,

20
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:24,854
- I told you not to let him take it.
- Like I could've stopped him.

21
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:28,898
He's as proud of that thing as your fool
brother was of that damn motorcycle.

22
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:30,822
And who still has a pin in his foot?

23
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:35,304
Nathaniel, people want things
to be nice when there's a funeral.

24
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,383
They don't want their loved ones riding
in something that smells like an ashtray.

25
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:44,218
All right, look. I'm quitting right now.
I promise.

26
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,178
Okay? I'll see you tonight.

27
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,385
That new hearse
was a total waste of money.

28
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:20,227
There was nothing wrong
with the old one.

29
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:24,468
I think your father's having
some sort of midlife crisis.

30
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,581
It would've made more sense
to invest in repaneling the chapel...

31
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,666
...or adding coffee bars
to the slumber rooms.

32
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,781
Well, I'd much rather he buy himself
a fancy new hearse...

33
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,629
...than leave me for a younger woman.

34
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,742
Or a woman my age,
for that matter.

35
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,819
Or heaven forbid, a man,
like my cousin Hannah's husband did.

36
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,023
God sure has dealt that woman
some blows in this life.

37
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,783
Mom.

38
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,184
Can I do anything to help?

39
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,383
No, no, honey. I'm fine.

40
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,106
Besides, don't you
have a viewing tonight?

41
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:06,783
- You should probably be getting ready.
- Right.

42
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:20,742
So I enjoyed talking to you
about that whole shiatsu thing.

43
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,864
I really hope that pans out for you.

44
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,668
You should let me
work on you sometime.

45
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:29,913
Here's my cell number.
I'll be here until the 29th.

46
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:32,264
Here you go.

47
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,265
My dad was supposed
to meet me here.

48
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:42,467
- I could give you a ride.
- I'm sure he'll be here soon enough.

49
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,508
I wasn't talking about that kind of ride.

50
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,871
You've done a nice job.

51
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:58,074
- She looks so peaceful.
- Well, she is at peace now.

52
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:04,716
If there's any justice in the universe,
she's shoveling shit in hell.

53
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,313
Excuse me.

54
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:12,430
- David Fisher.
- David, it's Claire.

55
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,310
- Is Nate there yet?
- Nope.

56
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:16,190
I thought he was coming
so we could do...

57
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:18,593
...the forced Christmas Eve family thing.
- Well...

58
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,517
There are some really excellent parties
I could be going to.

59
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:23,754
Claire.

60
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:26,508
This is one of the few times
we're all together.

61
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,279
Don't get all Pat Robertson on me,
I'll be there,

62
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,348
I have to drop some stuff off at a friend's
house before I head over, okay? Bye.

63
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,674
Fucking Boy Scout.

64
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,479
Attention, passengers of flight 71...

65
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,954
This is kind of disgusting.

66
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,233
- Disgusting good or disgusting bad?
- Disgusting very good.

67
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,556
I know.

68
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,878
- You are so fucking hot.
- You're so sweet.

69
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,912
I'm a sweet guy.

70
00:06:57,121 --> 00:07:00,113
Shut up and fuck me.

71
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,801
Hello.

72
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,076
This is Ruth Fisher.

73
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:14,079
Yes, I'm his wife.

74
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,591
What is this about?

75
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,594
What?!

76
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:36,280
Excuse me.

77
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,683
Mom, what the hell are you...?

78
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,677
There's been an accident.

79
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,797
The new hearse is totaled.

80
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,118
Your father is dead.

81
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:59,401
Your father is dead,
and my pot roast is ruined.

82
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:01,119
Oh, my God.

83
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:06,004
You carry a lot of tension
around in your lower back.

84
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,479
Not as much as 20 minutes ago.

85
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:16,076
Just so you know...

86
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,086
...I never do this.

87
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:23,122
Oh, yeah. Me neither.

88
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,999
So...

89
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,120
...were you ever gonna
tell me your name?

90
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,843
Probably not.

91
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,724
Why not?

92
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,443
Because I'm a realist.

93
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,527
That's my father looking for me.

94
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,569
Hey, Dad.

95
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,764
Oh, Dave, hey. Merry Christmas.

96
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:05,806
Of course I'm okay.
Couldn't be better in fact.

97
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,329
What?

98
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:19,324
I'm so sorry, Nate. I hate
to have to be the one to tell you.

99
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:34,572
This is just speed, right?
Promise me this isn't crack.

100
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,288
I'm having Christmas Eve dinner
with my demented family.

101
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,724
It'll be weird enough
without being high on crack.

102
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:46,169
No, it's just crystal meth. It just makes
everything burn a little bit brighter.

103
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:50,849
And it makes sex, like, totally primal.

104
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:55,894
Here. It's all right.

105
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:07,253
Oh, well, it's too late now.

106
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:08,845
It's mine.

107
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:14,133
Hello? David, hi.

108
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,611
Hang on a second.

109
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:22,413
So is Nate there yet?

110
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:27,646
No, he's still at the airport.
Claire, I've got bad news.

111
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:29,411
What?

112
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,096
Yeah, sure.

113
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,972
Okay, I'm on my way.

114
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,775
I have to go.

115
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,448
- No fucking way!
- Excuse me.

116
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,378
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

117
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,732
- You're coming back, right?
- I don't think so.

118
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:11,380
My dad just got hit by a bus,
and it broke his neck, and he's dead.

119
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:16,971
I gotta pick up my mom and bring her to
the morgue so she can identify his body.

120
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:23,937
No, I'm not kidding.
This is actually happening.

121
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,370
And now I'm high on crack!

122
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,620
- Crystal.
- Whatever!

123
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:31,418
So I guess this whole hellish experience
I'm about to go through...

124
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:33,898
...is just gonna burn
a little brighter now, right?

125
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:37,778
Great! Thank you! Fuck!

126
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:48,297
You really didn't have to do this.
I could've rented a car.

127
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,382
It's okay.
You're in no shape to drive.

128
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:56,580
I'm in no hurry to get home to my
family's annual Christmas Eve massacre.

129
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,181
Parents who stayed together
for the children...

130
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,934
...but really because they got off
on tormenting each other so much.

131
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,865
Manic-depressive brother...

132
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:09,263
...who always chooses the holidays
to go off his medication.

133
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:14,586
And an ancient springer spaniel who's
completely blind, deaf and incontinent.

134
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:19,020
What about you?

135
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,741
Actually, we're pretty normal.

136
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:24,222
My mom's a control freak.

137
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,782
My brother...

138
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,296
...well, he's a control freak too.

139
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,500
And my sister...

140
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:37,538
Well, I left home before she was born
so I never really knew her that well...

141
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,820
...but she's kind of wild like I was.
- Was?

142
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,945
My dad really rode my ass
when I was a kid.

143
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,463
I couldn't go rafting because
he buried a girl who drowned.

144
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:56,379
He buries this dipshit loser who OD'd
at a Flock of Seagulls concert...

145
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,865
...and I'm not allowed to go
to concerts for a year.

146
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,628
Your dad worked in a cemetery?

147
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,789
How could a man who's so scared of
everything, who never had an accident...

148
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,303
...or a speeding ticket in his entire life,
how could he have a car wreck?

149
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:14,983
Are you mad at him,
or the fact that we're all gonna die?

150
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,910
- Are you a shrink?
- No! God, no. No!

151
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,865
Both my parents are.

152
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,624
So, what else do you
want to talk about?

153
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,709
The weather?

154
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:35,542
Or the fact that we both
just fucked a perfect stranger?

155
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:39,541
And that we both lied
when we said we never did that.

156
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:52,223
- Wonderful service.
- Yes, it was. Very nice.

157
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,666
She looked so peaceful.
Thank you so much.

158
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,787
- You're welcome.
- Wonderful job.

159
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,634
Did you know that
before you were born...

160
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:17,794
...funeral homes
ran the ambulance business?

161
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,952
No.

162
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:24,675
Hearses were the only vehicles
that could transport people lying down.

163
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,790
Your father used to joke about that.

164
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:33,148
"Just drive him around the block
a few more times.

165
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:36,907
We won't need to stop
at the hospital. "

166
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:40,396
You're kind of freaking me out
right now.

167
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,748
Claire...

168
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,032
...are you having sex?
- What?

169
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,833
Or doing drugs?

170
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,678
Why are you asking me this right now?

171
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,598
Your father is dead.

172
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,033
I can't even remember the last time you
and I talked about anything important.

173
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,152
I need to know you're okay.

174
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,078
Oh, yeah.

175
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,472
Believe me, I'm okay.

176
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:16,639
You know, considering.

177
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:25,314
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

178
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,990
I wanted to compliment you
on the music.

179
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:32,912
I've been to three funerals this year.
Cancer, stroke, pediatric leukemia...

180
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:36,320
...and the music is always
that same sad organ music.

181
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,593
It reminds me of soap operas
my mom watched...

182
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:43,354
...before I started kindergarten. Oh, God,
you're probably too young to remember.

183
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:48,876
Anyway, I so prefer this light classical,
you know, chamber orchestra stuff.

184
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,554
It's still spiritual, but doesn't
seem so dated or depressing.

185
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:53,913
I studied music appreciation.

186
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,116
You think I'm really boring, don't you?
Well, get used to it,

187
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,837
Now that your father is dead...

188
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:01,114
...you can forget
about going to law school,

189
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:05,204
It's just you and dead people and freaks
like me for the rest of your life!

190
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:16,282
Mom.

191
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:21,038
Mom, I'm so sorry.

192
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:25,479
Who's she?

193
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,083
- This is...
- Brenda Chenowith.

194
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,482
Brenda Chenowith.

195
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:36,122
Brenda, this is my mom,
Ruth Fisher.

196
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,877
And my sister, Claire.

197
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:44,003
- Nate, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, just give me a minute.

198
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,722
- Mom, did you already do the...?
- I can't.

199
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:50,200
I've seen too many dead people
in my life. They're work.

200
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:55,278
I won't see your father that way.
I need you to do it.

201
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,766
Nate, I need to talk to you now,
please. It's urgent.

202
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,046
- So how did you and my son meet?
- In cooking class.

203
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,407
I have to tell somebody.
I am tweaking.

204
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,683
- Yeah, we're all upset.
- No, I'm high on crystal.

205
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:20,530
I smoked some with some friends
before David called me.

206
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,926
- You did what?
- Don't worry, it's the first time.

207
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:24,723
But I think I'm having a meltdown...

208
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:28,719
...and I can't tell if it's Dad being dead
or the crystal, but...

209
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,652
I'm really scared.

210
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,320
You cannot do this to me right now.

211
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,682
Don't be a narc.
We smoked pot at Thanksgiving.

212
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:40,248
Look, I have to go identify
our dead father's body.

213
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:44,890
I'm sorry you're having
a bad drug experience, but deal with it.

214
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:14,210
Well?

215
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,245
Well, well,

216
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:20,686
The prodigal returns,

217
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:24,366
This is what you've been running away
from your whole life, buddy-boy.

218
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:27,488
Scared the crap out of you
when you were growing up, didn't it?

219
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,855
And you thought you'd escape,
well, guess what?

220
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:35,407
Nobody escapes.

221
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:44,216
- Well?
- Yeah, that's him.

222
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:51,296
Okay, let's get out of here.

223
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,208
How'd he look?

224
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,455
Dead.

225
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,776
Will there need to be
a lot of reconstruction?

226
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:05,573
David's not that skilled
at the really hard stuff.

227
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,852
Federico usually does that.
He's quite gifted.

228
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,855
You don't think we'll have
to have a closed casket, do you?

229
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,528
- I would hate to send that message.
- What message?

230
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,254
That we're not equipped to handle
a major restoration...

231
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,658
...or that we're not proud of our work.
- Can we talk about this later?

232
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,173
We should really get Nate home.
He's probably exhausted. Let's go.

233
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,331
Thanks for driving me here.

234
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:47,378
Please. I'm just avoiding my own hell.
I'm a big coward.

235
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,818
Me too.

236
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,942
I don't know if I can handle this.

237
00:19:56,143 --> 00:20:00,137
Well, you're about to find out.

238
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:03,936
I wish you the best, Nate.

239
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,896
Goodbye.

240
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:25,343
Claire.

241
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:31,100
- You're driving too fast.
- This isn't fast. You wanna see fast?

242
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,254
Pull over!

243
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,977
Listen, do you do a lot of drugs?

244
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:51,941
What? No.
And it's none of your business.

245
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,342
Yes, it is my business.

246
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:56,506
You were driving like a maniac.
You could've gotten us killed.

247
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,586
What the hell is this?
You're not my father.

248
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,744
You split as soon as you could.
You don't even know me.

249
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:05,988
So don't start thinking you can
tell me what to do, okay?

250
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,547
So where's Dad, downstairs already?

251
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,742
He's still in the morgue.

252
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:31,188
You didn't bring him back with you?

253
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,746
Oh, dear.

254
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:36,585
That didn't even cross my mind.

255
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,626
We should've taken the van
so we could bring him home.

256
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:45,462
I'm sorry.
That was very stupid of me.

257
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,668
Nice going, Dave.

258
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:55,433
Like she doesn't have enough
to feel bad about right now?

259
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,909
Things have to be done.
Federico's downstairs, ready to start.

260
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:02,628
Every second we wait will only make
Dad's restoration more difficult.

261
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:07,464
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you, bag boy?

262
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,103
"Bag boy"?

263
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:14,866
I'm assistant manager of organic produce
at Seattle's highest volume food co-op.

264
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:18,750
Jesus, pull your dicks out and measure
them. Let's get this over with.

265
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,269
Were we supposed to throw Dad
in the back of Claire's car?

266
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,545
It is a hearse!

267
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:28,588
Yeah, hi. It's David Fisher.

268
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:31,185
Yeah, so I need to come
pick up the body.

269
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:33,432
These people mean nothing to me,

270
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:37,106
Know you not the family of the man
who has slaved for you...

271
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,750
...from dawn to dark
these many years?

272
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:41,833
They appear to be so happy...

273
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:45,666
- I made you some dinner.
- I'm so not hungry.

274
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:50,473
We have to eat, Claire.
We didn't die.

275
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,550
What is that?

276
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:58,354
- For your father,
your brother, Tiny Tim,

277
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,469
On three. One. Two. Three.

278
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,795
Really sorry, man.

279
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,278
Thanks.

280
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:46,470
For a body that's firm, yet flexible,

281
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,913
For skin that begs to be touched,

282
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:54,434
For the velvety appearance
of actual living tissue...

283
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:59,194
...top morticians rely on Living Splendor
embalming fluid,

284
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:04,477
Living Splendor,
Only real life is better,

285
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:57,598
Hey, buddy-boy.

286
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,920
Come on in, it's okay.

287
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:04,997
Say hello to Mr. Bloomberg.

288
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:10,759
There isn't anything to be afraid of, Nate.
Mr. Bloomberg's dead.

289
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,041
I'm getting him ready so his family
can see him for the last time...

290
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,241
...and say goodbye to him.
It'll make them feel better.

291
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:20,157
That's what Daddy does.

292
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,160
What do you got?

293
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,403
You got me.

294
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,763
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

295
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,246
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

296
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:48,924
Nate!

297
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:51,001
What's up?

298
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:57,724
- Hey, Rico.
- It's good to see you.

299
00:26:00,252 --> 00:26:02,527
Really sorry about your dad, man.

300
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:06,885
But, well, you know,
when your time's up, it's up, right?

301
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:09,049
How's he doing?

302
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:10,727
So far so good.

303
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,925
I really appreciate you coming in
on Christmas Eve, Federico.

304
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:17,604
It's the least I could do for Mr. F.
Everything he did for me.

305
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:21,730
I was gonna be up all night anyway,
putting together useless shit...

306
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,686
...Santa Claus is bringing my kid.

307
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:26,966
We don't use that kind of language
in here. Show some respect.

308
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:37,363
- You need something?
- No.

309
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:39,645
I just...

310
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:41,651
David Fisher.

311
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:47,085
Hey, I just want to remind you, don't
eat too much with your family tonight...

312
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:51,369
...because I am making you something
totally decadent and fatty for dessert.

313
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,052
Hold just a second, please.

314
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:03,692
Hi.

315
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:07,734
Keith, I'm sorry, I can't make it,

316
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,053
Why not?

317
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:13,174
My father was just killed
in a car accident.

318
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:16,017
Oh, shit. David, I'm so sorry.

319
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,890
What can I do?

320
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,818
Nothing, thanks.
But I have to stay here.

321
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,695
Listen, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call me.

322
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:28,015
Sure,

323
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:32,338
I mean it, David. You don't
have to go through this alone.

324
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,495
I gotta go.

325
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,417
Okay, here it goes.

326
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,135
This is the one I'm most proud of.

327
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:49,176
The husband, okay?
He got fired, flipped out...

328
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:52,817
...shot his wife point-blank in the head,
then shot himself in the mouth.

329
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:57,220
Some seriously closed-casket shit, right?
Now look at this.

330
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:03,021
Like the bride and groom
on top of a cake.

331
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,332
And then we cremated them.

332
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:09,580
What a fucking waste.

333
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:13,978
Actually...

334
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:17,335
...this right here is...
This is my best work.

335
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:21,732
Wait a minute, this kid
was born just last month.

336
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:26,142
He'll be 4 fucking years old in April,
can you believe it?

337
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,539
Vanessa's pregnant again.

338
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,576
You stud!

339
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:38,622
Hey, it wasn't planned. You know what?
Neither was this one.

340
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:42,135
And he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

341
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,462
Keep an eye on those chemicals,
Federico. We don't want him to burn.

342
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,706
Hey.

343
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,303
- Where's Mom?
- She went to bed.

344
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,059
Was she feeling any better?

345
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:16,261
Yeah, Nate, she was on top
of the goddamn world.

346
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:26,104
- Where's David?
- He's downstairs, working.

347
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,869
On Dad?

348
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:32,740
Yeah, well, him and Rico.

349
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:37,463
He said not to wait up for him.
We should try and sleep.

350
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,503
Yeah, as if that were a viable option.

351
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:07,469
- You want to go to the grocery store?
- Yes. Anything to get out of here.

352
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:35,113
Well, it's about to start
raining frogs here.

353
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:36,588
How are things on your end?

354
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,707
- God, I'm glad you called.
- Really, why?

355
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:42,793
I don't know.
Because you...

356
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:44,826
You have a calming effect on me.

357
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,826
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "projection"?

358
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,391
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "blow me"?

359
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:57,351
Come on, You grew up
with all that psychobabble,

360
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,024
You rebelled against it
every chance you got, Still do,

361
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:03,627
And that includes having sex
with strangers in closets at airports.

362
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:06,746
And you think you're
not easy to read?

363
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:10,233
Coasting by on your looks and charm
isn't working like it used to...

364
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:14,271
...but you have no idea what else to do
because you've never had to learn,

365
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:17,390
Any woman with half a brain
looks at a guy like you and thinks:

366
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,795
"Good for a hot fuck. "
But believe me, that's it.

367
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,869
L...

368
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,557
Nate, can we go home?
I really gotta take a shower.

369
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:38,391
Oh, God, Jesus Christ! Am I not allowed
to have even a single moment to myself?

370
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,035
Okay.

371
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,950
It's okay.

372
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,436
What can I do?

373
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,871
Nothing. No one can do anything.

374
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,277
- You'll have to pay for that cantaloupe.
- You fuck off!

375
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:14,676
She looked her best
every day of her life,

376
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:18,512
Don't let one horribly disfiguring
accident change that,

377
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:21,715
Use new Wound Filler
cosmetic molding putty,

378
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:24,483
Now faster setting and self-sealing...

379
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,914
...to help make masking
unsightly wounds a breeze,

380
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:47,719
Ma, you remember that stuffed dog
I used to have?

381
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,395
I dragged it around until its ears fell off,
then you made new ears out of a towel.

382
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:55,918
I hated that dog after that.
And I threw it up on the roof.

383
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:57,684
No.

384
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,035
I wanted it back and begged Dad
to get it, but he said no...

385
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:04,443
...if I really wanted it, I'd never
have thrown it in the first place.

386
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:09,198
Your father did so many wonderful things
for you, and that's all you can think of?

387
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:13,440
- I just remembered it.
- He was a good man!

388
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:21,076
I'm going running.

389
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:38,320
Oh, no, you're doing me?
You're the worst one we've got.

390
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,918
- Thanks, Dad.
- Where's Federico?

391
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:44,838
It's Christmas morning. He's with
his wife and kid. He'll be in later.

392
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,564
Couldn't this wait?
I don't want you ruining my face.

393
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,330
- It's a little late for that.
- Not funny.

394
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,239
- I need to stay busy right now.
- So go reorganize some files.

395
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,647
Or develop a new bookkeeping system.
That's what you're good at.

396
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,480
You never really had any aptitude
for this stuff.

397
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:05,047
I know.
And what did I do with my life?

398
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,085
I went to school to learn
exactly how to do this stuff.

399
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,762
Other kids my age were going
to frat parties, I was draining corpses...

400
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:15,964
...and refashioning severed ears
out of wax.

401
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:19,721
Thank God I didn't lose an ear. I can
only imagine what you'd do with that.

402
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,765
And I did it all for you.

403
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:27,647
I did it to make you happy,
you ungrateful son of a bitch.

404
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:31,130
Dave?

405
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:36,411
I just wanted to let you know
I was here.

406
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,771
We'll deal you in next hand.

407
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:32,461
- I'm about to jump out of my skin.
- Don't.

408
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:35,894
I'm just barely holding it together.
Are you still high?

409
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:41,178
- I don't know. Am I sweating?
- I know I am.

410
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,418
This is too fucking weird.
It's been three days...

411
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:50,742
...and I'm still trapped in zombie world.
- This is all happening to you.

412
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:53,504
Fuck off!

413
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:57,062
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one
who wasn't prepared for this.

414
00:36:57,265 --> 00:37:00,496
I came expecting to sleep late and chow
down on Mom's cooking for six days.

415
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:03,378
And now I find myself feeling like...

416
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:07,499
...I'm not even a part of this family.
- I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat.

417
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,140
At least you got out of here.

418
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:13,577
I live in a shitty apartment
which was supposed to be temporary.

419
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:16,016
I work at a job,
also supposed to be temporary...

420
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:20,140
...until I figured out what I wanted to do
with my life, which apparently is nothing.

421
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:23,896
I have lots of sex, but my relationships
don't last more than a couple months.

422
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:28,498
I don't even have the self-discipline
to floss daily. I've had four root canals!

423
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:32,462
I'm 35, I've had four root canals.

424
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm gonna be a loser who ends up
in his deathbed saying:

425
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:40,944
- "Where'd my life go?"
- No, you won't.

426
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:45,306
You'll be saying,
"Where the hell's the morphine?"

427
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:47,628
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

428
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:50,946
I've spent my whole fucking life
being cheerful.

429
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:55,665
I'm sorry about your father,
but he's in a much better place now.

430
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:58,748
You are so right about that.

431
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,628
Who the hell is that?

432
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:26,227
I know, Ruth.

433
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:29,471
I know everything.

434
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:35,462
I've known the Fishers
for years from church.

435
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:38,824
- You know them too?
- Yes, yes. I work here.

436
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,591
Oh, you work here.

437
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:54,234
- What are you doing here?
- I just got off duty. I came...

438
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:58,586
...to pay my respects to your father.
- You never even met my father.

439
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,355
Exactly. And you've met my parents
how many times now?

440
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:04,388
- We spent the weekend at their house.
- Don't do this to me.

441
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,870
- This is not your high-school reunion.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:08,747
This is not the time to be political.

443
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:11,470
- You think I'm here to be political?
- Keep your voice down.

444
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:15,430
What is this? We can fuck, but I can't
be a shoulder for you to cry on?

445
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,548
- I'm not crying.
- So, what am I? Am I just sex to you?

446
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,235
Jesus!

447
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:23,189
Do we really have to have
this conversation now?

448
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:26,628
Oh, shit. Here comes my mother.

449
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:32,832
- I'm so tired.
- I know, Mom. It's exhausting.

450
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,710
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

451
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:39,547
This is Keith Charles, a friend of mine.
He came to pay his respects to Dad.

452
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:43,671
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm really sorry about your husband.

453
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:50,589
- You're friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

454
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,788
Nice to meet you.

455
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,991
I'd like to see your father now.

456
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,595
Who's that cop?

457
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,719
- My Aunt Shirley was laid out here.
- Aunt Shirley, huh?

458
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,550
Shirley Hamilton.
Terrible accident, lost her ear.

459
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:19,912
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know Shirley.
I remember Shirley.

460
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:21,156
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:26,310
I was the person who sewed her ear
back on. That was me. That's my work.

462
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:42,403
What? She's sad,
so he has to get her out of sight?

463
00:40:42,603 --> 00:40:43,558
They always do that.

464
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:47,039
The second someone starts to lose it,
they take them off into that room.

465
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,438
It makes the other people uncomfortable,
I guess.

466
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:52,636
This is not about the other people!

467
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:54,800
Volume.

468
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:05,402
When I went backpacking through Europe
after I quit school...

469
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,121
...I went to this island
off the coast of Sicily.

470
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:11,317
It was this volcanic island,

471
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:14,244
And on the boat over,
there was this pine box,

472
00:41:14,445 --> 00:41:17,358
Somebody from the island
being returned to be buried there,

473
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,883
And there are all these old Sicilians
dressed up all in black...

474
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,364
...waiting, lined up on the beach,

475
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,716
And when they got
that coffin to the beach...

476
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:29,920
...those old Sicilian women went apeshit,
screaming, throwing themselves on it...

477
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,278
...beating their chests, tearing
at their hair, making animal noises,

478
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,364
It was just so...

479
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,444
So real,

480
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:40,207
I mean, I'd been around funerals
my entire life...

481
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:43,798
...but I had never seen such grief,

482
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:47,318
And at the time,
it gave me the creeps,

483
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:52,838
But now I think it's probably
so much more healthy than...

484
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,559
...this.

485
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:02,327
That cop is hot.

486
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:06,318
- Oh, David, David.
- I know, Mom.

487
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,998
It's going to be okay.
It just takes time.

488
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,680
- I've done a terrible, terrible thing.
- What?

489
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,846
I've done a terrible thing.

490
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,166
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

491
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,365
I'm not fine. I'm a whore! I was
unfaithful to your father for years!

492
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:26,200
And now he knows.
He knows.

493
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:32,727
I met a man at church once
when your father didn't come with me.

494
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:36,604
- Mom...
- And he invited me for coffee...

495
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:39,280
...and he said he liked my hair.

496
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:42,325
He's a hairdresser, a widower.

497
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:48,165
Well, they divorced before she died,
so technically I guess he's divorced.

498
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,603
He invited me to accompany him
on a hike.

499
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:52,132
This is really not the time.

500
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:55,006
- Maybe she needs to get this out.
- I don't want to hear it.

501
00:42:55,213 --> 00:42:59,002
I used to love hiking when I was
younger, and being outdoors.

502
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:01,330
I always wanted
to take you kids camping...

503
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:05,527
...but your father would never
leave the business!

504
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:11,651
Well, I can tell you. I went camping
with this man from church several times!

505
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:15,169
Told your father
I was visiting my sister.

506
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,774
If he'd ever thought to call...

507
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:19,364
Can you even begin to fathom
the impropriety of this?

508
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:21,167
Your husband is lying
in a casket.

509
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,651
David, she's grief-stricken, okay?
Fuck propriety.

510
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:25,972
We don't say that word!

511
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,247
Did you know him?

512
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:41,095
No.

513
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:43,447
Did you?

514
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:45,887
He was my father.

515
00:43:46,097 --> 00:43:48,293
You're Claire?

516
00:43:48,978 --> 00:43:50,889
- Yeah.
- Keith Charles.

517
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,577
I'm a friend of your brother's.

518
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:55,212
- Of Nate's?
- No, David's.

519
00:43:55,418 --> 00:43:59,094
- David's friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

520
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,416
- David plays racquetball?
- Excuse us.

521
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,456
You want me to cry
on your shoulder? Fine.

522
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:11,412
My mother just confessed
she was having an affair.

523
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,850
- Wow.
- Yeah, with some hairdresser...

524
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,769
...who likes to hike. Now Nate is in there
playing Mr. Sensitive with her...

525
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,495
...while her dead husband
lies in the next room. It's disgusting.

526
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,659
- Breathe. You're gonna get through this.
- Oh, I know.

527
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:28,740
I'll be the strong, stable, dependable one,
because that's what I do.

528
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:32,854
Everyone around me will fall apart
because that's what they do.

529
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:36,657
Don't you get exhausted being so hard
on everyone? And yourself?

530
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,615
Oh, shut up.

531
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:44,335
- She met him at church.
- You met me at church.

532
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:52,977
Hands.

533
00:45:00,903 --> 00:45:04,533
I didn't even realize how lonely I was...

534
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:09,534
...or how long it had been
since a man touched me like that.

535
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:16,415
Well, loneliness is a terrible thing.

536
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:20,095
I'm still a woman, you know.

537
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:22,341
Yes, I know.

538
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:28,985
And now your father sees me.
Like God sees me.

539
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:34,863
He knows everything.
I'm so ashamed.

540
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:40,299
You didn't do it to hurt anybody.

541
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:43,817
You were lonely.
I'm sure Dad forgives you.

542
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:52,063
- And God doesn't?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure he does too.

543
00:45:57,868 --> 00:46:00,223
Look, it's okay.

544
00:46:00,428 --> 00:46:04,820
Everybody forgives everybody.
For everything.

545
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,345
Fuck.

546
00:46:45,992 --> 00:46:50,065
If you're looking for the olives, honey,
they're right here.

547
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:03,429
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

548
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:07,673
...is easy as pie with Franklin's
new leak-proof earth dispenser,

549
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:10,388
Say goodbye to soiled fingers forever,

550
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:16,346
Only from Franklin Funeral Supplies,
We put the fun back in funeral,

551
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:23,473
In the midst of life,
we are in death.

552
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,985
Of whom may we seek for succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

553
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:31,029
Who for our sins art justly displeased?

554
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:34,592
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

555
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:37,469
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayer.

556
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:42,545
But spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty.

557
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:48,389
O holy and merciful savior,
thou most worthy judge eternal.

558
00:47:48,597 --> 00:47:51,236
Suffer us not, at our last hour...

559
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:56,272
...through any pains of death,
to fall from thee.

560
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:04,754
In the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life.

561
00:48:05,398 --> 00:48:08,071
Through almighty God
we commend our brother...

562
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:10,395
...Nathaniel Samuel Fisher...

563
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:14,114
...and we commit his body
to the ground.

564
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,958
He looks like he's salting popcorn.

565
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,754
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...

566
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:22,916
...dust to dust.

567
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,429
The Lord bless him and keep him.

568
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,713
The Lord make his face to shine
upon him and be gracious unto him.

569
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,800
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace.

570
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:07,161
- Nate...
- No!

571
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:09,718
I refuse to sanitize this anymore.

572
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:13,158
- This is how it's done.
- Yeah? Well, it's whacked.

573
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,037
What is this stupid saltshaker?

574
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:20,635
What is this hermetically sealed box?
This phony AstroTurf around the grave?

575
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:27,159
Jesus, David, it's like surgery.
Clean, antiseptic, business.

576
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:29,681
- He was our father!
- Please don't do this.

577
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:33,161
You can pump him full of chemicals,
you can put makeup on him...

578
00:49:33,365 --> 00:49:36,038
...and you can prop him up
for a nap in the slumber room...

579
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:42,116
...but the fact remains that the only
father we're ever gonna have is gone!

580
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:45,124
Forever.
And that sucks.

581
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:48,318
But it's a goddamn part of life,
and you can't really accept it...

582
00:49:48,526 --> 00:49:50,404
...without getting your hands dirty.

583
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:53,519
Well, I do accept it, and I intend
to honor the old bastard...

584
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:59,359
...by letting the world see how fucked
up and shitty I feel that he's dead!

585
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:02,128
Goddamn it!

586
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:05,923
Amen.

587
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,721
Wait.

588
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:44,442
Let her.

589
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:18,692
Let us pray.

590
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:23,764
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

591
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:29,812
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

592
00:51:30,015 --> 00:51:34,486
Give us this day, our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses...

593
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:38,085
...as we forgive those
who have trespassed against us.

594
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:42,608
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

595
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:48,049
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

596
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,976
Amen! Amen!

597
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,775
The Lord be with you.

598
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:04,494
Mom, Federico's gonna
drive you back, okay?

599
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:08,407
I just need to go over a few details
with Nate. We'll be right behind you.

600
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:11,052
Put her there, Mrs. F.

601
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:17,131
You have such delicate hands, Federico.
Like a statue.

602
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:20,775
Or an illustration in an antique book.

603
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:25,928
Or one of those little ceramic hands
they use to display gloves.

604
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,773
You want to be the alpha dog,
Nate, is that it?

605
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,414
Coasting toward mid-life
with nothing to show for it.

606
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,532
You wanna come back and be the rock
for this family to lean on?

607
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,459
- Fuck you.
- That is not what I'm...

608
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:49,459
You want to get your hands dirty?
You sanctimonious prick.

609
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:52,619
Talk to me when you've had to stuff
formaldehyde-soaked cotton...

610
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,381
...up your father's ass
so he doesn't leak.

611
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:57,140
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

612
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:01,096
Well, I'm sure you just would've
tossed him out with the garbage.

613
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:02,576
It may seem weird to you...

614
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:05,854
...but there is a reason
behind everything that we do here.

615
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:08,451
We provide people
with a very important...

616
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:11,894
...and sacred service
at the darkest time in their lives.

617
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:14,901
Because maybe they don't wanna
make a spectacle of themselves.

618
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:17,617
Because maybe they'd prefer
to grieve in private.

619
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:18,778
Why?

620
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:23,500
Why does it have to be such a secret?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

621
00:53:24,464 --> 00:53:27,934
- Dave, please...
- You know nothing!

622
00:53:28,424 --> 00:53:30,335
Nothing!

623
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,337
You had a responsibility
to this family...

624
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:38,501
...and you ran away,
and left it all for me.

625
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:41,822
Don't blame me if you're
not living the life you want.

626
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:44,698
That is nobody's fault but your own.

627
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:52,055
Okay, fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

628
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:54,496
You got out...

629
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:57,174
...stay out.

630
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:05,216
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher, sir?
If I could get a moment of your time.

631
00:54:05,427 --> 00:54:08,066
- What?
- I'm from Kroehner Service International.

632
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:11,623
I'd like to talk to you about joining
our family of death-care facilities.

633
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:14,183
- I cannot believe this.
- Lf you'd just hear me out...

634
00:54:14,388 --> 00:54:16,185
We're not selling.
Get the fuck out of here!

635
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:18,106
We wouldn't change
the name of the business.

636
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:20,185
We would retain you
as a salaried manager.

637
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:25,099
Look, I really want to hit somebody
right now, and it might as well be you!

638
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:35,263
I'll call you when you've had some time
to recover from your loss.

639
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,387
- You're really lucky, you know that?
- You kidding? It was over in a second.

640
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,582
I didn't have to be afraid of it
or even think about it.

641
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,067
- No more bullshit.
- No more responsibility.

642
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:53,183
- And no more having to care.
- No more boredom!

643
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,229
No more waiting to die.

644
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,310
Hi.

645
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:32,185
Well, after four days with my family,
I'm ready for shock therapy.

646
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:36,512
I'm just waiting to see
if my HMO covers it.

647
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:43,427
- How's it going with you?
- Oh, it's great. Great.

648
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:46,627
My father's dead, my mom's a whore,
my brother wants to kill me...

649
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:51,113
...and my sister's smoking crack.
I think I win.

650
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,672
Four days ago,
I was a relatively happy guy.

651
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:56,993
Now it's like I don't even know
who that guy was.

652
00:56:03,116 --> 00:56:04,674
I'm a fucking mess.

653
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:07,471
If you want to know the truth.

654
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,876
But I think you're already aware of that.

655
00:56:15,317 --> 00:56:17,388
Well, here's my number.

656
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:23,116
If you ever want to, I don't know,
go out on a real date?

657
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:27,072
You know, where you buy me dinner
before I put out.

658
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,276
Maybe I'm a woman that meets a man
who seems emotionally conflicted...

659
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:38,233
...no relationship skills, and I figure,
"Hey, that's for me. "

660
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:41,909
- I don't even live here. I live in Seattle.
- That makes you more attractive.

661
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,792
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,554
Well, I also happen to be a serial rapist.

663
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,911
I've got 10 nurses
buried under my house.

664
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,832
Now you're making me wet.

665
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:36,482
I... I need...

666
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:39,280
I need...

667
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:57,399
It's okay. It's okay.

668
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,281
Good morning.

669
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,084
Thank God you're here.

670
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:05,522
Yeah, well, of course I'm here.

671
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:15,725
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Oh, I'm gonna go for a run.

672
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:19,322
- I'll eat when I get back.
- Nate?

673
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:24,845
You don't have to go back to Seattle
right away, do you?

674
00:59:29,173 --> 00:59:32,848
I guess not.
I could make a few calls.

675
00:59:33,053 --> 00:59:37,126
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:59:37,894 --> 00:59:40,362
Just for a few days.

677
00:59:43,734 --> 00:59:45,611
Okay.
