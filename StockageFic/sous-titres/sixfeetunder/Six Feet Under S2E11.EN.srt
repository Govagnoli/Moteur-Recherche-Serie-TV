1
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,810
Trash. As in trailer trash.

2
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,891
They're 20 minutes late with my Vioxx again.

3
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,011
I'm in such pain.

4
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,810
I'm in such agony.

5
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,566
I wish the Good Lord would take me soon.

6
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:17,004
How are things at home with you and Rico?
He still acting crazy?

7
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:20,165
I don't know,
but he definitely has a bug up his ass.

8
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:21,845
Mid-life crisis.

9
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,969
He's too young for that.

10
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,967
Honey, men start having their mid-life crisis
in their early 20s...

11
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:31,409
and they keep on having them
every three to five years after that.

12
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:34,326
You're gonna have to eat more than this,
Mrs. Kippleman.

13
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,802
-Shit!
-Now what?

14
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,569
Vanessa, she's got no pulse.

15
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,807
Shit!

16
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:48,082
-She's a full code?
-I don't know.

17
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:50,092
Come on, Edith, come on.

18
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:54,132
A world-class complainer like you
isn't gonna give up that easy.

19
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,929
-How about these?
-The green pants.

20
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,892
-Actually, these are olive.
-I can get myself dressed, you know.

21
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,372
I'm just trying to help.

22
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,365
-Did I ask for your help?
-No.

23
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,489
Then what the hell are you doing
in my room?

24
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,212
Hey, you don't talk to David that way.

25
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,762
You'd better start showing some respect
around here.

26
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,492
-Or what, you're gonna put me in jail?
-What did you say?

27
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:32,608
Let her go.

28
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:35,446
We've got to start setting
some serious boundaries with her.

29
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,808
Look at all the shit she's had to deal with.

30
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,453
Not to mention the past couple of months.
She's 9.

31
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,330
-I know how old she is.
-I'm just saying...

32
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,085
Do you want to pick a fight with me?

33
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:47,529
No, do you want to pick a fight
with a 9-year-old about her attitude?

34
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:49,331
This morning I do.

35
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,964
Too fucking bad. I know you're nervous
about your old man coming...

36
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:56,602
but I don't have to let you
take it out on Taylor. Or me.

37
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,083
-It's 9:30.
-So?

38
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,566
Let me sleep late.

39
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:12,929
It's the last enjoyment I'll know
before I become a cog in the wheel...

40
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:15,288
making mocha lattes
for the people who have a life.

41
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,843
-Don't you think that's a little dramatic?
-Not really.

42
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:23,806
-Can I make you something to eat?
-No, thanks.

43
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,926
You never eat a decent breakfast anymore.

44
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,486
This is a glass of orange juice.
This is an apple.

45
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:34,566
That's two of my daily servings of fruit
recommended by the USDA.

46
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,644
Claire, are you depressed?

47
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:41,092
I'm not even gonna answer that question.

48
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:46,209
Whatever you're going through,
I hope you don't blame me.

49
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,406
I was just calling you.

50
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,530
What, you can be late all you want
but I'm not allowed to be?

51
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,047
-Calm down.
-Why? I'm pissed off!

52
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,727
I get pissed off sometimes.
I have a right to express it.

53
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:05,202
Express it to somebody else,
because I've got to run.

54
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,488
Brenda and I have a meeting with Rabbi Ari.

55
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,167
-You're thinking of converting?
-Maybe.

56
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,003
What? I'm already circumcised.

57
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,772
-Anything I need to be aware of here?
-I did a pickup this morning at Bay Breeze...

58
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,252
another referral from Vanessa.

59
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,611
Great, another chance for Rico to act
like we owe our entire livelihood to him.

60
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,172
Hello! Mr. Fisher?

61
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,767
Dave, you've got to lighten up, man.

62
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,122
Can I help you?

63
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,886
-Are you Nathaniel Fisher?
-No, he's deceased.

64
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:38,443
Wait a minute, that's me.
I'm Nathaniel Fisher, Jr.

65
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,524
Consider yourself served.

66
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:53,489
-Shit.
-Who was that?

67
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,729
You remember Mrs. Collins?

68
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,607
The waitress who got locked
in the walk-in overnight?

69
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,447
No, the wife of the guy who fell off the boat,
got sliced up by the propeller.

70
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,171
Yeah, the bargain hunter.

71
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,969
She wanted to see the body.

72
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,250
-You didn't.
-She made me.

73
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:17,604
Now she's suing us for emotional distress
to the tune of $500,000. Fuck!

74
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:22,972
There's an ashtray over there somewhere.

75
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:27,168
You should really clean this car out
sometime, you know.

76
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,404
What the fuck is this?

77
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:36,692
It's some creepy thing
my Aunt Sarah sent me for my birthday.

78
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:39,651
I don't know what happened.
Usually she has pretty good taste.

79
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,169
It's filled with some nasty Chinese
holistic herb shit.

80
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,292
Newsflash! These aren't Chinese herbs.

81
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,367
-They're not?
-These are shrooms.

82
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,443
My aunt sent me mushrooms?

83
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:58,049
Whatever you thought you were
doing tomorrow, plan on blowing it off.

84
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,364
-What's wrong with today?
-I have a date with Mr. Schussler.

85
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:04,729
-Mr. Schussler the vocational arts teacher?
-Yeah.

86
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:08,449
And you can't fuck for shit
when you're on shrooms.

87
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:13,766
Marriage is a profound experience
that can deeply enrich your life...

88
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,242
and even bring you closer to God.

89
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:19,247
But our culture has many misconceptions
about it.

90
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,211
Like marriage will cure loneliness...

91
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:26,207
or that most of our satisfactions in life
should come from our partner.

92
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,887
Or that good sex means good marriage.

93
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:32,888
And the truth is that marriage is different
for different people.

94
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,487
So in this and our next five sessions...

95
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:38,565
we'll talk about what marriage means to you.

96
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,612
I'm curious.

97
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:44,130
-Have you ever been married?
-No, I haven't.

98
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:47,810
But I have counseled many couples
in my congregation...

99
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,407
both before, during, and after marriage.

100
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,563
One thing I can say without hesitation...

101
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,087
is you can't have a good marriage
without honesty.

102
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,162
Yeah.

103
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:59,165
That kind of goes without saying,
doesn't it?

104
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:04,446
Are you completely honest with each other?

105
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,608
You don't have to answer that right now.

106
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,844
It's just something to think about
for next week.

107
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:28,209
-Would you like some cucumber salad?
-No, thank you.

108
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,365
-I made more than enough.
-I reading paper.

109
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,808
Fine.

110
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,203
Take it, go ahead, take it.

111
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,572
I'll be back.

112
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,850
Like Terminator, no?

113
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,728
What is he? Did he threaten you?

114
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,763
Mind your own business, woman!

115
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:35,644
Can I just say that I think
total honesty is not always the best thing?

116
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,008
What about privacy?

117
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:41,369
What about trying to maintain the mystery
of a relationship?

118
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:45,241
Sometimes truth is irrelevant.

119
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:49,168
Brenda, I did something stupid.

120
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,972
I'm listening.

121
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,933
The trip to Seattle, my friend Lisa?

122
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:05,402
I slept with her. She's pregnant.

123
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:19,168
I don't even know how to respond
to something like this.

124
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,090
What do you feel?

125
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,890
I don't know what I feel.
I don't feel anything.

126
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:31,852
I feel numb.

127
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:38,602
-When were you planning on telling me?
-I'm telling you now.

128
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,611
What do you expect me to do
with this information?

129
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,682
Christ, Nate! This whole wedding thing
scares the shit out of me...

130
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:52,051
but I've been trying to make myself believe
that we could actually....

131
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,372
Almost done.

132
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:13,928
Okay.

133
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,166
Okay, then.

134
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,452
How bad is it?

135
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,763
-Your brother showed her the body?
-Yes.

136
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,289
-It was in pretty bad shape, huh?
-Yes.

137
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,012
I think she's got a pretty airtight case.

138
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:38,323
I think that you guys
are more or less fucked.

139
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,529
She made him show her the body.

140
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,969
I can certainly argue that point,
but, David, she was under duress...

141
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,647
and this woman is going to describe
in great detail...

142
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,883
exactly what she saw
when she's up on the stand.

143
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,806
On top of that,
she's hired herself an aggressive law firm...

144
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:55,408
that nobody likes to mess with,
so I think that we should try to settle.

145
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,370
How much money do you guys have?

146
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,603
-I'm sorry I was late.
-Where were you?

147
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:05,890
With Brenda. We were in the middle
of something pretty intense.

148
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:09,045
Do you know how much trouble we are in
because of this lawsuit?

149
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,725
I have things I've got to deal with.

150
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,929
I have a life, too. I have a kid now.

151
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,481
At least I try to keep it separate
from the business...

152
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,610
that you seem so hell-bent
on flushing down the fucking toilet!

153
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,645
We are fucked, Nate!

154
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:24,411
And you fucked us.

155
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:32,651
I'm afraid my daughter's suffering from
depression and I don't know what to do.

156
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:37,045
Most teenagers suffer from mild depression
at one time or another.

157
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,693
-Is that true?
-True enough.

158
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,330
But I'm pretty familiar
with clinical depression...

159
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:46,405
-and I don't see Claire suffering from that.
-You don't?

160
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,929
Look, she's the kind of person...

161
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:53,722
that needs her life to be meaningful.
I'm sure you know this better than I do.

162
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,122
No, I don't feel as though I do.

163
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:59,849
And by the way, who doesn't need their life
to be meaningful?

164
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,082
You'd be surprised.

165
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,812
She has no idea how easy she's had it!

166
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:08,324
Do you want to know what you can do
to be more supportive of Claire?

167
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,449
Of course. That's why I'm here, I think.

168
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,490
This is a brochure for LAC-Arts.

169
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,403
I think Claire should think about
going there.

170
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,087
It's a great school
for someone with her creativity.

171
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,364
-You really don't think she's depressed?
-I don't.

172
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:33,603
-But can I speak candidly?
-Please.

173
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:37,645
I think it's possible that you might be.

174
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:47,325
It's me. I'm leaving another goddamn
message on your voice mail.

175
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,889
Listen, I really need to talk.

176
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:01,405
Billy, God damn it, I need you.
I really need you.

177
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,727
God damn it, where the fuck are you?

178
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,731
Mr. Charles, hey!

179
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,049
It's good to see you again.

180
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:30,448
You met me when Keith brought me down
to San Diego last....

181
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,923
-It's been over a year ago.
-I know who you are.

182
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,406
Hey, Lucille. I'm sorry I'm so late.
I guess I missed dinner, huh?

183
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,444
-I left you a plate in the microwave.
-Thank you.

184
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:49,652
-Hey, you're home.
-Yeah. I'm sorry I'm so late.

185
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,365
Did you get my...

186
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,653
-Where's Taylor?
-Brushing her teeth.

187
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,212
-Did she floss first?
-Yes, I watched her.

188
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,490
Listen, I put fresh linens on.
Extra blankets in the hall closet.

189
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:04,007
Keith, your mother and I want
to have a word with you.

190
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,812
-Can't it wait until morning?
-No, I don't think it can.

191
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:11,762
-I can leave the room if you'd like.
-I don't care if you're here for this or not.

192
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:16,051
Keith, we'd like to take Taylor home with us
when we go back to San Diego.

193
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,442
-What, for a visit?
-No, to live.

194
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:21,407
-Why?
-This isn't any of your concern, sir.

195
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:26,044
-I'm sorry, but I think it is.
-No, David, let's hear him out.

196
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:32,004
For one, we have a yard big enough
for her to play in.

197
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:34,289
We'll be able to spend more time with her.

198
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,445
And we'll be able to offer her more stability.

199
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,567
It's what's best for the child,
and you know it.

200
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,448
Fine.

201
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,084
Ari, hi.

202
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,802
I'm sorry to just drop in like this so late,
but I was in the neighborhood.

203
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:10,886
Well, nearby, speaking to somebody
who's interested in arranging a funeral.

204
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:14,090
-His own, actually. What do you call that?
-A pre-need.

205
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,322
Right.

206
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:19,566
So I was wondering
if you would be willing to help him?

207
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:22,372
Yeah, sure.
Just give me his name and number.

208
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:25,286
-I'll call him first thing tomorrow.
-Okay.

209
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,687
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm great.

210
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:32,566
Okay, that's bullshit.

211
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:36,362
I'm coming in, and you're gonna offer me
something to drink.

212
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,488
That is a lot for her to absorb.

213
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:49,129
She already knew about the AVM,
but I just told her about the baby today.

214
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:53,246
You said we'd never have a good marriage
without honesty.

215
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,608
-I did say that, didn't I?
-Yeah.

216
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:03,811
Why do you think you have so much trouble
being honest with Brenda?

217
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:07,932
-I don't think it's particular to Brenda.
-With women, then.

218
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,603
-I don't have trouble being honest with you.
-I'm a rabbi, Nate.

219
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:17,925
-You don't look like a rabbi.
-I am a rabbi.

220
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:22,083
Unavailable to you,
not even in your wildest dreams.

221
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:25,172
That's why you don't have trouble
being honest with me.

222
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,244
There's nothing at stake.

223
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,972
How do you feel about becoming a father?

224
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,042
I don't know how I feel about it.

225
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:40,769
I certainly never imagined
it would happen like this.

226
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:45,007
All of our actions have consequences.

227
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:49,889
We may not even be aware of them,
but they exist nevertheless.

228
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:56,846
You should consider it a blessing.
What if you had never known?

229
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,362
Sorry.

230
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:08,568
Just give her some time, Nate.

231
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:11,972
Time. Right.

232
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:45,043
We got another one from Bay Breeze!
That's the fourth one this year.

233
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:49,445
Yes, I'm aware of how many referrals
your wife sends our way.

234
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:53,322
Just making sure you know
where the business is coming from.

235
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:59,963
-Something funny about this one, David.
-Funny how?

236
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:09,369
The certificate says the cause of death
was congestive heart failure.

237
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:12,684
So? Old people have their heart
quit on them all the time.

238
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:16,129
Yeah, but she's got these contusions
around her neck.

239
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,411
Old people bruise easily.

240
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,883
Those probably happened
while they were trying to resuscitate her.

241
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,372
Maybe.

242
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,885
What the fuck?

243
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,006
A hot dog?

244
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:01,164
You tell me. I don't think something this big
just happened to go down the wrong way.

245
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,972
Is it okay if Parker spends the night
at our house tonight?

246
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,372
Of course.

247
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:17,004
Would you like me to pick you up
a frozen pizza and some videos?

248
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,324
No, I think we're good.

249
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:26,371
Are you doing something
with Nikolai tonight?

250
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,207
I think he's losing interest in me.

251
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:32,405
He's been spending a lot of time
alone lately.

252
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,851
He was living here
with plastic casts on both legs...

253
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,527
and peeing in a bedpan
for, what, six weeks?

254
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,490
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:45,284
Just give him some space.
Guys need a lot of space.

256
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:50,246
He doesn't know how to take care of himself
and he needs my help!

257
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:52,172
If you say so.

258
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,806
I'm a little confused
about this term "pre-need. "

259
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,849
It's a payment structure that allows you to...

260
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,527
Make the purchase before you need it.
I get that.

261
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,046
I may be dying. I'm not an idiot.

262
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,931
My question is
with the choice of the word "need. "

263
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,732
I mean, who really needs a funeral anyway?

264
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:18,168
If you're dead you don't need shit.

265
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:22,246
Yes, the funeral is really
for the people you leave behind...

266
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,126
to help them come to terms...

267
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:27,046
What if you're not leaving anybody behind?

268
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,765
What if your whole fucking life has been
one big waste of time for everybody...

269
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:34,686
-including yourself?
-You don't know that.

270
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:42,803
I'm all for thinning out the human race.
There are just too many fucking people.

271
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:48,168
Anthrax, smallpox. I say bring it on.

272
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,284
You'd probably like that, huh?
Good for business.

273
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:57,205
Maybe I should just leave this information
with you and I'll come back later.

274
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:00,128
Sorry if I'm being antisocial.

275
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,447
Sit down.

276
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:17,242
The good rabbi went through all the trouble
of setting this up.

277
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,847
Besides, I may not be here tomorrow.

278
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,087
-You mind if I ask...
-What I have?

279
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:31,283
-Pancreatic cancer.
-I'm sorry.

280
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:34,732
It's one of the worst ones you can get.

281
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,805
I did not know that.

282
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,364
Yeah. I should be dead already.

283
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:52,609
So this is just gravy time.
It's extra frosting on the cake.

284
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,725
Most people
last up to maybe six months, tops.

285
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:01,965
Me, I've been hanging in here
for over a year.

286
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:05,009
Can you fucking believe it?

287
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,449
I'll bet you never met anybody
half as lucky as I am.

288
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:13,686
And you pulled this relatively intact
out of the deceased's airway?

289
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:14,842
That's correct.

290
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,811
What made you decide to look in her throat?

291
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,723
I would have gone in there anyway
to swab her out...

292
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:23,804
before I started embalming her.

293
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:27,966
-But I had my suspicions.
-What made you suspicious?

294
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,648
The contusions around her neck.

295
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,769
These contusions could've been made
when they tried to resuscitate her.

296
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:36,445
They could have.

297
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:40,924
If they tried to resuscitate, why didn't they
find the frankfurter stuck in her airway?

298
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:43,481
It was stuck pretty far down.

299
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:48,363
Some of these nursing homes aren't exactly
up to speed on their CPR training.

300
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:51,126
She was brought over
from the Bay Breeze Nursing Home?

301
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,612
That's correct.

302
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:55,084
And who tried to resuscitate her?

303
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,607
Wait a minute. I think I got that.

304
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:01,772
Dolores Willitts and Vanessa Dial....

305
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:06,729
Diaz. Vanessa Diaz.

306
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,765
She is my wife.

307
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,766
-Where is Nikolai?
-He's out on a delivery.

308
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:26,209
Tell him I stopped by, and I come back later.

309
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:30,013
How much money does Nikolai owe you?

310
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,724
-Excuse me?
-How much money does Nikolai owe you?

311
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,847
-Who are you?
-I'm his friend.

312
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:43,528
-His lady friend?
-That's right.

313
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,763
It is none of your concern.

314
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:50,442
Tell me how much he owes you,
and I'll pay you the money.

315
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:56,366
-You will pay me the money?
-Tell me how much it is.

316
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,003
$87,000.

317
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,087
Oh, my.

318
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:06,566
-I had no idea it was that much.
-You don't have that kind of money, do you?

319
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:13,249
As a matter of fact, I do.

320
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:33,241
-You would do this for Nikolai?
-Please, I'm trying to count.

321
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,444
Nikolai's a lucky man.

322
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:48,931
What is your name?

323
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,573
Ruth Fisher.

324
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,372
I would've taken a check, Ruth Fisher.

325
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:45,688
Who's this pretty little girl
who wants to join the party?

326
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:48,162
Isn't it way past your bedtime, honey?

327
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,285
Brenda, honey.

328
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:55,209
Mommy and Daddy have company,
and you need to go back up to bed now.

329
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:58,171
Margaret, you're stigmatizing the situation
for her.

330
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,525
No, I'm not, Bern.

331
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:09,449
Keith, you cannot let them take my baby.

332
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,611
Karla, they're only as far away as San Diego.

333
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:14,726
I think it's for the best.

334
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:18,522
There ain't no fucking way it's for the best.
Are you crazy?

335
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,603
Daddy didn't even need an excuse
to smack the shit out of me or you...

336
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:26,288
-and look what that did to us.
-Look what that did to you.

337
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:29,127
I don't want Taylor growing up
with that shit.

338
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,364
But you don't mind her growing up
with a mother who's a drug addict?

339
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,808
I might be a drug addict,
but I never hurt my child.

340
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:37,646
That's the way people raised their kids
back then.

341
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:40,964
I'm tired of you blaming everything
gone wrong in your life on Dad.

342
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:44,762
Please. You know how
the slightest little thing would set him off.

343
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,605
I think he's changed.

344
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,685
People can change.

345
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:54,647
People don't change.
They just get older, that's all.

346
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:07,009
-David Fisher, how the hell are you?
-Jesus!

347
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,851
Certainly not in any mood
to deal with the likes of you.

348
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:15,528
Honey, you could stand to work on
those manners. Hi, Nate.

349
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,922
I understand you boys are being sued.

350
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,969
So what, you've come here to gloat?

351
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:24,649
I just wanted you to know we are paying
poor Mrs. Collins' legal fees.

352
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,452
And, honey, we've got awfully deep pockets.

353
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,728
Y'all, this thing is gonna go on forever.

354
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:33,647
In the end it's gonna drag you boys down,
I can guarantee you that.

355
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:37,726
Now, we are still willing to buy
this little mom-and-pop shop of yours...

356
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,168
at a drastically reduced price, I'm afraid.

357
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:43,370
But I think that if you're smart,
and I'm betting you are...

358
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:46,809
you'll go on and get out
while the getting's still halfway good.

359
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,282
I'm curious, Mitzi.
What do you get out of this?

360
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:52,809
I like to win, honey.
It's the way I was brought up.

361
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:56,642
I hope you don't expect me to apologize
for it, because I'm not gonna do it.

362
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,088
I don't expect anything from you.

363
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:01,482
But I wonder, at the day's end,
when you're alone...

364
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,643
staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror...

365
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,008
do you really like who you see
looking back at you?

366
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,731
I love what I see.

367
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:11,123
See, I just don't buy that.

368
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,370
Because if you did
you wouldn't be doing this.

369
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:16,811
You know, it's a crying shame...

370
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:21,091
that someone as cute as you has to be
such a goddamn doom-and-gloomer.

371
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:25,452
You boys think it over
and let me know what you decide.

372
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,603
Personally, I think it's a no-brainer...

373
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:30,366
but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

374
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:35,362
-But I don't have the money.
-What do you mean?

375
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:38,047
-Of course you have the money.
-I don't. It's all gone.

376
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,522
-Where did it go?
-That's none of your business.

377
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,925
Mom, we need that money in order to offer
Mrs. Collins some kind of settlement...

378
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,810
or we're seriously screwed.

379
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:50,727
The only time you tell me what's going on
in your lives is when you need money.

380
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:54,647
If you'd told me about this before,
the money would've been there. It's gone.

381
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,930
-You guys, this is my friend Parker.
-Hi.

382
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:02,008
-We're just gonna be upstairs.
-Bye.

383
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,286
I give up.

384
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:22,611
That was weird. That was totally weird.
Are they always like that?

385
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:24,247
Always.

386
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:36,407
My God! Your room is so beautiful.

387
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,370
We should do something.
What do you want to do?

388
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,083
I don't know. What do you want to do?

389
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,289
What do you feel like doing?

390
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,607
-I feel like throwing up.
-Me, too.

391
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,812
-Is it normal?
-Totally.

392
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:59,207
These shrooms are fucking kick-ass.

393
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,603
Holy shit, you have a sewing machine?

394
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,888
Yeah, I found it in the attic.

395
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:07,443
It belonged to my dad's mom.

396
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,972
-Let's make something.
-Do you know how to use it?

397
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,726
Yeah. My God, it's so fucking cool.

398
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,485
People used to have
to make their own clothes all the time!

399
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:24,168
People used to have to make
their own soap. Can you believe that?

400
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:27,165
People used to have to kill their own cows
and stuff.

401
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,721
I really wish we could've been alive
back then.

402
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,007
Me, too.

403
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:47,330
Hi, it's me. I'm not here,
so talk to the machine.

404
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,807
Thank you for seeing me, Mrs. Collins.

405
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:01,771
I just want to apologize
for the unfortunate incident...

406
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:06,085
that brings us to this unpleasant juncture.

407
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:09,764
My brother is new to this business.

408
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:11,411
He didn't know what he was doing...

409
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:14,212
when he showed you
your husband's remains.

410
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:16,443
That's not my problem, is it?

411
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,491
No, of course not.

412
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:24,171
You were vulnerable
when you asked him to do this...

413
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:27,171
and he shouldn't have.
But, nevertheless, you did ask him.

414
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:28,891
What's your point?

415
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,444
-What's my point?
-Yeah.

416
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:33,770
Do you even have one?

417
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:40,283
You know it's not my fault or my brother's...

418
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:43,570
that you allowed your husband
to smack you around all those years.

419
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:46,645
-That's your problem.
-You've no right to talk about my marriage.

420
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:49,372
You chose to be a doormat,
or a punching bag...

421
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:52,286
or whatever metaphor for victimhood
you're comfortable with.

422
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,489
You stayed in an abusive marriage...

423
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,962
and wasted God knows how many years
of your life.

424
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:00,523
Years you'll never get back.
And that makes you furious, doesn't it?

425
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:02,888
You've probably spent
your entire miserable life...

426
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:05,567
blaming other people
for all the mistakes you've made.

427
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,405
Now you want us to pay for that?

428
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:10,485
Jesus, lady, just how fucking low
are you willing to sink?

429
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:14,602
This lawsuit of yours
is gonna cost my family our business!

430
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,285
That's my point!

431
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:23,442
There. Are you happy?

432
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,052
Now get out.

433
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:29,288
Get the fuck out of my house!

434
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,010
Can you spare a joint?

435
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,085
I love halter-tops.

436
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:34,725
Are you looking at my tits?

437
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:37,532
I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.

438
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,049
Are you looking at my tits?

439
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:45,165
My God, I wish I could've lived
during the Renaissance.

440
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:47,528
Those are so fucking beautiful.

441
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,605
I love those pants.

442
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,892
So when you walk it makes music, right?

443
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:56,083
See, if we live our lives the right way...

444
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:59,290
then every single thing we do
becomes a work of art...

445
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,603
even the pants we wear...

446
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:05,287
-or just the way we make our bed.
-Wow.

447
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:08,126
That's the whole fucking problem
with the world right now.

448
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:11,410
It's that we don't try to be creative
with every single thing we do.

449
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:13,131
Martha Stewart does.

450
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,531
I thought you might be getting hungry,
so I made you girls some sandwiches.

451
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:22,410
We are so not hungry.

452
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:26,490
We'll eat them later.

453
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:28,965
All right, then.

454
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:32,767
I'll come back later to get the tray.

455
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:35,244
-Mom?
-Yes, dear.

456
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,653
Here, I made these pants for you.

457
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,965
Thank you, Claire.

458
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,571
These are lovely.

459
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:49,965
I love you, Mom.

460
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:54,244
I never tell you how much,
because I'm afraid to for some reason...

461
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:58,770
but right now I want you to know I love you.
I think you're so beautiful.

462
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,365
I love you, too.

463
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,164
You don't know my dad, David.

464
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:40,768
He's like a pit bull when he gets his jaw
locked on something. Believe me.

465
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:44,004
What happened to the Keith who fights
for something he believes in?

466
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:47,722
-For something we both believe in?
-This isn't that simple.

467
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:51,602
Are you taking his side 'cause looking
after Taylor is too big a commitment?

468
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:55,527
No, I'm taking his side because,
for once, I think he's right.

469
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,566
You know what I think?

470
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:04,487
I think you're not sure that two gay men
should raise a child.

471
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:13,643
-That's your shit.
-Then why aren't we fighting for her?

472
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,769
Because they have more time
to spend with her.

473
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:19,084
Please. Your father plays golf all day
and your mom plays with her...

474
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:22,529
for half-an-hour, tops,
then pops in a video and gets on the phone.

475
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:24,968
I am not ambivalent about wanting kids.

476
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:27,487
Then you're ambivalent
about wanting kids with me?

477
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,768
Of course not. I just want to be ready.

478
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:32,765
Life doesn't work that way.
It just dumps things in your lap...

479
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:35,083
and then you try to make the best of it.

480
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,482
I'm tired of talking about this.

481
00:37:42,013 --> 00:37:44,925
You know what this is really about?
You're afraid of him.

482
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,241
Fuck you.

483
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,288
As much as I hate you treating me
like a doormat...

484
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:53,445
it's even worse seeing your father
treat you like one.

485
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:56,650
-You think I treat you like a doormat?
-Sometimes.

486
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,928
Why don't you stand up to him?

487
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:04,571
I don't think I treat you like a doormat.

488
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,771
Sometimes you do.

489
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:13,532
Go to sleep.

490
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,288
We both have to get up early.

491
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:33,803
Okay, you guys need to go now.

492
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:39,366
Okay, then.

493
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:48,004
Can I have your number?

494
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,845
Why? So we can date?

495
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:55,848
Late.

496
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,484
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

497
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:27,684
How did it go with the police?

498
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:30,810
How do you think it went?
They kept us there all night.

499
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:33,691
They didn't even talk to us
until about an hour ago.

500
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,525
At least they didn't arrest you.

501
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,810
Do you think I could shove a hot dog
down some old lady's throat?

502
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:41,965
No, of course not.

503
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:45,807
But you could have noticed it was there.

504
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:51,008
You know who they think did it?

505
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:53,368
The roommate, Ramona Kippleman.

506
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:57,732
But that old bitch is smart.
She's not saying anything to them.

507
00:39:57,933 --> 00:40:00,288
-So that's that?
-Yeah.

508
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:03,285
Except now, thanks to you, I'm out of a job.

509
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,967
-What?
-They fired Dolores and me for negligence.

510
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:08,362
They had to hang it on somebody.

511
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,524
What was I supposed to do?

512
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,968
Hide a murder
so you could keep some shitty job?

513
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:16,930
Of course not, Rico...

514
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:20,369
but now I have to go out
and find another shitty job.

515
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:28,803
You got Julio off to school?

516
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,332
-Yeah.
-And where's Augusto?

517
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:35,885
He's taking a nap.

518
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:44,169
I'm gonna try and get some sleep
before he wakes up.

519
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:58,729
Where's your friend Parker?

520
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:01,762
My God, those are so hideous.

521
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,048
They're not hideous in the least.

522
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,931
I like them. And do you want to know why?

523
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,881
Because my daughter,
whom I love very much, made them for me.

524
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,891
Look, that wasn't me. It was somebody else.

525
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:18,370
I may just wear these pants
until the day I die.

526
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:19,932
Please don't.

527
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:24,561
God. What made me ever think
I could be an artist?

528
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:26,850
Here, this is for you.

529
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:30,129
I don't know why I bother.

530
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,087
I think you have real talent, Claire.

531
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:38,805
But go ahead and throw it away,
if that's what you're set on doing.

532
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:58,484
Taylor, would you go to your room?
I need to speak to your grandparents.

533
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,686
Yeah, sure.

534
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:09,451
David and I talked it over and decided
Taylor will stay with us for now.

535
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:12,047
At least until the school year's up.

536
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,205
The hell you say.

537
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:16,568
-Keith...
-Stay out of this, Mom.

538
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:20,924
That child is coming home...

539
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:23,772
with me and your mother.

540
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:27,161
Taylor's staying with me and David,
and that's final.

541
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,686
-You...
-Do it.

542
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:31,806
I dare you.

543
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,689
I was handling situation...

544
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,525
you stupid woman.

545
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:03,847
-You have no right to talk to me this way.
-You have no right!

546
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:07,364
Christ Almighty....

547
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,043
What's going on?

548
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,569
Nikolai owed someone some money,
and I paid them back.

549
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,963
-What?
-You can't try to fix others' problems...

550
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:24,248
without them asking, cupcake.

551
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:27,606
You're too co-ey. That's your problem.

552
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:29,490
-"Co-ey?"
-Codependent.

553
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,006
I know what it means.

554
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:33,323
And you know something, Robbie?
I hate that word.

555
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:35,563
That word is totally inappropriate here.

556
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:39,726
I am a mother. I have a family.
Family members depend on one another.

557
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:43,772
You can't be intimate with someone
and not be dependant on them.

558
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:47,568
I wasn't aware Nikolai was a member
of your family.

559
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:57,443
I feel so bad about treating my mother
like shit all the time.

560
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,851
What makes you think
you treat her like shit?

561
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:05,690
I made her these pants,
harlequin pants with bells on them.

562
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,968
My God, they're so queer.

563
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:10,528
And she's actually wearing them.

564
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:16,963
She means well.
She's just so clueless and...

565
00:44:17,813 --> 00:44:19,929
I don't know, embarrassing.

566
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,932
Everyone's embarrassed by their parents.

567
00:44:26,173 --> 00:44:28,528
Where's the picture of you
and what's-her-name?

568
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:33,772
We broke up.

569
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:37,090
You guys looked so happy.

570
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:40,529
I mean, in the photo
she always looked really happy.

571
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,169
I just assumed you were...

572
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:48,363
-in it for keeps.
-Well, we weren't.

573
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,805
What time is it?

574
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,690
We still have about 10 minutes.

575
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:02,243
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

576
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:04,042
No.

577
00:45:04,693 --> 00:45:06,888
Is there something you want me
to talk about?

578
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:09,282
No, not really.

579
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:14,611
I've got some Psych homework
I could be doing.

580
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:19,566
So, see you.

581
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:43,126
Would you like me to make you
something to eat?

582
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:44,566
No, thanks.

583
00:45:47,253 --> 00:45:50,404
Have you made any definite plans
for the wedding?

584
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:54,042
To be honest, there might not be a wedding.

585
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,725
Really and truly?

586
00:45:57,973 --> 00:46:00,726
-Really and truly.
-What did she do?

587
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:05,410
It's not something Brenda did.
It's something I did.

588
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:07,927
Maybe it's for the best.

589
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,961
Or maybe it's not for the best.
Maybe it just is.

590
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,521
And now I just have to live with it.

591
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,530
Are you sure you wouldn't like me
to make you something to eat?

592
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:25,969
A grilled cheese sandwich?

593
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,367
-Hey.
-Hey.

594
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:03,125
I tried calling you.

595
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,203
People make mistakes, Nate.

596
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:21,249
They don't always know
why they do the things they do.

597
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,772
You don't love this Lisa chick, do you?

598
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,884
-No.
-Good.

599
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:33,729
Because I still love you.

600
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:39,690
And I can't lose you.

601
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,012
I can't.

602
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:46,891
I need you, Nate.

603
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:55,609
As fucked up as you are...

604
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,527
you are the sanest thing in my life.

605
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:03,045
-Let's work this out together, okay?
-Okay.

606
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:07,932
I love you.

607
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:23,930
English
