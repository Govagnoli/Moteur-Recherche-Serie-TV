1
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,370
- I am such a fucking idiot!
- No.

2
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,880
- I should've dumped him years ago.
- Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:56,091 --> 00:02:01,849
- I feel 20 pounds lighter.
- More like 180 pounds.

4
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,647
- What do you think he's doing tonight?
- Oh, he's fucking his little grad student.

5
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:09,321
Thinking he's king of the world.

6
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:14,610
God, I wish I knew who invented Viagra.
So I could shoot him.

7
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:16,292
- I'll drink to that.
- Hear, hear.

8
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:21,249
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, it fell down my shirt!
Hold this, hold this, I have an idea.

9
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:25,568
Wait. Driver. Hey, driver.

10
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:30,806
Take us to Miyagi's, okay?
Because I feel like dancing.

11
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:33,086
Look what I found.

12
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,814
Oh, promise me,
no dancing on the tables tonight.

13
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,053
You just open this.

14
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:43,612
Hold it. Hold it.

15
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,056
- Come on.
- Come back down, honey.

16
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:53,450
- Come on.
- I'm king of the world!

17
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,733
I'm king of the world.
I'm king of the world!

18
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:35,454
This is how you study
for the funeral director's license?

19
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,815
You must really like wearing a suit.

20
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,061
There's always a chance
we might get a walk-in.

21
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:43,541
There's always a chance
we might get abducted by aliens.

22
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:50,825
What's the longest we've ever gone
without a body?

23
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,182
I remember Dad saying something
like nine days during the '84 Olympics.

24
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:58,140
"The great drought of '84."

25
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,096
Dad used to do Walter Brennan:
"Come on, little Luke...

26
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,186
...let's stitch this dead guy up
because Ma's made a mess of catfish...

27
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:07,108
...and I'm powerful hungry. "

28
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,578
Okay, well, thank you
for making me feel like an idiot.

29
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,823
No, I just... You knew
a whole side of Dad I never did.

30
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,263
Nine days, huh?
We just might beat that.

31
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,430
"When a family places money
in a funeral trust for a pre-need...

32
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,231
...how much money can the funeral home
use for other purposes...

33
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,821
...until the family
requires your services?"

34
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,068
Fifty percent.

35
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,461
- Twenty-five percent?
- Zero, none.

36
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,829
I knew that.

37
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:42,068
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me,

38
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:44,913
It's about time. I've been calling you
for six days straight.

39
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,346
Yeah, I've been Incredibly busy.
Lots of new clients, sorry.

40
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,831
- How's Billy?
- Better.

41
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:55,505
It only happens once a year, you know?
Twice at the most.

42
00:04:56,075 --> 00:05:01,070
- So when can I see you?
- I don't know, Tuesday?

43
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:04,074
- Is he staying with you?
- Yeah, just for a few more days.

44
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,428
Listen, I gotta go. I'll call you, okay?
I promise.

45
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:13,268
We think we're weird,
being undertakers' kids?

46
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,389
Be thankful our parents weren't shrinks.

47
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,715
"How many days does a family have
to cancel a contract for services?"

48
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,831
I get sick of this bizarre behavior
I'm supposed to figure out.

49
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,038
- She's pissed when I can't. It's neurotic!
- Would you concentrate on this, please?

50
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,397
You need to get your license
so you can handle your share of things.

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,068
- "How many days...?"
- Three days.

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,550
It's not exactly the California bar, David.
Come on. Make me earn it.

53
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:40,630
"When a funeral home
advertises their services...

54
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,518
...which two pieces of information are
legally required on all advertisements?"

55
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:58,517
I'd start with some heavy-duty
armature material and plaster of Paris.

56
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:04,755
Mastic compound for her face,
tissue builder and wax for her features.

57
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:10,953
I'd finish her off with a good sealer.
She'll leak like a garden hose.

58
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:15,364
A little airbrushing and a high-quality
foundation and she's good to go.

59
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:21,117
- How much time would you need?
- At least a day to do it right.

60
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,568
- The Fishers can spare you for a full day?
- I'm not auditioning for you.

61
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:29,726
This is a one-time freelance job
and I use my own materials.

62
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,566
Kroehner's texturizers, they blow.

63
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,237
- How much?
- 1500.

64
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,807
Okay.

65
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,405
For someone with your talent,
that's a bargain.

66
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,446
Stop blowing smoke up my ass.
I'm not quitting the Fishers.

67
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:52,728
- Mr. F. Put me through school.
- Have her done by 5.

68
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,321
And she'd better look flawless.

69
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:04,085
Don't think about how steep it is.
You've got eight more miles.

70
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,522
Come on, keep it moving.

Carlos Castaneda can blow me.

76
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:27,373
Tell me about it. Where's the "spiritual
transcendence" part from the brochure?

77
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,771
This is like fucking boot camp.

78
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:33,094
Have I...? Have I thanked you
for getting me high this morning?

79
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:35,492
Like 12 times.

80
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:39,334
- Just making sure.
- Claire, Topher!

81
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:44,136
You're straggling. You know the rules.
The group stays together.

82
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,810
- Period.
- Jawohl, mein Kommandant,

83
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,892
I got a new way to make money. We
rent out the slumber room for meetings.

84
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,694
- Twelve-step groups, that sort of thing.
- Are you insane?

85
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,692
Drunks and drug addicts
inside our home?

86
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,337
- The insurance issues alone...
- Then how about senior dance lessons?

87
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:04,890
Twice a week at 50 bucks a pop.
That's $5200 a year.

88
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,138
- That's six months' property tax.
- What if we've got a viewing?

89
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:11,095
They work around our schedule.
Old people have nothing else to do.

90
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,374
They dance here, have fun.
Who gets a call when they drop?

91
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,696
- That's not a bad idea.
- Good. They're coming here at 2.

92
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,895
No more comments about me
not pulling my weight for a while, okay?

93
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:31,575
Is this a new company policy,
casual Fridays?

94
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:34,822
- Nice of you to drop by, it's noon.
- I stayed after 9 last night...

95
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,539
...restocking and sterilizing.
You mean, you didn't check?

96
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,776
If it's all right with you guys,
I need the day off.

97
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,546
- Vanessa's got an ultrasound.
- She just had one last week.

98
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,738
They just want to do another one.

99
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:48,057
I think I should be there with her,
don't you?

100
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:51,185
- Of course, you could've called.
- I left my jacket in the prep room.

101
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:55,307
It's got my wallet, my insurance card,
all that stuff. Thanks, guys.

102
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,261
Great, once again I'm the asshole
and you're the cool guy.

103
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,858
You tell him tomorrow
he's cleaning out the body fridge.

104
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,827
I want it scrubbed, hosed
and disinfected.

105
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,980
- You tell him.
- It's Fisher & Sons.

106
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,307
- Sometimes you have to be the bad cop.
- Well, you're so good at it.

107
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:26,820
Rico!

108
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,503
Nate, please. Don't do that.

109
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,142
I got a lot on my mind
with the ultrasound, you know?

110
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:39,507
- David wants you to clean out the...
- The walk-in, I know.

111
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:42,274
Your brother's got a bug up his ass
about cleanliness.

112
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:46,309
I know. When we used to play G.I. Joes,
he always wanted to give his a shower.

113
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,232
Yeah, well. I'm running late.

114
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,148
Where's your jacket?

115
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:59,393
Oh, shit! I must've left it at home.

116
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:02,907
Told you, man, I got a lot on my mind
from the ultrasound.

117
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,869
- See you.
- See you.

118
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,869
Now begins the vision quest
part of our journey.

119
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,027
Oh, great, now we get to starve
and sweat ourselves...

120
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:23,756
...into a hallucinogenic state of ecstasy.
- Gonna get harder in the next few days.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,833
You all know how tough physically.

122
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,069
Now the mental challenges begin.

123
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:34,069
Okay, starting now, you guys lead.
I just follow.

124
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:40,839
So I hope, for my sake, you've all
perfected your map and compass skills.

125
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,399
- Parker.
- Oh, God. Not Parker.

126
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,594
Which way do we go?

127
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:52,923
- That way.
- What are you waiting for? You lead.

128
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,721
Fucking Girl Scout.

129
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:09,764
- Good call, Parker.
- So who do you think plays Parker...

130
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:13,596
...in the movie of her life?
Sandy Bullock or Julia Roberts?

131
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,638
Oh, please, she'd never rate that high.

132
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:19,966
She'd get like one of those Buffy
or Dawson's Creek chicks, tops.

133
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,921
- What is that?
- This?

134
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,847
Khinkali.

135
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:32,363
It's like dumpling
with spicy meat inside.

136
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,882
I cannot believe
you never hear of khinkali.

137
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,769
You know, you need to go out
from the house more.

138
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,243
I get out. I took a very enjoyable trip
to San Bernardino just a few weeks ago.

139
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:49,083
You should come to my neighborhood.
All Russian. You would love it.

140
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,841
People with passion, full of life.
Not like your family.

141
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,407
- What do you mean?
- Russians speak from here.

142
00:11:55,612 --> 00:12:01,404
From the heart, with their souls. Not like
Fisher, from here, like a little mouse...

143
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,246
Not like that.

144
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:08,367
If it's so wonderful in Russia,
you should take the first flight back.

145
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,965
In Russia, I was engineer.

146
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,811
- Knock-knock.
- Hiram.

147
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,411
Tried my hand at Jamaican chicken.
Turned out good.

148
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:23,212
- Thought you might like some for lunch.
- That's so thoughtful. Thank you.

149
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,136
- Hiram, this is my boss, Nikolai.
- Hi.

150
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,255
- She has a lunch.
- Here, try some.

151
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:34,256
- Please.
- You burned it.

152
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,167
- Nikolai!
- Ruth is busy.

153
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:43,931
- I'm on my lunch break.
- Lunch is over. Now we work.

154
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,891
Sorry I got you in trouble
with your boss.

155
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,137
Don't you worry, I can handle him.

156
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,975
Everybody ready and allemande left.

157
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:09,817
Right and left grand.

158
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:13,892
Good, good.
Swing your partners.

159
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:22,178
And promenade home.
Very good.

160
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:25,383
- Hey, Vanessa, is Rico there?
- No, should I page him?

161
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,019
It's nothing important.
I wanted to run something by him.

162
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,580
- Okay,
- Did you have your ultrasound already?

163
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,981
Yeah, last week.

164
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,058
You're not having one today?

165
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:41,616
Oh, yeah, yeah,
but not till this afternoon.

166
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm sorry, Nate,
the UPS guy's at the door, I gotta go.

167
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,461
And I'll tell Rico you called, okay?

168
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:49,943
- Shit!
- Shit.

169
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:54,540
Hey! Don't say that, papito,
That's a grown-up word.

170
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,267
Very good, very good,
ladies and gentlemen.

171
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,144
Now, if I could have your attention
for just one second.

172
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:15,986
I wanna teach you a new figure.
You're gonna love it.

173
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:18,547
Your friends are gonna be
very impressed. I promise.

174
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:22,462
It's called the Hungarian Swing.
And I need a volunteer.

175
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,466
So if I could just borrow you
for one second.

176
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,585
I promise it won't hurt a bit.
It goes like this.

177
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,389
You're gonna stand right hip
to right hip.

178
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,154
Your other hand is gonna go
on your partner's waist.

179
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,466
Your left hand is gonna
go up over the head.

180
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:41,748
Now you're gonna swing
one and a half times.

181
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,556
She will turn
one and a half times...

182
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,630
...into the promenade position.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

183
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:53,274
Let's do it again with the music, okay?
Not so fast.

184
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,595
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
with the music. Here we go.

185
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:02,235
Okay. And two, three, four.

186
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,436
Kiss him.

187
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,078
Interesting technique, where'd you
train?

188
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:33,750
Cypress College,
interned at Fisher & Sons.

189
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:37,239
Oh, so you're the guy from Fisher.
You got out of there just in time.

190
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:41,516
- Kroehner's gonna bury them.
- I don't think so.

191
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:44,921
Somebody burned down the funeral home
Kroehner was building across the street.

192
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:48,673
Somebody?
You ever heard of "Jewish lightning"?

193
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:53,315
Oh, sorry, did I offend you?
I'm Jewish, I can say that.

194
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,438
Kroehner burned down their own building
for the insurance money?

195
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:01,639
Trust me, it's not over. It's,
like, Matt Gilardi's personal vendetta.

196
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:04,076
Fisher is history.

197
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,042
Take care now, get home safe.

198
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:13,285
Aren't they a trip? I love them.
Old people still know how to boogie.

199
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:17,276
- Yeah. More than me.
- Oh, I can change that.

200
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:21,562
- I'm Kurt, by the way.
- How'd it go?

201
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,522
- Terrific.
- Great.

202
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,847
- So I guess you'll be coming back.
- I hope so.

203
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,047
- This really was a great idea, Nate.
- So it seems, Dave.

204
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:38,280
So, Dave.
You free tomorrow night?

205
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:43,323
Yes. We're in the middle of a dry spell.
He's got nothing but time.

206
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,290
How's about 8?

207
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:51,090
- 8, for dinner? Is... Is okay.
- Great, I'll pick you up.

208
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:53,204
See you tomorrow.

209
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:07,251
- You just pimped me out to that kid.
- That kid wants to jump your bones.

210
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:10,527
Oh, come on, David.
I watch Will and Grace, I have gaydar.

211
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:13,614
Okay, don't say "gaydar. "

212
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:16,207
I sure wish we could
light up that joint,

213
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:19,052
Yeah, Dennis is watching us
like a hawk.

214
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:23,330
Now that we've officially established
ourselves as the antisocial losers.

215
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:26,336
We'll just... We'll just sneak off
after we set up camp.

216
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:29,928
While the rest of the bush youth
groom each other for lice.

217
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,491
Hi, Claire.

218
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,572
Hi.

219
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,613
You...? You two are friends?

220
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,176
We go to the same school.
We're not exactly friends.

221
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,497
We're not exactly enemies, either.
We have classes together.

222
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,932
One.
Shouldn't you be leading us?

223
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:55,818
Now the guy with braces is doing it.
You know, everyone gets a turn.

224
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,819
I thought we were gonna do
daredevil shit.

225
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:01,935
- We're just following a fucking map.
- I know, this is fucking adolescent.

226
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:05,852
- Do you guys have some pot?
- Maybe.

227
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:19,740
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

228
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,015
What'd you use for the cheekbones?

229
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:25,741
Elmer's glue, dental floss,
and modeling clay.

230
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:29,734
I should've had your work videotaped.
These lesser lights could learn from you.

231
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,538
I have a lot to learn myself.

232
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:35,657
- Any interest in consulting?
- My plate is full.

233
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:39,781
- How about something more permanent?
- What's gonna happen to Fisher & Sons?

234
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,377
What do you care, is your name Fisher?

235
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:46,420
Within eight months,
I can offer you your own home.

236
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,304
There's a position opening up
in San Diego early next year.

237
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:53,387
- I'll think about it.
- Sure, take some time.

238
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,185
Talk it over with your wife.
Oh, and by the way?

239
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,541
This offer lasts 48 hours.

240
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,825
Brenda.

241
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,712
Bren.

242
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,114
Hello?

243
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,835
Billy?

244
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,316
Fuck!

245
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,798
- Crickey.
- Who the fuck are you?

246
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,034
Name's Connor. Connor Thompson.
You gotta be Nate.

247
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,995
Oh, yeah, Brenda's
given me the John Dory on you.

248
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:24,838
- Never told me you were this territorial.
- What's with the broken glass?

249
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,157
One too many largies last night.

250
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:36,278
- Do you mind putting something on?
- Don't worry. I don't fancy blokes.

251
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,202
Nice pants, though.

252
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:46,635
- Is Brenda here?
- Doesn't look like it.

253
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,474
- Well, do you know where she is?
- Nope.

254
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:58,076
Oh, I'm not rooting her,
if that's what you think.

255
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:00,437
No, she made it quite clear
that wasn't an option.

256
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:02,439
Her heart's got your name on it now.

257
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,201
No, that would be her ass.

258
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:10,479
You're thinking I'm pretty suss,
aren't you?

259
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,720
Hey.

260
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:19,523
Any you guys seen Topher?

261
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,560
I bet you can't wait to get back
to Stepford.

262
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,328
What a freak.

263
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:38,371
Take it you two have met.

264
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:42,531
These took forever to dry.

265
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,803
Hey, you.

266
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:59,331
Apparently you were mad at me because
I went to the desert without you.

267
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,810
- No.
- What's with Crocodile Dundee, then?

268
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:06,055
- Why the fuck are you doing his laundry?
- Oh, this is really unattractive behavior.

269
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:08,372
Sorry,
I guess I'm just a little weirded out...

270
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:12,092
...that I keep running into
naked guys at your house.

271
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:15,731
They're still warm.
Thanks, Lollies.

272
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:20,417
Connor is a very old friend
from a totally previous life.

273
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:22,927
He hasn't been in L.A. For 10 years.
Don't freak!

274
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,856
I am not freaking.

275
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,415
Just exactly where
does nature boy sleep?

276
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,052
Why didn't you tell me about him?

277
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,652
Because I knew that you
would react like this.

278
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:50,053
I am touched that you're jealous.
Now get over it.

279
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:56,099
Because you have no reason to be.
I promise.

280
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,371
- Lf I was fucking him, I'd tell you.
- Oh, Jesus, that's comforting, thank you.

281
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,462
Come to dinner tomorrow.
Connor's cooking some Australian thing.

282
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,894
- And Billy's coming over.
- Oh, Billy's coming over.

283
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:10,903
I thought he was staying with you.
You've been fucking lying to me!

284
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,903
I have spent the last six days
worried sick about you.

285
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:17,222
- And you've been partying your ass off!
- Okay! L...

286
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,656
I fucked up.

287
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,496
Okay?

288
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,461
I've been under a little pressure lately.
With my brother...

289
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,262
...having a nervous breakdown
and everything, I was...

290
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:35,460
...just trying to simplify things.

291
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,861
Don't blow this out of proportion,
please, Nate.

292
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,105
Okay.

293
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,344
What time tomorrow night?

294
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:07,102
Topher?

295
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:15,742
- You fucking asshole!
- Jesus.

296
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:20,550
Oh, fuck. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm...

297
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:25,112
- Fuck me! Fuck.
- Oh, shit!

298
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:29,149
Look, look. If she tells anybody,
no one will believe her.

299
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:32,632
Everybody thinks she's, like, crazy.

300
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:36,110
The sexual habits of the koala
are quite mysterious...

301
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:39,514
...because of their complicated
reproductive systems,

302
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:43,346
The male koala's penis
is forked like a snake's tongue,

303
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:46,797
The female has two vaginas
which share a common opening,

304
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:52,356
- What you watching?
- PBS, very funny.

305
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,471
What's up?

306
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,477
Well, I just thought you should know.
I called Vanessa.

307
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,875
And there's no ultrasound today.

308
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,039
And I also think Rico took a couple
bottles of stuff from the prep room.

309
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,792
Shit!
Fucking Kroehner.

310
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:14,633
I'll call around, see what I can find out.
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

311
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:19,120
I was going to, but I got distracted
by you and the square-dance guy.

312
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:23,395
It's not like Rico has an exclusive
contract with us or anything.

313
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:26,322
- So he's moonlighting.
- Moonlighting's when you take a job...

314
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:29,242
...when your first job is over.
He takes a job for Gilardi...

315
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:32,242
...while with us. It's treason.
- Stop being such a drama queen.

316
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,754
Stop acting like you're honorary mayor
of West Hollywood all of a sudden.

317
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:43,477
He lied to our faces.

318
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:47,236
Yeah, he did.

319
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,963
Hey, Claire.

320
00:25:56,887 --> 00:26:00,597
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

321
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:02,526
- I thought you and Topher...
- It's okay.

322
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:07,120
- Whatever, it's none of my business.
- No, it's okay, I just, I don't know.

323
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:09,763
I hope you won't just write me off now.

324
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:14,327
I mean, maybe it'll even, like,
break the ice.

325
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,721
Yeah.

326
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,439
I just kind of, you know,
think you're funny and cool.

327
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:28,406
And well, sometimes
I feel boring and lame around you.

328
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:34,528
And I think it's because, I don't know,
I kind of want to be your friend.

329
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:44,564
- Why?
- Why not?

330
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:51,092
Okay, but this is totally weird.

331
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,006
How's Vanessa?

332
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:16,208
She's great. Yeah.
The baby's strong as a bouncer.

333
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:18,295
How's Chloe Yorkin?

334
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,658
Some of your more ardent fans
in prep rooms around L. A...

335
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:25,374
...are calling this one
your Sistine Chapel.

336
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,299
Look. I told Gilardi
it was a one-time thing.

337
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,897
I mean, come on, guys, you gotta
understand. It wasn't for the money.

338
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,371
I mean, her head was like a...

339
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:43,858
...like a watermelon somebody hit
with a sledgehammer.

340
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,974
I mean, a case like that
doesn't come along every day.

341
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:48,735
What did he offer you to leave?

342
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,181
What are you offering me to stay?

343
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:04,024
What? You guys thought I would stay
out of loyalty?

344
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:08,261
Unlike you two, I have a wife and kids
to think about.

345
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:10,935
What do you want?

346
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:14,783
- I want to be a partner.
- That would require a significant...

347
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,739
...financial investment on your part.

348
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:20,698
That's what partners are.

349
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:24,135
Rico, let David and me talk.

350
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,737
Don't do anything until
we have a chance to counter, okay?

351
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,304
Okay.

352
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,507
We can work out
some profit-sharing plan.

353
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,865
He's finally figured out he's worth more
than we can pay him. We're fucked.

354
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:54,229
Okay, today, we're gonna climb
about 3000 feet...

355
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:59,102
...to a shelter close to the summit.
Now we have to move fast.

356
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,071
- When it gets dark, it gets cold.
- Why did you sleep with him?

357
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:05,111
I don't know.
Just to see if I could.

358
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:10,469
So who hasn't been leader yet?

359
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,506
- I haven't.
- Me, neither.

360
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:16,825
Claire.

361
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:19,510
- What?
- Which way do we go?

362
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:23,506
I don't know, I really don't care.

363
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,275
- Somebody else pick.
- Come on.

364
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:30,833
- Want to consult your map and compass?
- No, I think I lost my compass anyway.

365
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:33,193
Then borrow one from someone else.

366
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,714
Look, just pick someone else, okay?
Please.

367
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:48,748
Okay, that way. I think we should
go that way. It's obviously the path.

368
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,836
Okay, maybe someone else
would like to...

369
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,709
Hey, Claire paid her 1200 bucks too.
Doesn't she get a turn?

370
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,957
Don't pull me into your shit, okay?

371
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:04,913
Okay, look.

372
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:08,592
All right, let's all take out
our maps and our compasses...

373
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:11,635
It's Claire's turn, Dennis.

374
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:17,676
I think we should follow Claire.
And she said we should go this way.

375
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,840
Okay. This way it is.

376
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:31,761
- Thanks a lot.
- What?

377
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:34,763
Now this trip is finally starting to be fun.

378
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,044
I prefer busy to quiet.

379
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:45,243
Some people, they like nothing to do.
Me, it drives me crazy.

380
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:50,525
Besides, no customer, no money.

381
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:56,080
When I walking by this restaurant
every day while I going home.

382
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:59,878
It's Ethiopian restaurant.
No customer.

383
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:03,646
Every night, night after night,
no customer.

384
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:06,801
How they can make a living?
I don't know. I don't understand this.

385
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,486
I thought Ethiopian people
don't have no food.

386
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,201
Maybe that...

387
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,052
I boring you?

388
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:43,085
- Heavens, no.
- Good. Watch you don't cut your finger.

389
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,808
Did you really put a foot
in Gabe Dimas' locker?

390
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:53,927
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:58,415
That is like the greatest thing ever.
If anyone ever deserved it.

392
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,893
- Did you have sex with him?
- Oh, yeah.

393
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:05,169
- Did you suck his toes?
- Yes.

394
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,733
I'm gonna have to ask
the two of you to turn around.

395
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,850
- What?
- I'll accompany you to the last camp.

396
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,889
A jeep will take you back
to base parking.

397
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,209
You're kicking us out?
You can't do that.

398
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,697
Yes, we can. It's all in the contract
that you and your adult guardian signed.

399
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,858
Anyone who witnesses a group leader
having sex with a student...

400
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,729
...can be thrown out? I doubt it.
- You purposely led us off...

401
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,695
...the predetermined course,
endangering everyone's safety.

402
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,256
And I'd be willing to bet
there's drugs in your pack.

403
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:37,091
You can't go through my stuff.
You need a search warrant.

404
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,341
Okay? Now, look,
we can do this the easy way...

405
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,613
...or we can get cops involved.
What do you want?

406
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:48,419
- You are such a total loser.
- This is not a game, you little bitch!

407
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:50,859
- You are fucking with people's lives.
- Those people...

408
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:55,740
...are completely innocent bystanders.
Hello!

409
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:04,976
- David Fisher.
- The adult guardian of Claire Fisher?

410
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:08,100
- Yes, that is correct.
- I'm with Sierra Crossroads,

411
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:12,061
Your daughter was discovered with
marijuana, She's leaving the expedition,

412
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:16,101
Transportation's on its way to take her to
her car, She should be in L, A, tonight...

413
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:20,062
...instead of Sunday as planned,
Any questions?

414
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:23,419
No. Thank you for calling.

415
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:28,504
Your dad sounds like a real tight-ass.

416
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,866
Castaneda, huh?

417
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,265
- People still read that?
- Look, don't even, okay?

418
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,064
All need for us to interact
has been removed.

419
00:33:42,391 --> 00:33:46,509
- Listen, how well do you know Parker?
- Hardly at all.

420
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:49,220
I'd really hate it if she's one
of those people who would...

421
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:54,187
...create a huge stink and ruin my life
just for the entertainment value of it.

422
00:33:54,392 --> 00:34:00,309
- Sorry, I don't really know her.
- God, I hate pissing outdoors!

423
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:03,628
Parker, don't light that.

424
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,670
So who's in charge
while you're here babysitting us?

425
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,747
- Topher.
- What?

426
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:15,071
He hates this whole
Sierra Crossroads bullshit.

427
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:18,427
What, are you kidding? He's
been doing it since he was 14 years old.

428
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:22,226
- You're full of shit.
- It's one of the things...

429
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,349
...that helped him get accepted
to Stanford.

430
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,709
- Topher is going to Stanford?
- Prelaw.

431
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,395
This whole experience
just gets more and more irritating.

432
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,467
Here's your ride.

433
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,750
Ten minutes.

434
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,917
Damn, she looks good.
You took Polaroids, right?

435
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:19,403
Polaroids?
I borrowed Jacob's digital camera.

436
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:26,393
You blended the filler material
just perfect.

437
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:30,803
Honey, she really is your Sistine Chapel.

438
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,715
- You think?
- Baby, you know.

439
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:39,122
- Too bad you gotta bury her.
- Yeah.

440
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,285
- She looks beautiful, doesn't she?
- Never better.

441
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,638
You should've seen her yesterday.

442
00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:49,356
- You're gonna take the offer.
- I haven't decided.

443
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:53,278
No, I said, you're gonna take the offer.

444
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:57,448
- Where would I be without the Fishers?
- In a house, not some lousy apartment.

445
00:35:57,649 --> 00:36:00,722
They treat you like a migrant worker.

446
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,162
- They'll never make me a partner.
- Not ever.

447
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,640
$ 1500 a restoration.

448
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:17,008
Tuition at SC's highway robbery,
so calling helps pay for books and beer.

449
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:21,165
It's either that or become a beeper boy.
I'm not quite ready to go there.

450
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:24,127
So, what's with
the International Male shirt?

451
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,092
This? Oh, I...

452
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:30,167
- I borrowed it from my sister.
- It looks good.

453
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,482
I bet it looks even better off.

454
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:42,364
So you were talking
about square dance calling.

455
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,088
It's my grandparents' group.

456
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,935
They practically raised me
after my parents kicked me out.

457
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:49,092
Kicked you out?

458
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:52,809
- When they found out about you?
- When my father walked in on me...

459
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:55,815
...and my high-school boyfriend
fucking on the desk in his study.

460
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:59,010
It was awful.
My mother had a complete breakdown.

461
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:02,893
My parents eventually split.
It was a total movie for Lifetime.

462
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,527
What about you?
What'd your parents do?

463
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,094
When I came out?

464
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,975
My dad was okay with it.
My mom's still a little uncomfortable.

465
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:14,688
It baffles me that anyone
even gives a shit, you know?

466
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,411
Here you go. Here you go.
Enjoy.

467
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,694
- You have a boyfriend?
- No.

468
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:27,294
- Why not?
- I'm not sure.

469
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,333
You ever have one?

470
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:33,581
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah, several.

471
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:38,218
You've got the longest eyelashes
I've ever seen.

472
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,856
I've always liked older guys.

473
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:46,701
- I'm the older guy.
- Guys my age are idiots.

474
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:50,260
They're fun to fuck,
but it usually ends there.

475
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:54,020
And I hate the way they treat older men.
Tired old queen, fossil, troll.

476
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:56,944
As if we're not gonna end up there
ourselves one day.

477
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,657
I'm getting my master's in social work...

478
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,143
...with a concentration on services
for seniors, so it's a pet peeve of mine.

479
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,702
- Are you a top or a bottom?
- What?

480
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:15,423
Oh, I'm versatile.

481
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,899
Bottom, good, this will work out well.
You want to get out of here?

482
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,388
Yeah.

483
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:30,339
So the bastard carked it.
I lost my investment, my bike...

484
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,099
...fucking everything.
- Connor, this always happens to you.

485
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:38,549
Oh, well. I guess I can always go back
on the banana roll?

486
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:43,071
Do you remember, what was that,
that thing in Texas?

487
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:46,070
- You lost your bike in Texas!
- Oh, not that fucking woman.

488
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,911
Yes, it was like '95 or something.
What was that?

489
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:51,991
Well, I thought I was gonna get a root.

490
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,991
Hey, Nate.

491
00:38:57,914 --> 00:39:01,543
Listen.
I'm sorry about last week.

492
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:08,194
I go off the meds now and then
just to feel alive.

493
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:11,991
I'm sure you must have thought
I was a total psycho.

494
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,115
It crossed my mind.

495
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,907
Well, I'm not.

496
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:35,910
I don't want to come
between you and my sister.

497
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,108
She's happy with you.

498
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:44,553
Happier than I've seen her
in a long time and I mean that.

499
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,719
That is so tragic.

500
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:53,160
So, what's the story? Just
another spunk to add to your collection?

501
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:59,917
So, what's there left for me to do?
Become an air hostess?

502
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:03,672
I think you should get a TV show
where you wrestle things, right?

503
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:08,041
- But not animals. Things.
- What kind of things?

504
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:13,876
Like household objects.
Like refrigerators.

505
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:20,163
And here's the title of it, right,
A Sandwich Short of a Picnic,

506
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,999
That's the fucking way I like it too.

507
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,077
Yeah, hey, caller,
what's your John Dory?

508
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,959
What fucking language
are you speaking?

509
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:35,837
Nate, buddy. Chill.

510
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:46,561
This car is, like, total Graceland
on wheels.

511
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:51,638
Total love nest.
Have you ever fucked in here?

512
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,841
Once.

513
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,083
I know this record exec,
a friend of my dad's.

514
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,169
He's got like this total
make-out van from the '70s.

515
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:04,841
He thinks it's so cool
and it's just not.

516
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:08,202
How do you think Dennis
knew I had pot?

517
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:13,803
So your dad died, huh?
What was that like?

518
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:19,604
I don't know.
It doesn't seem real.

519
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:25,443
- I never knew anybody that died.
- I grew up in a funeral home, so...

520
00:41:25,654 --> 00:41:31,491
...I was always around it.
- Okay, was that, like, completely weird?

521
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:34,126
Yes.

522
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:39,213
My dad's a big shot at Disney.

523
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,294
Really, why don't you
go to private school?

524
00:41:42,496 --> 00:41:47,446
He divorced my mom a long time ago.
He likes his new family better.

525
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,013
He won't give my mom alimony,
because he caught her having sex...

526
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:56,338
...with, like, this retarded guy.
- Fuck.

527
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:00,970
I'm kidding.
My mom gets killer alimony.

528
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:03,613
I just keep getting kicked out
of private schools.

529
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:10,652
I thought you were, like, this total
overachiever. Like, little Miss Perfect.

530
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,368
Good. That's what
I want people to think.

531
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:19,018
When in reality you're, like,
this compulsive liar, danger slut.

532
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:26,375
I thought you were,
like, this Goth arty freak girl...

533
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:32,931
...who was, like, tragic and suicidal.
- Oh, my God, that is so not who I am.

534
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:38,573
Nobody is ever who they seem to be.

535
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,138
Nobody interesting.

536
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:46,025
You told me two lesbians
took a bath in my bathtub,

537
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:51,495
I don't get this show.

538
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,499
- It's a game show.
- I know that.

539
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:56,174
I just don't understand
why people like it.

540
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:59,140
My friend Amelia
says it's her favorite show.

541
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:04,102
It's a great show.
My son likes Once Upon a Hamster,

542
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:07,698
When I was his age,
I was crazy for Mad Magazine,

543
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:10,862
Ernie Kovacs, the Marx brothers.

544
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:16,427
Anybody that took potshots
at sacred cows. I mean, anybody.

545
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:43,428
Yeah, I loved all that stuff.

546
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:45,948
Irreverence was my drug of choice.

547
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,543
Still is, I guess.

548
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,471
Nate, mate.

549
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,790
I'm really glad you
and Lollies hooked up.

550
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:13,310
I mean, personally I couldn't handle her
playing Freud all the fucking time.

551
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:18,025
I don't give a fuck
why I am the way I am.

552
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:22,993
Well, she is a complicated woman.

553
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,792
No, she's not.

554
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:44,796
I found this in a shoebox
and made you a copy.

555
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:49,873
Oh, that's killer, Billy.
Oh, it's a great shot, mate.

556
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:54,200
Oh, look at you in your sluggos.

557
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,678
Poor yabbie wouldn't know
if his ass was on fire.

558
00:45:00,883 --> 00:45:03,193
Useless as the bottom half of a mermaid.

559
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,555
Put some sunnies
on your stale bottle of piss.

560
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,920
Let's have a bobbley,
you daggy deadshit.

561
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,878
Crock a bingle, you googlie.

562
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:16,036
Drongo.

563
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:39,006
- When was that taken?
- Two summers ago. In Perth.

564
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,440
I thought you said you hadn't
seen him in a decade.

565
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:46,767
No, I said Connor hasn't been to L.A.
In a decade.

566
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,609
Where do you sleep, mate?

567
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,882
Because that sleeping bag
hasn't moved an inch in days!

568
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:57,159
- They sleep in the same bed, where else?
- Don't crack a fit, Nate, mate.

569
00:45:57,371 --> 00:46:02,765
- I mean, she's totally wrapped up in you.
- Oh, you just shut the fuck up, cowboy!

570
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:06,448
Okay, I didn't tell you, because
I knew you would react just like this.

571
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:08,489
Well, how else am I supposed to react?

572
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,567
I'm supposed to make an old friend sleep
on the floor to protect your macho pride?

573
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,889
- You have a shiatsu mat!
- Come on, man.

574
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:18,325
Haven't you ever slept with a woman
and not had sex with her?

575
00:46:21,894 --> 00:46:25,854
- No!
- Outside, get some air.

576
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:29,770
"Go outside, get some air. "
Fuck you!

577
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:32,444
I'm leaving!

578
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:39,645
Have fun with your Aussie fuck mate,
fucker!

579
00:46:52,298 --> 00:46:55,052
Damn, you are versatile.

580
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:03,813
You think I'm being a possessive asshole
for wanting Brenda for myself?

581
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,171
Wanting to feel connected with someone
doesn't mean you're possessive...

582
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,656
...or an asshole.
But until there's a commitment...

583
00:47:10,101 --> 00:47:11,580
...you have no claim on her.

584
00:47:11,781 --> 00:47:13,976
A woman doesn't have to wait
to be chosen anymore.

585
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:16,377
- She can do the choosing.
- Lf she waits too long...

586
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:19,142
...the right guy might just move on.

587
00:47:19,622 --> 00:47:22,581
You're right, dear.
You're so right.

588
00:47:22,783 --> 00:47:27,140
A chartered bus out of Vegas
overturned on the 10 last night.

589
00:47:27,823 --> 00:47:31,817
Forty-four passengers.
Most of them dead.

590
00:47:33,304 --> 00:47:35,943
- You sleep well last night?
- Yes, thank you.

591
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:39,218
You sleep at all last night?

592
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:43,140
- How'd the funeral director's test go?
- Oh, man, I choked.

593
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:45,735
- What a cluster fuck.
- Language.

594
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,585
- You just said "asshole. "
- Nate, I need you to pass that test.

595
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:52,257
Yeah, well, Dave, I need you to
lighten up on me, starting now.

596
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,220
Hey.

597
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:04,581
First of all, I just want to thank you guys
for everything that you've done for me.

598
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:09,505
But I think it's time for me to move on.
I have to think about my future.

599
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:13,908
- My family's future.
- You're leaving us? Oh, dear.

600
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,260
You haven't given us a chance
to counter Kroehner...

601
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,784
Am I a partner?

602
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:27,944
You guys didn't even talk about it.

603
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,552
Thank you, Federico.

604
00:48:35,673 --> 00:48:38,983
I'm sorry that we can't offer you more.

605
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:44,230
You will always have a job
waiting for you here.

606
00:48:48,074 --> 00:48:50,270
Kroehner will never appreciate
how good you are.

607
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:53,512
You'll just be a part of their
assembly line.

608
00:48:54,555 --> 00:48:56,864
Yeah. We'll see.

609
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:06,357
A word of advice, guys.
Don't turn your back on Gilardi.

610
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,955
Well, so much for loyalty.

611
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:13,514
Nate, he's given us five years.
He doesn't owe us anything.

612
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,152
Nobody owes us.

613
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:39,591
My only defense is
I think I was hallucinating.

614
00:49:41,802 --> 00:49:45,841
That and the thought of you
with another man makes me crazy.

615
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,953
Sorry.

616
00:49:49,603 --> 00:49:52,071
I'm just a guy that way.

617
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:55,841
- So where's Connor?
- Oh, God, I threw him out.

618
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:58,080
There's only so much of him I can take.

619
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:04,635
- So you forgive me?
- Sure, why not?

620
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:08,360
Good.
Now it's your turn.

621
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:14,242
- You want me to apologize?
- Yes.

622
00:50:17,086 --> 00:50:21,922
For trying to use Billy's meltdown
and Connor's visit to push me away.

623
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:25,723
For being impatient with my very valid
emotional response to each one.

624
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:28,846
And for always asking me to adjust
my behavior and feelings...

625
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:31,278
...but never being willing
to do that yourself.

626
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:37,608
Okay, that's fair.

627
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,766
I apologize.

628
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:48,087
- Part of you wants me to bail.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

629
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:50,647
Why?

630
00:50:54,932 --> 00:51:00,564
Because we've already gone further
than I have with anybody since...

631
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:03,810
Since a long time ago.

632
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:09,205
Because every time I've ever believed
in a happy ending...

633
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,884
...I've gotten severely fucked.

634
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:16,686
Sorry.

635
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,284
Well, do me a favor.

636
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:24,488
Promise me from here on out
I am the only naked man in your bed...

637
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:26,812
...and in your life.

638
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:29,695
I'm serious, Bren.
Promise me.

639
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:34,968
I promise.

640
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:38,131
I love you and I want to be with you
for the long haul.

641
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:41,091
But there's a limit to the amount of shit
I will put up with.

642
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,812
Did you just make me
a lifetime commitment...

643
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,772
...right before the thinly veiled
threat of abandonment?

644
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:50,609
Well, I don't remember
using the word "lifetime. "

645
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:54,409
Oh, well, I won't hold you to it.

646
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:09,420
Sorry I'm so weird about intimacy.

647
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:12,856
I guess spending your childhood
being picked apart...

648
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:16,942
...by behavioral psychologists
will do that.

649
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:20,421
Yeah, well, not being able
to sleep at night...

650
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:24,981
...because you know your basement's
full of dead people takes its toll too.

651
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,582
Sorry.

652
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:49,416
Nate Fisher.

653
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,897
Remember that chartered bus
that overturned last night?

654
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:54,019
They were all locals.
We're getting three.

655
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:58,267
- The first family will be here in an hour.
- I'm on my way.

656
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:01,859
- And try to curb your enthusiasm.
- This will be tough without Rico.

657
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:03,661
See you later,

658
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:26,750
- Good Lord, what did they do to you?
- Don't ask.

659
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:36,704
So did Mom freak
when you told her I got busted?

660
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,269
I didn't tell her.

661
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:43,744
- Okay, why?
- I don't know, other stuff came up.

662
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:45,832
It seemed like a low priority.

663
00:53:46,595 --> 00:53:49,826
- Are you going to?
- Probably not.

664
00:53:53,276 --> 00:53:57,030
I'm sorry the Crossroads thing
didn't work out like you had hoped.

665
00:53:57,236 --> 00:53:59,148
Actually, it was kind of amazing.

666
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,673
I think I really learned
something valuable.

667
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:07,951
Everything I think I know is wrong.

668
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,708
Hey, what happened to that guy Keith?

669
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,638
It just didn't work out.

670
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:32,675
- That's too bad.
- Life goes on.

671
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,039
That it does.

672
00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:42,636
Well, there's work to be done.

673
00:55:13,514 --> 00:56:08,169
