Saison 5 Episode 8
"Singing for our lives"

8
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:53,361
Hey, Marita.

9
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,235
No, I'm working.

10
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,841
Another half hour and I gotta
go feed a cat off mulholland.

11
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,018
What kind of party  ?

12
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,945
All right, I'll call
you when I get home.

13
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh, shit.

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,212
You should see this hill.

15
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,178
No, I'm on my rollerblades.

16
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:15,309
I should really take
them off and walk down.

17
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,646
It's really steep.

18
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,365
Really, really steep.

19
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,415
Call you right back.

20
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,834
Come on, pup, come on  !

21
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,278
All right  !

22
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,501
Oh my god  ! Now we're safe.

23
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,634
I need some help out here  !

24
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,173
I need some help  !

25
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,212
Did I tell you Nate's dragging me

26
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,420
to a quaker church service tonight  ?

27
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,849
- No.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,986
He thinks couples therapy
is a waste of time,

29
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,657
So this is his solution.

30
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,731
I thought you were
already going to therapy.

31
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,573
Oh yeah, we went once,

32
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,838
But he thought

33
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:20,695
That the therapist and
I were ganging up on him,

34
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,551
So that was that.

35
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:25,616
Well, who knows, maybe a little
spirituality will help, you know.

36
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,324
Quakerism  ?

37
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,980
Yeah, right.

38
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,361
I just wish he'd take half as
much interest in his own baby.

39
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:34,791
Hey, if it was important
to you to have him here,

40
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,494
You should have made that clear to him.

41
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,753
I didn't tell him.

42
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,595
Nate and I, we're 100
miles apart on this baby.

43
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,333
On everything, really.

44
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,406
I didn't want him here.

45
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:47,708
I mean, it's not good for me.

46
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,892
It's certainly not good for the baby.

47
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,567
Ha.

48
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,467
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,817
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, dr. Melnick.

50
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:01,901
- How are you feeling today  ?
- Okay.

51
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:03,488
Yeah.

52
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,355
- Would you lie back for me please  ?

53
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,918
- No husband today  ?
- No, no. He couldn't get away from work.

54
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,566
This is my friend Jackie.

55
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,497
There's your fetus.

56
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,039
Oh.

57
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,399
Nice heartbeat.

58
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,611
Size looks good. Yeah.

59
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,540
Everything seems to be
developing normally at this point.

60
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,747
So the baby's healthy  ?

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,265
I'd still like to do an amnio.

62
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,343
No. No.

63
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,377
Do you want to know the baby's sex  ?

64
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,449
Here's my work number, my cell number.

65
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:01,080
I know those numbers, David.

66
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:03,293
Yes, but sometimes in
the panic of an emergency

67
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,077
It's helpful to have them written down.

68
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,840
I'll be driving Roger's limo
all day, so here's that number.

69
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:10,251
This is too many numbers, honestly.

70
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,516
We really appreciate
you watching the boys.

71
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,497
Durrell didn't tell us
until last night that

72
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,974
- It was teacher development day.
- You didn't ask me.

73
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,223
I'm glad to finally have some
time with my new grandchildren.

74
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,936
You've been hiding them from me.

75
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,173
We've been trying to keep
them to a regular schedule.

76
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,060
Well, we'll have fun today.

77
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:27,932
I brought the makings for
chocolate chip cookies.

78
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,541
- I thought I'd bake.
- I like chocolate chip cookies.

79
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,290
All boys do.

80
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:34,094
- I don't.
- You'll like mine.

81
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:36,592
Oh, we'll see about that.

82
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:39,023
Durrell, you do whatever
Mrs. Fisher tells you to do.

83
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:41,535
What if she tells me
to jump out the window  ?

84
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,804
They're allowed one hour of
television, one our of playstation

85
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,894
And they can take their soccer
ball down to the courtyard.

86
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:49,334
But they'd better not be kicking
the ball against the building.

87
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,720
- Or you'll whup us.
- I did not say that.

88
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,150
We'll be fine, really. You two go now.

89
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,703
Have a good day.

90
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,764
I'll be home by 5 :00.

91
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,667
You look like a witch.

92
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,532
I assure you I'm not.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,984
I didn't say you were.
I said you look like one.

94
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,293
<i>This is what they made very efficient.</i>

95
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:28,108
<i>This is why the republicans
rely so much on this base.</i>

96
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:31,170
<i>This is a corporatized
christian cult situation</i>

97
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,077
<i>Where it's about personal empowerment</i>

98
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,350
<i>Which is part of the republican agenda</i>

99
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,016
<i>The neo-Contact cult agenda.</i>

100
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,576
<i>What Ray was talking about</i>

101
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,446
<i>Ray is obviously a
different type of christian</i>

102
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,234
<i>Who I offended</i>

103
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,154
Oh god. Jesus.

104
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,805
Usted decidiro sobra
la señora de Guadalupe.

105
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:24,829
Sí. Perro con manguillos de cobre.

106
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,030
Amarillo pulido.

107
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,476
- ¿Qué  ?
- El cobre pulido.

108
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,127
Pulido, pulido what  ?

109
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,089
- Qué pulido  ?
- Con en el interior en seda rosada,

110
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,388
- En vez de marrón.
- Polished.

111
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,518
Pulido, polished.
Polished what  ?

112
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,484
I don't know what
you're talking about.

113
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,754
Qué dio.

114
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,360
Por favor, un momento.

115
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:53,306
If you knew they didn't speak english,

116
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,222
Then why did you even
try to handle the intake  ?

117
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,201
I'm trying to learn spanish.
By using our clients as a classroom  ?

118
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:01,216
I didn't plan this. It was a walk-In.
I was the only one available.

119
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:04,519
What am I supposed
do with this body now  ?

120
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,641
You wanna take over for me  ?

121
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,308
Oh, that's right. You can't.

122
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,753
I already did most of the work.

123
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,926
Great. I'm really in the mood for
dealing with a grieving widower.

124
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,105
It's her parents.

125
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,712
She's married, then her parents
don't have the right to make these decisions.

126
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,398
- To make these decisions Nate.
- I think she was divorced.

127
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,710
- You think  ?
- Yes, Rico, I think.

128
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,391
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

129
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,501
- Are you really sure about all this  ?
- What  ?

130
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,455
Didn't you overdo it
on the merchandise  ?

131
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,502
What are you talking about  ?

132
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,868
You sold them a casket for $4,000,

133
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,173
You added another $600
just to switch handles,

134
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,633
Three grand for the monument,
another $400 for doves.

135
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:57,612
It just goes on.

136
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,752
This is their youngest daughter
they're burying Nate.

137
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,320
The guy works in a machine
shop. He can't afford this.

138
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,818
Besides learning to mangle
a few words in spanish,

139
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,705
Maybe you should learn something
about latin culture as well.

140
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:09,710
We honor our dead, Nate.

141
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:12,654
- And end up broke because of it.
- That is so fucking racist.

142
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,634
How am I being racist  ? ! You're
the one who said it's cultural thing.

143
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,669
Every single member of the family
pitches in at moments like this.

144
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:22,012
Everyone. We take care of each
other. No one's left broke.

145
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,538
I've got work to do.

146
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,973
As you can see we've got
a top of the line retort

147
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,565
To the primary and secondary chambers

148
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,814
Just we're lined last year. Feel
free to look over everything.

149
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,757
- You're asking 340,000  ?

150
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,861
Oh, it's worth every penny, David.

151
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,989
I get over 300 cases a year.

152
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,092
I could handle more if
I added another retort

153
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,130
Which is exactly what I would do
If I were 20 years younger.

154
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,567
Cremation is a growing
business, you know that.

155
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,919
Yes, I do.

156
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,198
You don't want fisher &
sons to get left behind.

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,934
Fisher & Diaz.

158
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:02,419
I've got another prospective
buyer stopping by in the morning.

159
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:05,194
- I see.
- I'm not trying to push you,

160
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,006
But I've had this place since 1972.

161
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,405
It's been good to me.

162
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,611
I'd be pleased to pass it on
to the sons of Nathaniel Fisher.

163
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:17,302
I'll talk to my partners.

164
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,719
Regular non-fat latte.

165
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,137
Oh  ! Steal us a bunch of splendas.

166
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,123
- Like a whole bunch.
- Splenda.

167
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,658
Yeah. A large mocha ice-Blended please.

168
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,550
I want a regular soy

169
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,494
pomegranate blueberry tea latte.
But in a large cup.

170
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,667
and then could you
just fill up the rest with soy  ?

171
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:42,823
Isn't that just a large soy
pomegranate blueberry tea latte  ?

172
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,278
No, it's a regular in a large cup.

173
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:48,246
Oh, and also...

174
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,875
A reduced-Fat...

175
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,480
Wholesome morning muffin.

176
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,926
Claire  ?

177
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,786
Hey, Anita.

178
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:09,320
Oh, someone's very thirsty.

179
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,893
And on her way to
bible class, I'm guessing.

180
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:14,205
Oh yeah. It's pretty awful, isn't it  ?

181
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:16,984
I'm kind of temping at this place.

182
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,928
Is that where you've been  ?
Shit, I've left you like 100 messages

183
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:22,214
- I thought you were dead.
- Sorry.

184
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,007
You were like my best friend
and then suddenly you were gone.

185
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,406
Well, how've you been  ?

186
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:33,039
Fabulous. You know.
School, sex, drugs, creating art.

187
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,288
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:39,208
I'm kind of on the clock,
so I should probably go.

189
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,575
Ah, here, let me give you this.

190
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,009
Lac-Arts junior show.
I got a piece in it.

191
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,770
Oh, wow  !

192
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,910
Please promise you'll come.

193
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,333
Everybody'll be there.

194
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,976
Yeah, okay. Great.

195
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,943
Good.

196
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,792
Boys, the first batch is ready  !

197
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,468
Anthony, Durrell,

198
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,961
The cookies are ready  !

199
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:44,484
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

200
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,503
Sure.

201
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:50,669
Come on, a quaker church service.
At the very least it'll be interesting.

202
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,143
I'm trying to keep an open mind.

203
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,692
There's no sermon or anything.

204
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:59,373
People just sit silently
And wait to be filled

205
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,901
with the presence of god.

206
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:05,836
Maggie says we can say
something if we feel like it, but

207
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,915
You don't have to.
It's not like a requirement.

208
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,750
Is there anything else
Maggie thinks we should know  ?

209
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,637
Melnick says the baby's
looking really good.

210
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,230
- When was this  ?
- This morning.

211
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,278
- I had a sonogram.
- What  ?

212
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:23,630
Why didn't you tell me about it  ?

213
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,583
Because I wanted to spare you the grief.

214
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,898
I'm sorry, but this is one of the
things that we talked about really.

215
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:30,377
It pisses me off when you do
stuff like this without telling me.

216
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,171
Ok, why don't you sit
there and allow yourself

217
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,627
To be filled with the presence of god  ?

218
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:42,108
- So what did she say  ?
- She said that the baby

219
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,836
was developing normally.

220
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:46,784
There's no sign of any irregularities,

221
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:49,596
All of which is very very encouraging.

222
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,052
So it's perfectly healthy.

223
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,953
Well, you know,
there are some things

224
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,649
That the sonogram can't tell.

225
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,559
What, so it could have
down's or Spina Bifida  ?

226
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,700
Oh, no probably not
downs because we did

227
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,479
this neck measurement test.
And at looked really good.

228
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,643
Wow. So, great  !

229
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,573
We get to maybe check
this one thing off the list

230
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,521
And it could still have a million
other things wrong with it.

231
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,282
The baby's not an it, Nate, it's a girl.

232
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,057
We're having another daughter.

233
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,197
Mom, how could you let
them take off like that  ?

234
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,188
I had no idea they'd left.

235
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:33,855
- Why weren't you watching them  ?
- I was making cookies.

236
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:35,540
You said they could
play in the courtyard.

237
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,329
You never thought
once to check on them  ?

238
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,775
Don't talk to me like I'm an imbecile.

239
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:41,160
- I've raised three children.
- That's why I expected

240
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:43,714
A little more from you.
This just can't happen, mum.

241
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:46,614
Then you can take me off
your list of babysitters.

242
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,850
I'm taking my cookies.

243
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,776
You can wipe that smirk
right off your face.

244
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,311
You are grounded, mister.

245
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,090
And you cannot tell Keith about this.

246
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,489
<i>You can't just shuffle
through the process</i>

247
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:15,240
<i>- and pretend I don't exist.
- It's nerve-Wracking enough</i>

248
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,132
- For me without you being-
- What, the voice of reason  ?

249
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,877
Wow, you look great.

250
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,895
- Are we going out tonight  ?
- I am

251
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,557
I'm going to dinner with Angelica
And some of her friends.

252
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:59,562
We might go to a party
afterwards so don't wait up.

253
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:03,619
Oh.

254
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:06,637
Boys eaten  ?

255
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,905
This is wednesday. It's your
night to take care of dinner.

256
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,706
- Oh, right right.
- Don't give me that look.

257
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,640
You have one night
a week, I have six.

258
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:18,762
Order some pizza if
that's the best you can do.

259
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,710
- I can cook something.
- Don't forget to clean up.

260
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:23,076
That's not my job.

261
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,180
- Okay, I get it.

262
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:25,884
And do not make me
the bad guy here, please  ?

263
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:27,837
Vanessa...

264
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,593
I'm fine. Just
Just go.

265
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,255
I am.

266
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:40,510
So, friends... With the doctor saying

267
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,517
everything's in remission,

268
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,916
Kathy and I are feeling very...

269
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,770
Very blessed right now.

270
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,983
Friends... I have

271
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,438
been dizzy all week. And
I had to take the bus here.

272
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,072
I need someone to
give me a ride home.

273
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:16,462
Oh

274
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,096
Thank you.

275
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,566
I just wanted to say how
good it feels to be here.

276
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,213
All day long I deal with death...

277
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:42,683
And stress...

278
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:46,317
And it's nice to be
in a place of peace.

279
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,485
That's all.

280
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,935
Is it okay if I take some
of those cookies to work  ?

281
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:04,682
You made so many.

282
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:07,423
- Take as many as you'd like.
- Thanks.

283
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,203
- Do you want some help  ?
- No.

284
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:15,297
I think I've already
made a mess of it.

285
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,565
I don't know why I try
and cut my own hair.

286
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,116
Pamper yourself. Go to a salon.

287
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,746
It's not like we're
living on the prairie.

288
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,320
You want to give quaker church
another chance tomorrow night  ?

289
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,930
- Not really.
- One, two, four, three, five.

290
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,428
- Okay.
- Why  ?

291
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,184
Well, Maggie's car is in the shop

292
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,752
And I offered to
give her a ride, so...

293
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:50,412
It's 8 :30 in the morning and
you've already talked to Maggie  ?

294
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,098
She needed a ride.

295
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,290
That place looked like
it was full of friends

296
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,995
Who just love to be her ride.

297
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,769
Do you want to come or not  ?

298
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:04,793
Are you really buying into this  ?

299
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,690
I'm not buying into anything.

300
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,737
So, when you went into
that church last night,

301
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,385
You really believed you
were in the presence of god  ?

302
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:13,990
What I said was that it
felt like a place of peace.

303
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:16,685
- Which it isn't here.
- Not a lot lately, no.

304
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:19,262
One, two, three, four, five.

305
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,699
Hey, sweetie. Can you
get your shoes for me,

306
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,267
Then I'll get you ready
for daycare, okay  ?

307
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,849
Thank you.

308
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,083
It was just nice, Brenda.
It was really nice to

309
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,674
be around some people who
didn't think they know everything

310
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,280
And who thought there might
be something more to life

311
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,712
Than what they can see and
feel and be right about.

312
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,168
Well, I feel sorry for you

313
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,867
That you have such emptiness inside you

314
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:49,027
That you need to fill it with
something so...

315
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:50,844
ridiculous.

316
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,261
- You really don't believe in anything  ?
- You know I don't.

317
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,172
Well, I feel sorry for you then.

318
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:57,121
And I don't understand
where you draw the line.

319
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,412
The service is basically

320
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:01,247
silent meditation. You meditate.

321
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,308
Yes, but I'm not waiting for
some mythical, historical ghost

322
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,553
With his shaming,
blood-sacrifice bullshit

323
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,506
To come and save my soul.

324
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,973
I meditate to see the world as it is

325
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,764
To accept the world,

326
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,717
To feel alive.

327
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,534
And you can't do
that with other people  ?

328
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,294
Not with those people, no.

329
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,771
So if I get involved with Quakerism

330
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,907
Or whatever because
it makes sense to me,

331
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:24,606
- Because it means something to me,
- Nate, you can't you're just using this

332
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,969
As a way to distance yourself
from me and your baby,

333
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,001
Because you're scared and
you don't know what to do.

334
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:31,702
How could I be distancing
myself  ? ! I'm here every night  !

335
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:34,321
Not tomorrow night  ! Apparently
you'd rather be with that sappy,

336
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,368
- Little ferret, Maggie.
- Hey  !

337
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,613
- She is a deeply kind person.
- Oh.

338
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,755
Is that what you're looking
for now  ?

339
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:42,635
A deeply kind person  ?

340
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:43,754
Well, I know I don't want someone

341
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,942
Who makes me feel like shit
every second of the day.

342
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,546
If I'm so awful, why don't you leave  ?

343
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:51,575
Will you stop threatening me  ? It's like
you think you can win every argument

344
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,561
- By giving me some fucking ultimatum  !
- No, it was a question  !

345
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,512
Yeah  ? Well, I'm not leaving  !

346
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,405
Maybe you want to leave,
but I'm here Brenda  !

347
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:00,900
I am here, Brenda,
I m'not going anywhere

348
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:03,453
I gotta go to work.

349
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,064
Hey, Benny. What's up  ?

350
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:20,224
- Can you tell me what this is  ?
- A side mirror.

351
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:22,619
Can you tell me what
it's doing in my hand  ?

352
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,666
- You got me.
- It's in my hand because it's no longer

353
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,325
attached to my car. And it's no
longer attached to my car

354
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,243
Because your kid knocked it
off with your ginormous truck

355
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:33,280
- Trying to park last week.
- What, Durrell  ?

356
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,605
He's 12 years old, man.

357
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,898
Oh, fucking kid.

358
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,979
All right, I'll pay you for it.

359
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,927
$280.00

360
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,859
I'll, I'll write you a check.

361
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:04,310
So, was that you I saw crawling out
of a lime-Green hearse yesterday  ?

362
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,047
It's actually more of an avocado.

363
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:11,231
Ah. You don't seem
particularly goth and...

364
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,606
I don't think you have
your own band, so...

365
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,179
- My dad was a funeral director.
- Ah.

366
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,977
- Really  ?
- Yeah. I grew up in a funeral home.

367
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,263
- I still live in a funeral home.
- Wow.

368
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:27,019
- With dead bodies and everything.
- Yep.

369
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:30,451
- Isn't that kind of scary  ?
- Not compared to this.

370
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:49,143
"Lac-Arts junior show."

371
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,388
- Tonight. You going  ?
- I don't know. I said I would.

372
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,195
But I think I might become
conveniently sick.

373
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:58,331
- Not into it  ?
- No, it's just these friends from school

374
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:01,200
- Who I don't see anymore.
- No way  ? I got the same thing

375
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,941
This get together with all
my old fraternity brothers.

376
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:07,223
I'm the only one who's not married
or in a serious relationship,

377
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,054
So I end up looking like a loser.

378
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:13,073
- Which you are.
- Beside the point.

379
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:18,767
How about I go with
you to your thing,

380
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,439
- And you come with me to mine  ?
- Are you serious  ?

381
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,307
Yeah. We'll take my car.

382
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,538
Cool.

383
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,172
- Just going to
- Please.

384
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:42,665
I think it's an opportunity
we can't afford to pass up.

385
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:48,490
- Did you start without me  ?
- No, I'm just reading David's proposal

386
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:51,495
- While we waited for you.
- Proposal  ? What proposal  ?

387
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:54,011
This. I think now

388
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:56,115
At the end of our corporate year.
Instead of taking

389
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,063
our traditional bonuses,
we should think

390
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:00,462
reinvesting in the company.

391
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:04,161
- I'm all for that.
- So I suggest we buy a crematory.

392
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:07,330
What  ? No. No. No way.

393
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:08,938
You haven't even read it yet.

394
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,576
People who want their
loved ones cremated

395
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,341
Are people who don't
wanna spend anything.

396
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:14,152
There's no money to
be made in cremation.

397
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:16,437
Of course, there is. There's no
overhead if we own our own.

398
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,755
Yeah, just a $340,000 mortgage.

399
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:23,526
No, here's another
number to think about.

400
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,520
35%. Do you know what that number is  ?

401
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,788
That is the percentage of our
clientele that was latino last year.

402
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:38,614
Do you know why it was so high  ?
I'm not saying anything.

403
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,254
I've already been called
a racist once this week.

404
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:43,208
Because the name Diaz
went up on our sign.

405
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:46,143
That's why we have all
this extra money, because

406
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:48,107
I'm bringing in
the latino community.

407
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,492
And there's no way that I'm
voting that we get a crematory.

408
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:52,558
So what is it you want  ?

409
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,804
Well, another spanish
speaking employee

410
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:57,002
To work exclusively
in community outreach.

411
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,795
Fisher and Diaz needs to be a
visible member in our community.

412
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:02,631
We should be sponsoring soccer teams

413
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,185
Rico, I'm gonna stop you right there.

414
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,903
We can't think of all the
fun things we'd like to do.

415
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:10,072
- We have to plan for our future.
- This is our future  !

416
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,884
I don't think it's the
future of Fisher and Diaz.

417
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:16,279
Oh, I get it.

418
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,030
The fisher boys are ganging up
because you're afraid of

419
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,025
- losing a little control, huh  ?
- Wait, don't include me in this.

420
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,573
- Ruth Fisher.
- Hello, Hiram.

421
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:44,256
Have a seat, I'll be
with you in a moment.

422
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:46,961
Or if you'd prefer one
of our other stylists...

423
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:49,867
No, I'm here to see you.

424
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:53,629
I think the last thing we
need to do is buy a crematory.

425
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,314
- Thank you.
- But I don't agree with you either.

426
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:59,089
God, this whole business
is so screwed up.

427
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,150
Death used to be something
that happened at home,

428
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,310
It was taken care of by family
And all the undertaker,

429
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:06,123
did was build the caskets.
We were cabinet makers.

430
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:10,061
Okay, I'm not sure I know
how to build a cabinet.

431
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,474
It wasn't until the civil war. That
they needed to transport bodies

432
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:16,760
back home without them decomposing
That they started embalming them.

433
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:20,017
Of course, some asshole figured
out a way to make money off of it.

434
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:22,476
There is no real reason
for most of what we do.

435
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,630
We don't need to embalm bodies.

436
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,289
Well, there is a little
problem of smell.

437
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,637
So what  ?

438
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,987
That's a part of death.
And I think that's where

439
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,820
This business went wrong. We tried to
disguise it, make it look pretty, neat,

440
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:37,085
- And someone else's problem.
- Nate, do you actually have a proposal

441
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,182
Or is this just more
of a general lecture  ?

442
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,852
- Green funerals.
- Oh, brother.

443
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:44,985
No caskets, no toxic chemicals
to leach into the soil.

444
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,046
- And we make money on this how  ?
- This isn't about making money.

445
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:49,664
This is about making a better world.

446
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,990
I'm sorry, but a world that I'm broke in

447
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:54,932
- Doesn't seem better to me.
- All right, look,

448
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:57,624
We find a natural setting
that's worth preserving.

449
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,974
We get a conservation
easement so that it's protected

450
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,684
From being developed in the future.

451
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:03,552
Look who's doing his
homework all of a sudden.

452
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,974
I just know that when I die,
please, wrap me in a shroud,

453
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,035
Plant me next to
a beautiful tree so that,

454
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,494
Nobody could build
a mini-Mall there.

455
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,959
According to your pre-Need
you wanna be cremated.

456
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,439
- So I'll change it.
- Nate.

457
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:19,900
Really, I understand and it
all sounds very wonderful,

458
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,054
- But we don't have that kind of money.
- So we'll get some investors  !

459
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,924
Jesus, David, can you
just try to be optimistic

460
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,746
Instead of always coming up
with reasons to never change  ?

461
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:32,067
If you want to pursue
this, you have my blessing,

462
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,914
But I'm not putting any
of our money into it.

463
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,326
Yeah, great meeting, guys.

464
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:48,196
- Hey, man  !
- Jesus. Hey, man.

465
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:49,889
- How are you doing  ?
- Did you meet Claire  ?

466
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,620
No. Hey, I'm lauderback.

467
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:55,018
- Thanks. Claire here is just visiting.
- Oh  !

468
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:57,985
She's actually the biggest
soap opera star in all of Holland.

469
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,816
Cool.

470
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,874
Welcome to America.

471
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,739
Danke.

472
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,870
It's good to see you.
Good to meet you.

473
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,199
Lauderback invented this game

474
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:18,223
Where we'd all put diapers on
under our pants, go to a strip club

475
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,069
And the first one who could take a
shit while getting a lap dance won.

476
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,475
- What was the point of that  ?
- We were in college.

477
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,955
And idiots and drunk.

478
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:31,610
- I never won.
- Good.

479
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:36,435
Strange to think that these were
My best friends for four years.

480
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,550
I have nothing in common
with them anymore.

481
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,011
They're all bmws and baby strollers.

482
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:43,841
And golf on the weekends.

483
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,475
I'm not ready to be my dad just yet.

484
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,250
So what made you decide
to become a lawyer  ?

485
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:53,380
That's what my dad is.

486
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,961
I know, I'm a complete hypocrite.

487
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,706
It's actually pretty good, though.

488
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:01,287
Maybe not my dream come true, but...

489
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,534
I like it.

490
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:08,346
I knew he did it once. I didn't
know it was a regular thing.

491
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,862
- Why the hell didn't you tell me  ?
- Because I took care of it.

492
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:14,919
You've got to stop babying him, David.

493
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,919
Grab the vegetables, please.

494
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:24,420
- You are grounded, my man.
- I'm already grounded.

495
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,094
But I wasn't supposed to tell you.

496
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,706
So are you gonna pay for that mirror  ?

497
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,801
It was $280.

498
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,161
I'm not paying for
nothing. You pay for it.

499
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:39,679
- You don't talk to me that way, you hear  ?
- I'll talk to you anyway I want to, bitch.

500
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,679
That's it.
Come on, big man

501
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,166
- Try me  !
- What's wrong with you  ?

502
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:48,932
Let go  ! Come on  !

503
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:52,746
This is Jimmy's.

504
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:55,284
He's sort of the star of our class.

505
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,879
Why  ?

506
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,647
Well... Well

507
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,223
His use of gigantism.

508
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:04,708
Sculpting his little cultural tokens

509
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,937
But on such heroic scale.

510
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:10,014
It sort of forces us to look
differently at the things that...

511
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:13,496
Surround us. Sounds
pretty stupid, doesn't it  ?

512
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:18,032
- I like this one.
- Really  ?

513
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,531
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is Anita's.

514
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:23,801
It's funny. We always thought
her work was kind of surfacy.

515
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:27,301
I like it.

516
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:37,309
Russell, hey.

517
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:39,659
Claire, shit, hi.

518
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,976
Russell, this is Ted.

519
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

520
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:55,640
You her secret service agent  ?

521
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:58,197
Yes, actually I am.

522
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:03,747
Claire and I went out
for a very long time.

523
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:05,761
- Ah.
- Yep.

524
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,730
It ended horribly.

525
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,056
- How have you been  ?
- I've been, I've been good.

526
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:15,639
Really really good.

527
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:19,930
My work has gone to
some amazing places

528
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,683
Since I got hit by a car.

529
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:25,088
Oh my god. You were hit by a car  ?

530
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:27,119
What happened  ?

531
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,626
To be honest, I prefer to...

532
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,011
Process those emotions

533
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,319
Through my art.

534
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:36,734
Oh. But you're okay  ?

535
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:40,224
I hope to be. One day
Okay, yes.

536
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:44,659
- Good.
- And you  ?

537
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,760
Oh, I'm good. You know  ?

538
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,279
Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,413
So...

540
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,356
Hey, I'm gonna go find Jimmy,
because I think he's looking for me.

541
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,797
- Okay.
- And...

542
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,030
I think I saw some evil
ninjas down that hallway.

543
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,837
- I'll check it out.
- Okay.

544
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:12,396
So, you dated him  ?

545
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:16,335
He was sort of my
boyfriend for a while, yeah.

546
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,839
And then he went gay.

547
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:20,876
And then he ended up with Anita

548
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:23,568
And I switched to Jimmy, I think.

549
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,450
It gets kind of confusing.

550
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:28,436
- You probably think I'm a freak.
- I once dated a girl

551
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:31,085
who had a pet donkey,
So far be it for me

552
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,408
Let's get some wine or something.

553
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,860
Well well well. If it isn't
the queen of disappearance.

554
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,594
- Hey.
- Hey  !

555
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,885
These are my friends Jimmy
and Anita. This is Ted.

556
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:46,042
Nice to meet you. Hi.

557
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,835
Are you rich  ? Please buy my stuff.

558
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,830
Actually, Ted was just
admiring your photograph.

559
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:54,489
Oh really  ? I got a whole
box of them in the car.

560
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,030
Really. Please, buy them.

561
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:59,730
I need clothes and drugs and shampoo.

562
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:03,071
So did you see the big review
of our show in "LA weekly."

563
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:05,371
Oh, no, I guess I missed it.

564
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:08,735
They said the way Jimmy's
sculptures clashed with reality

565
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,681
Caused a frisson.

566
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:14,235
Oh  ! Russell was just looking for you.

567
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,277
Oh jesus  ! I gotta hide.

568
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:19,541
If he comes anywhere near me, please
tackle him and beat him unconscious.

569
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,487
Bye.

570
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:24,345
What's with him and Russell  ?

571
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:27,620
It's so great. Jimmy got
drunk and let russell blow him.

572
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,984
- Now russell's majorly in love.
- Oh god.

573
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,772
Yeah, it's my new favorite story.

574
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:46,780
I can't believe what idiots
you have to work with.

575
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:48,706
Tell me about it.

576
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,767
They don't listen to me.
They don't respect me.

577
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:53,170
You sure you're not talking
about someone else, baby  ?

578
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,266
Vanessa treats you like a dog.

579
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,654
She's never going to forgive you.

580
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,402
Yeah, well, I fucked up.

581
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:02,805
That's what men do.
They can't help it.

582
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,964
I'd forgive you.

583
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:11,628
I'd even forgive you a second time.

584
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,806
You need a nice mexican girl.

585
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:17,324
Not one of those puerto rican bitches.

586
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:19,616
They all got razor
blades in their pussies.

587
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:22,366
- Whoa.
- You know it's true.

588
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,268
A girl like me,

589
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,290
I'd let you be the man of the house.

590
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,886
I'd let you do anything
you wanted, Rico.

591
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:32,363
Anything.

592
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,837
Did you find Jimmy yet  ?

593
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,267
I'm such a mess, I guess.

594
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,854
I'm always falling in love
with people who hate me.

595
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,690
Not always.

596
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,987
Thing is, I'm not even
in love with Jimmy.

597
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:09,802
I want to be Jimmy.

598
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:15,434
And the paradoxical thing is

599
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,401
Underneath all of that...

600
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:21,541
I hate Jimmy.

601
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,925
He's...

602
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:27,311
He's so self-Absorbed.

603
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:31,883
He builds a seven-Foot sculpture

604
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:34,275
Of his penis.

605
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:36,490
It's a lollipop.

606
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,878
It's subliminal, Claire.

607
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:42,239
Hey, I'm sorry, you know  ?

608
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,878
About the collage stuff

609
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,113
And taking all the credit.

610
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,694
It was part yours.

611
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:04,264
It's good seeing you, Claire.

612
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,909
You too.

613
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:25,725
Avoid the shrimp rolls.

614
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,017
They seem to be covered
with fecal matter.

615
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,574
- Olivier.
- Claire.

616
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:33,054
One of my most brilliant students.

617
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:36,651
And the smartest. Which, of course
you know, is not the same thing.

618
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,558
God, shut up.

619
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:40,306
She smiles.

620
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:42,535
Do you know how long it's
been since I saw that smile  ?

621
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:44,673
Where's your self-righteousness  ?

622
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,363
I guess I lost it.

623
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,055
So, who's this young
man you're with tonight  ?

624
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:51,882
I'd introduce you to him, but
I don't want you to fuck him.

625
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,168
There's yourself
righteousness, Claire.

626
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:59,879
Speaking of ex-boyfriends of
mine whom you've had sex with,

627
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,767
I heard Billy quit.

628
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:04,297
Yeah, well, apparently you crushed him.

629
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,516
So you got anything hanging on the wall  ?

630
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:11,157
Nada.

631
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:14,104
I still paint, but it's all shit.

632
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,383
And the only person who buys my art
Is my rich patron of a mistress.

633
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:21,729
Do you know the humiliation
involved in that  ?

634
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:22,827
I'm sorry.

635
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,230
We all go through fallow periods

636
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:27,195
When we must let the soil rest

637
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:29,598
To prepare for new growth.

638
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:31,692
Really  ?

639
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:35,135
- You think that's true  ?
- Oh god, please let it be true,

640
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:37,158
Otherwise I'm doomed.

641
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:39,864
I'd have to stop teaching
and start driving a cab.

642
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,342
You don't drive.

643
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,270
Oh, well, then I'm
really fucked, aren't i  ?

644
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,499
What about you  ?

645
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,213
I haven't taken a
photograph in months.

646
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:52,076
Oh, fuck art. I mean
what have you been doing  ?

647
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,387
Working at a shitty job.

648
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,368
Feeling sorry for myself.

649
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,392
Going home every night
pretty much hating my life.

650
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:04,350
It sucks, doesn't it  ?

651
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,437
Ah, he's indestructible.
He's fucking indestructible.

652
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:16,445
Fucking bitch  ! I'll kill you.

653
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:22,370
Ah, theater.

654
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:25,409
Don't touch me  !

655
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,945
This is going to be pretty
inconvenient when I want to butter

656
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,354
- My toast in the morning.
- Use a spoon.

657
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:35,725
Chopsticks  ?

658
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,467
You can kill a man
with a chopstick, David.

659
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,330
Don't you think this
is a little drastic  ?

660
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,999
- He pulled a knife on me.
- You scared him.

661
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,651
Gotta get a stronger
lock for his bedroom door.

662
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,176
That way we know when we put
him in there he stays in there.

663
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,258
- What if there's a fire  ?
- Let him burn.

664
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,068
I was nervous about
seeing everyone tonight.

665
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:01,689
Like they were all moving
forward with their lives

666
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,859
And all doing amazing things

667
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:06,773
While I was going nowhere, but...

668
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,470
God, they're all exactly
where I left them.

669
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,987
And that makes you feel  ?

670
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,087
I am feeling good.

671
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,448
I had a lot of fun tonight.

672
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:19,904
Yeah, me too.

673
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,282
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

674
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:27,382
9:00.

675
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:30,002
Yeah.

676
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,192
I had no idea eating dinner on
a pillow could be so much fun.

677
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:39,297
It makes me want to throw
away every chair in the house.

678
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,959
If you want to take
the full experience,

679
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:42,846
You'll have to let me
take you to morocco.

680
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:45,543
Where would you like
to enjoy our aperitif  ?

681
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:47,652
Your sun porch  ?

682
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:49,790
I was thinking we
could take it upstairs

683
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:52,365
to the bedroom.

684
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:54,790
What  ?

685
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,952
All the way back I was
practicing how to say that.

686
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:59,070
It sounded so silly.

687
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,709
I should have just done this.

688
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,745
He won't even consider
that what I'm saying

689
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:18,635
Might actually be valid. He
just wants me to agree with him

690
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:21,797
And say, "wow, Nate  ! Gee, yeah.

691
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,223
Quakers. I never
thought of it like that."

692
00:41:24,488 --> 00:41:26,781
He hates the fact that I'm questioning

693
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:30,209
Why he's being drawn to something
that he knows we can't possibly share.

694
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,509
Brenda, please shut the fuck up.

695
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,966
I can't do this anymore.

696
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:37,708
All day long I have to listen to my
students complain about their problems,

697
00:41:37,783 --> 00:41:40,441
And when I finally get a break, I have
to listen to you go on about yours.

698
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:42,444
Okay.

699
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,197
Honestly, I should tape
one of your monologues

700
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,163
Because you say the same
fucking thing every time.

701
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,178
If you want to change the
dynamic of your relationship,

702
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:51,939
Then you need to change.

703
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:54,539
If you want him to open up to
you, you need to open up to him.

704
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:58,061
There, I've said it. Thank god.

705
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,394
Now can we please talk
about something meaningless

706
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:03,206
Like last night's episode of
"american idol" ? Thank you.

707
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,458
I've never watched "american idol."

708
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:10,401
Well, let me know when you have, okay  ?

709
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:17,209
That was delicious, Hiram. What a treat.

710
00:42:17,528 --> 00:42:20,187
My pleasure. I'll clean up,
then I should probably get going.

711
00:42:21,683 --> 00:42:23,917
Let's go camping.

712
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:26,546
Today  ?

713
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,612
Right now.

714
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,230
Okay.

715
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:36,331
You don't have to make us lunch.

716
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:38,026
Of course I'm gonna
make you lunches.

717
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,645
I don't want you eating
that awful cafeteria food.

718
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,010
I mean, if you're mad at us.

719
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,547
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at Durrell.

720
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:48,701
He only does bad stuff
because he wants to have fun.

721
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,681
Yeah, well, that's
not a very good reason.

722
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:54,012
You know, when you give us back.

723
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:01,379
- What  ?
- Everybody always gives us back.

724
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:05,129
- Who  ?
- Our foster parents.

725
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:07,229
So Durrell wants to have
fun while we're here.

726
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,622
Señor.

727
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:26,914
Muchas gracias, padre.

728
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:28,585
Gracias.

729
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,973
Ah, there you are.

730
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,949
- $400 for 50 doves.
- I'm throwing in an extra 20 doves.

731
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,768
- We appreciate your business.
- Thank you very much.

732
00:43:37,057 --> 00:43:38,772
Thank you.

733
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:51,306
- Gracias.
- Por favor.

734
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:13,478
Hey, can you help
me with something  ?

735
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:15,982
I need a new cartridge for my printer.

736
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,058
Supply closet.

737
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:25,901
I think they're stacked up here.

738
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:54,443
- Hey.
- Hey.

739
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,928
- You're here.
- Yeah, sorry I'm a little early.

740
00:44:57,275 --> 00:44:59,220
It's okay. Come on in.

741
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,761
Had to get out of the
office. Sometimes it's just...

742
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:05,963
Too fucking depressing, you know  ?

743
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:08,108
Rough day  ?

744
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:09,726
Yeah.

745
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,191
- You want something to drink  ?
- Water, thanks.

746
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,870
Okay. Make yourself at home.

747
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,362
So what happened  ?

748
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,256
Nothing.

749
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:25,259
Here.

750
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,262
Sit down.

751
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:34,847
It's...

752
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:37,081
Brenda and I lately, it just
feels like we're fighting

753
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:39,266
Even when we're not.

754
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,516
There's always this
underlying layer of...

755
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:44,904
tension

756
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:47,183
Resentment, whatever.

757
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,486
Well, being married isn't easy.

758
00:45:51,032 --> 00:45:53,093
I know that.

759
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:56,268
Yeah, we just see the world
In such completely different

760
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:58,097
ways, you know  ?

761
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,986
Yeah  ?

762
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:02,895
I say I conveniently ignored
that fact when we got married.

763
00:46:06,993 --> 00:46:08,996
I'm sorry. I come in here,
I start unloading all my shit.

764
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:10,787
It's okay.

765
00:46:10,883 --> 00:46:13,118
It'll be nice tonight just to...

766
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,352
Go to the meeting and be quiet.

767
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:20,021
Yeah, I think of it as my landing strip.

768
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:23,009
You know, no matter
how weird the day gets

769
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:25,321
Or how much goes wrong,

770
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:27,786
I can always go to a friends meeting

771
00:46:29,173 --> 00:46:30,829
And land.

772
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:33,877
- So how are you  ?
- Oh god.

773
00:46:33,973 --> 00:46:35,764
You adjusting to L.A. ?

774
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,816
Well, I...

775
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:41,777
I look out my window every morning
and I wonder how I got here.

776
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:45,148
And then I think,
I was on my way out

777
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:47,633
And my dad begged me to stay.

778
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:50,178
And, that is exactly how
I wound up back here.

779
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:53,645
After my dad died my
mother asked me to

780
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,840
To stick around.

781
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,939
Any regrets  ?

782
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,015
That becoming the one
thing I never wanted to be.

783
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:02,326
Oh yeah.

784
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:06,482
Or not. I don't know.

785
00:47:07,217 --> 00:47:09,972
For a while I was thinking
I was really helping people.

786
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:16,597
Lately the whole business
just seems unnecessary.

787
00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:21,834
I just feel useless.

788
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:24,241
Nate, you are far from useless.

789
00:47:24,354 --> 00:47:26,839
I don't just mean at
work. I mean everywhere.

790
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,749
We may have this
handicapped child, right  ?

791
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,403
And there is not a damned
thing I can do about it.

792
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,899
I can't make the baby healthy.

793
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:38,044
I can't make myself feel any
more ready to deal with it.

794
00:47:38,057 --> 00:47:41,047
I can't even make myself want to
deal with it. I can't do anything.

795
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:46,059
You're allowed to be scared.

796
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,342
Life is scary.

797
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,252
Yeah, it's fucking terrifying.

798
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:21,122
Nate.

799
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,690
No, this is

800
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:06,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

801
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:10,407
Where are the boys  ?

802
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:12,728
They're at your mother's. You can
pick them up tomorrow morning.

803
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:16,560
This used to be our pizza night.

804
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:19,835
There's a lot of
things that used to be.

805
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,133
You couldn't even wait
to have dinner with me  ?

806
00:49:27,149 --> 00:49:29,460
Here. Finish it.

807
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:36,637
Vanessa...

808
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:39,467
I can't do this anymore.

809
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:41,129
Do what  ?

810
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,786
I feel like

811
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:45,301
I feel like I'm just
the guy who mows the lawn

812
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:48,248
And takes out the trash and
occasionally gets to have sex with you

813
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:50,939
While you lay there looking
bored out of your mind.

814
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,846
I don't know what you
expected when you came back.

815
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:55,701
I was expecting you to
try to make this work.

816
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:57,686
You know, if we're gonna be married,

817
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:59,535
Then let's be married.

818
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,673
But if you can't do that and
you don't love me anymore,

819
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:03,695
Then I don't want to
be here. I'll move out.

820
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,786
Rico, I do love you.

821
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:11,924
I really do, but I cannot

822
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,400
I can't get over this.

823
00:50:15,485 --> 00:50:17,334
Ever  ?

824
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:21,683
- You can't ever get over this  ?
- Hopefully...

825
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:25,612
- Eventually.
- But why  ?

826
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,734
Why  ? You know I'll never
do anything like that again.

827
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,400
I know, but

828
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:36,184
Don't ask me to explain.
It's not a mental thing.

829
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,133
It's just this is how I feel.

830
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,997
- So what do we do now  ?
- I don't know.

831
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:10,497
It has too much salt.

832
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:13,015
I know, it's really bad.

833
00:51:16,182 --> 00:51:18,551
You want to go out and
get something to eat  ?

834
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:21,894
Yeah.

835
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:33,003
My knife broke.

836
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:35,122
That's okay, Anthony.

837
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:38,601
We have a whole box of them.

838
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:40,651
I told Roger I'm gonna
want a couple of weeks off

839
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,809
- As soon as school's out.
- Oh  ?

840
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,901
I was thinking we'd go on vacation.

841
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:49,117
You know, go down to Mexico.
Go swimming in the ocean.

842
00:51:49,262 --> 00:51:51,266
But who's gonna take care of us  ?

843
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:55,087
You're coming with us.

844
00:51:57,612 --> 00:51:59,577
I don't want to swim.

845
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:01,869
I want to go to the mountains
and learn to snowboard.

846
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:04,766
We can do that in the winter.

847
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,943
All four of us.

848
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:09,476
We'll go all kinds of places.

849
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,403
Yes, we will  !

850
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:25,189
It smells so good up here.

851
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,733
This is the way the world
is supposed to smell.

852
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,448
- And listen.
- What  ?

853
00:52:29,498 --> 00:52:32,426
Did you hear it  ? There's a
river about a half mile down.

854
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,487
We can go fishing in the morning.

855
00:52:34,506 --> 00:52:36,548
Oh, this is wonderful  !

856
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:39,843
I feel so completely free  !
There's no one waiting for me

857
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:42,696
Or expecting me to do anything  !

858
00:52:42,888 --> 00:52:45,489
- You can do anything you please.
- Exactly.

859
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:52,392
I guess we missed the
church service  ?

860
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:04,975
- Are you crying  ?
- No.

861
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:09,387
No, I'm okay.

862
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:16,470
You should get going.

863
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,260
- Are you sure you're all right  ?
- I'm fine.

864
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:27,390
You should go.

865
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,419
This wasn't planned, you know.

866
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,080
I know.

867
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:01,834
- What  ?
- My arm is numb.

868
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:05,034
Numb arm. Numb arm,
numb, numb

869
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:07,968
Nate  !

870
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,221
What's the matter  ?

871
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:12,881
Oh my god.
