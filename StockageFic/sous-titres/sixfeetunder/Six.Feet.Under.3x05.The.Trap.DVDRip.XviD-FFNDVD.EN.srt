1
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,656
Why didn't you accept
the complimentary map of the trail?

2
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:53,055
I've done this hike a hundred times before.

3
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,012
You're the one who insisted on
making a left at the last marker.

4
00:01:57,059 --> 00:02:01,416
- Because the other way didn't look like a trail.
- That was the trail!

5
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,737
Fine.

6
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,657
Everything in the entire world is my fault.

7
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,294
Not everything.
Just the fact that we're now totally lost

8
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,375
and I'm totally dehydrated.

9
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,332
If you were so sure about the damn trail,
which you weren't,

10
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,370
then why didn't you...

11
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,454
What is that down there?

12
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,010
I told you there was something.

13
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,857
You never believe me,
you get just like your mother.

14
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,050
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do. Just be honest for once.

15
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,730
Oh, my God.

16
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,530
Something's moving.

17
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,733
- Somebody's in there. They're trapped.
- No, they're not.

18
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,251
Must have driven off that dirt road up there.

19
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,216
It's been sitting here for years.

20
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,537
Why would they have an accident
and just leave their car to rot?

21
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,848
Maybe because they're still in it.

22
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,454
OK, I'm fading.
I can't even keep my eyes open.

23
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:36,376
I need to get a cup of coffee.

24
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,968
- You fell asleep on the phone last night.
- I did not!

25
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,614
I was talking for 30 minutes straight

26
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:48,130
and I was thinking,
"It's so good to get these things out,"

27
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,739
and then...

28
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,610
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,892
I haven't slept in three nights. I've been
devouring this Camille Claudel biography.

30
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,614
Remember me saying
my brother's getting married on Saturday?

31
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,456
To the woman with no chin.

32
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,491
That's right. So I didn't totally bore you.

33
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:10,254
I know it's kind of last minute,

34
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,336
but I was thinking
if you weren't doing anything...

35
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,493
I mean, if it wouldn't be
completely painful for you

36
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,211
to come with me...

37
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:26,895
It's not a date. It sounds like a date.
But it's not.

38
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:35,376
OK, it's a date. You can be my date.

39
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,136
Sure. I mean...

40
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,533
Why not? Of course I'll go with you.

41
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,369
OK, it got weird, didn't it?

42
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,410
And I did it.

43
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,734
I hate life.

44
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,294
Claire, I really like our friendship

45
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,330
and I would never...

46
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,771
What's with the chitty-chat?

47
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,893
You can focus on your work or you can gossip
like old blind women.

48
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,248
It's your decision.

49
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:16,292
Finally you draw what you see,
not what you think you see.

50
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,376
I like it.

51
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,568
Claire, you and I should talk.

52
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:37,929
Look, everything I do sucks today, I know.

53
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,970
This isn't about your work.

54
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,570
- Thank you.
- Of course.

55
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:11,289
You're not gonna believe this. Olivier asked me
to be his assistant. I start tomorrow.

56
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,898
I don't believe this.

57
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,932
I feel like I just won something.
I never win anything.

58
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,015
Me neither.

59
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,729
I guess any of these would be fine.

60
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,138
Honey, you actually have to pick one.

61
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:37,218
Chris, how am I supposed to know
what kind of casket Will would want?

62
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,855
He disappeared over 25 years ago and I can
hardly remember how he took his coffee.

63
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,207
I myself like the deluxe Aegean.

64
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,092
It's a little on the high end but it's very calming,

65
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,017
it's like a slow, lulling ride on...

66
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,650
on the Aegean, I guess.

67
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,853
- I need to sit down.
- Take your time.

68
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,215
We know how hard this is for you.

69
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,769
He...

70
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,049
went out for a newspaper one day,

71
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,135
and never came back.

72
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:16,137
So I figured he'd deserted me.

73
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:19,296
Which made sense,
because we were one of those horrible...

74
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,014
got married too soon
for all the wrong reasons couples.

75
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,412
Now I find out

76
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,098
he didn't run away at all,

77
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,130
he died in a freak accident.

78
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,735
What am I supposed to do with all these years
of feeling like he deserted us?

79
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,057
Honey, we don't even need to do a funeral.
It's just an empty ritual.

80
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,648
Actually, the closure it provides is
quite powerful

81
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,849
and quite healing.

82
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,015
The strange part is where they found him,
in that canyon.

83
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:55,291
It was ten miles from where we lived.
What was he doing there?

84
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,376
- Maybe he got lost.
- Right.

85
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,174
Looking for a newspaper on a dirt road
in the middle of nowhere?

86
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,813
Do you think he was seeing someone else?

87
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,616
I have no idea.

88
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,490
He could have been.

89
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,048
Diane, let's make a decision
on the casket and get out of here.

90
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,936
Will was Jewish, so...

91
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,251
The Sampson.

92
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:27,052
It's plain cedar. Got it.

93
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,696
I can finish out the week, if you need.

94
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:58,207
Claire, you got another job, go do it.

95
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,375
It's an amazing opportunity

96
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,492
to learn from Olivier Castro-Staal,
maybe help him with his art,

97
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,214
do something meaningful instead of just...
You know?

98
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:12,616
Fine. I wasn't crazy about you doing pickups
and deliveries anyway.

99
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,457
We have enough actual employees here.

100
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,337
OK. Thanks.

101
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,695
Wait, this is for you.

102
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,450
What's that, a goodbye gift?

103
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:29,015
It's a box of bones I just picked up
from the coroner. William Jaffe.

104
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,811
Here, catch.

105
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:33,490
Just kidding.

106
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:41,533
- I'm not sure this is a good idea.
- It's perfect.

107
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,570
We were saving some by using Claire.

108
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:47,134
We can save a lot with an apprentice.
I've crunched the numbers.

109
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,138
- You can crunch numbers?
- Of course I can. It's free labour.

110
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,455
We give him a place to live,
he gets credit from mortuary school

111
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,888
and we don't have to pay him bupkiss.

112
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,894
As Mr F used to say. Well?

113
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,536
I don't know, I think this house is
already a little crowded.

114
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,729
You mean with your wife and baby?

115
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,897
I'm just saying that... How do we even know
someone will want the job?

116
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:15,534
I've got five seniors from Cypress lined up,
dying to interview.

117
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,651
- I think we should do it.
- All right, fine.

118
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,816
Isn't someone going to ask me
how I feel about this?

119
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,327
After all, since none of you actually live here,

120
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:29,373
I'd be the one who's forced to coexist
with a stranger who could kill me.

121
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,694
She's right. It's not fair to her.

122
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:36,859
Mrs F, we can save up to $10,000 a year,
according to my projections.

123
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,088
I don't want loud rock music in this house.

124
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,255
No rock music. Got it.

125
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,689
So you guys wanna
look at the resumes they faxed over?

126
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:51,730
Are you kidding? I'm dying to.

127
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,974
Mom, you don't have to be a martyr.

128
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,773
It's for you. You need to make more money
now that Lisa's a stay-at-home.

129
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,333
- A what?
- A stay-at-home mother.

130
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,370
They're called that now,

131
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:08,617
like you have some bracelet on your foot
that will ring if you leave your house.

132
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:11,253
- Lisa's going back to work.
- Of course.

133
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:12,937
When Maya goes to kindergarten.

134
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,734
- Why are you holding a mousetrap?
- I found a box of them.

135
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,293
Remember when we had that infestation?

136
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,892
- Those things are cruel.
- Mice have germs. They deserve to die.

137
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,933
Let's just hope that bad rehearsal
means good show tomorrow.

138
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,178
Good night, everybody.

139
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:00,691
David.

140
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,931
What? Was my solo awful?

141
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,095
No, no, it's...

142
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,538
it's good.

143
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,092
It is.

144
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,815
But I think you need to stop
trying to make it so perfect.

145
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,688
Just try to be more relaxed with it.

146
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,657
See you tomorrow night.

147
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,612
We're going out for a drink.
It's only gonna be...

148
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,650
A drink, yes, absolutely.

149
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:37,690
Dennis can kiss my lily-white ass.

150
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,491
It's not like it's the Met.

151
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,973
Hey, he's just trying to...

152
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,089
I mean, your solo is a little...

153
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,213
- What?
- It's prissy.

154
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,499
It's like a little girl's doll house.

155
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,848
It's like a kitty-cat greeting card.

156
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,413
Like a poofy white cutesy-pie.

157
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,654
Thanks, Terry, I get the point. God.

158
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,850
I was just trying to make it sound pretty.

159
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,049
That's the point, dear-don't.

160
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,567
Just sing from someplace real.

161
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,213
God, when did I become 400 years old?

162
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,931
On your last birthday.

163
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,929
Not that you would remember anything.

164
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,016
He was trying to convince this guy
that he used to be in Cirque du Soleil.

165
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,456
Show him the
"coming down from a trapeze" look.

166
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,610
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll get a check so we can get out of here.

167
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:41,572
He is obsessed with trading spaces.
We're lucky we got him this long.

168
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:51,049
Look, I know I'm not supposed to
say anything but I will.

169
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,613
I feel weird not acknowledging it.

170
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,297
- What?
- You know.

171
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,652
It. How we know each other.

172
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,248
- From chorus?
- Fine, just pretend. Whatever.

173
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,089
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- From the bathroom at Sears.

174
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,528
It was about seven, eight years ago?

175
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,570
You jerked me off.

176
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,689
The second stall.
The security guy almost caught us.

177
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,448
You're confusing me with someone else.

178
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:23,898
Come on.

179
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:27,727
You checked me out in automotive supplies,
I followed you into home appliances.

180
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,658
- We met in the second-floor john...
- This wasn't me.

181
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,212
Please.

182
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,130
Fine, be that way.

183
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,249
Is that enough? Do you need more?

184
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,694
I think 40 is too much.

185
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:49,334
So, David, is your boyfriend
coming to the concert?

186
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,176
Yeah, he's supposed to.

187
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,611
I can't wait to meet him.

188
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,216
Goddammit.

189
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,056
Aren't there instructions?

190
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,378
A page of hieroglyphics
showing nothing that came in this box.

191
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,688
What are you doing?

192
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:15,015
I'm circling problem purchases on the Visa bill.

193
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,208
Problem purchases?

194
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,332
Things we've bought that maybe
we didn't need or could buy less of.

195
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,410
You mean things I bought.

196
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,853
Are the smiley faces good purchases?

197
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,855
No, I was just doodling.

198
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:41,051
I don't see why these are problem purchases.
This is lunch with David. I had to eat.

199
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:44,057
You didn't have to spend $55.
What did you have?

200
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,576
A couple of sandwiches.

201
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,371
This country's insane.

202
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,254
You dropped $80 at Book Soup.
I guess you haven't heard of libraries.

203
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,169
- Libraries are depressing.
- Nate...

204
00:15:56,219 --> 00:16:00,212
you're not single any more,
you can't keep spending like you are.

205
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,370
I'll try to cut down.

206
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,778
Until you get back to work.

207
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,091
Actually, I'm holding off looking for another job.

208
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,935
Really? For how long?

209
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,531
I don't know. We'll see.

210
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,208
Because my mom seems to think
it's until Maya starts kindergarten.

211
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,251
This is not a decision you can make
without me.

212
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,930
That was a late rehearsal.

213
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,776
Yeah, we just...

214
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,094
The concert's tomorrow night, so...

215
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,130
What time should I be there?

216
00:16:58,339 --> 00:16:59,613
7:30?

217
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,819
I don't get off until nine at the earliest.

218
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,497
You can't make it?

219
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,327
David, I did everything I could
to change my schedule.

220
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:11,177
I understand. You can come to the next one.

221
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:13,494
Boy, just twist the knife in deeper.

222
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,930
- I oughta talk to Frank about this.
- You really don't have to come.

223
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:20,447
It's not a big deal, I'm not angry.

224
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,091
Really?

225
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,296
Thank you

226
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,614
for being so aware that this isn't about you.

227
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,927
We really are making progress.

228
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,857
This is really fucked up.
Missing your concert for this lame-ass job.

229
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,331
- I should just call in sick.
- No, don't.

230
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,018
How did my life become so meaningless?

231
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,850
I used to make a difference.

232
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:55,653
I used to protect people's lives.
Now I just protect their stuff.

233
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,533
I give you some meaning, don't I?
You give me meaning.

234
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,376
Of course.

235
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,177
But we can't be everything for each other,
that's just not possible.

236
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,608
I'll be done in a few minutes, Arthur,
you're a little early.

237
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,572
I was a lot early,
so I walked around the block for a while.

238
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,014
An elderly woman who was almost
completely bald told me to get off her lawn.

239
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:48,015
- May I ask you a personal question?
- You can ask.

240
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:51,573
Why did you choose me
over the other applicants?

241
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:54,577
I'm looking to improve my interview skills.

242
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,970
Fair enough.

243
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,374
It was between you and Judy Lindeman.

244
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,774
We just thought you would fit here better.

245
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,419
- Based on?
- Well...

246
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:12,928
There was something in the way
you talked about your grandmother.

247
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,212
My great-aunt Pearl.

248
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,215
She was a very special woman.

249
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,128
I barely knew my parents.
They burned to death in a fire when I was five.

250
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,455
- I'm sorry.
- Aunt Pearl gave up everything for me.

251
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,093
- She home-schooled me.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,290
You seem a little home-schooled.

253
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,650
Ah, shit.

254
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,167
These collagen lips are such a bitch.

255
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,653
I'm guessing Aunt Pearl didn't like cussing.

256
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,651
Not one bit. She would've tarred me
for that language.

257
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:53,098
Rico, have you...?

258
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:56,848
Mrs F, this is Arthur Martin,
our new apprentice.

259
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,490
Excuse me. Have you seen Nate?
Lisa's looking for him.

260
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,339
That'll be 62.90.

261
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,370
There you go.

262
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,698
I have to talk to my manager.

263
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,094
I need credit approval.

264
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:28,935
This CD is so great for taking diet pills
and cleaning your bathroom.

265
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,498
What are you doing?

266
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,293
Do you even listen to me when I talk
or do you just hear static?

267
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,376
- I'm...
- How do you expect Maya to go to college?

268
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,695
You're throwing everything we have away
for fucking Beck?

269
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,734
Just sign here, please.

270
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,054
You know what? I don't want these,
I changed my mind.

271
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,738
Can we just cancel this purchase?

272
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,892
Come on, Claire,
the early worm catches things.

273
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,087
- Where's your studio?
- My house. Why's that your business?

274
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,609
- Isn't that where we're going?
- We're going to the Century City mall.

275
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:49,048
- The mall?
- Best mall in the world.

276
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,488
I used to like Livingston Mall

277
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,214
but Bamberger's went out of business
and it all went to hell.

278
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,295
You need an assistant to shop?

279
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,890
I need an assistant to drive me.

280
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,134
My licence was taken away by fascists.

281
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,172
I don't know why I'm always persecuted
but it's always been so.

282
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:11,291
- So I'm your driver?
- Yes.

283
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,331
Can we go now?
Brentano's are having a sale.

284
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:18,770
And if I ever catch you with
my toothbrush again, you're dead meat.

285
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,891
This is my brother, Nate.
Nate, this is Tom Jaffe.

286
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:36,329
- William Jaffe's son.
- I didn't realise he had a...

287
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,132
Look, I'm so sorry for your loss.

288
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,568
I was only a few months old when he...

289
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:45,013
When it happened.

290
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,334
I never even knew him.

291
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,054
Tom was dropping off
some of his father's belongings.

292
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:54,216
Seems strange
considering that there's no real body.

293
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:59,777
In situations like your father's, it helps
the family to put his belongings to rest also.

294
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,696
I hope this'll do.

295
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,448
Was your father a little person?

296
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,809
No, this was the only suit of his
that my mother could find.

297
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,578
It was in some box his family had.

298
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,610
It's from his Bar Mitzvah.

299
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:23,811
And there's this. It was in the same box.
It either belonged to him or my uncle.

300
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,892
My mother thinks she remembers
my father liking Blue Bayou.

301
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:39,932
I'm gonna get fired if I'm not back by two,
so if that's all...

302
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,136
Yes. We'll see you tomorrow at the funeral.

303
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:54,570
What's wrong with you?

304
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,575
I don't know.

305
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:00,611
Can you imagine being so calm
about your father's death?

306
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,413
He probably thinks of his stepfather
as his real father. As he should.

307
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:07,895
He doesn't know anything about his dad,
not a thing,

308
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,169
whether he even liked Linda Ronstadt.

309
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:13,336
Do you know if our dad liked Linda Ronstadt?

310
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,370
As a matter of fact I do.

311
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,413
In his record collection there was
a copy of a Heart Like A Wheel.

312
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:27,409
Here are the teacups.
And these are dinner plates.

313
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,814
Those up there are for casseroles.

314
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,770
And these are the cereal bowls.

315
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,538
Please feel free to use any of the dishes.

316
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,815
Is there one I shouldn't use?

317
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,896
Silly. That one was David's special yellow bowl.

318
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,852
He got upset when anyone else used it.
I'm sure he won't mind any more.

319
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,089
Let's not take the chance.
We'll keep it out of rotation.

320
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,978
Thank you.

321
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,776
Now, you see the chart I made?

322
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,898
Each meal time is divided into two shifts,

323
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:58,895
one for each of us.

324
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:02,090
So we never have to suffer the awkwardness of
eating at the same time.

325
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,573
Thank you. That's very thoughtful.

326
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,417
We just sign up each day for the one we want.

327
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:10,929
So my dinner can be from six to seven

328
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,492
or from seven to eight.

329
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,292
Exactly. Which do you want tonight?

330
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,727
I'll take seven.

331
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,256
Actually, I'll take six.

332
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,654
Oh, good. I had a late lunch.

333
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,167
Just use that pen there to initial it.

334
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:31,336
Of course, other people also use the kitchen.

335
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:36,496
If you want to make a schedule with them,
feel free to use my system.

336
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,689
Laundry facilities are in here.

337
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:44,251
Sunday nights are off limits.
I'm sorry but that's when I do my linen.

338
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,253
Yes, ma'am. I understand completely.

339
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:52,374
I should make a note about
not aiming the shower at that tile.

340
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,855
No need. It's all in the little booklet
that's hanging by the sink.

341
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,094
What a lovely room.

342
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,891
Such warm light.

343
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:01,930
It does the trick.

344
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,731
"Second drawer sticks

345
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,339
"unless you lift as you pull."

346
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,057
Thank you. That's very kind.

347
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:21,848
All right. That's the end of the tour.

348
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,367
- You're on your own now.
- Thank you.

349
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:03,411
Nate.

350
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,936
Oh, my God.

351
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,048
- What are you doing here?
- I shoulda called first.

352
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,090
I was afraid you'd...

353
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,856
I need to talk to you.

354
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:25,170
It won't take long.

355
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,738
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

356
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,452
I don't know. I've got a lot of errands today.

357
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:39,010
Can I come with you?

358
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,407
Please.

359
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:52,014
It seems like I just got this smog-checked
last month.

360
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:02,657
I called you when I first got back into town.

361
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,815
Couple of months ago.

362
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,850
I hung up when you answered.

363
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:11,973
I just wanted to make sure that you were alive.

364
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,577
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:18,410
After everything we went through,

366
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:21,656
to not even know if you're alive, that's...

367
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,098
sad.

368
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:30,337
But apparently your surgery
was a success, right?

369
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,778
Yeah.

370
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:37,174
Well, the AVM ruptured in the middle of it
and all hell broke loose

371
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,779
but they fixed it.

372
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,696
Thank God.

373
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,771
Use your fucking signal, woman!

374
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,616
You can go up my ass.

375
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,297
Claire.

376
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,216
I once had an affair
with an older, married woman.

377
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,250
Her name was Astra.

378
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:06,608
That means star. Did you know that?

379
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,376
Have you ever committed infidelity?

380
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,895
No, not yet. But someday, hopefully.

381
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:20,731
Infidelity is not funny, Claire. It's tragic.
All betrayal is tragic.

382
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,728
I was 21 when we first met.
The radio was playing.

383
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,168
I Wear My Sunglasses At Night.

384
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,090
Such an insipid song.

385
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,538
But now it always makes my heart feel...

386
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,212
squished.

387
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:47,254
She's beautiful.

388
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:52,175
She's the best fucking thing
that ever happened to me.

389
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,010
So what's gone on with you?

390
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:04,454
Went to Santa Fe for a while.
I was in Austin, Texas.

391
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:07,775
Couple of weeks in Tahoe, but I really hated it.

392
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,935
What were you doing there?

393
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:13,335
Just trying to find a place
to make me feel better.

394
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:20,973
- Are you still living in Venice?
- I'm staying at my mom's.

395
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,570
How's that?

396
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:28,731
It's the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

397
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,654
Bad news, your car didn't pass.

398
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:36,453
- I can fix it but I'll need about half an hour.
- All right.

399
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,927
Totally fucks up my whole afternoon.

400
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,933
You know, I saw a place up the street.
We could get a drink.

401
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:48,410
So what's your life like?

402
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:50,450
You're married, a father...

403
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:53,176
It's great.

404
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,532
It's really great.

405
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,570
I'm glad.

406
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,496
You so deserve to be happy

407
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,178
after everything you've been through.

408
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,730
I mean, it's hard sometimes.

409
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,178
You know. Relationships aren't easy.

410
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:10,894
Really?

411
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:17,658
You just have to work at it every day.

412
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,694
Can't expect everything
to be perfect all the time.

413
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,011
Can't get shaken when it isn't.

414
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,656
And if there's a moment
where I feel like I'm in prison

415
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:33,772
I just have to think about all those moments
when it feels safe

416
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:38,214
and remind myself that those moments
outweigh the prison moments.

417
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:42,093
Being alone is the prison,
just thinking about yourself,

418
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:46,018
just being trapped in this vortex
of always watching yourself.

419
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:50,610
Which, I suppose, is OK if you're interesting.

420
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,127
Truth is, nobody's that interesting.

421
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,133
Listen to me.

422
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,374
Let's just talk about movies or something.

423
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,296
I haven't seen a movie in a year.

424
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,856
Anything else?

425
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,770
Just the check.

426
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,056
Ah, fuck.

427
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:19,371
So, Bren, what's this catching-up session
all about?

428
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:22,250
I'm not sure.

429
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,690
Actually, I am sure.

430
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,732
This is so difficult.

431
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,136
I apologise...

432
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:43,129
for having sex with other people
while being in a relationship with you.

433
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:45,409
For not showing up to our shared reality

434
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,178
by altering my consciousness
with various substances.

435
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:49,857
But you already apologised.

436
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,377
You're making amends.

437
00:32:56,699 --> 00:33:00,817
- I hate that word.
- Still doing the whole 12-step thing?

438
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:03,214
I'm doing a lot of different things.

439
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,130
My life is...

440
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,810
complicated right now.

441
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,454
Yeah, well, whose isn't?

442
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:17,136
No, let me.

443
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,571
Thanks.

444
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,968
I don't even know if she's alive now.

445
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,330
All I know is that, before I met Astra,

446
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,291
I was consumed by this passion to create.

447
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,970
A passion I seem to have lost.

448
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,768
I was never really in love with her.

449
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,896
Of course you were.

450
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:51,932
You ripped a jasmine bush out of the ground
and put it in her car.

451
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,529
I had just had my first real success
and all eyes were on me.

452
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,776
What was I going to do next? I was a coward.

453
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,251
I focused on another person.

454
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,450
I could have been great.

455
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,730
And so can you.

456
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,137
If you get lonely, have sex.

457
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,173
But if you meet somebody who you think
means something to you, you're doomed.

458
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,376
Car 438, do you receive me?

459
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:56,898
Yeah, go ahead.

460
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:59,294
Alarm going off at 5636 Fremont Place.

461
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,090
Got it. I'm on my way.

462
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,609
You're a little late.

463
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,617
Insider job. Must've known
the owners were away.

464
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:51,811
Got the jewellery upstairs and the cash box
in the library. Real clean.

465
00:35:57,419 --> 00:36:00,536
You boys gonna be OK closing up
by yourselves?

466
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,978
I think we can handle it.

467
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,728
Fucking cops.

468
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,770
Think they're such hot shit.

469
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:15,012
- Dion Corelli.
- Keith Charles.

470
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:18,618
You were hoping for some action, right?

471
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,098
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I know that feeling.

472
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,490
How about I buy you a drink?

473
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,537
- Is that comfortable?
- I don't know when I got so clumsy.

474
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,410
I never used to be this way.

475
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:48,498
- I think it's too tight.
- No, it's fine.

476
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:54,576
It was so strange. I put my finger right
on that nail when I heard you coming up.

477
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:59,731
- I'd seen it sticking out of the wall...
- Why didn't you tell me about it?

478
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:03,179
It was almost like somebody pushed me.

479
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,652
Like some kind of invisible person
wanting to hurt me.

480
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,572
And earlier in the day,
I twisted my ankle coming down the stairs.

481
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,248
I was looking for you. Or something.
It was around four.

482
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:20,689
- Couldn't find you anywhere.
- I went out for a drink.

483
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:24,898
With Brenda.

484
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,810
Why?

485
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:32,851
She showed up. I was running errands,
she came along.

486
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:34,890
Getting a drink is an errand?

487
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,530
What did she want?

488
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:47,891
To apologise for being such a crazy bitch
when we were together.

489
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,054
Actually, it was pretty decent of her.

490
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,337
What? Lisa, it was just one beer.

491
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:03,489
I really don't appreciate finding out about it
after the fact.

492
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,135
It's no big deal but next time,
please tell me first before you go do it.

493
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,135
I'm supposed to ask permission?

494
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:12,977
No, but you could've said,
"I want you to meet my wife,"

495
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,614
then said you were gonna catch up
with an old girlfriend.

496
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,736
You're right.

497
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:26,816
I'm sorry.

498
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:35,091
Relax, guy, the owners are in Antigua,
they're not gonna mind.

499
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,972
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Come on.

500
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:40,010
We deserve it.

501
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,619
It's not like we're gonna get caught.

502
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,332
We're the only ones who would catch us.

503
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,810
This is some place.

504
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:00,367
- I bet the people don't even appreciate it.
- Probably not.

505
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:03,534
No one appreciates what they have.

506
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,854
Especially the ones who have more of it.

507
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:08,613
Fucking rich people.

508
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,338
What can you do?

509
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:14,930
Don't you ever just wanna...

510
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:22,690
That felt so good.

511
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:40,695
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let's fuck this place up.

512
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,889
Those idiot cops didn't check in here.

513
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:47,532
We'll go to town and say the robbers did it.
Let's break some shit.

514
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,570
Teach those rich fuckers a lesson.

515
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,931
- You're crazy.
- Come on, guy. You know you want to.

516
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,377
Cut it out.

517
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,251
Cut it out!

518
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:13,298
Jesus.

519
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:30,096
You did a great job tonight, David.

520
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,089
- You were amazing.
- Dennis.

521
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:35,369
Can I borrow you for five seconds?

522
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:39,412
This is the part where Patrick makes me
go over every syllable he sang,

523
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:42,815
describing why each was
so unique and wonderful.

524
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,651
- Hey, Terry.
- Where's your boyfriend?

525
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,618
He had to work.

526
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:11,576
It was me in the Sears bathroom.

527
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,939
Honey, I know it was you.

528
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:17,015
I never forget a face.

529
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:21,894
God, it feels so good to say it.
I don't know why I wouldn't admit it yesterday.

530
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,295
- It just seemed so...
- Sleazy, repressed, not that pretty?

531
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:27,330
Something like that.

532
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,979
That time for me was so difficult.

533
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:35,453
I mean... really difficult.

534
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,774
I tried to compartmentalise that part of my life
but you can't.

535
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,368
Sweetie, you don't need to explain it to me.

536
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:49,099
I don't know why things
have to be so hard.

537
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,373
I think it's because we make them that way.

538
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,533
So...

539
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,047
you ever jerk off anyone else in the chorus?

540
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,090
Of course not.

541
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:03,376
- You?
- A couple.

542
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:08,333
So if let you up, no more crazy stuff?

543
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:10,858
No, sir.

544
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,570
Holy shit, man.

545
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:27,889
You didn't have to play so hard.

546
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,127
I was just blowing off a little steam.

547
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,928
Get your things and get out of here.

548
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,810
You ever a cop?

549
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,128
Whatever you are,

550
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,329
you got a lot of shit to deal with.

551
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:28,969
I could always talk to Will
because he was my best buddy.

552
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:32,091
So my wife said, "Pretend that he's here.

553
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:37,138
"What would you tell him?"
So I thought I'd give it a try.

554
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:42,336
So I say, goddamn you, Will, I'm mad at you.

555
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,497
You're not getting bald and flabby
like the rest of us old, married folk.

556
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,807
Yeah, you had the right idea -
cut out while you were in your prime.

557
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:58,770
Hangover.

558
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,209
- What trouble did you boys get into?
- None. Keith had to work,

559
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:03,897
I had a concert.

560
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:06,328
You did? Why didn't you tell anyone?

561
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,812
Next time.

562
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,419
I'm gonna go lie down for a few minutes.

563
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,527
You're glad that you're not like us,
tied to the old ball and chain,

564
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,172
unable to do whatever we want when we want
like you always did.

565
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:37,130
THE PANIC ROOM

566
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:01,530
Why do you look so sad?

567
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:06,494
I won't be gone forever. I'll be back
from Montana in a month or so.

568
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,929
As soon as I can get Marcie out of jail
and into counselling,

569
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:13,051
which I'm sure she'll resist. Always does.

570
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:15,454
Does your daughter have
these episodes often?

571
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:18,332
Pretty often. She's a real nut job.

572
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:22,535
But what can I do? I'm her mom.
She really needs me.

573
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:27,936
Oh, God, kids are such a drain.
Really suck you dry if you let 'em.

574
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,576
My kids don't need me. Not at all.

575
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:35,168
Thank your fucking lucky stars.
Where's that coffee you promised me?

576
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,932
- Can you wait seven minutes?
- Not really.

577
00:46:49,979 --> 00:46:52,447
Bettina, this isn't right. Get up.

578
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,047
- I love spying.
- I don't.

579
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:02,294
Sure you do. Everyone does.

580
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,136
We're all voyeurs at heart.

581
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:08,331
We're all dying to see everybody else's
fucked-up, weird, private shit.

582
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:23,368
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I've had so much fun with you.

583
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:28,452
I'd never crouch here and spy on Arthur
with anyone else.

584
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:31,616
Doll, you gotta learn
how to make your own fun.

585
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,419
He's not exactly what I would call eye candy.

586
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:44,170
"Swallowed my tongue."

587
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,972
And I know that everything that happens
happens for a reason.

588
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:59,535
I only wish that Will could have
known his son, Tom.

589
00:48:00,939 --> 00:48:03,089
There's so much he could've taught him.

590
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:05,130
That's a load of bullshit.

591
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:08,696
You met my kid, he turned out fine.

592
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:11,776
He didn't need a fuck-up like me
to stick around.

593
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,175
Me driving off the road was the best thing
for everybody.

594
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:21,089
Seriously, Diane and I had a shit relationship
which totally would've screwed up that kid.

595
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,653
Just like you and Lisa
are gonna screw up Maya.

596
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,769
- Fuck you.
- You just wanna stay in this

597
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,573
to prove what a good guy you can be,
not because you love Lisa.

598
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:33,373
This isn't just about me.
There are other lives at stake.

599
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:38,338
Don't give me that shit.
You are so fucking trapped.

600
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:39,778
Yeah?

601
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:42,570
Well, who isn't?

602
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,975
The only way not be trapped
is to not have anything.

603
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:50,251
You look me in the eye and tell me that
sometimes you don't wanna get in your car

604
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:53,655
and just start driving and never look back.

605
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,048
Come on.

606
00:48:58,339 --> 00:48:59,897
I dare you.

607
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:06,649
But, of course, he managed to pull off
one big trick -

608
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:09,338
he made himself disappear for 25 years.

609
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,929
Hi. Didn't you hear me?

610
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,172
No. Sorry, I was totally in my head.

611
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:25,775
Did you get my message from last night?

612
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,414
- No, I got in really late.
- It's about my brother's wedding.

613
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:33,892
Get this, there's a rehearsal dinner.

614
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:35,531
Russell,

615
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:40,657
maybe it's not such a good idea
for us to, you know, date.

616
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,608
It's so weird that you say that.

617
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:50,050
It's so weird that you say that
because I was thinking the same thing

618
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:54,775
and I didn't wanna say it
cos I thought I'd sound crazy,

619
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:57,811
being the one who started this whole thing.

620
00:49:58,939 --> 00:50:02,648
So you're OK just staying the way we are?

621
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,088
Totally. Totally.

622
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:10,490
- Yes.
- Great.

623
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:14,248
I have to give this stuff to Olivier.

624
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:54,649
I'm sorry. Did I read the chart wrong?
I thought you initialled the late lunch.

625
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:57,532
I did, I just got hungry. Is that OK?

626
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:01,015
Of course. I'm glad to have the company.

627
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:06,574
Would you like a little frittata?

628
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:08,689
I'd love a little frittata.

629
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:22,891
I was just fooling around.

630
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:25,499
I never dreamed it would actually work.

631
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:27,769
They work. They definitely work.

632
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:30,490
It's so terrible.

633
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:34,457
- And it wasn't even my cheese.
- That's OK.

634
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:39,812
On the other hand, they have germs.

635
00:51:40,779 --> 00:51:42,770
They really do deserve to die.

636
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,656
Are you just waking up?

637
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:53,088
I was up. Then I went back to sleep again.

638
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,009
- Why are you home for lunch?
- I wanted to see you.

639
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:03,849
I thought you'd be home last night.
I waited up but I must've fallen asleep.

640
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:06,288
- What time did you get in?
- Late.

641
00:52:07,259 --> 00:52:09,727
I thought your shift ended at eleven.

642
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,297
It did.

643
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:19,939
- I drove around. Needed to think.
- About what?

644
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,612
This job was supposed to be temporary

645
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:27,731
but it's really starting not to feel that way.

646
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:32,216
Last night I realised I needed to make a move
and do something different.

647
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:34,136
What made you realise that?

648
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,730
It's just time.

649
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:43,655
How was your concert?

650
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:45,337
It was...

651
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,931
It was great. I wish you could've been there.

652
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:52,373
But I totally understand that you couldn't be.
