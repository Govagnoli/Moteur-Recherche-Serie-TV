1
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,550
I did.

2
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,158
No.

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,751
I swear, I was like majorly, intensely...

4
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,438
worked up like never before.

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,471
Trust me, that's so not it.

6
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,438
Quit looking at me like I'm the new zoo baby.
I did come.

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,472
Honey, there's no way.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,233
I was there, remember?

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,592
There was no funny face, no funny noises.

10
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,792
You didn't melt
into a smoking little puddle of Claire...

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,398
yet.

12
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,910
- This sucks. What is wrong with me?
- Nothing.

13
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,951
We're just getting started.

14
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,510
- You wait and see, I'll make you scream.
- I hope so.

15
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,554
George, come to church with me.

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,195
Agnostics don't go to church, Ruth.
That's part of the appeal.

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,676
It would make me so happy
to be there with you.

18
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,998
Sweetheart, this is my day to catch up.
I've got a million things to do.

19
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,033
- It's only an hour.
- Then you won't miss me for long.

20
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,031
- Morning, all.
- Hey.

21
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,915
- Can I get you anything? How are you?
- Orange juice. I'm great.

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,151
Well, my stomach is burning a little.
Maybe too much coffee.

23
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,034
For goodness' sake, you need water.
Juice would produce more acid.

24
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,959
No bodies in the prep room. You think
death spared Los Angeles last night?

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,514
- Doubtful.
- What are you doing here?

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,439
I don't know.
I should be here in case we get a walk-in.

27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,517
What's going on with you today?

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,030
I have to work and your mother's got the spirit.

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,790
- Would you like to come to church with me?
- Yes, I'd like that very much.

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,832
I'll be ready in a minute. Here, drink your water.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,275
Last chance.

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,311
Pray for me.

33
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,670
- Hello.
- Rico.

34
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,514
You were such a lover last night. So good.

35
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,511
No, it was...

36
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,391
It was you.

37
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,437
Wait, what are you doing here?

38
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,234
It's late. You gotta go home.

39
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,557
Man, it's almost 11.

40
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,832
- Just tell your wife you fell asleep in the car.
- She threw me out.

41
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,599
- Shut up. For real?
- Yeah, for real.

42
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,073
I don't know who else she thinks is out there.
Give up a man like you?

43
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,598
She's fucked up.

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,237
I don't want to talk about her.

45
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,834
Hey, I could stay here for a while, right?

46
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,829
Sorry, baby, it's just that this apartment is
so small and my cousins visit all the time.

47
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,075
They have to sleep over.

48
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,351
No problem.

49
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,191
Love your enemy. Turn the other cheek.

50
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,550
What could be more simple or more difficult?

51
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,869
But these are the teachings at the living heart
of Christ's message to the world.

52
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,234
When Peter asked Jesus, "Lord, how oft
shall I forgive my brother? Seven times?"

53
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,509
Seems like a lot, doesn't it? Seven times.

54
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,749
But Jesus said to Peter, "Not seven times,
but seventy times seven."

55
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,872
Whoa. Do the math.

56
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,430
You stupid hypocrite!

57
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,238
No!

58
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,394
How does it feel?

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,676
So it is our daily mission
to find the Christ in ourselves

60
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,915
and forgive our enemies.

61
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,632
Heartburn.

62
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
It is forgiveness that eases our suffering.

63
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,111
Nice ride.

64
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,755
God damn it.

65
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,752
- What?
- Let's go away for a little while.

66
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,632
- Where do you want to go?
- North?

67
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,277
- We could leave tomorrow and...
- Can't. I'm scoring the new Jet Li movie.

68
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,039
Next couple days
so you're hardly gonna see me.

69
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,469
Oh, well.

70
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,351
Sorry.

71
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,428
Afterwards, maybe.

72
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,836
Cambria, Carmel, Monterey.

73
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,038
That'd work.

74
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,232
If you have no interest in the past
and don't read history,

75
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,669
how can you comprehend the present?

76
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,792
George, history is not what really happened.

77
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,549
History is some warmongering,
patriarchal idea of what happened.

78
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,036
- Who gives a shit about that?
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

79
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,232
- Anita thinks the study of fossils is futile.
- In my humble opinion.

80
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,636
- Dave, we're getting a body.
- Who? How? What?

81
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,708
- You've forgotten part of your outfit, Anita.
- I was gonna wear a T-shirt, but fuck it.

82
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,355
He was sitting in the driveway
in this mint '60s Lincoln

83
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,710
with a pre-need form from Dad
sitting right on top of the dash.

84
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,036
- Where is he now?
- At the coroner's, but he'll be back soon.

85
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,913
I thought your day
was filled with important activities.

86
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,748
- Always time for healthy debate.
- I'm right, you're wrong, game over.

87
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,909
- Rico's gonna work on him so you don't...
- I want to. I need to do something.

88
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,396
Hey, Mom, can you look after Maya
for a little while?

89
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,792
- OK.
- There you go. Thanks, Mom.

90
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,153
But everything we are is built on what
went before. Our foundation is the earth.

91
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,272
California's made of dust.
It's falling into the ocean.

92
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,311
You call that a foundation?

93
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,349
Look who's here. Gertrude and Alice.

94
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,518
Well, look at her. Were we supposed
to dress '80s and nobody called?

95
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,755
Take a break, ladies.

96
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,837
The coach house would be a better place
for you all to gather.

97
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,874
- Don't worry, we're leaving. Come on, Anita.
- Keep up, Edie. The '80s are back.

98
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,517
Pretty funny.

99
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,197
Hilarious.

100
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,231
This is a $1,000 suit.

101
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,637
You think you've seen it all.

102
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,468
Somebody could have set him up in the car
and run away.

103
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,514
Or maybe he died in a compromising position
like...you know...

104
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,757
- He's 80.
- It happens.

105
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,997
I'm telling you, this guy drove himself
to his own funeral.

106
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,429
- Hi, it's me.
- Hey, you, what's up?

107
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,756
Nothing. Missed you.
We haven't talked since yesterday.

108
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,509
- What do you mean? We talked this morning.
- We did?

109
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,677
<i>Yeah, I called you before I left the hotel</i>.

110
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,030
Oh, yeah, right, I spaced. I'm sorry.

111
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,278
- You don't sound like yourself.
- No, I'm fine, it's just...

112
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,314
Bodies are coming in left and right today.
Nate, Rico, I'll be there in a second.

113
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,512
Tell me the truth. That's the only way
these long-distance things work.

114
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,632
I gotta go. I'll call you later or you call me.

115
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,875
I'm fine. Be careful. Bye.

116
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,998
He's not fine.

117
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,872
You think?

118
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,037
Russell's supposed to be here.
Is he bailing on this?

119
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,833
He's asleep.
I fucked him into unconsciousness.

120
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,519
It costs a lot of money to rent chainsaws.

121
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,235
If we accidentally chop somebody up,
they'll totally sue our ass.

122
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,068
- I'm not saying to do that exact thing.
- We're trying to brainstorm a dark...

123
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,237
Confrontational concept. Where's yours?

124
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,159
- Attacking with chainsaws is a total clichê.
- Machetes!

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,193
We stand at the entrance with masks
and machetes. An image of menace.

126
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,915
- Machetes have no resonance...
- For our culture.

127
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,396
What are you, conjoined twins? Jesus.

128
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,675
You sent the kids to the park with Cassidy?
Vanessa, I have a right to see them.

129
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,835
They don't need to be near your hoochie
mama. Who knows where she's been?

130
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,475
It was never like that.
Why don't you just listen to me?

131
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,832
- I'll sleep on the couch. We can talk tonight.
- No.

132
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,589
How could you?
Come home to us after screwing her?

133
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,270
I never screwed her!
Never until last night!

134
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,834
I mean...

135
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,077
Your marriage is on the rocks
and that's what you do?

136
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,156
You kicked me out into the street.

137
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,636
Yes, I went to her.
Yes, I had sex with her. It's all your fault.

138
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,831
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, I didn't mean...

139
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,475
You break your vows,
you fuck that whore and you blame me?

140
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,514
You coward, you bastard.
You son of a bitch. You make me sick.

141
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,198
Papa always said, when the time came,

142
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,711
he'd put on his best suit
and take himself to the funeral home.

143
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,313
- That's what he did.
- Unbelievable.

144
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,990
- Not if you knew him.
- He was a civil engineer. Meticulous.

145
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,759
He never wanted to burden us with anything.

146
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,749
He always did what he said he would do.
You could always trust his word.

147
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,713
The whole community looked up to him.
He was the best father.

148
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,515
A wonderful husband.

149
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,709
Sounds like he was a very fine man.

150
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,718
He was. He was.

151
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,476
I'm so, so sorry.

152
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,909
Thank you for your sympathy, Mr Diaz.

153
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,275
I'm really sorry, too.

154
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,510
So we'll see you Tuesday for the service.

155
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,520
He planned all that, as well.

156
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,715
If there's anything else we can do...

157
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,149
Keys to the car?

158
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,792
Oh, yeah.

159
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,717
You look busy.

160
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,753
I am. I'm contemplating.

161
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,236
Your busy is so different from my busy.

162
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,796
So, what's next on your packed agenda?

163
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,038
Papers to grade, yard work.
I should really finish that article.

164
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,550
Nice of you to talk with Claire's friend
this morning.

165
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,230
- I guess that goes on in your classroom.
- What?

166
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,990
Intellectual discussions
with young women in skimpy fashions.

167
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,998
Well, they do love to challenge a father figure.

168
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,033
But if you think that's skimpy,
you should see them summer quarter.

169
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
My man.

170
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,511
Dog, we're still on the job. You've had enough.

171
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,393
- What, are you my wife?
- Kiss my ass.

172
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,271
Whip it out.

173
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,398
Hey, this boyfriend, do you love him?

174
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,238
- That's right.
- Is he sexy?

175
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,909
You see this fat guy right here?

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,598
- Does he look crazy to you?
- That's the DJ. They always look crazy.

177
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,200
- Big dick?
- Excuse me?

178
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,437
Your boyfriend, does he have a big dick?

179
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,711
- Is that what you like? Me, I got a big dick.
- Jesus.

180
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,833
If something don't happen tonight,
it's gonna break right off.

181
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,113
You could really help me out, know what
I'm saying? You know what I'm saying?

182
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,357
I know what you're saying.
I'm not helping you out.

183
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,960
- It's not cool.
- You're kidding.

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,753
I don't treat my man
the way you treat your woman.

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,314
All right? You're loaded. Go back to your room.

186
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,397
- You don't think I'm sexy?
- You should go.

187
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,193
- Check out my dick before you say no, man.
- Go, please.

188
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,996
- Phone.
- Yup.

189
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,875
- Nate Fisher.
- <i>It's me</i>.

190
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,192
I thought last time was our last last time.

191
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,834
Yeah, as far as sex goes.

192
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,392
I told Joe.

193
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,352
- About me?
- Well, I didn't name names, but yeah.

194
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,960
I was really scared. It was really hard.

195
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,991
<i>But, yeah, we're OK</i>.

196
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,919
- Well, congratulations, I'm real happy for you.
- So, listen, come see our new house.

197
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,951
- <i>Brenda</i>...
- I know what you said.

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,788
I can't just surgically remove you from my life.
It doesn't make sense.

199
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,559
- <i>Come on</i>.
- Well, I'm sorry, I've got other plans.

200
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,750
- I don't believe you.
- It's true. We're going to Travel Town later.

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,874
- Aren't we, Miss Pumpkin?
- With the trains? I love them! They're so little.

202
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,151
- Can I come with you?
- I don't know.

203
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,590
No ulterior motives, I just wanna ride the rails.

204
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,237
- Brenda, we always have ulterior motives.
- <i>No, we don't. We don't</i>.

205
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,272
<i>Come on. Please?</i>

206
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,109
<i>Liar, liar, liar</i>.

207
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,435
What kind of man spends this much money
on some chick without getting laid?

208
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,670
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

209
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,316
- I'm trying not to eat the Krispy Kremes.
- <i>Come over as soon as you can</i>.

210
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,155
- Something's different. You sound better.
- <i>Yeah</i>.

211
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,191
I'm done crying.

212
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,634
Ready? What do you say, Maya, huh?
Caboose?

213
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,148
We're getting the caboose?

214
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,191
We got the caboose!

215
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,637
Lsn't this exciting?

216
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,514
- All aboard! Destination Las Vegas!
- Where we going? Las Vegas!

217
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,398
Bye!

218
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,438
My goodness, what's all this?

219
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,471
Nothing. It's just some flowers.

220
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,911
What's up?

221
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,875
That girl Anita,

222
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,992
I think she should be contributing financially.

223
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,270
Why? She's hardly ever here.
She basically lives at Russell's.

224
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,873
- Your Russell? That's terrible.
- I don't care.

225
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,229
Still, I think she should give us a cheque.

226
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,837
What do you have against Anita?

227
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,874
If she's going to prance around the house
in underwear, she should pay for the privilege.

228
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,913
Mom, I guarantee you,
none of my friends prance.

229
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,871
You know what I mean.

230
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,034
Well, don't book a 5am radio thing
and three stupid TV talk shows back to back.

231
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,277
Remember, I sign your fucking cheques.

232
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,629
- I'll be in front.
- No.

233
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,353
You think you have job security?

234
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,755
I fired my own goddamn parents.

235
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,795
Assholes! Greedy, bloodsucking assholes!

236
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,197
Gimme that.

237
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,912
I think there may be better ways
to handle your anger.

238
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,236
Yeah, well, when I care what you think,
I'll let you know.

239
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,078
- Fine.
- God.

240
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,314
- Oh, my God!
- That's your picture.

241
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,591
I look like a fucking $2 hooker!
I was supposed to sign off on these!

242
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,713
Fucking stupid assholes!
Why do they do it every fucking time?

243
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,548
Come on, now. Listen to me.
You're beautiful, all right?

244
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,431
Come on, now.

245
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,955
Besides,
aren't you supposed to look like a hooker?

246
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,831
I'm starving.

247
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,478
Oh, Keith.

248
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,431
Oh, my God.

249
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,796
Thank you so much.

250
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,235
Would you stop playing gang girl?
We're only here to talk.

251
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,316
You don't know what she's gonna do.

252
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,670
She could scratch your face,
then what do you say to the PTA?

253
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,439
Please, I want to see what she's like.

254
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,076
Whatever. I'm taking out my earrings
and I'm putting away my gold.

255
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,311
That's her.

256
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,958
- Who are you?
- I'm Vanessa. I'm Rico's wife.

257
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,392
OK, this is not my problem.
You have no right to be here.

258
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,830
If you're sleeping with Rico,
it is your problem.

259
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,874
No, it's not my problem you don't know
how to dress and you can't keep a man.

260
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,480
What? I'm not finished talking to you.

261
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,391
- Fucking bitch! Trying to steal my husband!
- Fucking home-wrecker! Dirty whore!

262
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,830
- I'll kick your fucking ass!
- And your fake fucking tits!

263
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,314
- You're just jealous of my tits!
- Bitch, please!

264
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,831
- Your man paid for these, gordita!
- Who the fuck are you calling gordita?

265
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,599
Get her, Vanessa! Get off my sister!
Get the hell off of my sister, you sleazy pig!

266
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,758
Don't fuck with my husband! Do not fuck with
my kids! I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

267
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,792
Fuck you! I didn't make him do nothing!
I got a kid, too!

268
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,435
Get outta here! I've called the cops! 911 !

269
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,835
He doesn't want you any more.

270
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,396
Oh, shit.

271
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,396
- We gotta go pick up the boys from school.
- Right.

272
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,952
- You can help me pick up if you want.
- What have you done?

273
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,793
- I cut back the crape myrtle.
- This is not a crape myrtle.

274
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,753
It's the tree Nathaniel planted for Claire
on her tenth birthday.

275
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,793
Can't you tell a crape myrtle
from a Bradford flowering pear?

276
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,196
Well, whatever it is, it looked diseased.

277
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,232
I've read about powdery mildew
and it's no joke.

278
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,193
That tree is not, nor has it ever been,
diseased.

279
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,279
It never gets powdery mildew
because I keep the soil dry and aerated.

280
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,551
- My God, you've killed it.
- I have not.

281
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,116
Ask anyone, you have to trim vegetation
in order to stimulate new growth.

282
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,151
You're a geologist. You know rocks.

283
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,115
This is a living thing. You chop off the branches
and you make wounds.

284
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,199
Ruth, please, don't anthropomorphise trees.

285
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,835
Wounds, that's what they're called,
and these wounds will not heal.

286
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,236
They'll be invaded by rot.
It will move into the core wood.

287
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,989
You've butchered the most beautiful tree
in my yard.

288
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,993
I think it'll come back
bigger and better than ever.

289
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,031
And if it doesn't...

290
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,429
we can always get another one.

291
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,432
You could have told me
what you were going to do.

292
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,877
- Hello?
- <i>Who's this?</i>

293
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,633
You called me. Who's this?

294
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,716
<i>Sarge</i>.

295
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,638
You gotta know me or how can I call you?

296
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,717
Sarge? From paintball?

297
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,957
Oh, my God, this is David Fisher.

298
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,709
David and Keith. You made us breakfast.

299
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,433
Hey, David, yeah.

300
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,471
I remember. How you doing?

301
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,034
- I'm fine. How are you?
- <i>Excellent</i>.

302
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,074
I found this number in my wallet and I was,
like, "Whoa, who the fuck is this?" It's you.

303
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,230
- Yeah, it's me.
- <i>Came from La Habra to play a tournament</i>.

304
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,195
- Kinda hanging out now, drinking some beers.
- Yeah?

305
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,198
- <i>Not much happening here</i>.
- Come over.

306
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,878
Hi.

307
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,599
Hey.

308
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,671
You're so damn cute.

309
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,675
- Too much fragrance.
- Maybe a little.

310
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,190
Fuck! I bought these votives.
They're supposed to be unscented.

311
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,392
Instead they're, like,
sandalwood, lavender, vanilla, musk.

312
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,391
Come here, stop it.

313
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,799
I don't know why...
I mean, we already kinda had sex,

314
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,957
but I feel like I'm at a middle school cotillion.

315
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,796
Well, you're not.

316
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,229
You're all grown-up and beautiful.

317
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,030
- Don't laugh at me.
- I'm not. Not at all.

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,798
I don't know what to do
to make this go right tonight.

319
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,831
It's already going right.

320
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,713
Except you have to change
this vagina music immediately.

321
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,959
OK.

322
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,314
Yeah, I definitely remember you.

323
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,837
And Keith's out of town?

324
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,999
He's on the other side of the continent.

325
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,751
So this time I get you all to myself.

326
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,076
- Yes, you do.
- I dig it.

327
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,996
So do I.

328
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,192
- Weed?
- Oh, God, yes.

329
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,190
Dude, what are you doing
way the fuck over there?

330
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,118
- I don't know.
- Come here.

331
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,753
- What?
- You feeling anything resembling excitement?

332
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,711
Of course.

333
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,550
I love kissing you. Your face has
these subtle curves and angles.

334
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,471
- Am I doing something wrong?
- No.

335
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,750
There's just so much more we could be doing.

336
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,791
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

337
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,751
Let's make it like a dance.

338
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,871
Where I touch you...

339
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,389
- which is nice, right?
- Yeah.

340
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,954
And then you touch me.

341
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,156
OK, this is not happening. Sorry, it's not.

342
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,595
I took one of David's Ativan.
I thought it would help.

343
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,513
You really want to get off, huh?

344
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,279
Yeah, kinda. I mean, it'd be nice.

345
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,912
Go ahead.

346
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,838
Claire Fisher.

347
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,991
I want to watch.

348
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,676
All right, yeah.

349
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,639
Watch me. I'll come for you.

350
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,471
Oh, hey.

351
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,670
Oh, I was waiting up for you.

352
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,598
Hey.

353
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,995
Good music?

354
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,669
Yeah, you know, oompah, oompah.

355
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,790
Love, danger.

356
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,278
What did you do today?

357
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,039
- I went to Travel Town.
- No?

358
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,232
Yes. Nate took his daughter
and I tagged along.

359
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,478
- Did you ride the train?
- Four times.

360
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,391
I know Griffith Gulch like the back of my hand.

361
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,318
That's a long trip. You must be tuckered out.

362
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,237
You'd think so, but not so tuckered.

363
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,437
Dude, yeah!

364
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,592
Yeah!

365
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,916
- Hello.
- Lock up your goddamn Vanessa or I will.

366
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,359
- What are you talking about?
- She and another puta tried to beat my ass.

367
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,154
When they couldn't,
they beat my fucking car. It's your fault.

368
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,670
- <i>You'd better buy me a new one</i>.
- It is not my fault.

369
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,233
You started this. I've given you enough.

370
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,477
My life is ruined because of you.
Fuck your car, Infinity, I'm done.

371
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,718
Fine. I don't need you any more, dum-dum.
I got two guys better than you.

372
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,673
They're not stupid enough
to tell their bitch-ass wives. Bitch!

373
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,351
<i>I don't know where we are</i>.

374
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,234
Oh, Tampa.

375
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,359
Yeah, because when I got on stage, I said,
"How much do you love me, Tampa?"

376
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,995
I'd better let you get some sleep.

377
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,230
You know when you're really tired,
but you can't stop your mind?

378
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,792
It just goes around and around.

379
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,717
Yeah.

380
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,679
Hey, how's your boyfriend?

381
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,912
Not so good.

382
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,792
Tell me.

383
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,431
He got carjacked a while ago. It was bad.

384
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,075
Yeah.

385
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,315
I'm afraid of those things, too.

386
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,796
Some freak out of nowhere with a gun,

387
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,990
those autograph hounds.

388
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,553
You just never know.

389
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,797
You sing. It's my job to worry.

390
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,711
Stay with me?

391
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,675
- Just till I fall asleep.
- Celeste...

392
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,637
Shut up.

393
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,319
- Trying to get me arrested? You're barely 18.
- Publicity. Last March I turned 21.

394
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,111
You ever been with a woman?

395
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,358
Of course.

396
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,910
- I don't get fucked in the ass.
- That makes one of us.

397
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,675
- What are you doing?
- Gotta bunk with a guy from my team.

398
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,713
More tourney this week. I don't wanna get
my ass lit up at the top of the action.

399
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,039
Gotta focus, stay tight, stay alive.

400
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,753
- Game on.
- Well, stay here.

401
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,758
You can't go already, I want you to stay.

402
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,791
Yeah, I get that, but...

403
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,957
like, no, sorry.

404
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,438
I'll make you breakfast. I'll go to
your tournament with you. Come back to bed.

405
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,598
- Or we can watch TV.
- Do you have a deafness problem? Tune in.

406
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,517
I gotta be someplace else.

407
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,717
I'll leave you a joint. You could use it.

408
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,955
- What do I have to do?
- What?

409
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,956
To get somebody to stay with me!

410
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,470
- Fuck this shit, man.
- Don't you go!

411
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,752
David, do I call a hospital?

412
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,279
No.

413
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,272
No.

414
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,758
Get some help, will ya? You're losing it.

415
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,429
Good Lord. Federico.

416
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,311
Hi, Mrs. F.

417
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,920
- What is this?
- I...

418
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,428
Well, we're having problems at home
and I didn't have anywhere else to go.

419
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,391
What a shame. I'm sorry.

420
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,991
- But you can't sleep here.
- Oh, OK, I'll go.

421
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,831
No, dear, come upstairs. You can take Claire's
old room. We'll put these in the washer.

422
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,711
Thank you.

423
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,391
Don't cry. Your marriage has always been
so strong. You'll be home soon.

424
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,752
No, I cheated on Vanessa.
She'll never forgive me.

425
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,109
What's wrong with you men?

426
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,756
Always turning your back on what you have,
always sniffing around for something new.

427
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,352
Me? You've had three boyfriends since Mr F,
not including the affair with the hairdresser.

428
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,909
- You know about Hiram?
- I practically live here.

429
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,195
I made a mistake. I just want to take it all back.

430
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,631
I know, dear, I know.

431
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,991
- Yo.
- <i>Hey</i>.

432
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,112
Just the man I want to talk to. What's up?

433
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,039
- You have to come home.
- <i>I am. The tour's on the West Coast soon</i>.

434
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,511
- I got to check in with you about...
- You're not listening to me. I need you now.

435
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,472
- <i>The timing's not good</i>.
- Fuck timing, fuck you!

436
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,711
What's going on with you?

437
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,595
Do I have to explain to you that I'm losing
my mind? Can't you tell? Where is everybody?

438
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,077
OK, OK, I hear you.
Don't stay alone, go to your family.

439
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,111
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can</i>.

440
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,311
I think I've figured us out.

441
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,157
Me, too.

442
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,592
You first.

443
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,955
I think you are the coolest
and most beautiful person

444
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,154
I've ever seen in my life
and I admire you so fucking much.

445
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,397
- Well, of course.
- And you are totally hot.

446
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,877
I mean, I feel that, I really do,
and I'm, like, so pulled to you.

447
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,278
But when I look at
this whole thing objectively...

448
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,155
- The attraction's aesthetic.
- Well, yeah. It's creative and artistic...

449
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,192
- And intellectual and physical...
- Yes!

450
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,277
But not necessarily sexual.

451
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,590
- You're not into fucking women.
- I thought I was.

452
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,954
- Shit.
- Shit.

453
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,598
But after seeing your orgasm,
I really, really want one.

454
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,391
Fuck!

455
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,993
It's a beautiful place, Bren.

456
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,632
Peaceful.

457
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,197
You and Joe did good.

458
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,911
Could've been us.

459
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,873
Yeah, but it's not us.
And it is time for Maya's nap.

460
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,991
Ready? Time for a nap.
We gotta say goodbye.

461
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,634
Just let her sleep on the bed.

462
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,831
Come on, we can talk about safe things.

463
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,791
I'm going out for a couple of hours.

464
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,758
OK, bye.

465
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,831
All you do is come and go!

466
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,438
Ruth?

467
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,630
Marriage is not a gas station, George.

468
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,389
You can't just pull in and fill up
whenever you remember you have a wife.

469
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,908
That is completely unfair and inaccurate.

470
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,833
I have always treated you
as a partner and a friend.

471
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,474
If that's not marriage, I don't know what is.

472
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,035
- That's right, you don't.
- What about your own life?

473
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,470
Why do I have to be
the centre of everything for you?

474
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,640
Why do you have to hound me about every
detail down to the fucking subatomic level?

475
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,673
When I don't there's shit on my doorstep or
another child appears or another girlfriend

476
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,676
or you murder my favourite tree!

477
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,909
Sarah was wrong.
You're not like Nathaniel, you're worse!

478
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,195
- You are smothering me.
- Oh, bullshit!

479
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,390
You always do exactly what you want.

480
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,830
You haven't changed or grown one iota
since we met.

481
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,158
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

482
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,837
Warn me? Are you threatening divorce?

483
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,757
That is not what I meant.

484
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,029
I'm your seventh spouse.
How much warning do you think I need?

485
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,836
- You jumped on him?
- I couldn't stop myself.

486
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,917
- What did he do?
- Put me down and sat on me.

487
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,157
I was like a mosquito to him. It was humiliating.

488
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,231
- I have to get control of myself.
- No, David.

489
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,750
If you were any more controlled,
you'd be a sculpture.

490
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,991
You know what?

491
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,990
Last night, I had a humiliating
homosexual experience of my own.

492
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,032
Seriously? What happened?

493
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,959
- Not much. I never even went down on her.
- You can stop there.

494
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,197
I just couldn't go through with it.
It pisses me off.

495
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,956
- It would be so much easier to be gay.
- Oh, no.

496
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,993
- Yeah, I'd have a really defined subculture.
- Overrated.

497
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,830
We're both women. I'd have some idea
of what she was thinking and feeling.

498
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,677
Not necessarily.

499
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,359
I wouldn't have to deal
with unfamiliar sex organs.

500
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,675
They're all unfamiliar unless they're yours.

501
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,117
How you doing?

502
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,598
- I gotta leave the tour, Duane.
- Yeah, I heard.

503
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,959
- There'll still be work in LA?
- Definitely, yeah.

504
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,551
We know it's not your fault.
What are you gonna do?

505
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,149
Yeah. I'll go tell Celeste.

506
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,272
Whoa. She's the one that told me.

507
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,352
- What are you talking about?
- What are you? Celeste fired your ass.

508
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,909
Joe. Oh, God. Fuck.

509
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,078
- Wait, wait, Maya's...
- Nate's daughter's in the next room.

510
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,395
Look...

511
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,832
I deserve whatever you have to say to me,
but I don't want her scared so...

512
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,075
- Can you give me that?
- Get out.

513
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,515
That's him? Your previous indiscretion, him?

514
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,519
- Yes.
- That depressing cripple.

515
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,790
You're both cripples, obviously.

516
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,319
I am so stupid. I was actually considering
having children with you.

517
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,638
- That truly frightens me.
- It's not your fault.

518
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,477
I know it's not my fault.

519
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,797
I've obviously been in denial
that I'm in recovery...

520
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,718
Shut the fuck up!

521
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,230
You neurotic, tedious, self-absorbed bitch.

522
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,877
You don't give a shit about me. You never did.

523
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,517
That's not true. I love you, Joe. I do.

524
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,234
I was honest with you. I have an issue.

525
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,592
Oh, blah-blah fucking psycho-bullshit!

526
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,189
It's not sex, it's betrayal.
That's your fucking addiction.

527
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,357
- OK, I'll get help...
- No, no, no.

528
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,391
Here's a question for you.

529
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,638
What do you call a person without character,
without integrity, without loyalty,

530
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,035
without respect?

531
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,514
I call that person a fucking waste of my time.

532
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,911
That's not who I am.

533
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,758
You think you know me, but you don't.

534
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,835
You'd think someone in this family

535
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,633
would notice when the house is on fire.

536
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,634
<i>This is bullshit</i>.

537
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,478
You go to bed with a woman while
your boyfriend's recovering?

538
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,556
- I can't trust a man like that.
- Celeste...

539
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,559
If you stayed with the tour, you'd distract me.
That can't happen.

540
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,434
Plus it's very unprofessional to fuck the boss.
Not cool, dog.

541
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,717
Just so you know,
I was leaving before you fired me.

542
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,557
Synchronicity.

543
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,352
Ciao, baby.

544
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,231
<i>"Dear neighbour</i>...

545
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,280
<i>"You are my brother</i>.

546
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,311
<i>"I love you</i>... <i>"</i>

547
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,073
<i>"And yet, I feel a great sadness</i>...

548
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,358
- <i>"in my bosoml"</i>
- Where's Mom?

549
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,792
"Going away. Don't contact the authorities.

550
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,070
"I'll be in touch when I'm ready.
Dinner is in the oven."

551
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,509
Apparently she's gone walkabout.

552
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,512
<i>I wish this family</i>
<i>was as close as the Flanders</i>.

553
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,475
<i>OK, OK, all right, all right. She's right</i>.
<i>Let's do something together</i>.

554
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,231
<i>What does everyone say to miniature golf,</i>
<i>followed by a round of chocolate milkshakes?</i>

555
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,556
- <i>All rightl</i>
- <i>I was going to wash my hair</i>.

556
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,629
