1
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,470
l don't know why you didn't accept
the complimentary map at the trailhead.

2
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,416
Maybe because l've done
this hike 100 times before.

3
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:54,649
You're the one who insisted
on making a left at the last marker.

4
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,987
Because the other way
didn't look like a trail.

5
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,525
That was the trail.

6
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:04,388
Fine. Everything is my fault.
Everything in the entire world.

7
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,694
No. Not everything.

8
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:09,828
Just the fact that we're now totally lost
and l'm totally dehydrated.

9
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:12,498
lf you were so sure about the damn trail...

10
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:15,600
which you weren't,
then why didn't you just go and....

11
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,540
What is that down there?

12
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:23,378
l told you there was something,
but you didn't believe me.

13
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:25,942
You never believe me.
You think l'm just like your mother.

14
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,750
-No, l don't.
-Yes, you do, just be honest for once.

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,553
Oh, my God.

16
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,995
Something's moving.

17
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,758
-Somebody's in there, they're trapped.
-No, they're not.

18
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,708
Must've driven off that dirt road up there.

19
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,779
lt's been sitting here for years.

20
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,682
People are horrible.

21
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:06,557
Why would they have an accident,
and then just leave their car to rot?

22
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,455
Maybe because they're still in it.

23
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,750
Okay, l'm fading.
l can't even keep my eyes open.

24
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,754
l need to get a cup of coffee.

25
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:36,289
You fell asleep
when we were on the phone last night.

26
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,756
l did not.

27
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:42,358
l was talking for like 30 minutes straight,
and l was thinking:

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,764
''lt is so good to get these things out,''
and then....

29
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,633
l'm sorry.
l haven't slept in like three nights...

30
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,573
l've been devouring
this Camille Claudel biography.

31
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,907
Do you remember me telling you that
my brother's getting married on Saturday?

32
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,713
-Yes, to the woman with no chin.
-That's right, so l didn't totally bore you.

33
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,885
l know it's kind of last minute...

34
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,119
but l was thinking
maybe if you weren't doing anything...

35
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,889
l mean, if it wouldn't
be completely painful for you...

36
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,621
to come with me?

37
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,229
lt's not a date.
lt sounds like a date, but it's not.

38
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:33,010
Okay, it's a date. You would be my date.

39
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:40,452
Sure. l mean, why not?

40
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,587
-Of course l'll go with you.
-Okay, it got weird, didn't it?

41
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,258
And l did it. l hate life.

42
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,924
Claire, l really like our friendship
and l would never--

43
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:57,868
What's with the chitty chat?

44
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:03,304
You can focus on your work,
or you can gossip like old blind women.

45
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,145
lt's your decision.

46
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,878
Finally you draw what you see,
not what you think you see.

47
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,483
l like it.

48
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,396
Claire, you and l should talk.

49
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,503
Look, everything l do sucks today.
l know, l've just like--

50
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,373
This isn't about your work.

51
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,525
-Thank you.
-Of course.

52
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,395
Okay.

53
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,170
You're not gonna believe this.
Olivier asked me to be his assistant...

54
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,106
and l start tomorrow.

55
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,941
l don't believe this.

56
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:15,573
l feel like l just won something.
l never win anything.

57
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,151
Me neither.

58
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,350
l guess any of these would be fine.

59
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:31,857
-Honey, you actually have to pick one.
-Chris, please.

60
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,164
How am l supposed to know
what kind of casket Will would want?

61
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,534
He disappeared over 25 years ago.

62
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,403
And l can hardly remember
how he took his coffee.

63
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,943
l myself like the Deluxe Aegean.

64
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,809
lt's a little on the high end,
but it's very calming.

65
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,212
lt's like a slow, lulling ride on....

66
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,283
On the Aegean, l guess.

67
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,886
-l need to sit down.
-Take your time.

68
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,828
There's no hurry,
we know how hard this is for you.

69
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,492
He...

70
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:10,059
went out for a newspaper one day
and never came back.

71
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:13,437
So, l figured he deserted me.

72
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,776
Which made sense.
Because we were one of those horrible...

73
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:19,904
got-married-too-soon
for-all-the-wrong-reasons couples.

74
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:24,745
Now, l find out he didn't run away at all...

75
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,650
he died in a freak accident.

76
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,818
What am l supposed to do
with all these years...

77
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,883
of feeling like he deserted us?

78
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:37,630
Honey, we don't even need to do a funeral.
lt's just an empty ritual.

79
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,601
Actually, the closure it provides
is quite powerful. And quite healing.

80
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,638
The strange part is where they found him.

81
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,609
ln that canyon, it was 10 miles
from where we lived back then.

82
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,543
What was he doing there?

83
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,845
-Maybe he got lost.
-Right.

84
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,611
Looking for a newspaper
on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere?

85
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,584
l mean, do you think
he was seeing someone else?

86
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,356
l have no idea.

87
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,697
He could have been.

88
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:17,033
Diane, let's just make a decision
on the casket, and get out of here.

89
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,000
Will was Jewish so l suppose....

90
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:24,342
The Sampson. lt's plain cedar. Got it.

91
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:53,296
l can finish out the week if you need,
it's no problem.

92
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:57,777
-Claire, you got another job, go do it.
-lt's just.... lt's an amazing opportunity.

93
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:01,611
To learn from Olivier Castro-Staal,
maybe even help him with his art.

94
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:05,682
And just do something meaningful,
instead of just, you know.

95
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,418
Fine. You know what?

96
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,355
l wasn't crazy about you
doing pickups and deliveries anyway.

97
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,258
We have enough actual employees here,
we shouldn't have to pay somebody extra.

98
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,989
Okay, thanks.

99
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,390
Wait, this is for you.

100
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,434
ls that a goodbye gift?

101
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,835
No, it's a box of bones
l just picked up from the coroner.

102
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:27,431
William Jaffe. Here, catch.

103
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,271
Just kidding.

104
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,213
-l'm not sure this is such a good idea.
-No, it's perfect.

105
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,278
Look, we were saving some
by using Claire.

106
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,414
We can save serious money
with an apprentice.

107
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,857
-l've crunched the numbers.
-You can crunch numbers?

108
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:46,951
Of course l can.

109
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:50,691
Look, it's free labor,
we just have to give him a place to live.

110
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:54,633
He gets credit for mortuary school,
and we don't have to pay him bupkiss.

111
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:59,700
As Mr. F. used to say. Well?

112
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,273
l don't know. l think this house
is already getting a little crowded.

113
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:06,711
-You mean, with your wife and baby?
-l'm just saying that....

114
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:09,641
How do we even know
someone will want the job?

115
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,175
l've got five seniors from Cypress lined up
dying to interview today.

116
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,189
-l think we should do it.
-All right, fine.

117
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:19,158
lsn't someone going to ask me
how l feel about this?

118
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:22,390
After all, since none of you
actually live in the house anymore...

119
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,023
l'll be the one forced to coexist
with a stranger...

120
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,067
who could kill me
in the middle of the night.

121
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:29,329
You know what?
She's right, it's not fair to her.

122
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:34,340
Mrs. F? We can save up to $10,000 a year
according to my projections.

123
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,845
l don't want loud rock music in this house.

124
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,850
No rock music, got it.

125
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,647
So, you guys want to take a look
at some of the resumes they faxed over?

126
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,656
Are you kidding? l'm dying to.

127
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,587
You know, Mom,
you don't have to be a martyr all the time.

128
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,889
l agreed to it for you.

129
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,795
You need to make more money,
now that Lisa is a stay-at-home.

130
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,924
-A what?
-A stay-at-home mother.

131
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:03,437
Lisa told me that's what they're called
now. What a terrible expression.

132
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:06,735
Like you have a bracelet on
that'll ring if you leave your house.

133
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,001
Lisa's going back to work.

134
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,908
Of course she is.
When Maya goes to kindergarten.

135
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:18,180
-Why are you holding a mousetrap?
-l found a box of them.

136
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,311
Remember when we had
that mouse infestation years ago?

137
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,621
-Those things are so cruel.
-Mice have germs, they deserve to die.

138
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:51,778
Okay. Let's just hope that bad rehearsal
means good show tomorrow night.

139
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,044
Good night, everybody.

140
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,019
David?

141
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:05,396
-What, was my solo awful?
-No. lt's good.

142
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,669
But l think you need to stop
trying to make it so...

143
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:12,898
perfect.

144
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:18,143
-Okay.
-Just try to be more relaxed with it, okay?

145
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,604
Okay, great, we'll see you tomorrow night.

146
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,982
David, we're going out for a drink.

147
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:30,387
-lt's only going to be--
-A drink, yes, absolutely.

148
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:36,756
Dennis can kiss my lilywhite ass.
l mean, it's not like it's the Met.

149
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:41,698
He's just trying to....
l mean, your solo is a little....

150
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,834
lt's what?

151
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:48,773
lt's prissy. lt's like a little girl's dollhouse.

152
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,705
Like a kitty-cat greeting card.
Like a poofy white cutesy-pie.

153
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,709
Thanks, Terry, l get the point.

154
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:59,048
God, l was just trying
to make it sound pretty.

155
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:03,785
That's the point, dear. Don't.
Just sing from someplace real.

156
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,859
God, when did l become 400 years old?

157
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,724
On your last birthday.

158
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,869
Not that you would remember anything
from that night.

159
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,730
He was actually trying to convince this
guy that he used to be in Cirque du Soleil.

160
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,004
Ter, show him the coming-down-
from-a-trapeze look, please.

161
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,643
l have to go to the bathroom.
l'll get a check so we can get out of here.

162
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:39,717
This one is obsessed with Trading Spaces.
We're lucky we got him this long.

163
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:48,529
Look, l know l'm not supposed
to say anything, but l will.

164
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,963
l feel weird not acknowledging it.

165
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,072
-What?
-You know. lt.

166
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:58,078
-How we know each other.
-From chorus?

167
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,840
-Fine, just pretend. Whatever.
-l don't know what you're talking about.

168
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:07,183
From the bathroom at Sears.
lt was what, seven, eight years ago?

169
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:13,190
You jerked me off. The second stall?
The security guy almost caught us?

170
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,929
Honestly, you're confusing me
with someone else.

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,262
Come on.

172
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,701
You checked me out
in automotive supplies...

173
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,500
l followed you into home appliances...

174
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,973
we met up in the second floor john,
where everyone--

175
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,067
-This wasn't me.
-Please.

176
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,378
Fine, be that way.

177
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,877
ls that enough? Do you need more?

178
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,150
l think $40 is too much.

179
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,518
So, David, is your boyfriend
coming to the concert tomorrow?

180
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:50,860
-Yeah, he's supposed to.
-l can't wait to meet him.

181
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,571
-God damn it.
-Aren't there instructions?

182
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:04,376
A page of hieroglyphics
showing nothing that came in this box.

183
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,448
What are you doing?

184
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,013
l'm circling problem purchases
on the Visa bill.

185
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:15,120
Problem purchases?

186
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,116
Things we bought that maybe
we didn't need or could buy less of.

187
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,893
No, you mean things l bought.

188
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,633
What are these little smiley faces?
Good purchases?

189
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,398
No, l was just doodling.

190
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,831
l don't see why
these are problem purchases.

191
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,674
This was lunch with David. l had to eat.

192
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:41,880
You didn't have to spend $55.
What did you have?

193
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,676
-A couple of sandwiches.
-This country is insane.

194
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,822
What about this one?
You dropped $80 at Book Soup.

195
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:53,352
-l guess you haven't heard of libraries.
-Libraries are depressing.

196
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:57,227
Nate. You're not single anymore.
You can't keep spending like you are.

197
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,297
Okay, l'll try and cut down.

198
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,235
You know, until you go back to work.

199
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:14,840
Actually, l'm holding off
looking for another job.

200
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,446
Really? For how long?

201
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,184
l don't know, we'll see.

202
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:24,122
Because my mom seems to think
that it's until Maya starts kindergarten.

203
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:29,790
This is not a decision
you can make without me.

204
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,923
Okay.

205
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,975
-That was a late rehearsal.
-Yeah, we just....

206
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,885
You know, the concert's
tomorrow night, so.

207
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:55,080
What time should l be there?

208
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,382
7:30.

209
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:01,989
-l don't get off until 9:00 at the earliest.
-You can't make it?

210
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,553
David, please don't try
and make me feel guilty, okay?

211
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,725
l did everything l could
to change my schedule.

212
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,200
l understand, it's okay.
You'll come to the next one.

213
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,171
Boy, just twist the knife in deeper.
l'm going to talk to Frank about this.

214
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,199
Keith, you really don't have to come.
lt's not a big deal, l'm not angry.

215
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,472
Really?

216
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:27,279
Thank you for being so aware,
this isn't about you.

217
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,123
We really are making progress.

218
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,424
You know, this is really fucked up.

219
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,467
Missing your concert for this lame-ass job.
l should just call in sick.

220
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:45,331
-No, don't.
-l don't get it.

221
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,636
How did my life become
so fucking meaningless?

222
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,677
l used to make a difference.
l used to protect people's lives.

223
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:53,076
Now, l just protect their stuff.

224
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:56,209
Work isn't everything.
l give you some meaning, don't l?

225
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,581
-You give me meaning.
-Of course.

226
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,053
But we can't be everything
for each other, David.

227
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,215
l mean, that's just not possible.

228
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:29,043
l'll be done in a few minutes, Arthur.
You're a little early.

229
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:33,075
Actually, l was a lot early.
So, l walked around the block for a while.

230
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,684
An elderly woman
who was almost completely bald...

231
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,658
told me to get off her lawn.

232
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:45,896
-May l ask you a personal question?
-You can ask.

233
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,030
Why did you choose me
over the other applicants?

234
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:53,096
l'm only asking because l'm always
looking to improve my interview skills.

235
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:57,810
Fair enough.
lt was between you and Judy Lindaman...

236
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:00,937
but we just thought
you would fit here better.

237
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:03,174
Based on?

238
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,688
There was something in the way
you talked about your grandmother.

239
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:15,492
My Great-aunt Pearl.
She was a very special woman.

240
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,763
l barely knew my parents.

241
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:21,094
They burned to death in a fire
when l was five.

242
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:24,270
-l'm sorry.
-My Aunt Pearl gave up everything for me.

243
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,101
She home-schooled me.

244
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:30,804
Yeah, you seem a little home-schooled.

245
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:38,681
Shit. These collagen lips are such a bitch.

246
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:44,553
l'm guessing
your Aunt Pearl didn't like cussing.

247
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,285
Not one bit.

248
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:49,526
She would have tarred me
for that kind of language.

249
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,860
-Rico, have you--
-Mrs. F.

250
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:55,424
-This is Arthur Martin, our new apprentice.
-Hello.

251
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:59,129
Excuse me, have you seen Nate?
Lisa's looking for him.

252
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,741
-That'll be $62.90.
-There you go.

253
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,293
l have to talk to my manager.
l need credit approval!

254
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:26,756
This CD is so great for like taking diet pills
and cleaning your bathroom.

255
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,704
What are you doing?
Do you even listen to me when l talk?

256
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,506
Or you just hear static
every time l open my mouth?

257
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,548
How on earth do you expect
Maya to go to college?

258
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,210
You're throwing everything
we have together away for fucking Beck?

259
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,247
Just sign here, please.

260
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,921
You know what?
l don't want these, l changed my mind.

261
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:56,258
So, can we just cancel this purchase?

262
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,025
Come on, Claire,
the early worm catches things, let's go.

263
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:38,128
-Okay, where's your studio?
-ln my house.

264
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:42,001
-Why is that your business?
-lsn't that where we're going?

265
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,575
No. We're going to the Century City mall.

266
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,772
-The mall?
-Best mall in the world.

267
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,441
l used to like Livingston Mall
when l taught at Rutgers.

268
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,849
Then Bamberger's went out of business
and it all went straight to hell.

269
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,252
Wait. You need an assistant to shop?

270
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,556
l need an assistant to drive me.

271
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:02,322
My license was taken away
by a jackbooted fascist.

272
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:06,059
l don't know why l am always persecuted,
but it has always been so.

273
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:10,135
-So l'm your driver?
-Yes, can we go now?

274
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,932
Brentano's is having a sale.

275
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,668
And if l ever catch you with my toothbrush
again, you're dead meat.

276
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,652
This is my brother, Nate.
Nate, this is Tom Jaffe.

277
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,548
William Jaffe's son.

278
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:36,318
l didn't realize he had a....
Look, l'm so sorry for your loss.

279
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,260
l was only a few months old when he....

280
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,892
When it happened.

281
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,495
l never even knew him.

282
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:48,403
Tom was just dropping off
some of his father's belongings.

283
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,767
lt seems kind of strange
considering that there's no real body.

284
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:53,540
ln situations like your father's...

285
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:57,481
we find it helps the family
to put some of his belongings to rest also.

286
00:22:58,518 --> 00:22:59,917
l hope this'll do.

287
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,316
Was your father a little person?

288
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,389
No, this was the only suit of his
that my mother could find.

289
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,997
lt was in some box his family had.

290
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,367
lt's from his bar mitzvah. And there's this.

291
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:22,467
lt was in the same box.
lt either belonged to him or my uncle.

292
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,008
My mother thinks she remembers
my father liking Blue Bayou.

293
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,486
l'm going to get fired
if l'm not back by 2:00. So if that's all....

294
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,960
Yes, we'll see you tomorrow afternoon
at the funeral.

295
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,129
What's wrong with you?

296
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,376
Can you imagine being so calm
about your father's death?

297
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:02,108
He probably thinks of his stepfather
as his real father. As he should.

298
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:05,083
He doesn't know anything about his dad.
Not a thing.

299
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:08,453
He has no idea
whether he even liked Linda Ronstadt.

300
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:11,023
Do you know
if our dad liked Linda Ronstadt?

301
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,820
As a matter of fact, l do.

302
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:18,661
When l cleaned out his record collection
there was a copy of Heart Like a Wheel.

303
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:24,568
Here are the teacups.
And these are dinner plates.

304
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:28,773
And those up there are for casseroles.
And these are the cereal bowls.

305
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,100
Please feel free to use any of the dishes.

306
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,380
ls there one l shouldn't use?

307
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,885
lt's silly. That one used to be
David's special yellow bowl.

308
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:41,182
He would get upset
when anyone else used it.

309
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:44,849
-But l'm sure he won't mind anymore.
-Let's not take the chance.

310
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:48,159
-We'll keep it out of rotation.
-Thank you.

311
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,630
Now, you see the chart l made?

312
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:56,024
Each mealtime is divided into two shifts,
one for each of us.

313
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:58,604
So we never have to suffer
the awkwardness...

314
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:00,367
of both eating at the same time.

315
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,431
Thank you. That's very thoughtful.

316
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,000
We just sign up each day
for the one we want.

317
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:08,707
So, my dinner can be from 6:00 to 7:00...

318
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:13,014
-or from 7:00 to 8:00.
-Exactly. Which do you want tonight?

319
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,751
l'll take 7:00.

320
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:19,323
Actually...

321
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,157
l'll take 6:00.

322
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,392
Good, l had a late lunch.
Just use that pen there to initial it.

323
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:29,798
Of course, other people in this house
obviously also use the kitchen.

324
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,896
lf you want to make a schedule with them,
too, feel free to use my system.

325
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,432
Laundry facilities are in here.

326
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,806
Now, Sunday nights are off limits to you.

327
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,474
l'm very sorry,
but that's when l do my linens.

328
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,017
Yes, ma'am. l understand completely.

329
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,818
l should write down that part...

330
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:50,618
about never aiming the showerhead
at that part of the tile.

331
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,682
No need. lt's all in the little booklet
hanging by the sink.

332
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,489
What a lovely room.

333
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:59,122
-Such warm light.
-lt does the trick.

334
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:04,833
''The second drawer sticks
unless you lift as you pull.''

335
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,542
Thank you. That's very kind.

336
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:19,842
All right then. That's the end of the tour.

337
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,784
-You're on your own now.
-Thank you.

338
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:00,853
Nate?

339
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,563
Oh, my God.

340
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,162
-What are you doing here?
-l should have called first.

341
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,669
l was afraid you'd....

342
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:19,469
l need to talk to you.

343
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,347
lt won't take long.

344
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,309
l wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

345
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:32,688
l don't know. l've got a lot of errands
l have to run today.

346
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,351
Can l come with you?

347
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,093
Please?

348
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:49,605
lt seems like l just got this
thing smog checked last month.

349
00:27:57,183 --> 00:28:00,346
You know, l called you
when l first got back into town.

350
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,114
A couple of months ago?

351
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,681
And l hung up when you answered.

352
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,851
l just wanted to make sure
that you were alive.

353
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,525
l'm sorry, it's just...

354
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:18,033
after everything we went through,
to not even know if you're alive...

355
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:20,299
that's sad.

356
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:27,879
But apparently
your surgery was a success, right?

357
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:29,240
Yeah.

358
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:35,979
The AVM ruptured in the middle of it
and all hell broke loose...

359
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:39,086
-but they fixed it.
-Thank God.

360
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,562
Use your fucking signal, woman.
You can go up my ass.

361
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,003
Claire, l once had an affair
with an older married woman.

362
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,709
Her name was Astra.
That means star, did you know that?

363
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:11,552
-Have you ever committed infidelity?
-No, not yet.

364
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,058
But someday, hopefully.

365
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,587
lnfidelity is not funny, Claire.
lt's tragic. All betrayal is tragic.

366
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,697
l was 21 when we first met.

367
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:26,734
The radio was playing
l Wear My Sunglasses at Night.

368
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,806
Such an insipid song.

369
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:35,314
But now, it always makes my heart feel...

370
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,441
squished.

371
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:45,049
-She's beautiful.
-Yeah.

372
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,585
She's the best fucking thing
that ever happened to me.

373
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,800
So, what's going on with you?

374
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:02,196
l went to Santa Fe for a while.
l was in Austin, Texas.

375
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:05,368
A couple of weeks in Tahoe,
but l just really hated it.

376
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:07,374
What were you doing there?

377
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:11,046
Just trying to find a place
that would make me feel better.

378
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:18,981
-Are you still living in Venice?
-l'm staying at my mom's right now.

379
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:21,690
And how's that?

380
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:26,094
lt's the hardest thing
l've ever done in my life.

381
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:32,662
Okay. Bad news, your car didn't pass.
l can fix it. But l'll need about half an hour.

382
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:33,933
All right.

383
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,776
That totally fucks up my whole afternoon.

384
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:42,211
You know, l saw a place up the street,
we could get a drink.

385
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:48,117
So, what's your life like?
Being married, being a father?

386
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,519
lt's great.

387
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,954
-lt's really great.
-l'm glad.

388
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,430
You so deserve to be happy,
after everything you've been through.

389
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,331
l mean, it's hard sometimes.

390
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,135
-You know, relationships aren't easy.
-Really?

391
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:15,144
You just have to work at it every day.

392
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:20,179
You can't expect everything
to be perfect all the time...

393
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,320
and you can't get shaken when it isn't.

394
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:27,126
lf there's a moment
when l feel like l'm in prison...

395
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,787
l just have to think about
all those moments when it feels safe.

396
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,962
And remind myself that those moments
outweigh the prison moments.

397
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:40,000
Being alone is the prison.
Just thinking about yourself.

398
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:43,873
Just being trapped in this fucking vortex
of always watching yourself.

399
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,806
Which l suppose is okay
if you're interesting.

400
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:50,981
The truth is, nobody's that interesting.

401
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:57,086
God, listen to me.
Let's just talk about movies or something.

402
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,989
Sorry, l haven't even seen a movie
in like a year.

403
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,157
-Anything else?
-No.

404
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,360
Just the check.

405
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:11,360
Fuck.

406
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,271
So, Bren, what's this
little catching-up session all about?

407
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,305
l'm not sure.

408
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,108
Actually, l am sure.

409
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:28,877
This is so difficult.

410
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:34,523
l apologize...

411
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:37,920
for having sex with other people...

412
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,795
while being in a committed relationship
with you.

413
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,991
For not showing up to our shared reality...

414
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,004
by altering my consciousness
with various substances.

415
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:48,069
But you already apologized.

416
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,406
You're making amends.

417
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,981
l hate that word.

418
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,910
-Still doing the whole 12-step thing?
-l'm doing a lot of different things.

419
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,423
My life is...

420
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:07,421
complicated right now.

421
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,857
Yeah, well, whose isn't?

422
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,360
No, let me.

423
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:17,827
Thanks.

424
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:25,340
l don't even know if she's alive now.

425
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:29,608
All l know is that before l met Astra...

426
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,740
l was consumed
by this passion to create...

427
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,820
a passion l seem to have lost.

428
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,854
l was never really in love with her,
you know?

429
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,297
Of course you were.

430
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:49,529
You ripped a jasmine bush out of
the ground for her and put it in her car.

431
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:54,034
No. l had just had my first real success...

432
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:57,076
and all eyes were on me,
what was l going to do next?

433
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,139
l was a coward.
l focused on another person.

434
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,943
l could have been great.

435
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:07,917
And so can you.

436
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:12,091
lf you get lonely, have sex.

437
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,552
But if you meet somebody who you think
means something to you, you're doomed.

438
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:50,425
Car 438, do you receive me?

439
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:57,197
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Alarm going off at 5636 Fremont Place.

440
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,525
Got it, l'm on my way.

441
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:41,969
You're a little late.

442
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,774
lnsider job.
Must've known the owners were away.

443
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:48,111
Went for the jewelry upstairs
and the cashbox in the library.

444
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,673
Real neat and clean.

445
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:57,717
You boys sure you're going to be okay
closing up by yourselves?

446
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:59,784
Yeah. l think we can handle it.

447
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:04,493
Fucking cops.

448
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,465
Think they're such hot shit.

449
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:12,902
-Dion Corelli.
-Keith Charles.

450
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:16,208
You were hoping for some action, right?

451
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,980
-Yeah, l guess so.
-l know that feeling.

452
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:23,180
How about l buy you a drink?

453
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:40,125
-Are you sure that's comfortable?
-l don't know when l got so clumsy.

454
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,026
l never used to be this way.

455
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,394
-l think it's too tight.
-No, it's fine, really.

456
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:49,129
lt was so strange.

457
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:53,140
l put my finger right on that nail
when l heard you coming up the stairs.

458
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,369
l mean,
l'd seen it sticking out of the wall....

459
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,503
Why didn't you tell me about it?
l would have fixed it.

460
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:01,104
lt was almost like somebody pushed me.

461
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:05,453
Like some kind of invisible person
wanted to hurt me.

462
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:11,017
And earlier in the day, l twisted my ankle
coming down the stairs.

463
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,756
l was looking for you, for something.
lt was around 4:00.

464
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,890
-l couldn't find you anywhere.
-l went out for a drink.

465
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,529
With Brenda.

466
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,664
Why?

467
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:31,143
She just showed up, l was running
some errands, she came along.

468
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:33,113
Getting a drink is an errand?

469
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:40,720
What did she want?

470
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:45,350
To apologize for being such a crazy bitch
when we were together.

471
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,767
Actually, it was pretty decent of her.

472
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:57,271
What? Lisa, it was just one beer.

473
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:00,968
Yeah, l really don't appreciate
finding out about it after the fact.

474
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,205
lt's no big deal, but next time,
if something like this happens...

475
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,803
tell me first before you go do it.

476
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,905
What am l supposed to do,
come ask permission?

477
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:10,816
No, but you could have said,
''l want you to meet my wife''...

478
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:15,049
then introduced me, and said you're
gonna go catch up with an old girlfriend.

479
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,284
You're right.

480
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,125
l'm sorry.

481
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:32,264
Relax, guy, the owners are in Antigua.
They're not going to mind.

482
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:36,774
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Come on, you deserve it.

483
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,979
lt's not like we're going to get caught.

484
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:42,881
We're the only ones who would catch us.

485
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,617
-This is some place.
-Yeah.

486
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:57,163
l bet the people who live here
don't even appreciate it.

487
00:39:57,232 --> 00:39:58,699
Probably not.

488
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:03,729
-No one appreciates what they have.
-Especially the ones who have more of it.

489
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,664
Fucking rich people.

490
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,207
What can you do?

491
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,836
Don't you ever just want to....

492
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:20,254
That felt so good.

493
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:38,337
-What the hell are you doing, man?
-Let's fuck this place up.

494
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,065
Come on, those idiot cops
didn't even check in here.

495
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:43,110
We'll go to town
and say the robbers did it.

496
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:47,706
Let's just break some shit.
Teach those greedy rich fuckers a lesson.

497
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:51,308
-You're crazy.
-Come on, guy, you know you want to.

498
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,056
Cut it out.

499
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,032
Jesus.

500
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,786
You did a great job tonight, David.

501
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:32,691
-You were amazing.
-Dennis, can l borrow you for five seconds?

502
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:37,429
This is the part where Patrick makes me
go over every syllable he sang...

503
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:40,559
describing why
each was so unique and wonderful.

504
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:00,987
Hey, Terry.

505
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:04,584
-Where's your boyfriend?
-He had to work.

506
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:07,459
Okay, it was me.

507
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:12,326
-ln the Sears bathroom, you know?
-Honey, l know it was you.

508
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:15,328
l never forget a face.

509
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:17,234
God, it feels so good just to say it.

510
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:19,773
l don't know why
l wouldn't just admit it yesterday.

511
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:23,038
-lt just seemed so--
-Sleazy, repressed, not that pretty?

512
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,170
Yeah, something like that.

513
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:29,682
That time for me was so difficult.

514
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:33,185
l mean, really difficult.

515
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,825
l tried so hard to compartmentalize
that part of my life, but you can't.

516
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:41,555
Sweetie, you don't need
to explain it to me.

517
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:47,529
l don't know why things should have to be
so hard for people.

518
00:42:47,602 --> 00:42:49,900
l guess because we make them that way.

519
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:55,039
So, you ever jerk off
anyone else in the chorus?

520
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,633
Of course not.

521
00:42:58,046 --> 00:42:59,070
You?

522
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:01,510
A couple.

523
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,079
-So, if l let you up, no more crazy stuff?
-No, sir.

524
00:43:18,466 --> 00:43:20,491
Holy shit, man.

525
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:25,630
You didn't have to play so hard.

526
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,870
l was just blowing off a little steam.

527
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:33,674
Get your things and get out of here.

528
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,042
You ever a cop?

529
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,315
No.

530
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,356
Whatever you are,
you got a lot of shit to deal with.

531
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:26,661
l could always talk to Will
because he was my best buddy.

532
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,029
So my wife said,
''Why don't you pretend that he's here?

533
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:32,604
''What would you tell him?''

534
00:44:32,674 --> 00:44:35,404
So l thought,
''What the hell, l'll give it a try.''

535
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:40,237
So, l say, God damn you, Will,
l'm mad at you.

536
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:43,481
You're not getting bald
and befuddled and flabby...

537
00:44:43,551 --> 00:44:46,076
like the rest of us old, tired married folk.

538
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:51,915
You had the right idea, though.
Cut out while you were in your prime.

539
00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:55,722
Hangover.

540
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:58,490
What trouble did you boys
get into last night?

541
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:00,090
None, Keith had to work.

542
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:03,228
-l had a concert.
-You did? Why didn't you tell anyone?

543
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,266
Next time.

544
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:09,476
-l'm gonna go lie down for a few minutes.
-All right.

545
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:15,510
You're glad that you're not like us,
tied to the old ball and chain.

546
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:19,611
Unable to do whatever we want
when we want, like you always did.

547
00:45:57,492 --> 00:46:01,155
Why do you look so sad?
l won't be gone forever.

548
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:04,256
l'll be back from Montana
in a month or so...

549
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:07,764
as soon as l get Marcie out of jail
and into some sort of counseling.

550
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:10,497
Which l'm sure she'll resist, always does.

551
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,340
Does your daughter
have these episodes often?

552
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:16,309
Pretty often. She's a real nut job.

553
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:19,979
But what can l do?
l'm her mom. She really needs me.

554
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:26,013
God, kids are such a drain.
They really suck you dry if you let them.

555
00:46:26,354 --> 00:46:30,757
-My kids don't need me, not at all.
-Thank your fucking lucky stars.

556
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:33,826
So, where's that coffee you promised me?

557
00:46:35,763 --> 00:46:37,890
Can you wait seven minutes?

558
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:40,065
Not really.

559
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:51,301
-Bettina, this isn't right, get up.
-No.

560
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,877
-l love spying.
-Well, l don't.

561
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:01,751
Sure you do, everyone does.
We're all voyeurs at heart.

562
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,351
We're all just dying to see everybody
else's fucked up weird private shit.

563
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:18,298
l'm going to miss you so much.

564
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:21,775
l've had so much fun with you.

565
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:26,010
l would never crouch here
and spy on Arthur with anyone else.

566
00:47:26,347 --> 00:47:29,578
Doll, you gotta learn
how to make your own fun.

567
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,712
He's not exactly what
l would call eye candy.

568
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,324
''l think l just swallowed my tongue.''

569
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:52,866
And l know that everything that happens,
happens for a reason.

570
00:47:54,075 --> 00:47:57,306
l only wish
that Will could have known his son, Tom.

571
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:02,614
-There's so much he could've taught him.
-That's a load of bullshit.

572
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,574
Of course, Will wasn't much....

573
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:06,517
You met my kid, he turned out fine.

574
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:09,112
He didn't need a fuck-up like me
to stick around.

575
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,385
Me driving off the side of the road
that night...

576
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:13,359
was the best thing for everybody involved.

577
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:16,021
Seriously, Diane and l,
we had a shit relationship...

578
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:18,657
which totally would have screwed up
that kid.

579
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,594
Just like you and Lisa
are gonna screw up Maya.

580
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:22,693
Fuck you.

581
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,933
You just want to stay in this
to prove what a good guy you can be.

582
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:29,966
-Not because you love Lisa.
-This isn't just about me, you fucking idiot.

583
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:32,035
There are other lives at stake.

584
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:35,771
Don't give me that shit.
You are so fucking trapped.

585
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:39,749
Who isn't?

586
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:43,422
The only way not to be trapped
is to not have anything.

587
00:48:43,491 --> 00:48:45,118
You look me in the eye and tell me...

588
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:47,957
that sometimes
you don't want to get in your car...

589
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:51,624
and just start driving, and never look back.

590
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:55,096
Come on.

591
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,569
l dare you.

592
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:04,706
But, of course,
he did manage to pull off one big trick.

593
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:07,345
He made himself disappear for 25 years.

594
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:18,317
Hi, l've been calling your name.
You didn't hear me?

595
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:23,193
-No, sorry, l was totally in my head.
-Did you get my message from last night?

596
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:25,357
No, l got in really late.

597
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:28,059
lt's okay, it's about my brother's wedding.

598
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,534
Get this, there's a rehearsal dinner.

599
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:38,508
Russell, maybe it's not such a good idea
for us to, you know, date.

600
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:43,380
lt's so weird that you say that.

601
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,319
lt's so weird that you say that,
because l was thinking the same thing.

602
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:52,619
And l didn't want to say it
because l thought l'd sound crazy...

603
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:55,184
being the one
who started this whole thing.

604
00:49:56,898 --> 00:50:00,299
So, you're okay,
just like staying the way we are?

605
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:01,627
Totally.

606
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:08,200
-Yes.
-Great.

607
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,908
l have to give this stuff to Olivier.

608
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:52,375
l'm sorry. Did l read the chart wrong?
l thought you initialed the late lunch.

609
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:55,547
l did, l just got hungry. ls that okay?

610
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,155
Of course.

611
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,525
l'm glad to have the company.

612
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,322
Would you like a little frittata?

613
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,623
l would love a little frittata.

614
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:22,813
l was just fooling around.
l never dreamed it would actually work.

615
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,783
They work, they definitely work.

616
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,687
l feel so terrible.

617
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,257
-And it wasn't even my cheese.
-That's okay.

618
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:39,956
On the other hand, they have germs.
They really do deserve to die.

619
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:50,643
-Are you just waking up?
-l was up, then l went back to sleep again.

620
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:56,314
-Why are you home for lunch?
-l wanted to see you.

621
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,775
l thought you'd be home
before me last night.

622
00:51:58,853 --> 00:52:01,822
l waited up for a while,
but l must've fallen asleep.

623
00:52:01,922 --> 00:52:04,083
-What time did you get in?
-Late.

624
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:07,321
l thought your shift ended at 1 1 :00.

625
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:09,620
lt did.

626
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:16,134
l just drove around.
l needed some time to think about things.

627
00:52:16,704 --> 00:52:17,762
Like what?

628
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,434
This job was supposed to be temporary
but it's really starting not to feel that way.

629
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:29,538
Last night l realized l needed to
make a move and do something different.

630
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:31,981
What made you realize that?

631
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,987
lt's just time.

632
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,984
How was your concert?

633
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:47,197
lt was great.
l really wish you could've been there.

634
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:50,430
But l totally understand
that you couldn't be.

635
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:55,450
English
