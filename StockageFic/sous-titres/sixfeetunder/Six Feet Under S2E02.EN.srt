1
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:50,649
100 yards, 10 times.

2
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:53,452
80 yards times eight. 60 by six.

3
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:57,043
40 by four. 20 by two.
All in under 14 minutes.

4
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,328
You know the drill.
Let's toe the line, gentlemen!

5
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:03,804
-I got to make this cut. I'm on scholarship.
-Look, just don't stop running for nothing.

6
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:06,805
Stay with me, you'll be
on that starting line opening the game.

7
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:09,401
-Do you want to play football?
-Yes, sir!

8
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,291
-I said, do you want to play football?
-Yes, sir!

9
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,772
I can't hear you!

10
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,366
-Yes, sir!
-Set!

11
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,931
Good, good!

12
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:24,883
Jesus Christ, pick it up!

13
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,687
Run, you sorry pieces of shit!

14
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:32,568
Run! Don't you understand?

15
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,725
-How you doing, rookie?
-Just worry about your own self.

16
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,689
Touch that line, god damn it!

17
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,891
Make it work, you guys!

18
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:54,330
-This is me beating you.
-You can blow me, faggot!

19
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,767
Man down. We got a player down.

20
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,210
Way to fight through it, Sam.

21
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,166
Okay, he's breathing. Let's get out of here.

22
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,086
Just breathe, Sam.

23
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,322
Fuck.

24
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,531
Give a hand for Sam, everybody.

25
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:43,810
This is the spirit
of a real football player here.

26
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,368
Each of this year's National Book Award
winners took home $10,000.

27
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,604
Rick Karr, NPR News, New York.

28
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,368
Do you think caviar is too pretentious?

29
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,008
Well, with the foie gras
and the smoked salmon...

30
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:05,085
it might seem like
you're trying too hard to impress him.

31
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:06,242
Fuck.

32
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,370
I do want to impress him without it looking
like I could give a shit, which I don't.

33
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,201
So why do you want to impress him?

34
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,012
I don't know.

35
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,923
Because Trevor was
a big part of my life once.

36
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,330
Because his wife won
a National Book Award.

37
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:23,881
Because I have nothing else
to obsess about.

38
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,770
Well, you have me.

39
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:29,521
You, I take totally for granted,
don't you know that?

40
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:32,764
-I'm so glad you're feeling better.
-Yeah, you and me both, bucko.

41
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,491
That's the thing about depression.

42
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:38,532
If you allow yourself to feel it,
it gets very boring very fast.

43
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,849
You're not jealous, are you?

44
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,532
Of Trevor?

45
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,170
-Should I be?
-No. Of course not.

46
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,531
So what if he's the man whose masterly
touch ushered me into womanhood?

47
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,606
The one I ultimately compare
all other men to.

48
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:00,483
Okay. But just so you know,
you'll only have yourself to blame...

49
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:04,202
when I go all alpha dog and beat him
to a pulp in front of his wife and kid.

50
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,412
My hero.

51
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,084
I'm gonna kick his ass.

52
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,531
Fucking Trevor.

53
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,889
Good morning, Mrs. Huntley.

54
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,163
Looks like another scorcher.

55
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:34,207
Where are my new acquisitions, Mr. Gilardi?

56
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,567
I'm on it.

57
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,692
What you're on is my shitlist, cowboy.

58
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,004
I made you personally responsible
for finding three homes...

59
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,811
that we could dump at a profit.

60
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,612
And what do I get from you? Diddlysquat.

61
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,892
I already closed McKenzie Brothers
and Dayle Montgomery.

62
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,168
Three new homes, Mr. Gilardi.

63
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:55,407
Apparently, I misjudged your capabilities.

64
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,163
What about Fisher & Sons?
You've been after them for months now.

65
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:01,892
Well, they're more resilient than I expected.

66
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:06,206
Jeez Louise, Matt!
Play like you've got a big dick.

67
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:09,763
-Can you get them for me or not?
-You said I had till the end of the year.

68
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,846
Well, Christmas came early. You're fired.

69
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:14,882
What?

70
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:18,642
Your presence is no longer required.
You're hereby rendered irrelevant.

71
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,611
You can't be serious. Mitzi!

72
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,609
I can do this, I swear.
Now just give me another chance.

73
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:31,768
You know, just because I fucked you,
that doesn't put us on a first-name basis.

74
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,604
Well, you're dressed early.

75
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:45,812
We have an intake at 9:30. Josh Langmead.

76
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,606
Am I supposed to know who that is?

77
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:51,208
-Don't you watch the news?
-Not if I can help it. It's too depressing.

78
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,922
Josh Langmead is the Cal State
football player who died of heatstroke.

79
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:58,921
21 years old, in perfect health.
Till his brain fried.

80
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,448
Fuck.

81
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,809
Well, I'm off to Torrance.

82
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,522
I have a breakfast meeting
with the Living Splendor sales rep.

83
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,008
Wait a minute. That means...

84
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:15,722
Now you're a licensed funeral director,
we can do twice as much work.

85
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,964
Just do me a favor.
Don't even mention the word "cremation. "

86
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:22,409
Okay. Can I mention
the word "condescending"?

87
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,290
I'll be back by noon.

88
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:40,131
We thought Josh would want
to be wearing his number for the viewing.

89
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,085
Well, of course.

90
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,843
I took him to his first Rams game
when he was three.

91
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:58,088
It wasn't long after that
he started in Pop Warner Football.

92
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,727
He had NFL sheets...

93
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,767
curtains, pajamas.

94
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:14,370
Five Halloweens in a row,
he went as Bo Jackson.

95
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:21,808
It was his dream to play pro.

96
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,971
I bet he could have, too.

97
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:29,287
I think he was good enough.
He was certainly motivated enough.

98
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,971
Did you ever play ball?

99
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,604
Football? No, no way.

100
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:42,488
Dad wouldn't let me. He said it was too....
I did play a little baseball in high school.

101
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:51,166
Have you made a decision about a casket?

102
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,924
We'd like the Titan Four.

103
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,926
-How much is that?
-$9,200.

104
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,248
What the hell? It's only money.

105
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,490
Well, granted, 1,400 square feet
is a bit cozy...

106
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:18,327
but the layout is so ergonomic
that it feels twice as large.

107
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,252
Honey, it's got a sunroom.

108
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:27,610
-That girl's got to get a better poker face.
-Yeah, too late.

109
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,491
It's very good that you brought
your own inspector.

110
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:33,645
No, he's my cousin. He's in construction.

111
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,248
-So what's with the foundation?
-Nothing. Perfect shape.

112
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:43,405
Well, part of it was rebuilt two years ago
to the tune of $20,000.

113
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:46,724
So it's better than new now. Excuse me.

114
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,726
What do you think, man?

115
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,691
I'm not living in it. I've got a house.
What do you think?

116
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:56,003
I don't know. Vanessa likes it.

117
00:09:56,093 --> 00:10:00,371
Vanessa likes dragging you around
by your crank, too, is what I think.

118
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,688
You're talking about my wife, man.

119
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,049
Vanessa and me are tight, man.
You know that. It's not about her.

120
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:09,091
I'm just breaking it down
the way the guys have been telling me.

121
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:13,246
You've been acting like a candy-ass bitch
ever since you got married.

122
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,086
-Screw you, Ramon!
-Screw me all you want.

123
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,085
You know I'm right.

124
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:21,364
What are all these people doing
in our new house?

125
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:25,728
-Baby, do you really like the house?
-Yes!

126
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:30,001
Rico, the house is good.

127
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,172
It's got some little problems,
but nothing I can't fix.

128
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:36,165
There's a yard for the boys.
They'll be able to walk to school.

129
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,732
You're closer to work.

130
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,407
Ramon, can we use your truck to move?

131
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:26,408
Nate Fisher.

132
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,371
Hi there, Nate.
This is Sheri from Appleby Caskets.

133
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:33,526
We received your fax order. I'm sorry,
the Titan Four is no longer in production.

134
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,012
You've got to be shitting me.

135
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,927
You must not have our 2002 catalog.

136
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,767
-I can pop it in the mail if...
-What's the closest casket to the Titan?

137
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,332
Probably our Haven Two.

138
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,405
$4,100 wholesale.
Usually retails for about $11,600.

139
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,609
Son of a motherfuck!

140
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,052
-Sir....
-All right, I'll have to get back to you.

141
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,767
I swear, I fucking hate public school.

142
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,287
This year-round shit? Fuck.

143
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,970
Well, B-track gets October off,
and six weeks in the spring.

144
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,486
What do you want?

145
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:19,407
This Persian girl who was my best
friend at Archer, till I fucked her brother...

146
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,405
she's spending the entire summer in France.

147
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:26,208
Where the fuck is Gabe? He was supposed
to meet us here 10 minutes ago.

148
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,486
Dink, it's gonna be all right, man.
Everything is chill.

149
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:34,965
It's not chill. The cops have that
fucking video in every school in LA!

150
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:39,651
Which means they haven't ID'd us yet, okay?

151
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:44,204
So they probably can't ID us, and anyone
who could will keep quiet if they're smart.

152
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:46,488
You'd better fucking hope so.

153
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:50,005
Did you fucking.... Did you tell somebody?

154
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:53,170
Because if you did, I will kill your bitch-ass.
Do you hear me?

155
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,403
-No, asshole!
-What about Andy?

156
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:59,042
How am I supposed to know?
He's your fucking best friend!

157
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,728
What?

158
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:08,928
You were supposed to meet us
10 minutes ago. We're waiting.

159
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,693
Jesus, Claire, don't pussy whip him.

160
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:15,322
You got to act like you don't care.
Guys hate it when you're all over them.

161
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:19,326
Like you've ever stuck around
long enough to find out, wonder slut.

162
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:22,691
What, squirrel nut?

163
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,809
-Your soul's on fire.
-I know.

164
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,850
Your souls are on fire.

165
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:35,008
You're not on the list of people
who get to touch my tits.

166
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:42,052
Andy, what is wrong?

167
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:48,526
Get them off me!

168
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,524
This is so fucked up.

169
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:53,841
Oh, God!

170
00:13:56,573 --> 00:14:00,168
Andy, say something to me.
I don't know what to do right now!

171
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,687
Andy! Oh, my God!

172
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,650
Andy, look at me.

173
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:08,046
-Go get the nurse. Go!
-Did he take something?

174
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:12,568
You stop it, you fucking bitch,
or I will kick the shit out of you.

175
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,166
Do you hear me?

176
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,842
What the fuck are you looking at?

177
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,491
I told you last week the Titan series
was out of production.

178
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:23,690
I think that you should have torn the page
out of the catalog.

179
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:27,083
It was a mistake. We'll give them
the Haven Two for $11,000, instead.

180
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,245
-They're paying more than they can afford.
-You don't know that.

181
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,052
I cannot tell you how much I hate it
when you patronize me.

182
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,887
I'm being understanding. You want
patronizing? I'll give you patronizing.

183
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:38,042
Hey, guys.

184
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,522
Hey, Rico. Langmead's in the reefer.

185
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,844
-Yeah. You guys got a moment?
-Yeah. What's up?

186
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,131
-Vanessa and I found a house.
-Rico, that's great!

187
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,488
Yeah, we really like the house.

188
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:56,169
And we can swing the monthly payments
if we put down 20%%.

189
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,731
What are we talking about?

190
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:03,327
Well, we pieced most of it together.

191
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,570
But we're about $11,000 short.

192
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,649
-$11,000?
-Yup.

193
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,012
By tomorrow.

194
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:16,726
Look, we'll pay you back over 18 months,
at 7%% interest.

195
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:20,892
Now, that's a lot better than the bank,
and not too far off the market.

196
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,128
We'll let you know by tomorrow.

197
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,447
Thanks.

198
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,730
But right now,
Mr. Langmead needs your attention.

199
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,652
I'm on it.

200
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:39,009
See, I am understanding.

201
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:46,005
That's a lovely arrangement. What is it?

202
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,132
Scalene vase.

203
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:52,243
Didn't they teach you anything
at Daffodil University?

204
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:02,042
Actually, it's a combination
of inverted T and scalene.

205
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,211
It's my new design.

206
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:10,564
-And it's yours.
-No.

207
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:13,329
I just wanted to learn how to make one.

208
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:16,371
It's a gift from my heart. Seriously.

209
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,729
Thank you so much, Robbie.

210
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,212
Okay, Ruth...

211
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:30,891
this is going to be hard for me to say...

212
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,886
but I forgive you.

213
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,282
Forgive me? For what?

214
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:42,683
You destroyed
the natural order of the universe, cupcake.

215
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,762
Everything was perfectly quiet
and boring around here before you came.

216
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,208
And now Nikolai's all aflutter...

217
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:52,569
wanting to make improvements.
I'm expected to work.

218
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,606
For his own carnal reasons,
he favors you over me.

219
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:58,730
And for that, I forgive you.

220
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,732
I resent that.

221
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:05,283
I've always conducted myself
with complete professionalism.

222
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:08,524
Whatever, Ruth, I forgive you.

223
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,523
I don't need your forgiveness.

224
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:16,723
Oh, no. God damn it!
It's not supposed to go this way.

225
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,047
What isn't?

226
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,211
I'm graduating from The Plan tomorrow...

227
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,490
and I would really like it
if you would be my witness.

228
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,484
The Plan? What is The Plan?

229
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,450
It's a multi-disciplined course...

230
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,650
that allows you to think
way beyond yourself...

231
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:38,487
and rebuild your life from the ground floor,
plank by plank.

232
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,405
That sounds awful.

233
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:44,044
It teaches you how to feel really good
about yourself...

234
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,522
and get what you want out of life.

235
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,325
Do you want to go?

236
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:53,645
It would really mean a lot to me, Ruth.

237
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,602
Wow!

238
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,645
Pretty sweet, huh?

239
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:18,365
Each portal is lit by recessed halogens.

240
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:22,567
Tasteful signage for the model name,
materials, and pricing.

241
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,849
And this little drawer here?

242
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,931
This displays
your interior upholstery fabric.

243
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:31,164
Point of purchase does not get
any better than this, my friends.

244
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:32,891
It's very impressive.

245
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,009
Impressive? It's fucking gorgeous!

246
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,971
It's a completely interactive
retail experience.

247
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:42,410
'Cause human beings, we're tactile.
We like to touch the fruit before we buy.

248
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:46,042
I can't believe you guys.
You're still using a catalog.

249
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,169
Now, these caskets here...

250
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,813
that are on the upper level,
they appeal to men.

251
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:54,329
It's at their average height.
Down below are the ladies' favorites.

252
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,608
I have seen the future and this is it.

253
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:59,810
-Dave, where would it go?
-We put it in the second viewing room.

254
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:02,646
The one we use for storage?
It needs serious work.

255
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,803
So? We use this as a reason to do it!

256
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,249
Haven't we been planning to do that
with the money Mom gave us, anyway?

257
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,847
Dave, that money is almost all gone.

258
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,731
A 2 by 5 like this will not break your back.

259
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,525
$21,500.

260
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,529
I'll tell you what. $20,000, even.
That includes installation.

261
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,650
I'll even throw in a fresh coat of paint
for your room.

262
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,325
You can't beat that with a stick.

263
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,291
Nate, you always say
we have to spend money to make money.

264
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,931
All right, how long to install?

265
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:35,562
Give me the word,
and you'll be making sales in two days.

266
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:39,647
-Do you really like it?
-Who wouldn't?

267
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:42,651
I've never seen David happier.

268
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,531
It was like Christmas morning
when we were kids.

269
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:55,123
Working out a little aggression there?

270
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:58,922
We're having chicken piccata.
Have to marinate it overnight.

271
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:02,369
You never cook like this for me.
You never even cook.

272
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:07,282
And when Trevor goes back to New Haven,
I need you to forget that I can.

273
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,568
All right. What should I wear?

274
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,762
Speedo, hair extensions.
Wear what you want. I don't care.

275
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,408
Don't wear one of your funeral suits.

276
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:18,688
Oh, I thought you don't care.

277
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,488
Wear something that makes you look...

278
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:24,531
like the sexy bad boy you really are.

279
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:29,850
Something that makes Mr. Wife-and-kids
question all of his middle-class choices.

280
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,766
I'm all for that,
if you wear something low-cut in the back...

281
00:20:32,853 --> 00:20:35,651
so he can see my name
branded on your ass!

282
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,287
Hello?

283
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,370
New casket wall?

284
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,571
You boys are doing better than I thought.

285
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,965
-I'm Mitzi Dalton Huntley.
-David Fisher.

286
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,003
Do you need to plan a funeral?

287
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:43,127
You have no idea who I am, do you?

288
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:48,525
I'm Southwest Regional Director
for Kroehner Services International.

289
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,088
I was hoping that maybe you
and your brother...

290
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,687
might share a cup of coffee with me.

291
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:06,004
Well, hello! Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

292
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,690
You're a runner?

293
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,604
It's bad for your knees.

294
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:19,208
-Well, everything's bad for something.
-So I hear.

295
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,651
Why are you here?

296
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:25,725
I made it clear to Matt Gilardi
we're not interested in selling.

297
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,532
Matt Gilardi is no longer with Kroehner.

298
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,529
Yup, I fired his worthless ass...

299
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:34,889
because I didn't like the way
that he was representing our company.

300
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,043
And that is why I'm here today.

301
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,647
To do a little damage control...

302
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,689
and apologize to you boys.

303
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:44,008
Right.

304
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:48,564
I don't blame you for not trusting me.
Frankly, I'd be worried about you if you did.

305
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,486
-Cream with three sugars.
-Thank you.

306
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:56,131
-You didn't put rat poison in here, did you?
-Drink it and find out.

307
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:03,609
Oh, please! You boys aren't afraid
of Big Bad Mitzi, are you?

308
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,290
Come on. The economy is in a tailspin.

309
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,884
Corporations are downsizing, and resizing...

310
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,328
and reorganizing, including Kroehner.

311
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:17,564
We can't afford to take you over.
We've got problems of our own.

312
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:21,487
-Okay, let's just cut the foreplay.
-But that's the best part.

313
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:25,407
It's not that we don't trust you.
We despise everything you stand for:

314
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:29,327
Corporate profits over personal service,
stockholders over clients.

315
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,045
Greed over everything else.

316
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:35,365
I think you should take your gesture
of good faith and shove it up your ass!

317
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:40,725
Well, that's one opinion.
Anything that you would care to add, David?

318
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:44,649
No, I think Nate pretty much summed
our position up.

319
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,050
Well, all righty then.

320
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,489
I'll just show myself out.

321
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:58,722
By the way, you might want to
clean out your coffeemaker.

322
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,485
Your coffee sucks.

323
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,365
This is not so good.

324
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:08,489
Who the fuck is named Mitzi, anyway?

325
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:12,009
That sounds like something
you name a fucking Chihuahua.

326
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,890
Pretty bitching, huh?

327
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:27,089
When did you start getting a pup tent
over caskets?

328
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,609
-You're turning into David.
-Don't ever say that again.

329
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,686
Very nice.

330
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:36,364
Welcome to Casketeria.
May I take your order?

331
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:41,483
So, Mr. Langmead is all ready to go.

332
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,042
Great.

333
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:49,205
So, Nate, have you guys had a chance
to think about what we.... You know.

334
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:53,653
-Yeah, let's go into the office.
-Okay.

335
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:03,089
So do these really open?
Can you hide shit in here?

336
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,970
Can you close the door?

337
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,452
"Close the door" doesn't sound too good.

338
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:18,371
We can't give you a loan right now, Rico.

339
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:22,170
Look, we just spent a fortune
on the new casket wall.

340
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,289
We got to maintain an emergency fund...

341
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:28,366
in case Kroehner starts acting up again,
which suddenly looks very likely.

342
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:31,842
It was a tough choice. I'm sorry.

343
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,487
How much did that casket wall cost?

344
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,848
Our first priority is keeping this house open.

345
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,810
The more we make, the more you make.

346
00:25:42,893 --> 00:25:47,569
Tell me one thing. Did you and David decide
to buy that wall before or after we spoke?

347
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:57,005
First you won't make me a partner,
now you won't even...

348
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,846
I've had it with you moping
about not being a partner.

349
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,051
It's not happening, all right?
I wish I could help you, but I can't.

350
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:08,524
I mean, fuck, we're your employer!
We're not a goddamn savings and loan!

351
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,245
I'm sorry, Rico.

352
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,564
If it were my money,
I'd give you all of it, you know that.

353
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,806
Yeah, I'll pass it along to my kids.

354
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:31,610
They have to play in a parking lot
next to a dumpster.

355
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:40,568
Fuck.

356
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:06,526
I'm scared.

357
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:13,046
-What's gonna happen to me now?
-Well, that's not my problem, pal.

358
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:21,208
What?

359
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,843
I was so young. Why me?

360
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:28,324
Why the fuck not you?
What did you think, you were immune?

361
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,770
Everybody dies. Everybody!
What makes you so fucking special?

362
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:48,925
What do you think?

363
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:52,801
-I'm not signing up for anything.
-I'm not selling anything.

364
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,323
I'm a visitor, just like you.

365
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,410
Do you know how you can tell?

366
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:02,042
-The Elevated wear plastic tags.
-The Elevated?

367
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,964
You'll learn the lingo.

368
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:07,443
My daughter is graduating today. You?

369
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,407
My business associate is graduating.

370
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:15,046
-So what exactly is this?
-I don't know for sure myself.

371
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:18,293
But Sheila has never been happier.

372
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,286
So I wanted to see what it was all about.

373
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:23,245
Let's get started.

374
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:27,248
Today just might be
the most important day of your lives.

375
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,245
Come sit with me.
There's safety in numbers.

376
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:35,328
You cannot design a life that works...

377
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,246
without first drafting a clear blueprint.

378
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,049
And you cannot construct a life
that has meaning...

379
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:45,171
without first laying a solid foundation.

380
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,730
You are the architect of your life.

381
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,172
Not your emotionally distant father...

382
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:54,687
not your overly critical mother...

383
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:58,086
not your petty, fair-weather friends.

384
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,008
You.

385
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:12,964
It was hard
the first time I stood up for myself.

386
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:17,367
I always wanted everybody to like me.

387
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,210
Even though I hated myself,
you had to like me.

388
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:24,208
When I rebuilt my foundation...

389
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:28,932
and I was able to honor
and elevate the better part of me...

390
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:31,767
I realized I really like me.

391
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:35,210
So you don't have to.

392
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:41,924
I'm not a salvage job...

393
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:45,127
I am not a teardown, I am not junk.

394
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,163
It's taken me many years to say that,
to believe it.

395
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:55,002
There are days that I slip,
and I treat people like shit.

396
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:59,925
Like I treated myself for the last 30 years.

397
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:03,806
But, damn it, I swear I'm going to win this.

398
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,767
I'm going to build the life...

399
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,443
that I always wanted to live.

400
00:30:13,693 --> 00:30:14,762
Okay.

401
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:22,243
I thought it was too late.

402
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:25,364
Two terrible marriages...

403
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:30,204
children who won't even
return my phone calls.

404
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:35,565
It hurts. I'm 41 and I feel like I'm 80.

405
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,571
But I have value.

406
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:41,845
I'm still here.

407
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:45,805
And as long as I believe in myself...

408
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,052
and speak fiercely from the "I"...

409
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:51,529
then there's still hope.

410
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:56,132
There's no mortgage on my life. I own it.

411
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,411
Thank you, Mom.

412
00:31:06,453 --> 00:31:07,852
Thank you.

413
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:34,206
That was humiliating.
As if my self-esteem wasn't low enough.

414
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:38,124
It's kind of funny.
All that time we were racquetball partners...

415
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,169
we actually never played racquetball.

416
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:44,132
I am serious about learning how to play.
Are you available Thursday afternoon?

417
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,931
I don't know. I'll check.

418
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:51,768
Want to drop by my niece's birthday party
later? Eddie's on call.

419
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:53,048
Sure.

420
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:57,012
I've got a couple of errands to run.
I'll call you later.

421
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:00,887
I've got nothing to do.
I'll just tag along, if that's okay.

422
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,882
Oh, my God. Did you hear?
Andy was doing fry.

423
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,888
-I'm sorry. In English?
-Fry, wet, illy.

424
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:13,643
You're telling me you've never heard of fry?

425
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:17,646
I'm sorry. My parole officer
frowns on controlled substances.

426
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,329
Okay. You take your standard
garden-variety doobie, right?

427
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:25,565
You dip it in embalming fluid,
cut it with God knows what, and bam!

428
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:28,810
All your states are altered and you see God.

429
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:34,331
Or you're in tweaker hell, bouncing off
lockers and swallowing your own tongue.

430
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,927
Embalming fluid? Are you kidding me?

431
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,807
I've smelled that shit. It's lethal.

432
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:43,091
-You ought to get out more, live a little.
-You've done this?

433
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:46,529
No. But if you ever wanted
to make a quick buck....

434
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:50,891
Fuck off, Parker. I am not getting
into the pot and embalming fluid business.

435
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:53,328
I've had enough run-ins with the police,
thank you.

436
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:57,406
At $50 a pop? You might change your mind.

437
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,246
-Oh, my God, that fucking asshole!
-Right?

438
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,245
Andy's gonna be in detox for a week.

439
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:16,207
-Look okay?
-It looks fine.

440
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:21,208
-Like a page out of Gourmet magazine.
-Excellent.

441
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,730
Did you know they put hairspray on food
before they photograph it?

442
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:28,567
-Really?
-I went out with a food stylist in Seattle.

443
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:33,810
They do stuff to food that is worse than
what we do to dead bodies, believe you me.

444
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:41,168
Okay.

445
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,890
-Tell me I look beautiful.
-You are beautiful.

446
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:50,407
Wow. You even mean that.

447
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,287
Okay.

448
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,682
-Will, at least say hello.
-Hello!

449
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:10,603
Wow, Bren, it's great to see you.

450
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,411
-Yeah.
-It really is.

451
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:15,087
Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.

452
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:20,243
-You must be Dawn.
-Hi, it's nice to meet you.

453
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,449
Thank you so much for letting us bring Will.

454
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:26,731
-Trevor really wanted you to meet him.
-I really wanted to meet him.

455
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,483
-Hi, Will.
-Will, can you say hi?

456
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,403
He'll crash in a little while, I promise.

457
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:36,449
-Hi, I'm Trevor.
-Nate.

458
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,132
-Pleasure.
-Hi, how are you?

459
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,771
-Come in.
-Thanks.

460
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:44,804
This is really cool.

461
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,523
-So, wine, anyone?
-I'd love a glass.

462
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,612
-You're driving.
-All right.

463
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,287
-I want wine!
-You do? Well, what do you say?

464
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:58,126
"I want wine, please. "

465
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:01,330
All right, Mr. Pooh Bear,
remember what we discussed in the car?

466
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:04,291
We're going to use
our very best manners tonight.

467
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,086
Say "please. "

468
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,406
So, how's the press tour going?

469
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:16,203
Oh, God, I feel like such a sell-out.
I did Politically Incorrect last night.

470
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:18,932
-Wow, was it fun?
-Hardly.

471
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:23,052
It was me, Kobe Bryant,
that emaciated chick from The Practice...

472
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:26,523
and some 12-year-old rap singer
that I've never even heard of.

473
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:30,850
I read your first book.
I thought it was brilliant.

474
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:34,243
Thank you. I can send you a copy
of the new one, if you'd like.

475
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,051
I would. Thank you.

476
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:39,047
You know, I read Charlotte Light and Dark.

477
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:41,570
Oh, dear. Why?

478
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:45,093
In grad school, I had this idiot professor...

479
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:49,689
who insisted that it was the perfect profile
of a classic borderline personality.

480
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,762
You've heard that before, right?

481
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:57,050
I actually went to the library,
and looked up the symptoms...

482
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,693
and started behaving like that
to fuck with them.

483
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:02,492
Seriously? That's brilliant.

484
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:06,449
-How old were you?
-I must have been 9 or 10.

485
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:10,528
-It was towards the end.
-Personally, I think it's a crock of shit.

486
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:13,685
Did you ever notice how the majority
of borderlines are women?

487
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,482
I see it as just a misogynistic attempt
to pathologize women...

488
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:20,292
who refuse to toe the patriarchal line.

489
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:25,925
Yeah, I spent six months in Seattle
on a teaching fellowship.

490
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,131
-Ever do any climbing there?
-Yeah, some bouldering.

491
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,568
No real climbing with ropes, but....

492
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,805
Were you a cragger?

493
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:37,165
Rank amateur urban kind, but I do love it.

494
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:40,611
-You done the U.W. climbing rock?
-That's where I learned.

495
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:43,810
I never knew 30 feet
was so high off the ground.

496
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:47,244
30 feet? That's nothing.
I've got a couple of buddies...

497
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,723
they're real thrill seekers.
I mean, they climb high.

498
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,889
But no way I can do that.

499
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:57,611
Got to think about
more than just myself now.

500
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,211
Bren looks great.

501
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:09,771
-How's she doing?
-She's doing great.

502
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:13,211
-Man, she is so fucking smart.
-Yes, she is.

503
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:16,444
She used to run circles around me,
I can tell you that.

504
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,605
Everybody expected
such great things from her.

505
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,005
How's her brother?

506
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:30,002
He's in the hospital right now.

507
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:45,723
I just wanted to get out of my head.

508
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:50,091
So I took 18 months of classes and
I went to the Shiatsu Institute thinking...

509
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:53,210
I'd do it until I figure out
what I really want to do.

510
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:55,648
And here we are, 10 years later.

511
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:58,288
-But you love what you do, right?
-I do.

512
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:02,332
That's the key. And you know what?
There is this girl in my health club.

513
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:06,406
She doesn't do shiatsu, but I swear,
she is gifted.

514
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,687
Gifted.

515
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:11,247
You know, there is a science to shiatsu.

516
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,245
Chinese medicine dates back
over 2,000 years.

517
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,644
This is delicious, Brenda.
You know, I never cook like this.

518
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,610
I can make pasta, but that's about it.

519
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:27,606
She's got me beat, though.
I can make toast and ice cubes.

520
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:32,052
-Nate does pretty good microwave popcorn.
-What do you do, Nate?

521
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:35,204
I'm a funeral director.

522
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,761
Really?

523
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,884
What makes one decide
to become a funeral director?

524
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,007
Well, I was born into it, actually.

525
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:54,123
Like being born into the Mafia.

526
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,811
Not so fast there, hotshot. It's a toll road.

527
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:32,332
Time out.

528
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:36,088
Sometimes he becomes completely irrational
just to get attention.

529
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:39,365
Sometimes I do that.

530
00:39:48,573 --> 00:39:52,282
-Uncle K.
-Hey, baby girl. Happy birthday.

531
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:54,122
I'm nine.

532
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:57,011
I guess that means
I can't call you "baby girl" anymore.

533
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:00,483
-You better not.
-This is my friend David.

534
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:03,083
-Hi there.
-Hi.

535
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:05,084
So where's the party?

536
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,169
You want some? It's good.

537
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:30,083
This is for you, sweetheart.

538
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,769
-I saw this in the store.
-I can't believe they still make these.

539
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,731
-I thought you'd like it.
-Thanks, Uncle K.

540
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:51,006
-Where's Mommy?
-In the bedroom, sleeping.

541
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:55,365
-I'm going to go and talk to her for a bit.
-Okay.

542
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:35,003
-Hi. Thought you wasn't coming till later.
-It is later.

543
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,726
What happened to Taylor's birthday party?

544
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:40,042
Shit.

545
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:44,251
I got home from work and was bone-tired.

546
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:47,650
I'll take her to a flea market
over the weekend, get her something.

547
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,850
That's all you did for her birthday?
Buy her an Entenmann's cake?

548
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,605
It's her favorite.

549
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:01,607
-What are you on? Don't lie to me!
-I ain't on nothing, okay?

550
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:04,082
You think I'm suicidal or just plain stupid?

551
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:08,052
You need to stop living for yourself
and start thinking about that little girl!

552
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:11,967
I am seven months clean.
I work two jobs and take care of my kid.

553
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:15,443
I forgot her motherfucking birthday.
Do you want to arrest me for that?

554
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,730
You can do all the damage you want
to yourself. I can't stop that!

555
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:21,725
But I'm not gonna let you fuck up her life!

556
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:23,326
Take your hands off me.

557
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:26,928
I will file an assault charge
and you do not want that.

558
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:36,572
My sister had one of these
when she was a kid. But I broke it.

559
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,008
-On purpose?
-No.

560
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:41,205
I wanted to make a pizza...

561
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,888
and I put in a 300-watt bulb,
and the whole thing melted.

562
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:48,969
-That's dumb.
-Yeah, I know. I was 17.

563
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:52,923
You don't give a fuck about her!

564
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,288
-I'm talking to you!
-You don't know shit.

565
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,170
Get the fuck out of my house!

566
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:01,646
-Do you live in a house?
-Yup.

567
00:43:03,053 --> 00:43:05,726
-A big house?
-Not that big.

568
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,246
Got a daddy?

569
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:12,846
I used to.

570
00:43:20,453 --> 00:43:22,648
-We got to go, okay?
-Okay.

571
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,282
All right, listen, I'll come back tomorrow...

572
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:30,049
as soon as I get off work
and we'll go to the movies, okay?

573
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,282
Okay.

574
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:40,572
We got to go.

575
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:53,212
Oh, my God.

576
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:55,845
What was I thinking?

577
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,848
Well, I was only 19.

578
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,689
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

579
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:06,692
"There is this girl at my health club.
She is gifted. "

580
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:10,406
What a dork!

581
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:13,884
-His ears were filthy. Did you notice that?
-No.

582
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,290
-Now, her, I liked.
-That kid, what a freak.

583
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:21,646
They should start saving up
for therapy now.

584
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,724
We need some friends,
some couples we don't hate.

585
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:28,045
We have each other.

586
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,812
Maybe we should volunteer someplace.

587
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:37,691
No, I'm serious.

588
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:43,324
Do something good for the world.
Needle exchange program.

589
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:47,372
Habitat for Humanity, Meals on Wheels.

590
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:50,685
Just give more, consume less.

591
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:55,447
-Brenda, I'm dying.
-What?

592
00:44:57,133 --> 00:45:00,921
-What did you say?
-After the auto accident, I had...

593
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:04,361
x-rays, MRls, and they found something.

594
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:09,761
It's called AVM. I think I'm gonna die from it.
I don't know when.

595
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,325
I'm so scared.

596
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:25,048
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah.

597
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:30,208
Meals on Wheels.
You really want to do that?

598
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:36,084
I don't know. I have to do something.
I hate my fucking life.

599
00:45:36,853 --> 00:45:38,411
What's wrong?

600
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:41,651
I was watching Trevor and Dawn tonight...

601
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,409
thinking they're just...

602
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:47,964
so complete.

603
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:52,922
They have something
that I will never have, ever.

604
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:57,322
Either I wasn't born with it,
or it was beaten out of me...

605
00:45:57,413 --> 00:46:01,372
or maybe I made myself
into a self-fulfilling prophecy...

606
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:05,605
and I really am a borderline personality.
Now, wouldn't that be ironic?

607
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,409
What's going on with you?

608
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:13,252
I don't know.

609
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:17,291
I spent my childhood
performing for clinicians...

610
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:20,410
the rest of my life taking care
of my train wreck of a brother...

611
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:23,212
and I have no idea who I am.

612
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,047
I'm gonna make a cup of tea. You want one?

613
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:33,446
No, thanks.

614
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:47,411
God, I can't wait until our next funeral.

615
00:46:48,093 --> 00:46:51,972
-What do you think, Mom?
-It's very modern.

616
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:55,285
We figure it'll pay for itself
in less than eight months.

617
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:57,409
What did we spend on this?

618
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:00,964
About $20,000.

619
00:47:02,373 --> 00:47:05,490
How much is left
in the reserve fund I gave you?

620
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,847
I'll have to check.

621
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:10,164
I want a full accounting
of how you spent that $93,000.

622
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:14,531
I'm an investor in Fisher & Sons. That wall's
part of my investment. I expect a return.

623
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:16,092
Of course, Mom.

624
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:18,926
I am speaking fiercely from the "I"!

625
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:21,452
Do you mind?

626
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,692
I don't know.

627
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:31,607
I just need one of you to sign right here,
and we'll be done.

628
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:35,408
Do we need to write you a check now,
or can we mail it to your office?

629
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:38,007
You might want to open this first.

630
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,251
Came out good, huh?

631
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,483
-It's beautiful.
-It's great.

632
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:52,005
"Enjoy the new casket wall. It's on me.
Kisses. Mitzi Dalton Huntley. "

633
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:55,732
-Why would she pay for our wall?
-She didn't pay for it.

634
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:58,452
Appleby Caskets is owned by Kroehner.

635
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,727
-Since when?
-Since three weeks ago.

636
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,087
Enjoy.

637
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:12,685
-She has us selling Kroehner caskets.
-Wow. She's good.

638
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:16,891
I guess we can at least help out Rico now.

639
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:18,851
That's a good idea.

640
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:22,011
Then we go under,
he's out of work and can't pay us back.

641
00:48:22,093 --> 00:48:24,288
Which won't matter
as we won't exist anymore.

642
00:48:24,373 --> 00:48:26,762
David, we just saved $20,000.

643
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:30,610
We didn't save $20,000.
We just didn't spend it.

644
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:34,682
Actually, we just lost $1,600,
because we had to give the Langmeads...

645
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:38,083
the Haven Four for an even $10,000,
thank you very much.

646
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:49,647
Honey, of course I love the house.

647
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:52,327
Believe me,
they are never gonna give us the money.

648
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:56,611
-You love the house, though.
-We just have to keep on looking, baby.

649
00:48:56,813 --> 00:49:00,442
We don't. I went to the realtor this morning
and we got the house.

650
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:04,082
I wrote a check for the down payment,
and now Julio can have his own room.

651
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:07,483
What? Where did you get the money?
What do you mean?

652
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:09,845
Okay, don't be mad.

653
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:23,968
You went behind my back and asked
your sister for the money? Are you crazy?

654
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:28,012
-Rico, I wasn't about to lose that house.
-I provide for this family, not her!

655
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:31,802
I'm gone eight to ten hours a day
missing my kids, to get us what we need.

656
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:33,690
I don't need her fucking handouts!

657
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:37,368
Please, I don't want to hear
any machismo bullshit today, okay?

658
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:41,564
What did you say to me?

659
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,890
Baby, we have a house.

660
00:49:50,413 --> 00:49:54,042
It's our first house. Can you be happy?

661
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:58,566
-I'm canceling that check.
-Listen to me.

662
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:02,209
When the transmission went last month,
where did the money come from?

663
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:06,002
When I chipped my tooth and
we couldn't afford the dentist, who paid?

664
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:09,768
Angelica's doing good.
She has extra money. She's family.

665
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:12,613
She loves us. She wants to help us.

666
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:16,086
So, please...

667
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,651
put down the phone.

668
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:31,771
We have a house.

669
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:37,925
Everything is good.

670
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,643
I haven't seen you all day.

671
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,212
How's Andy?

672
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,210
He's gonna be okay.

673
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:06,211
What was he on?

674
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:09,687
Some weird shit. I don't really know.

675
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:14,206
Because I heard that he smoked a joint
dipped in embalming fluid.

676
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:17,768
I wouldn't know.

677
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:21,607
That wouldn't be embalming fluid
that you stole from my house, right?

678
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:25,008
What the fuck is wrong with you?

679
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:28,051
Do you have any idea
how much trouble this could get us in?

680
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,691
He could have died.

681
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:33,686
And my brothers could be getting
a phone call from the cops right now, okay?

682
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:36,731
-And you're gonna bring this on my...
-Would you stop?

683
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:42,765
Look, I gave Andy five fry sticks to sell,
and he fucking smoked them all.

684
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,727
I am sorry that I fucked with you.

685
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:49,643
But you took me down there,
and I saw the stuff and I wasn't thinking.

686
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:53,043
You were thinking.
You were thinking about yourself!

687
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,213
Claire, listen to me. Look.

688
00:51:57,053 --> 00:52:01,683
The cops have a videotape of me, Andy,
and Dink robbing a convenience store...

689
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:04,970
and now I'm worried
that Andy's gonna turn me in.

690
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:10,964
Who the fuck are you?

691
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:17,807
Fuck! Everything I touch turns to shit.

692
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:23,210
Everything is shit.

693
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:28,043
Everybody was right about you.

694
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:33,886
You are the only good thing that I have left.
Please don't give up on me.

695
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:37,487
Please.

696
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,402
No.

697
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:11,932
Oh, Christ!

698
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,970
You know,
you're really starting to piss me off.

699
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,407
What? What the fuck do you want from me?

700
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:24,406
I want you to see me! Look at me!

701
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:44,492
Look at me.

702
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,290
That's more like it.

703
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,689
-You done with your run already?
-I didn't need it.

704
00:54:31,573 --> 00:54:34,849
The Langmead viewing is at 6:00.
Are you ready? If you're not...

705
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:37,401
Dave, I need to tell you something.

706
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,930
What have you done now?

707
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:47,323
I think we should sit down.

708
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,652
What is it?

709
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:09,927
Listen, if I've been a real dick or something,
I'm really sorry about it.

710
00:55:12,853 --> 00:55:16,766
I found out that I have a condition
called AVM...

711
00:55:20,853 --> 00:55:25,290
which basically means I could have
a stroke or aneurysm at just about any time.

712
00:55:28,773 --> 00:55:31,207
I'm not coping with this very well.

713
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:37,090
I don't know how to deal,
and I don't know what to do.

714
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:45,851
Oh, fuck.

715
00:56:55,093 --> 00:56:56,321
English
