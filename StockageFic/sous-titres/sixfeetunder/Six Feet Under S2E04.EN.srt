1
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,823
Pike Place Market was born in 1907...

2
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:54,711
from citizen outrage
at the high cost of produce...

3
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,387
when Seattle City Councilman
Thomas Revelle...

4
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,828
proposed a public street market.

5
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,744
On opening day, August 7, 1907...

6
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,621
eight farmers brought their wagons
to the corner of 1st and Pike...

7
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:11,547
and were overwhelmed
by an estimated 10,000 eager shoppers.

8
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:14,671
By 11:00 a. m. they were completely sold out.

9
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,911
That concludes the morning half of our tour.

10
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:21,063
Once again, my name's Karen.

11
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:23,462
You've been a superduper group
this morning.

12
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:26,386
We'll see you back here on the bus at 1:30.

13
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:27,946
Thank you, Karen.

14
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:32,069
I don't know about you,
but I could sure use a fucking cigarette.

15
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,061
Come on, dear.

16
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,268
Bye.

17
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,671
Excuse me, sir?

18
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:48,345
Sir, it's lunchtime.

19
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,948
You can get off the bus now.
We're at Pike Place Market.

20
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,462
Shit!

21
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,625
We've got another dead one
back here, Larry.

22
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,382
You missed your last three sessions.

23
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:28,990
Sometimes coming in here talking about
my life gets in the way of me having one.

24
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,467
So why did you bother coming in today?

25
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:37,422
Because they sent a letter to my mother
and threatened to suspend me if I didn't.

26
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:41,067
I thought you had something
you wanted to talk about.

27
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,984
With you? Yeah, right.

28
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,591
Are you angry with me?

29
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,271
How can you tell?

30
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:54,828
I was obligated to cooperate
with the police, Claire. It's my job.

31
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:58,110
Just so you know,
I was here for you, not for them.

32
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,423
They wanted to interrogate you alone.

33
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:04,183
And they haven't found him yet,
in case you're curious.

34
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,546
I'm not.

35
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,511
You haven't heard from him?

36
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:13,346
Fuck, no. Not that I'd tell you if I had.

37
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:16,391
You did the right thing
when you called the police that night.

38
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,111
I know I did the right thing.

39
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,661
This isn't about whether or not
I did the right thing.

40
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:23,142
Given the circumstances,
it's fully understandable...

41
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,383
that you're feeling this angry, Claire.

42
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,182
If you don't stop saying my name
at the end of every sentence, I am gonna....

43
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,229
-What?
-I don't know.

44
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,871
Just don't, okay?

45
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,223
You feel like throwing something?

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,152
Excuse me?

47
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,672
You could, you know.

48
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,313
Just pick something up off my desk
and chuck it.

49
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:53,306
I'm so sure
you'd let me trash something off your desk.

50
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,623
If you thought it might help, I would.

51
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,472
No, thanks.

52
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:13,184
You're angry with Gabe...

53
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,665
and you're scared because you don't know
what's gonna happen to him.

54
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:21,149
At this point,
I don't give a flying fuck about him.

55
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,668
You don't really feel that way, do you?

56
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,422
No.

57
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,503
I do feel better. Thank you.

58
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:55,547
He was on one of those package bus tours.

59
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:57,346
He'd been going on a lot.

60
00:05:57,433 --> 00:06:00,072
Three or four times a year,
ever since Mom died.

61
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:04,146
Sometimes he went with his friend Pete.
This time he went alone.

62
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,550
They think his heart just gave out.

63
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,746
I'm very sorry.

64
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:16,063
-Where is your father now?
-He's still up there in Seattle.

65
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,106
The Columbia Funeral Home's holding him
for us. They're on Rainier Avenue.

66
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:26,585
Not a problem. We can make arrangements
to have him flown back to LA.

67
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,145
-Flown back?
-Yes.

68
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,025
Dad won't fly.

69
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,263
It was always a sore spot with Mom.

70
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:39,471
She wanted to travel,
but Dad flat out refused.

71
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:44,263
Then, after she died, he started taking
all these package bus tours.

72
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,581
He has....

73
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,430
-He had a thing about flying.
-He never flew.

74
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:55,149
-I'm sure, given the circumstances...
-No, it isn't what he would have wanted.

75
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,269
Isn't there some other way?

76
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:02,707
We can make arrangements
to have him shipped via rail or freight.

77
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:05,832
Like FedEx?

78
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,907
-You can do that?
-It's done all the time.

79
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,905
They brought Abraham Lincoln home
to lllinois by train...

80
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,507
all the way from Washington, packed in ice.

81
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,989
It shouldn't be a problem.

82
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:30,351
Keith, I'll be back up here just as soon
as your father's back on his feet.

83
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,230
What if Grandpa dies?

84
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,828
My friend Neisha's brother had an operation,
and he died.

85
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:41,705
I told you, Taylor, it's just a hernia.
It's nothing for you to worry about.

86
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:45,071
I'd sure like to know where the hell Karla is.

87
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,747
Is she still up in Oakland with Derek?

88
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,669
Did she even offer
to come back down here...

89
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:55,428
and take care of her kid
when you told her you were leaving?

90
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,271
We haven't heard from her.

91
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,501
Jesus.

92
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,383
I thought you had a number for her.

93
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,829
-It's been disconnected.
-Shit.

94
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:12,112
I told you, Keith,
hush that kind of mouth around your niece.

95
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:16,073
Maybe I should just take the child with me.

96
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,190
She'll be fine, all right?

97
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:21,106
My new place has an extra room,
and between Eddie and me...

98
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:23,991
-we'll make sure she's...
-I don't wanna come stay with you.

99
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:27,349
-How come you can't stay here?
-Because my things are at my place.

100
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,231
-What about my stuff?
-You can bring it with you.

101
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,305
You'd probably steal it.

102
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:35,031
There's my cab.

103
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:38,823
Taylor, come on, honey.
Give your grandma a hug.

104
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,510
I love you, Grandma.

105
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:50,786
Now, you be good,
and you mind your Uncle Keith.

106
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,626
I'll try to come back as fast as I can.

107
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:09,592
I know a lot worser words than "shit,"
you know.

108
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:11,706
So do I.

109
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,862
So, how'd the Mossback intake go?

110
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:23,787
We need to find a way to get a body shipped
back from your old stomping ground.

111
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:26,990
Why can't you just fly it back?
That's what your father always did.

112
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:29,189
Apparently the deceased was afraid
of flying.

113
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,946
I don't think he's gonna give a shit now.

114
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,342
The family doesn't want him to fly, all right?

115
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,742
The freight companies
are backed up until next week.

116
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,905
And Amtrak can't bring him back
until next Tuesday.

117
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,665
No problem.

118
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:45,109
I'll fly up, rent a refrigerated van,
and drive him back.

119
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:48,146
You don't need a refrigerated van,
just a one-way rental.

120
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,667
-He's already been embalmed.
-Even easier.

121
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:54,781
You'd do that? You'd fly up there
and turn around and drive all the way back?

122
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:57,751
I haven't been back since Christmas.
I can see a few friends.

123
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,710
I still have stuff up there. I'd love to.

124
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:03,069
I suppose we could mark up
the cost of shipping to cover your travel.

125
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,383
-When do you want me to leave?
-Tomorrow?

126
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:06,542
Done.

127
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:15,106
Have you met any nice men recently, David?

128
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:19,465
No one to speak of.

129
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,347
I wish you'd put yourself out more.

130
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:25,709
The door to your house only opens
from the inside, you know.

131
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:32,026
We haven't seen your friend Gabriel
around much lately, Claire.

132
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,302
So?

133
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,868
Have you not been seeing as much of him?

134
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:39,025
-No, I haven't.
-Did you two have a falling-out?

135
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,148
Yeah, Gabe joined the Hare Krishna, okay?

136
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,464
Those people with the orange robes
and tambourines?

137
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:48,943
That try to sell you books in the airport.
Yeah, that's them.

138
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:51,268
Oh, my goodness!

139
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,667
-He never struck me as a religious person.
-He is now, big-time.

140
00:10:57,113 --> 00:11:00,150
-Did he shave his head?
-Yeah, he shaved his head.

141
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,986
Can we talk about something else, please?

142
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,231
Claire, do you want to come to Seattle
with me?

143
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,542
You're asking me to come to Seattle
with you?

144
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,112
Yeah, why not?

145
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:16,391
I'm not sure we can stick the Mossbacks
with two plane tickets.

146
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:18,304
-I'll pay for it.
-You will?

147
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:20,509
Yeah. I could use the company.

148
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,585
-You could help me drive on the way back.
-She'll miss school.

149
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,904
We're not doing anything I can't miss,
and I can bring my homework.

150
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,949
It's just for a couple of days.

151
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:32,382
Fine.

152
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:36,071
I'm tired of trying to be the architect
for this family.

153
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,031
It's high time you drew your own blueprints.

154
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,582
Does anyone know
what the fuck she's talking about anymore?

155
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,231
-Nate.
-What?

156
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:05,952
By the way,
I'm flying up to Seattle tomorrow.

157
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,591
-You are?
-Yeah.

158
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,665
I'm picking up a body
and driving it back for David.

159
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,825
-I'm gonna take Claire with me.
-Sounds like fun.

160
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,784
You don't mind that I didn't ask you?

161
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,103
-Ask me what?
-To go with me.

162
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:26,581
-No, not at all.
-Good.

163
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:30,662
You sure?

164
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,546
Nate, I'm trying to read...

165
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,591
and you know I hate it
when you floss in front of me.

166
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:39,707
Sorry.

167
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,712
Is it weird I didn't ask you
to come to Seattle with me?

168
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,863
No, why would it be?

169
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,188
I don't know. It just feels a little weird.

170
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,070
Okay, now it is a little weird.

171
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,906
But only because
you're making it a little weird.

172
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,791
-But you're not mad about it?
-Not at all.

173
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:02,303
I think it's really good for you,
spending some time with your sister.

174
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:04,145
That's what I think.

175
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,621
-You sure it's not too weird?
-God, Nate, give it a rest.

176
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:24,663
-Good night, Bren.
-Good night.

177
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,546
Cool! Sleater-Kinney's playing
at this place called Showbox tonight.

178
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,069
I hate to break it to you,
but Showbox is 18 and over.

179
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:04,065
What makes you think
I don't have a fake I.D.?

180
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:06,104
You have a fake I.D.?

181
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,749
You're not gonna pull some
pseudo-parental bullshit on me, are you?

182
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,666
No. I had a fake I.D. once, too.

183
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,704
Maybe I'll go with you.

184
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:19,303
-I don't need a babysitter, Nate.
-I love Sleater-Kinney.

185
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,709
You love Sleater-Kinney?

186
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:28,823
Will you try to get over yourself for a second
and let me be your friend and your brother?

187
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:37,301
Did you bring me on this trip because
you thought I needed a little distraction?

188
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:40,351
I invited you because I thought it'd be fun
to bring you along.

189
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,742
Now I'm having second thoughts.

190
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,791
I believe you.

191
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:54,629
-So where are we staying, anyway?
-My friend Lisa's.

192
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:57,022
-Is she an old girlfriend?
-No.

193
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:00,064
No way, not even close.

194
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:03,306
We were strictly roommates, nothing more.

195
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,022
Worked at the co-op together.

196
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,632
Is she all crunchy-granola...

197
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:12,386
backpacky, and way into grunge?

198
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,861
Crunchy-granola: maybe a little.

199
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,671
Backpacky: definitely.

200
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,745
Into grunge: no way.

201
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,506
Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did.

202
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,425
Besides, Lisa is....

203
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,828
It's not too easy to categorize.

204
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,223
You guys did it a few times, though, right?

205
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,668
-We're not having this discussion.
-Fine.

206
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,711
This is it.

207
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:58,987
Sweet.

208
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:41,949
-It's so good to have you back home.
-It's good to be back.

209
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,109
Lisa, this is my sister, Claire.

210
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,021
Come in.

211
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:19,271
Hello, Hiram? It's me, Ruth.

212
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,710
I'm fine. How are you?

213
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,387
Listen, the reason why I'm calling is...

214
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:34,582
I just wanted to let you know that I've been
drafting a new blueprint for myself.

215
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,424
No, not for the house.

216
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,111
Yes, it is for the house. My house.

217
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:45,866
I mean, not the actual physical structure
I live in with my family.

218
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:48,069
I'm speaking
more of the emotional structure...

219
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:50,587
in which I've chosen to live my life.

220
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:55,461
I most certainly have not been drinking.

221
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:59,186
I'm just trying to let you know, Hiram...

222
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:02,271
that I harbor no hard feelings against you.

223
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,192
No, I do not want to get back together.

224
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,031
How presumptuous!

225
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,903
You know something, Hiram? Fuck off!

226
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:19,862
Amelia? It's Ruth.

227
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,547
I know we haven't seen each other
in a while...

228
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,750
and I feel a little funny leaving this
on your machine...

229
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,222
but I just wanted to let you know...

230
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:32,470
I've been drafting a new blueprint
for myself.

231
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:36,911
And if you're ever looking
for an opportunity to renew our friendship...

232
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,188
my front door is open to you.

233
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,632
That's all I wanted to say.

234
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,546
You can call me back if you want to, okay?

235
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:45,702
Bye!

236
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,425
Sarah, are you there?

237
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,189
If you're there, pick up.

238
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,269
Okay, fine. I know we don't talk
to each other very much anymore...

239
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:04,551
but I left you three messages in two weeks
and you haven't returned any of my calls.

240
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:08,342
I think you don't ever want to
talk to me again, and if that's the case...

241
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,583
we really need to talk!

242
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:15,231
There are things I'd like to say to you
about the cracks in my foundation...

243
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:18,032
and your part in helping me repair them.

244
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,784
This is your sister, Ruth.

245
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:35,430
What do you mean, you can't?

246
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:38,585
Eddie, I need you
to pick up Taylor from school.

247
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:41,591
Look, I realize you're in the middle
of a shift.

248
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:44,392
Can't you get somebody to cover for you?

249
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:47,551
I'm caught between a rock
and a fucking hard place here.

250
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,828
I need you to do this for me.

251
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,943
All right, never mind. Fuck it, then.

252
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,386
This is a bullshit detail.

253
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:57,112
I wish the guy would just shoot her
and get it over with.

254
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:59,627
I've got tickets for the Dodgers tonight.

255
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,592
What did I say?

256
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:15,590
Listen, I've got a huge favor to ask.

257
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,506
What is it?

258
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,505
I'm stuck in Koreatown.

259
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,153
Some guy's
holding his mother-in-law hostage.

260
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,986
He claims she put his TV remote
down a garbage disposal.

261
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,383
I don't know when I'll be out of here.
Eddie's pulling a double shift.

262
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,225
I hate to ask...

263
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:33,427
but is there any way
that you can pick up Taylor...

264
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:35,947
from Bridgebrook Elementary at 3:00?

265
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,388
Yes. I mean, sure. I'd be glad to.

266
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,068
-You sure?
-Yes, of course.

267
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:43,631
All right, thanks.

268
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:47,229
I'll call ahead to the school
so they'll be expecting you.

269
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:50,951
-I'll pick Taylor up from your place later.
-Great.

270
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,471
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

271
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,146
No problem.

272
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,028
-What is this?
-Tofu meatloaf.

273
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,872
It's completely vegan.

274
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:18,911
No dairy, no eggs.
No animal products of any kind.

275
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:22,187
-No meat?
-None whatsoever.

276
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:26,224
Why do you call it "meatloaf"?

277
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,666
You're a pisser just like your brother,
aren't you?

278
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:34,184
-Anyway, it used to be his favorite.
-It's delicious, Lisa.

279
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,791
I didn't put in too much garlic?

280
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:39,829
-Not for me.
-No way.

281
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,950
Garlic is a miracle herb.

282
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:44,310
It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.

283
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:45,826
It stimulates the immune system...

284
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:49,110
and inhibits the growth of parasites
in the intestines.

285
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:53,985
So, how's life at the co-op?

286
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:56,712
Our membership is up 15%% since you left...

287
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,546
in spite of the corporate outfits
breathing down our necks.

288
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:02,750
-Wow, sounds like things are going great.
-We miss you.

289
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:06,071
You should stop in
and say hello while you're here.

290
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:10,502
-So, how's life back in LA?
-It's okay.

291
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:15,023
What can I say? I may have finally
found something I'm good at.

292
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:18,503
-I always knew you had a spiritual calling.
-Yeah, right.

293
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:24,748
What? Being a funeral director
is proof of a spiritual calling?

294
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:30,230
It's not exactly what I imagined for Nate,
but it doesn't surprise me.

295
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,222
Nothing ever surprises you, Lisa.

296
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,746
That's true.

297
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,471
So, last time I spoke to you,
back in January...

298
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:49,625
I suppose, you had met somebody?

299
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,545
-Brenda.
-Yeah.

300
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:55,028
Anything ever happen with that?

301
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:57,790
We're still together.

302
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,623
Wow! Eight months.

303
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,546
That's gotta be an all-time record
for you, Nate.

304
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,032
It might be.

305
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:07,673
Sounds like a real relationship to me.

306
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,550
What can I say?

307
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:12,951
It is what it is.

308
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,108
I mean, for me, for where I am at right now,
it's a good thing.

309
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:21,070
-It's all good.
-It is. It's all...

310
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:26,382
well, mostly, you know, good.

311
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:30,309
I'm really happy for you, Nate.

312
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,622
You know, I got offered a job in LA.

313
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:38,952
-Really?
-Yeah.

314
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:42,423
Some big-time producer
came through town shooting a movie.

315
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:45,152
She's looking for a vegan chef,
and she offered me a job.

316
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,951
Really, what movie?

317
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,505
I'm not good with titles.
I don't go to the movies.

318
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:54,142
Film is processed with gelatin.
Gelatin comes from horses' hooves.

319
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:57,028
-I didn't know that.
-Most people don't.

320
00:23:57,113 --> 00:23:59,627
Hence the global slavery of animals.

321
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:06,345
-Were you thinking about taking the job?
-I don't know.

322
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,263
I mean, LA is such a godless place.

323
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,632
Besides, my life is really full here.

324
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:18,183
-May I use your bathroom?
-Yeah.

325
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,833
It's down the hall, first door on the left.

326
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,622
-She's a lot like you.
-You think?

327
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,989
God, I've missed you, Nate.

328
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:35,506
I've missed you, too.

329
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,905
Give me a break.

330
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,343
I think you totally cleared out my sinuses.

331
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,064
Not too hard?

332
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:19,788
Some of my clients find me a little intense.

333
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,909
Not at all.

334
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,310
I love it.

335
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:27,383
It feels great.

336
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:33,788
I have to say you're pretty loose.

337
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:36,590
Not a lot of tension in the usual places.

338
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,061
I'm curious. Melissa, what do you do?

339
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:47,944
I'm just asking because I'm thinking
about changing professions...

340
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,508
and I'm curious.

341
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:52,749
I'm a prostitute.

342
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:57,539
No shit?

343
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:02,499
No shit.

344
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:08,380
Cool.

345
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,582
I'm making a cup of tea. Want one?

346
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:22,302
I'd love to, but I've gotta get to work.

347
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,706
-Same time next week?
-Absolutely.

348
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,941
-I'll see you.
-See you.

349
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,905
-Hello?
-Bren. Hi, honey. It's Mom.

350
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:43,462
I'm at Tranquility Spa.
I need you to meet me over here.

351
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,111
-Why?
-Sweetheart, it's an emergency.

352
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,341
-I need you over here, please.
-What's happened?

353
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:51,662
I'm at Tranquility Spa, Brenda, in La Cañada.

354
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,867
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.

355
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:00,430
Brenda! Don't go in there.

356
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,025
Mother, let go of my fucking arm.
You're hurting me!

357
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,908
This is your father's car.

358
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:07,460
So Dad's here. Who cares?

359
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:10,190
He's not here. He's at work. I checked.

360
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:12,589
Look on the dash.

361
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:18,588
Your father doesn't smoke Virginia Slims.

362
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,982
Look on the gear shift.

363
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,227
A scrunchie. Big fucking deal!

364
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:31,065
Your father hasn't had enough hair
to need a scrunchie since 1975!

365
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,506
-So you think Dad's fucking somebody.
-Bingo!

366
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:35,946
Oh, my God, is that all this is?

367
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,141
I thought you'd heard from the hospital
that something happened to Billy.

368
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,426
Don't be so dramatic, Brenda.

369
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,984
I have to go downstairs
and work for a little while.

370
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,221
Do you have everything you need?

371
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,667
Can I have some chocolate milk?

372
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:59,745
I'm sorry. We don't have any chocolate milk.

373
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,460
I want some goddamn chocolate milk.

374
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,345
I'm sorry, but we only have white milk.

375
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:10,823
Ain't you got any other cookies
besides these?

376
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:12,344
Those are all we have.

377
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:15,229
I don't like these kind.
These kind taste like shit.

378
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:19,224
Then just color in your coloring books,
and I'll check in on you in a bit.

379
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,142
I don't like coloring books.

380
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:26,703
-You picked them out at the drugstore.
-You told me I had to.

381
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:30,340
-I thought you liked coloring books.
-I don't. I told you I like to draw.

382
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:31,944
Then draw.

383
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,905
These are coloring books.

384
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,307
You can't draw in coloring books...

385
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:42,951
because they already have
the drawings in them.

386
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,625
You can only color in coloring books.

387
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,259
That's why they're called coloring books.

388
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:58,820
-You wanna watch TV?
-Okay.

389
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:06,222
-You know how to use that?
-What do you think, I'm stupid?

390
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,269
-I didn't say you're stupid.
-Bitch, I know how to use a remote.

391
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,387
Fine, knock yourself out.

392
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,823
Dumb-ass cracker.

393
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,343
Man, I am starving for a cheeseburger.

394
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:22,548
I want something that walked the earth,
with the works.

395
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,542
Man, I'm having a double.

396
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:28,144
I thought you liked the meatless meatloaf.

397
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,228
-I lied.
-No shit.

398
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,781
And what's with the "it is what it is"...

399
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:38,863
purposely vague bullshit
about you and Brenda?

400
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:42,470
I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings, okay?

401
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,501
You definitely slept with her.

402
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:49,430
Okay, yes.

403
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:55,223
We had occasional sex together,
but it was strictly on a friendship basis.

404
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,029
You were fuck-buddies?

405
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,460
Yeah.

406
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:03,142
-And nothing more.
-Does Lisa know that?

407
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:07,030
You know what?

408
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,863
Every time we did have sex,
and I'm talking about five, six times, tops...

409
00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:17,063
I was very honest with her
about what it meant and what it didn't mean.

410
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:22,705
-She's got it bad for you.
-I was always honest with Lisa.

411
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,146
-If you say so.
-What do you want?

412
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:30,146
I want a Chubby Cheese with everything,
medium skinny fries, and a Coke.

413
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:35,308
My God, do you smell that?

414
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:38,030
What, burgers and fries?

415
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:40,466
No, it's like rotten eggs! Jesus!

416
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,667
Oh, man, déjà fucking vu.

417
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:47,785
Welcome to Chubby's.
May I take your order?

418
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:51,625
Yeah, I'll have a double Chubby....

419
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:59,981
I'll have a double Chubby cheeseburger.
Fuck me!

420
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:05,102
-Was that one or two cheeseburgers?
-Jesus, my head!

421
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:07,260
Fuck!

422
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,063
Nate, are you okay?

423
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:33,941
Sir, I didn't get that.
Can I take your order, please?

424
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,784
Hello, sir?

425
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,664
You drive.

426
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,981
I'm gonna get some air
and make a phone call.

427
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,060
Okay.

428
00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:15,028
-I didn't get that. Please repeat your order.
-Shut up.

429
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:25,149
Yeah, is Dr. DiPaolo in?

430
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,306
Yeah, it's definitely an emergency.

431
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,700
-Can I take your order, please?
-Shut the fuck up!

432
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,430
I'm going to have to contact the manager.

433
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:40,706
I can't believe I'm doing this.

434
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:43,589
Can't we at least go inside?

435
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,981
I could get a seaweed wrap
while I pretend to listen to you.

436
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,223
That couldn't be her.

437
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:51,142
I'm eating your protein bar.

438
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,984
Maybe it is.

439
00:32:57,871 --> 00:32:59,862
This is like eating upholstery.

440
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,350
I knew it.

441
00:33:04,111 --> 00:33:07,899
Bern couldn't get anyone that good-looking
to jump his saggy ass.

442
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:17,984
I thought you and Dad had an agreement
about this sort of thing.

443
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,302
We did. We do.

444
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:25,905
Only this time he broke one of the rules.
He didn't tell me first.

445
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,545
So you're not upset
Dad's fucking somebody else.

446
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,543
You're upset he didn't tell you
he was fucking somebody else.

447
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:32,859
That's right.

448
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:36,102
The rule is,
if you step outside the holy bonds...

449
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,261
you have to tell your wife first.

450
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,942
So she can line up some young hottie
of her own.

451
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,700
I guess that sounds fair.

452
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,548
You have other rules?

453
00:33:57,111 --> 00:34:01,548
-Yeah, a whole slew of them.
-Go on, tell me. I'm curious.

454
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,183
You can't fuck my friends, I can't fuck yours.

455
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:13,587
No fucking of mutual friends.
Never in Hawaii.

456
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:16,944
Never in a hotel
that costs more than $300 a night.

457
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:20,148
And never in a hotel
that's under $75 a night.

458
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:25,783
Not on holidays.

459
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:30,300
There are others. I just can't remember
all of them at the moment.

460
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,426
Is one of them:

461
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,184
"Never fuck anybody else
in front of your kids"?

462
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:38,343
I guess not. Since there was that time
I saw you in the hot tub...

463
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:40,023
with some old guy with a hairy back.

464
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,386
Darling, your father was there.

465
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:46,100
And there was absolutely no penetration,
I can assure you of that.

466
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:50,469
-I'll bet that wasn't your choice.
-And you were supposed to be in bed.

467
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,660
I was only gone a couple of hours, Rico.

468
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,542
Every hour you're gone
is an hour I have to stay late.

469
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,384
I'm sorry about your buddy's kid,
but I have kids of my own.

470
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:05,429
Is this about us not giving you the loan
for the house?

471
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:09,345
Because you never used to complain
about having to work a little overtime.

472
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:13,663
This is about me not wanting to be
taken advantage of by my employers.

473
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:17,903
-We're more than just your employers...
-That's bullshit, David, and you know it.

474
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:22,070
When it's convenient, we're like family.
But in a pinch, I'm just an employee...

475
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,665
and you and Nate are just my bosses.

476
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:27,023
Hey, little lady.

477
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,186
Taylor, I told you to wait upstairs.

478
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,901
-My tummy hurts.
-Let's go.

479
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:36,223
Is that man dead?

480
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,181
That man was totally dead.

481
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:48,907
Yes, that man was totally dead.

482
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:53,104
-Did you kill him?
-No.

483
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,660
-Did that other man in there kill him?
-No.

484
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:59,390
He died of natural causes.

485
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:04,866
My friend Renee said
sooner or later we'll all be dead.

486
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:08,990
That's true.

487
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:12,139
So someday I'll be dead,
laying on a table like that?

488
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:14,267
Not for a very, very long time.

489
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:19,459
My mom says my dad's good as dead
as far as she's concerned.

490
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:28,466
That's just her way of expressing anger
at him for not being around.

491
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:32,988
Sometimes my mom says
she wishes she was dead.

492
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:39,308
That's just something that people say
when they're upset about something.

493
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,584
Did that dead man in there have any kids?

494
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:47,549
Yeah, he had a wife and three children
and five grandchildren.

495
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:53,026
-I don't ever want to die.
-Me, neither.

496
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,100
It's called arteriovenous malformation.
AVM, for short.

497
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:08,384
Lots of people have it their whole lives
and never even know.

498
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:09,950
And the pills?

499
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,185
They're an anti-seizure medication.

500
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:18,060
So what happened to you,
that was a seizure?

501
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,379
Sort of.

502
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,060
-Sort of?
-It was a mild seizure.

503
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,345
-Does David know about this?
-Yes, he does.

504
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:30,868
I don't want Mom to know
'cause she'll just freak out. All right?

505
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,748
It's no big deal, I promise.

506
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:37,147
People don't just spaz out...

507
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:40,189
and hork all over their shoes
for no good reason.

508
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,626
Two words: tofu meatloaf.

509
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:48,865
Besides, now I have these pills
it'll be totally under control.

510
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:50,989
-You swear?
-I swear.

511
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:55,460
I just have to take them
for the rest of my life is all.

512
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,025
I don't believe you.

513
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,705
Just do me a favor
and don't tell David about this.

514
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:13,745
This client of mine's a prostitute.

515
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:16,550
-Is that supposed to shock me?
-What?

516
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,344
God, not everything is about you.

517
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:23,740
You're such a classic narcissist.

518
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:28,069
Just because your parents are shrinks
doesn't mean you know about psychology.

519
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:32,542
Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean
that you're not out of your fucking mind.

520
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,944
I've treated several prostitutes
over the years...

521
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:40,750
and they're not as uncommon
as you'd think....

522
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,984
That's her.

523
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:50,061
She's your age. I have to talk to her.

524
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:53,302
-Mom, don't. Please don't.
-No, wait.

525
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,826
I'm not angry.
I'm not going to make a scene.

526
00:38:55,911 --> 00:39:00,063
I just need to personalize the experience
and humanize the situation.

527
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:03,303
-It's for all of us.
-You'll just regret it.

528
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,180
Miss!

529
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,547
Hello, I'm Margaret, Bern's wife.

530
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:14,581
You know, Bern and I have
a really open relationship...

531
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:17,469
and I just want you to know
it's okay with me.

532
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:21,100
I'd love to chat,
but I've gotta go meet Bern for lunch. Sorry.

533
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,067
Get off, you bitch! I can't believe you!

534
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,188
-Get off of me!
-Fine.

535
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,704
You slut!

536
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:35,986
Psycho!

537
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:37,868
I'll see you in hell.

538
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,942
I hope you like herpes.

539
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:59,499
You know, I thought she'd be more evolved.

540
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:01,220
Evolved?

541
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,428
Mother, you just attacked
that woman repeatedly.

542
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:08,625
-She could have you thrown in jail.
-I seriously doubt that.

543
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,309
Are you hungry?

544
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,704
Why am I here?

545
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:21,180
Why was it necessary
for me to be here with you for this?

546
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,340
Because you needed a fucking audience.

547
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:29,428
-Not everything's about you, Brenda.
-Look at Mommy.

548
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,024
Isn't Mommy pretty?

549
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:35,423
Isn't Mommy fabulous and free-spirited
and uninhibited?

550
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,821
Validate Mommy, kids,
because she's incapable of doing it herself.

551
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:41,709
No wonder Billy ended up in a psych ward.
Not that you care.

552
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:45,704
For your information, Miss High and Mighty,
this is life.

553
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,790
People have crises.

554
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:51,910
They push each other's buttons.
They inflict pain on one another.

555
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,542
And once in a fucking blue moon,
they bring out the best in each other.

556
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,421
But mostly, they bring out the worst.

557
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:05,784
-You're pathetic.
-Don't you dare judge me.

558
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,146
You think you're the paragon
of mental health...

559
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,780
just because you've been dating
the same man for the past few months?

560
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:15,147
That's real,
compared to what your father and I have?

561
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:18,344
-You're just jealous.
-Of what?

562
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,788
The fact that I haven't allowed you
to totally destroy my life...

563
00:41:21,871 --> 00:41:23,350
like you have everybody else's.

564
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:24,750
What life?

565
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:30,381
You've spent 32 years
being your little brother's nursemaid...

566
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:31,426
Fuck you!

567
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:34,742
...to avoid having any emotional life
of your own.

568
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:38,420
And now that he's been put away...

569
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:40,706
you're gonna have
to face your own demons.

570
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,669
And, sweetheart, they're legion.

571
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:54,023
Get out of my car.

572
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,948
I would be happy to.

573
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,429
I hope you like pork roast
and mashed potatoes.

574
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:17,904
They're okay.

575
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:22,263
-Where are you going, dear?
-To watch TV.

576
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:26,144
In this house we eat dinner at the table.

577
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,584
-You don't watch TV while you eat?
-No, we don't.

578
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:33,628
Maybe we can watch some TV
when we're done eating.

579
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:42,789
-So, what grade are you in, Taylor?
-Fourth.

580
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:47,866
David was in the fourth grade once.

581
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,464
It's true.

582
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,662
Did you know David
used to be my Uncle Keith's boyfriend?

583
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:00,350
Yes, I did.

584
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,180
Sometimes my momma calls my Uncle Keith
a punk-ass fudgepacker...

585
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:09,501
'cause he likes men instead of women.

586
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:13,626
I guess that makes you
a punk-ass fudgepacker, too, don't it?

587
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:17,103
We don't use those kinds of words
at this table.

588
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:20,663
-We don't use those kinds of words at all.
-How come?

589
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:25,509
-Because those words are...
-Hateful. Those are hateful words.

590
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,868
What words do you use?

591
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:33,024
Homosexual.

592
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:40,702
My Uncle Keith has a new boyfriend.
His name's Eddie.

593
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:44,427
He drives an ambulance.
But I don't like him too much.

594
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,180
Why not?

595
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:50,784
He looks at himself in the mirror a lot,
and he talks to me like I'm stupid.

596
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:53,984
-I'm sure that's not true.
-Yes, it is.

597
00:43:55,871 --> 00:43:57,304
It is true.

598
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:02,023
Some people just don't know
how to talk to children.

599
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:03,783
Tell me about it.

600
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,461
I think I'll start the dishes.

601
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,586
It's time for you to leave now.

602
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:33,100
Go!

603
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:50,063
-Is everything okay?
-Claire, I thought you were taking a nap.

604
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,349
I was reading.

605
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,828
-Where's Nate?
-He's outside making a phone call.

606
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:01,702
Who were you talking to?

607
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:04,260
Ants.

608
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,669
I'm being overrun by them.

609
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:10,626
At first I tried setting a little food aside
for them next to the back door.

610
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:13,908
Then I tried coaxing them out
with some citrus oil.

611
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:16,346
Now I'm trying to reason with them.

612
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:22,269
At home, my dad used to squirt them
with lighter fluid and torch them.

613
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:31,140
I'm not still in love with your brother,
if that's what you're thinking.

614
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,301
Actually, I wasn't thinking that.

615
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:37,590
I used to be.

616
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,301
I used to think one day he would realize
I was the one for him.

617
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,949
He never has.

618
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:47,989
Do you think he ever will?

619
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:53,861
I'm probably not the person
to be asking that question.

620
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:59,026
He's my brother, but to tell you the truth,
I'm just getting to know the guy.

621
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:02,871
He's a heartbreaker, that's for sure.

622
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,380
There are a dozen women all over Seattle...

623
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,065
who would freak
if they knew he was back here.

624
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:11,909
-You must think I'm so stupid.
-No, I don't.

625
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:17,548
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

626
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,750
Not anymore.

627
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,390
We broke up.

628
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:27,108
You're better off, trust me.

629
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:30,750
Fucking ants.

630
00:46:32,151 --> 00:46:34,585
I just wanted to hear how your day went.

631
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:38,261
My mother practically beat the shit
out of a woman in a parking lot...

632
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:40,262
but apart from that, I'm fine.

633
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:43,190
-How's Seattle?
-Seattle's good.

634
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,910
Your mother tried
to beat the shit out of somebody?

635
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:49,267
I really don't feel like reliving that right now.

636
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:51,748
How's it going with Claire?

637
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:54,220
Great. We're getting along great.

638
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,189
Is everything okay?

639
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:01,708
I just have a headache.

640
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:06,743
We're gonna hit the road first thing
in the morning.

641
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,381
Okay, I'll see you, then.

642
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:14,946
I just ran a bath and it's getting cold, so....

643
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:17,590
I miss you.

644
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:21,943
I miss you, too.

645
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:12,189
You never called.

646
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:16,341
How did you know where I live?

647
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,821
That's not really important.

648
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,903
I think maybe it is.

649
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:30,590
You wanna know what's really important?

650
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:34,979
Show me.

651
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:20,703
Did she give you a hard time?

652
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:23,710
Not really.

653
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:29,268
Let me grab her,
and we'll get out of your way.

654
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:38,704
Thanks again.

655
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,907
It's no problem whatsoever.

656
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:43,740
She's a great kid, Keith. She really is.

657
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:47,790
Considering everything she's been put
through, it's kind of a miracle.

658
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:50,230
We should go.

659
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,706
-Good night, David.
-Good night.

660
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:31,190
I thought you might need an extra quilt.

661
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:34,387
It gets cold in this room.

662
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,019
Excellent.

663
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,182
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

664
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:46,622
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

665
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:48,309
Yeah. I'm good.

666
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:54,303
You can't fool me, Nate. I know you too well.

667
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,180
I'm fine.

668
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:16,070
Poor baby.

669
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:19,908
It's okay. I'm here.

670
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:22,270
I'm right here.

671
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,540
It's okay.

672
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:45,183
-Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?
-I'm good. I never eat breakfast.

673
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,825
Lisa, have you seen
my old brown flannel shirt?

674
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:52,381
I'm pretty sure it got donated
to the co-op garage sale.

675
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:55,824
Here it is.

676
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,386
I love that shirt. It's so Nate.

677
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:06,190
-Why don't you hang on to it?
-No, I couldn't.

678
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,144
I want you to have it.

679
00:52:08,231 --> 00:52:11,462
-What would I want with your shirt?
-Would you just keep it?

680
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:17,981
We should probably hit the road
and pick up Mr. Mossback.

681
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:19,345
Right.

682
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:27,501
As always, it's been great seeing you.

683
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,784
-Take care of yourself, Nate.
-You, too.

684
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:36,141
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you, Claire.

685
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,902
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

686
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:56,704
Morning, Mom.

687
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,981
It's awfully quiet around here
with Nate and Claire being gone.

688
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:03,229
I suppose it is.

689
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:08,467
What time did your friend come by
to pick up his niece?

690
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,060
1:30.

691
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:14,630
That's awfully late
for a child her age to be up.

692
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:16,827
She was asleep on the sun porch.

693
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:26,748
-Is there something you'd like to say to me?
-No.

694
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:30,590
Yes, there is.

695
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:34,064
I'm all ears.

696
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:40,024
Your father used to say that to me
all the time. "I'm all ears. "

697
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:43,101
Sometimes you remind me of him.

698
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,468
What's on your mind?

699
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:52,584
You have to be careful with children...

700
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:56,746
because their blueprints are being drafted
by the adults in their lives.

701
00:53:56,831 --> 00:53:58,787
And this little girl....

702
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:04,427
It seems to me that her foundation
is probably unstable enough...

703
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:06,388
without you bringing your....

704
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:09,499
My what?

705
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:14,670
Your relationship with her uncle,
you have to admit...

706
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,424
might be a little confusing
to someone her age.

707
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:27,020
I'm happy for you if this whole Plan thing
of yours has enabled you...

708
00:54:27,111 --> 00:54:29,341
to draft your own blueprint...

709
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,707
or patch up some of the cracks
in your foundation.

710
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:37,670
But just between you and me,
you're starting to sound like a crazy person.

711
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:40,980
I think it's time you kept
that shit to yourself...

712
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:43,631
and minded your own fucking business.

713
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:09,900
Thank you.

714
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:26,902
It's a little weird driving a dead guy
all the way back to LA.

715
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,551
It's only weird if you make it weird.

716
00:55:32,271 --> 00:55:34,785
-It's a little weird.
-It's not.

717
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:42,146
You know, Nate, I don't know why...

718
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:45,821
but it's comforting to know
you're just as fucked up as the rest of us.

719
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,550
I'm not anywhere near as fucked up
as the rest of you.

720
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:50,303
-You are.
-I'm not.

721
00:55:51,111 --> 00:55:53,909
-Yes, you are.
-Shut up and drive.

722
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:38,504
English
