1
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:46,791
Okay, this here's the dough mixer.

2
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:48,871
You gotta get in there, really scrub it...

3
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,542
...hose it down every night.

4
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:53,509
Keep the bugs out.

5
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,352
Because someone found a roach in
a loaf of wheat once and sued.

6
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,632
- Can't you just spray it with Raid?
- Then you got poison in bread, kill 100.

7
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,269
Is that good?

8
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:12,832
Oh, Jesus.

9
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,550
I gotta get to my chiropractor.

10
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,634
Hey.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,189
Think anyone's
ever had sex in here?

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,199
Now, why the fuck would
you even think that?

13
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,312
Romano?

14
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:48,394
Romano?

15
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:58,914
Romano, are you okay?

16
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,521
That was...

17
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,245
You made the weirdest noise back there.

18
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:36,365
If I were you, I would not
get into a weird-noise contest.

19
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:38,563
Oh, yeah?

20
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,249
Oh, boy.

21
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:44,886
I love this song.

22
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,811
This, really?

23
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,163
Yeah.

24
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,729
My dad had all these
old big-band records.

25
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,131
It always reminds me of...

26
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,929
I don't know, being a kid.

27
00:03:57,135 --> 00:04:02,051
Still being blissfully ignorant
about what a sick joke life can be.

28
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:06,136
I would've pegged you
as more of a fan of...

29
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:08,567
What? Sting?

30
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:12,168
U2? You know, grew up in the '80s
but too straight to be into the really...

31
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,209
...hard-core punk stuff.
- Oh, yeah?

32
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,727
I suppose you were into
the hard-core punk stuff.

33
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:19,612
I think it was just the heroin talking.

34
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,491
Oh, man, I love that look.

35
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,249
No, I really should go.

36
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,259
Mom and David and I are having
some sort of family meeting...

37
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:37,740
...to discuss whether we should
sell the business to Kroehner.

38
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,456
God, I hope we will.

39
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,141
Why?

40
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:47,018
So that I can get the hell
out of here and go back to Seattle.

41
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,412
Why don't you come with me?

42
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,260
Why on earth would I do
something like that?

43
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,777
Because you are my woman.

44
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,861
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,102
How come my name is
branded on your ass?

46
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,425
I love that look.

47
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,663
You don't understand
how serious this is.

48
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,018
We're under siege by
a major corporation.

49
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,140
- Stop being so dramatic.
- Mom, it's a fact.

50
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,657
David, we all have problems.

51
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,860
This oat bran is stuck on here
like cement...

52
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,946
...because you didn't soak
any water in it.

53
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,584
Listen to me.
Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers...

54
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,269
...to demand money upfront.

55
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,347
Now Continental Caskets wants us
to pay...

56
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,111
...for anything we put in the show room
before we sell it.

57
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,063
That's thousands of dollars.

58
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:36,070
Your father never let these things
get to him like you do.

59
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,547
He never had to deal with
this kind of situation.

60
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:41,061
I'm sure things will work out.
They always do.

61
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,741
- No, they don't.
- Good morning.

62
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:47,306
What's going on with you?

63
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,190
Nothing.

64
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,670
You're not leaving here until you
put some food in your stomach.

65
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,074
I'm starving.

66
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:26,155
Are you bulimic? Is that what we're
going to have to deal with now?

67
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,318
Mom, apparently you want a child
with an eating disorder.

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,273
Morning.

69
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,674
How was your run?

70
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,794
I haven't gone yet. I stayed over
at Brenda's last night.

71
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,355
No one cares where you were.

72
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,201
Why do you have to tell people
every single thing you do?

73
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:45,476
Sorry, I forgot we're all supposed
to live under a shroud of secrecy.

74
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,639
So I think we should sell.

75
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:57,714
I'm not saying that just because I don't
want anything to do with this business.

76
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,364
Have you looked at their offer?
A lot of money. Stock options?

77
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,557
Do you have any idea
how arrogant you are?

78
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:05,962
You don't get to decide
what we're doing.

79
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,760
I own half, Dave.

80
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,162
You haven't spent the last
11 years working here.

81
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,358
You didn't give up
anything for this.

82
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:13,967
Is this really what you want...

83
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,318
...or are you trying
to make a dead man happy?

84
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,640
We should have this
conversation later.

85
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,639
- Why can't she be a part of this?
- Thank you.

86
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,039
Nate, this is all I know.

87
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:34,082
Stay and run the place for Kroehner.
Go to law school like you wanted.

88
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,202
Take my trust fund.
I'll take the cash.

89
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,884
I think Nate's right.

90
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:45,367
Who knows how long any of us has left?
We should do what makes us happy.

91
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:49,010
Fine, sell, what do I care?

92
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:52,202
- You mean it?
- Sure.

93
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:55,805
Let's just invalidate my entire life.

94
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,412
I'll go to Gilardi today
and tell him our decision.

95
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,174
Oh, I don't know.
I guess the one with the satin interior.

96
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:09,926
Ma, there were five with satin interior.
Let's just go with the Classic Regal.

97
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:12,732
- I liked the White Pearl.
- The Classic Regal will be fine.

98
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,337
Who cares anyway?

99
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:19,249
My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces
by a big, giant dough mixer.

100
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,495
Oh, Ma, Pop wasn't
in that many pieces.

101
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,898
Ma, he's gonna look just as you
remember him. Right?

102
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,052
It says in your brochure you have
a gifted restorative artist. Whatever.

103
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:36,139
Can he make sure Pop look good
enough for an open casket or not?

104
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,418
Because you know,
we'll go elsewhere.

105
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:43,582
You'll be completely satisfied
with our work. I guarantee it.

106
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:48,653
Humpty Dumpty, huh? Train tracks?

107
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:50,343
Dough mixer.

108
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,413
Can you go to St. Joseph's
to pick him up?

109
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,104
Not today.

110
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:57,944
It's my cousin Ramon's baby's
christening. I told you.

111
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:01,775
I'll give you 50 bucks extra.
A hundred.

112
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:04,454
I'm the godfather, David.

113
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,896
Shit. I can't go because
of Mrs. Bond's viewing...

114
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:09,985
...and Kroehner told Marty
if he does our pickups...

115
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,701
...he'll lose all their business.
- So send Nate.

116
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:16,696
You know, I know he hates this shit,
but he's your partner now, right?

117
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,701
- He's, like, in a lot of pieces.
- Humpty Dumpty, I know.

118
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,185
Careful, that could be his head.

119
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,427
- Jesus.
- Or his pelvis.

120
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:34,020
It's probably his head.

121
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:38,710
- What happened to Rico, he get canned?
- No, he's just busy.

122
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,584
You new over there?

123
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,862
No, I'm just a temp.

124
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:46,941
I heard old man Fisher kicked.
You know him?

125
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,984
Not really.

126
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:52,823
Hey, no offense, pal,
you might want to call your agency...

127
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,471
...and ask for a new assignment.
- I'm already on it.

128
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:06,512
Hey, Gabe. I looked for you in the quad
this morning, but I didn't see you, so...

129
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:10,232
Maybe you stayed home because
you were tired or something, but...

130
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:16,070
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you and...

131
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,716
Not in any serious way,
I was just thinking about you casually.

132
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,990
Okay. Bye.

133
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,269
I wanna kill myself.

134
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,795
Hey, Morticia!

135
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,920
Foot slut!

136
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,399
It's such a fucking easy decision for him.

137
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,598
And then Mom takes his side.
Big surprise.

138
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:03,285
It's like I don't even exist.

139
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,761
Like me giving up law school
meant nothing.

140
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,118
So fight. If you really want to keep
the business, don't give it away.

141
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:13,606
See, that's just it. All day long, I've
been feeling this incredible sense of...

142
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,480
Relief.

143
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,317
I don't know if I want to keep it.
I could do anything. I'm still young.

144
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:23,124
- Right?
- Are you kidding? You're still a baby.

145
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,088
What about that one?

146
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,522
That's a little Mayberry for me.

147
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,521
Something simple and clean.

148
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:36,165
Like the ones that hang
in a deserted truck stop...

149
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,762
...when that handsome
drifter blows into town.

150
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,202
Of course.

151
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,805
What about that one?

152
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,332
Not bad.

153
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,410
I could see Ava Gardner
lying beneath it...

154
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:51,844
...plotting to steal Clark Gable
from Grace Kelly.

155
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,648
People start their lives
over all the time, right?

156
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:03,051
- That guy just cruised you.
- Really?

157
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,451
Bitch.

158
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,692
Right in front of me,
like I'm not even here.

159
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:07,852
He did?

160
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,616
And I missed it?

161
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,370
Oh, sorry.

162
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:16,137
- Oh, Ruth.
- Amelia.

163
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,496
Another casserole.

164
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:19,848
Lemon bars.

165
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,615
The kids will love them.

166
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,650
Don't you have candy striping today?

167
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,731
I did, but I told them
my best friend needed me.

168
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,496
- You've made the right decision.
- I know.

169
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:38,172
I never realized how much money there
was to be made in the funeral business.

170
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,417
Death-care industry.

171
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:42,341
And it's only gonna grow,
with all the baby boomers and all.

172
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:45,576
- Gee, there will be bodies everywhere.
- Hopefully.

173
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:48,900
And all in final resting places
provided by Kroehner.

174
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,174
With a little help from Fisher & Sons.

175
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,342
You know, we've had our eyes
on your operation for some time.

176
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:58,777
Your father was a nice guy, but he
didn't know how to run a business.

177
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,862
Well, my dad was never
in it for the money.

178
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:04,945
I think he was more concerned about,
you know, helping people.

179
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:07,535
You wanna help people,
join the Peace Corps.

180
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:10,421
- Yeah.
- Greedy little Nazi fuck.

181
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,180
So how exactly will this work?

182
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:16,743
We won't change the appearance
of your unit at all.

183
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,098
Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading,
perhaps.

184
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,698
But preparation of loved ones
will now take place...

185
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,458
...at a centralized location,
which services several other units.

186
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,184
Technicians on staff,
constantly producing.

187
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,423
So it's like a little factory.
Of embalming.

188
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,902
Preparation for visitation.

189
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,864
- We maintain a small fleet of vehicles...
- Hearses?

190
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,744
- Funeral carriages.
- Dead wagons.

191
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,943
Removal vans.

192
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:46,427
Once you centralize operations, you'd be
amazed how you maximize profits.

193
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:52,389
So in the end, we're all just
human McNuggets.

194
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,073
Just as we began.

195
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:55,753
I like you, Nate.

196
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:58,230
You hear that, buddy-boy?
He likes you.

197
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,824
Wow, you are so cool.

198
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,954
Your initial payment, sir.

199
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,868
The rest will follow after both our
lawyers have held up the process...

200
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:12,874
...long enough to justify their fees.

201
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:16,195
In the meantime, we'd like to send
a facilities inspector out to...

202
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,673
...take a look at things
as early as next week.

203
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,515
You know, like the president.

204
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,398
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right. Later.

205
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,671
Hey.

206
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,991
What's going on?

207
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,991
You fucking asshole.

208
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,071
Why is my car covered with
words like "toe sucker"?

209
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:52,243
I... I don't know. L...

210
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,596
You didn't, for instance, blab to
your friends that you bagged me...

211
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:57,238
...and that I sucked your toes?

212
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,357
I might have told one person.

213
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:07,560
Andy. He just... He asked me what I did
the night before, so I told him. I mean...

214
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,036
It's not like I thought this
was gonna work out...

215
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,125
...because I know nothing
ever works out...

216
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:19,604
...but I guess I just wanted
to enjoy this for a little bit.

217
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:23,404
Instead, the whole world's calling me
"this little piggy lover. "

218
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,808
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,363
I mean, come on. So what?

220
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,686
- So it got out. Who cares?
- Know what I wish?

221
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,965
I wish that just once people wouldn't
act like the clich'es that they are.

222
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,845
This can go to Goodwill.

223
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:44,007
And this...

224
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:47,442
And this one too.

225
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,894
Maybe Nathaniel's clothes
are too dull for Goodwill.

226
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:57,408
- Does Goodwill ever refuse anything?
- Ruth. If you want to cry, cry.

227
00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:02,166
- What are you talking about?
- Just let it out. That's why I'm here.

228
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,606
For the last time, I'm fine.

229
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:08,445
I just think it's very interesting. You're
supposed to be making two piles.

230
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:11,296
One for Goodwill
and one for memories...

231
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:13,806
...and yet you have not
held on to one thing.

232
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,054
The memory pile was your stupid idea.

233
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,249
What can I do with Nathaniel's
old clothes?

234
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,975
Make pillows, a quilt?
I ought to just burn them all.

235
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,178
How can someone with so little
clothing have so much clothing?

236
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,337
What is this?

237
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,129
Nothing.

238
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,296
It's stupid.

239
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:37,177
Something about visiting the pyramids,
taking ballet lessons?

240
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,817
I wrote down things I might
want to do now that I'm...

241
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:42,820
- I have more time.
- Well, I think that's wonderful.

242
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:45,332
No, it's not.

243
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:49,252
It's stupid. I don't even want to do
any of these things.

244
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:51,341
I just did it because
some book told me to.

245
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,933
- What am I, gonna be in Swan Lake?
- Why not?

246
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:57,182
You see stories like that on the news
all the time. It's inspiring.

247
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:00,855
It's depressing. It seems so desperate.

248
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:02,942
Maybe it's a little desperate.

249
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:07,218
Besides, who knows?

250
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:11,376
It's always possible
you might meet a man.

251
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,977
That part of my life is over.

252
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,706
You're supposed to flip this mattress
every two months.

253
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:22,942
I do mine every 14 weeks.

254
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:27,382
Well, I can't remember ever flipping this.
It's probably been 20 years.

255
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,909
Come on, get up.

256
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,746
You haven't finished going
through Nathaniel's clothes.

257
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,147
Ruth.

258
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,860
Ruth, how can I help you?

259
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,064
You can lift this up with me.

260
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,909
An uncovered mattress is so sad.

261
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,786
Help me turn this over!

262
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,670
All right.

263
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,465
Okay.

264
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,186
All right.

265
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,025
Does it feel any different?

266
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,068
No.

267
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:22,676
Save our park!

268
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:26,918
Save our park!
Save our park!

269
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,159
Save our park!
Save our park!

270
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,274
No more money for politicians!
Money for parks!

271
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,278
Save our park!
Save our park!

272
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:04,840
What are you doing?

273
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:08,482
You have a gift.
You can help people.

274
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:13,836
Fine.

275
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,642
Go back to peddling soy milk
and nailing waitresses.

276
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,725
What do I care? I'm dead.

277
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,043
Move it, asshole!

278
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:28,884
Save our park!
Save our park!

279
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,603
So now you don't want to sell.

280
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,805
- I know it sounds crazy.
- No, not at all.

281
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,526
We'll keep the business for the rest of
the day, then sell it again tomorrow.

282
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,403
- Hear me out.
- This is a good system.

283
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,001
We'll sell in the mornings,
keep it in the afternoons.

284
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:45,363
Sometimes, we sell again in the evenings
when we can't make a decision.

285
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:47,370
David, you're not being fair.

286
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,928
When I didn't want to sell,
you could've cared less.

287
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,486
When Nate doesn't, you listen.

288
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:56,449
Okay, I'm a terrible mother, who's
responsible for all your problems. Happy?

289
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:02,166
So you had some revelation, and
now you wanna be a funeral director?

290
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,129
- How long is that going to last?
- He does have a point, Nate.

291
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,488
- You don't always stick with things.
- You can't be in the same room...

292
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:09,651
...with a dead body.

293
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:12,895
I know, but there's a reason for that.

294
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:16,456
This is what I'm supposed to do.

295
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:19,252
Which is why I've spent so much time
running away from it.

296
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,495
My whole life, I've been a tourist.

297
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,852
Now I have the chance to do some
good instead of just sucking up air.

298
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:39,938
I know it's a lot to ask of you, I know,
but I just really think that we can do this.

299
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,497
You and me, together.

300
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:44,859
Brothers.

301
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:47,133
Like we used to be.

302
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:54,022
We could still sell to Kroehner
and both manage Fisher & Sons.

303
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,454
Yeah, but then we're just
spokesmodels...

304
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,338
...working to make fat Republican
stockholders richer.

305
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:01,854
Kroehner doesn't give a shit
about people. We care.

306
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:05,900
- We can help them through their grief.
- This is a business, Nate, not a charity.

307
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:08,495
Of course it's a business, but...

308
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,698
...it's more than that, and you know it.

309
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:18,862
Okay.

310
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:20,296
Great.

311
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,707
I'll call Gilardi and tell him
he can kiss our collective ass.

312
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,183
Language.

313
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,188
Maybe Dad knew what he was doing.

314
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,907
You did not have to waste this stuff
on me.

315
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:40,102
Oh, please. My parents got a case of it...

316
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:44,544
...from some TV movie they
were technical advisors on.

317
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:46,903
Some serial-killer thing for cable.

318
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:50,185
Oh, they're such whores.
They'll do anything.

319
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,667
Gosh.

320
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,832
Can you believe this
stuff is expensive?

321
00:21:56,794 --> 00:22:00,071
You know, I've always wanted to tell off
some corporate suit, some...

322
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:03,347
...greedy little
Nazi fuck, you know?

323
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,709
That's very hostile.

324
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,625
No, I was very diplomatic. I just said,
"Thanks, but we changed our minds. "

325
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,032
What did he do?

326
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,387
He didn't do anything.
What's he gonna do?

327
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:17,954
- This is completely unacceptable.
- The Baxters changed their mind.

328
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:22,197
- They're going with the Unger Mortuary.
- Was there a reason?

329
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,029
They probably just underbid you.

330
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,911
Hal Unger never underbid anybody.

331
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,112
He moved to Florida. They were
bought out by Kroehner months ago.

332
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,197
Sign here.

333
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,879
You know...

334
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:41,155
...I didn't just decide to stay in
Los Angeles because of the business.

335
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:44,354
- I had another reason.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this.

336
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,238
- I've got such a nice buzz going.
- It was you.

337
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,318
Nate, get serious.

338
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:52,560
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

339
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:55,642
You're staying here because
you found something you want to do.

340
00:22:55,844 --> 00:23:00,714
I am the extra bonus
that probably won't work out.

341
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:04,235
Sometimes your honesty
gets really tiresome.

342
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:08,314
- I don't want any children.
- Who said anything about children?

343
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,677
I was referring to you.

344
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,162
I got something for you.

345
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,680
Open it.

346
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,841
Glenn Miller Orchestra
at the Hollywood Palladium.

347
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,849
Brenda, this is so cool.
I've never been to the Palladium.

348
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:39,407
You grew up in L.A., and you've never
been to the Palladium? Pathetic.

349
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:44,566
These are for three weeks from now.

350
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:47,048
How'd you know
I wouldn't be in Seattle?

351
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,209
I didn't.

352
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,374
Morning, Rico.

353
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,902
Just what I need, another boss
breathing down my neck.

354
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:43,933
Put me to work.

355
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:49,499
Hello?

356
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,696
Pregnancy's kicked Vanessa's hormones
into overload. I gotta talk her down.

357
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,297
If you wanna help, take Mr. Romano
out of the bag and put him on the table.

358
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:14,863
Remember, breathe through
your mouth, man. He's pretty ripe.

359
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:43,627
Oh, Christ.

360
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,829
- Nate.
- Great, look what you made me do.

361
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,673
Oh, gross.

362
00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:59,793
I want to talk to you
about something.

363
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:05,753
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
a little busy swimming in a man's guts.

364
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:10,274
I don't know what this is.

365
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:15,028
I'm picking up a part of a person,
and I don't even know what part it is!

366
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:18,514
Fine, I'll talk to you later.

367
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:19,673
Oh, God.

368
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,678
Sorry.

369
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:42,073
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:45,080
I work here now.
I have to be a part of things.

371
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:48,116
Let Rico take care of him.

372
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:53,158
I have a job for you that's much better
suited to your particular talents.

373
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,398
Morning, Nate.
Lovely day, isn't it?

374
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,757
I've seen better.

375
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,403
I only wanted to say hello,
seeing that I'm your new neighbor.

376
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:20,684
We just bought that house
across the street.

377
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:24,280
Got it for a song too.

378
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:29,040
Oh, and by the way, we're planning to
put you out of business in six months.

379
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:32,129
They're opening a Poseidon Society
across the street?

380
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,127
That's right.

381
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,561
What is a Poseidon Society?

382
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:40,480
They sell cremations, cheap cremations.
Now, for a fraction of what we charge...

383
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:43,490
...you can dump off the relative
you never really liked...

384
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:46,206
...at the Torch Mart across the street.

385
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,325
I guess we have to just
continue to do our best.

386
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,091
And how exactly do we do that?

387
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:54,569
You know Lou the florist,
that sweet old guy?

388
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,527
He just upped what
he charges us by 200 percent.

389
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,494
And that chemical dealer
on Figueroa is now suing us...

390
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:03,767
...over some nonexistent
shipment of cavity fluid.

391
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,695
Every other supplier that we have
in common with Kroehner...

392
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,729
...suddenly developed
some problem with Fisher & Sons.

393
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:11,813
For some reason,
by the name of Kroehner...

394
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:14,611
...the Health Department
is going to inspect us next week.

395
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:17,172
Yeah, so what? Isn't everything clean?

396
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:21,531
Yes, but any inspection means
we have to update something.

397
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:25,209
If it's the ventilation system, we're sunk.

398
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,332
We should've sold.

399
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:31,691
Nate? I'm having a problem.

400
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,172
You don't happen to have
Mr. Romano's foot on you, do you?

401
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:40,811
Do you remember picking up the foot?

402
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:45,174
I think so, but my eyes were shut,
and I was trying not to vomit.

403
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:47,771
I'm not happy.

404
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:52,135
Well, that's very interesting, David,
because I'm ecstatic.

405
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:56,254
Maybe the morgue
never gave us that foot.

406
00:28:57,224 --> 00:28:59,180
Both feet are listed
in the paperwork, Nate.

407
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:02,536
Just think, Nate. Is there
any other point you could've lost it?

408
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:04,736
- Lost what?
- Nothing.

409
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:08,495
If you lost something, look under the
bed. That's where things always turn up.

410
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,857
- I doubt that applies in this case.
- That's what people always say...

411
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,706
...then they find what they're
looking for under the bed.

412
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:18,423
- Mom, we're really busy down here.
- The upstairs machine is broken.

413
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,107
I called the repairman but...

414
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,186
Oh, my God, what is this?

415
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:30,218
Someone left a Kleenex in their pocket,
and now it's all over everything.

416
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,458
It's disgusting.

417
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,261
Nate, retrace your steps.

418
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,589
Is there any other point
you could've lost the foot?

419
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,469
I almost dropped him at the morgue,
but the bag didn't open.

420
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,666
I tripped on the stairs,
but nothing fell out.

421
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:53,308
Banged into the freezer.
Spilled him onto the floor...

422
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:57,223
- And I picked him up from off the floor.
- It should be here.

423
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:01,909
I'd say it's an $8 million lawsuit.

424
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,511
At least.

425
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,837
- Here she comes.
- Like my new shoes? They're size 12.

426
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:18,106
Toe slut.

427
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,438
Amelia?

428
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,285
It's me, Ruth.

429
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:14,116
Your best friend needs help.

430
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,081
Is he all put together?

431
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:34,079
- Oh, he's 100 percent there.
- Absolutely.

432
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,519
I'd like to see him.

433
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:42,170
I'm sorry, our embalmer
is a little on the artistic side.

434
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:45,045
He gets crazy if he has any input.

435
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,402
It's best to wait until
we're completely done.

436
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,403
One more thing.

437
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:51,966
His shoes.

438
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:56,653
- What are you, an idiot?
- Those are his favorite shoes.

439
00:31:56,854 --> 00:32:00,529
He has perfectly comfortable loafers,
which would be much more appropriate.

440
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:05,650
Yes, I myself have loafers
which are just like walking on air.

441
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:08,494
We should've just
told her the truth.

442
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:13,335
"Sorry, Mrs. Romano, but my idiot
of a brother lost a part of your husband. "

443
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,493
Yeah, that would've worked.

444
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:16,891
Where are you going?

445
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,576
I have someplace I have to be.

446
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:21,576
When I return, I hope to
be greeted by a foot...

447
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:24,736
...a solution as to how to stop
a billion-dollar corporation...

448
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:29,091
...from putting us out of business
and pruned hedges.

449
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,890
- Aren't you glad you're out of the house?
- Yes, this is just what I needed.

450
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:39,217
We should try and get a seat
right in front.

451
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:43,096
- I'm placing a bet.
- We should just try and enjoy the day.

452
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:46,692
I don't see why we need to gamble.

453
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:50,697
That's sweet.

454
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:54,173
You both look so happy.

455
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:56,375
It's just an act.

456
00:32:57,224 --> 00:33:00,660
Just enjoy it while it lasts,
which isn't very long.

457
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,254
Excuse me?

458
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:05,377
You think you have forever,
but you don't.

459
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:07,736
Soon you start to get on each
other's nerves...

460
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,499
...then you don't tell the other person
as much as you used to.

461
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,267
What's the point?
You thought they understood you.

462
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,264
- But they never did, not really.
- Ruth.

463
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,981
Finally, not only do you not
tell him anything real...

464
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:20,780
...you actively start lying to him.

465
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:24,581
Then when you think it can't get
any worse, he up and dies.

466
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:31,022
- I think I see a shorter line over there.
- Bye.

467
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,866
No matter what you do,
you end up alone!

468
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,664
Not knowing who you are
or what you really want!

469
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,830
Ruth, Ruth, why did we
come here today?

470
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,782
To have fun. Aren't you having fun?

471
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,187
I think it's wobbling.

472
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:53,181
It just looks like it's wobbling because
you've been staring at it for so long.

473
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:55,464
It's definitely wobbling.

474
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:57,426
You're hallucinating.

475
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:58,589
Life is strange.

476
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:01,673
If one of those tiny screws
isn't screwed on tight enough...

477
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,867
...that thing could fall
and kill us instantaneously.

478
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,670
Just chop us to bits like a Cuisinart.

479
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:13,107
And an assassin with a semiautomatic
could walk through the door...

480
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,866
...and spray our brains all over the place.

481
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:22,436
The sun could become a supernova
and engulf the entire planet in flames.

482
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,515
David Fisher.

483
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,438
We just got a call from Claire's school.
She's in trouble.

484
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,032
- Can't Mom handle this?
- She's MIA.

485
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,313
And besides, I think you might be
interested in what they told me.

486
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:43,320
What? Start from the beginning.

487
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,357
Jesus.

488
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:52,001
Okay, I'll be right there.
Until then, tell Nate to...

489
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,637
Oh, great, he's MIA too?

490
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,199
All right, bye.

491
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:02,880
There's a rumor going around school
that my sister put a dismembered foot...

492
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:06,634
...into some boy's locker.
- Shut the fuck up.

493
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:25,204
She did it. I know she did.

494
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,161
Where's the foot now?

495
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,280
I don't know.
The student who found it...

496
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:33,243
...denies that it ever happened.
- Okay, where's your sister?

497
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,918
No one knows.
A police report has been filed...

498
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,679
...and now Mom is supposed to meet
with the principal.

499
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,359
I don't understand kids.

500
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,927
When I was her age, I never
would've taken a foot.

501
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:47,488
David, I can help. I'm a cop.
That's what I do for a living.

502
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:51,413
You find feet?

503
00:35:52,213 --> 00:35:53,612
What the fuck am I gonna do?

504
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:55,405
Tell me who lived here again.

505
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:59,293
The Fritzens.

506
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:02,968
I have totally fucked things up.
Kept us from selling.

507
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:06,724
Now we're gonna go under, and it's
because of me. I'm a fucking moron.

508
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:08,892
You used to hang out over here?

509
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:13,647
Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play in here
after school. Both her parents worked.

510
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:18,372
Brenda, this is serious.
My entire family could go bankrupt.

511
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:23,568
So swallow your pride,
go back to the corporation and sell.

512
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:29,009
They'll cut their offer in half now,
knowing we're so quick to buckle under.

513
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,212
Plus, I really don't wanna let
that greedy little Nazi win.

514
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,218
Oh, so this is a pissing contest?

515
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,660
Nate, I'm going to kiss you!

516
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,734
I lost someone's foot today.

517
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:57,095
Sorry.

518
00:36:57,744 --> 00:37:00,622
I really thought I had, like, this...

519
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:03,658
...profound revelation.

520
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:08,095
Fuck, if this isn't what I'm supposed
to be doing with my life, then what is?

521
00:37:08,386 --> 00:37:11,776
Living it.
And you're doing that, so relax.

522
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,456
You don't give a fuck about
what I'm going through.

523
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:20,777
Sure. As much as I can, given we've
known each other less than a month.

524
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:29,979
There's no big investment. I mean, that's
part of the appeal for both of us.

525
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,621
Right?

526
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,827
Right?

527
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:55,152
Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me
in this room. I wouldn't let her.

528
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:59,746
- You can't control things. Nobody can.
- Shut up.

529
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:02,343
There's only one thing that's certain.

530
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:08,912
- Everything changes.
- Shut. Up.

531
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,833
I already talked to the cops.

532
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,508
I don't understand why
I have to go through this again.

533
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,188
- Because this time I want the truth.
- Man...

534
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,074
A witness already said she saw you
running down the hall...

535
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:43,318
...screaming the crazy funeral-home
girl put a foot in your locker.

536
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,240
It was a joke. It was just a joke.

537
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,956
She's kind of a loser,
and we all pick on her.

538
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:51,917
- She totally asks for it.
- Modern technology is really something.

539
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,916
- I don't care, man.
- You should.

540
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:59,673
We have chemicals we put on your hands
to see if you've touched human remains.

541
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,795
No way.

542
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:04,519
You want to tell me
what really happened today?

543
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,477
L...

544
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,398
Who's that?

545
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:14,798
That's my partner.

546
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,362
You better be glad you don't have to
mess with him.

547
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,035
That guy's into some crazy-ass shit.

548
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:23,285
Now, either you can tell me
where you put the foot...

549
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:26,798
...or you're gonna be dealing with
that crazy-ass motherfucker.

550
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:49,401
Big Shirley by a nose!

551
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:54,486
She won!

552
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:59,167
Oh, God, I just can't believe it.
I won $ 16.

553
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:00,693
I told you this would be fun.

554
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:04,092
- How much did you win?
- I don't know.

555
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,684
- Four thousand.
- Four thousand what?

556
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:09,091
Dollars.

557
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:23,490
And by the way, I had an affair
with a hairdresser last year.

558
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:28,489
- You did?
- Yep.

559
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:43,539
Are you a cup?
How many cups are you?

560
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,893
I'm a loaf of bread.

561
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:49,700
Hello?

562
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:52,417
Okay. Talk slowly.

563
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:58,782
I'm gonna see you in a few hours.

564
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:02,294
Slow down. Slower.

565
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:04,496
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

566
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:08,254
- Because you have to.
- Brenda.

567
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:12,944
Just stay there.
I'll call you in a half-hour.

568
00:41:13,146 --> 00:41:14,659
- Promise?
- I promise.

569
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:20,626
- Who was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

570
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:24,860
- I gotta go.
- Brenda, who was it?

571
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:29,507
Just someone else, okay?
Just back off.

572
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:34,067
I can't deal with this right now.
I'll call you.

573
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:44,381
I'm glad you're staying in town.

574
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:56,072
- He threw it out of his car?
- He was taking it to show some friends.

575
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,311
Then it hit him,
he might get in trouble.

576
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:01,506
What with people not supposed to
be in possession of others' feet.

577
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:04,149
- He tossed it out.
- I've gotta get home.

578
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,550
Just drop me off, and I'll
pick up my car later.

579
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,634
All right, I'll take a look
where he said he tossed it.

580
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:13,795
- You don't have to do that.
- Hey, how can I sleep?

581
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:16,067
Knowing that there's
a foot on the loose?

582
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:20,953
- You lost $25,000? It's just gone?
- I suppose it still exists.

583
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:23,274
It's just not mine anymore.

584
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:27,834
- I'm waiting for an explanation.
- Don't talk to me like a child.

585
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,233
I was on a...

586
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:31,157
What do you call it? A roll.

587
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,397
So I kept betting more and more,
and I just felt so good...

588
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,513
...like I was living someone else's life.
I was up $9000!

589
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,996
And then I started to lose.

590
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:45,592
And then I started to feel like me again,
and so I kept betting more and more...

591
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:48,635
...and losing more and more.
- You should've been more careful.

592
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,960
I don't want to be careful.
I want to feel alive.

593
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:55,155
There should be a way to do that
that's a little less expensive.

594
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:57,918
I have a right to make mistakes, Nate!

595
00:42:58,124 --> 00:43:00,513
You of all people shouldn't
begrudge me that.

596
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:07,799
What?

597
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:15,477
I lost $25,000. Okay, you got it
out of me. Now leave me alone!

598
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,966
Hey.

599
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,842
Claire?

600
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:44,921
- You're David's friend.
- Keith.

601
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:48,525
What's going on?

602
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:53,962
Not much.

603
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,452
So where's Claire now?

604
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:06,213
I gotta say I'm totally relieved.
That I didn't lose it.

605
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:09,051
Hey.

606
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,817
Nice job, Rico.

607
00:44:18,537 --> 00:44:21,973
- Thank you.
- Boy, they did do a marvelous job.

608
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:25,127
They ought to, they charged a fortune.

609
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:35,689
Can I assist you, Miss Romano?

610
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,253
I know it's silly...

611
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,534
...but I just wanted to see with my own
eyes that Pop's all put together right.

612
00:44:41,741 --> 00:44:43,777
We get to do that, don't we?

613
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,742
Okay. Good.

614
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:07,624
I think I'll be able
to sleep much better now.

615
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:22,340
- Rico, you gave him a foot?
- Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:24,425
I thought it was for the best.

617
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:26,823
Remember that leg of lamb
that your mother had...

618
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:29,543
...in the back of her freezer for forever?
- Okay, stop.

619
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:32,547
Embalmed, wrapped in latex
and duct tape.

620
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:37,343
I was following him home
to get it back when I saw him toss it.

621
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,018
Now I've been here for
hours, and I can't find it.

622
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,223
- Describe it to me again.
- It's a foot.

623
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,025
Why did you take it in the first place?

624
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,702
Well, at the time, it seemed like a good
way to pay him back for something.

625
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:52,267
I just wanted to shake him up.

626
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:56,182
I don't understand how guys
can be so unshakable.

627
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,029
I know what you mean.

628
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:03,627
Did you ever suck a guy's toe?

629
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:09,071
Yeah.

630
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:12,906
Me too.

631
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:19,273
Have you been
watching Mrs. Romano?

632
00:46:19,837 --> 00:46:21,555
Yeah.

633
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:24,033
Been watching her all night.

634
00:46:24,238 --> 00:46:26,069
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

635
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:29,032
Casket climber.

636
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:32,431
Her? She doesn't look that energetic.

637
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,395
Yeah. Those are the ones
that really go for it.

638
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,469
So we should probably have
a conversation with Rico...

639
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,831
...about what's going on with Kroehner.

640
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,357
Okay.

641
00:46:46,922 --> 00:46:50,551
So there was no baby christening
the other day. I lied.

642
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:53,633
But I only took one
meeting with Gilardi.

643
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:57,995
- You met with him? Why?
- Hey, Gilardi called me, okay?

644
00:46:58,203 --> 00:47:00,513
I have the right to consider my options.

645
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:03,079
My father put you
through mortuary school.

646
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:10,123
- I wanna go with you!
- Mrs. Romano! Mrs. Romano!

647
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:11,395
- It's okay.
- Mommy!

648
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:14,359
Grab her legs! It's okay.
It's okay. Here we go.

649
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:16,318
- Here we go, Mrs. Romano.
- I'm sorry.

650
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:25,043
I give up.

651
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:29,244
It's not here.

652
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:34,602
This probably isn't over.

653
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:42,001
If there's a lesson to be learned, it's
that your actions have consequences.

654
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:45,009
Yeah, well, Gabe should learn that.

655
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:52,803
I know you and my brother are,
like...

656
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,165
...gay.

657
00:47:57,853 --> 00:47:59,890
Okay.

658
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:05,252
What do you see in him?

659
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:12,093
- He's just David, you know?
- I know. That's why I'm asking.

660
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:17,415
He is smart. He's kind. He's funny.

661
00:48:19,017 --> 00:48:22,726
I know he can be a little uptight,
but underneath that, he's...

662
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:28,293
...such a little boy. Innocent.

663
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:29,534
And I like that.

664
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:34,216
Most of the men I meet, well...

665
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,775
...they kind of just want me
to be one thing.

666
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,290
What, like, big, black sex cop?

667
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,891
"Sorry I was speeding, officer, I guess
you'll have to punish me now. "

668
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,500
Yeah.

669
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:49,298
And I don't want to be that.
Rent a video.

670
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:51,100
David...

671
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,773
...he gets me.

672
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:59,459
When someone sees you as you
really are and wants to be with you...

673
00:48:59,824 --> 00:49:02,338
...that's powerful.

674
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:08,980
Whatever.

675
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:13,863
I wish I could know
the David you know.

676
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:17,060
You could be a little nicer to him.

677
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:19,258
He's under a lot of stress...

678
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:22,106
...with that cremation place
opening across the street.

679
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:26,025
What cremation place?

680
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:28,344
She stole a foot?

681
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,141
From a person?

682
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:33,898
Yes. Would it have been better
if it was an animal's?

683
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:35,178
A little bit.

684
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,826
You wake up one day
and your baby's stolen a foot.

685
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,580
- Where have I been?
- Losing $25,000.

686
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:48,423
Hey.

687
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:56,747
Okay, I've had a long day.

688
00:49:57,273 --> 00:50:00,550
Oh, David, I ran into your friend Keith.

689
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:04,310
- Who's Keith?
- You met at Dad's thing.

690
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:08,144
- I never met a Keith.
- Yes, you did, the cop.

691
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:10,073
I asked him to help out.

692
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:13,268
He'll see what he can do
about there not being an official report.

693
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:15,990
Why does this person have to be
so involved in our life?

694
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:19,587
Claire, we should probably talk about
getting you some help.

695
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:22,348
You are not my father.

696
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:26,748
If you need a project, get a dog.

697
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:30,916
Keith says the school's probably
gonna make me see a shrink anyway.

698
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,757
Oh, dear.

699
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:34,995
By the way, that house
across the street?

700
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,239
It's on fire.

701
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:02,038
I guess this should solve
all your problems.

702
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:21,076
Freckles!

703
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,201
Freckles!

704
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:26,444
Here, girl!

705
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,517
Freckles!

706
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:50,776
