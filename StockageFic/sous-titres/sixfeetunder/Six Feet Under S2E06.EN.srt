1
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,048
Over there. I just saw a fin.

2
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,171
Right. In the most polluted port in America?

3
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,447
-Nothing could live here.
-Really?

4
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,889
That makes me sad.
It looks so beautiful at night.

5
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:18,044
Yeah, so is Burbank.

6
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,848
-You're gorgeous, you know that?
-Shut up!

7
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,652
So why haven't you
ever talked to me before?

8
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,611
I was intimidated. You're very intimidating.

9
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:29,206
You're full of shit.

10
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,772
Of course they pick
a goddamn boat this year...

11
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:38,812
so nobody can leave
before Parkinson's jerk-off speech...

12
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,886
about what a fucking great company
this is, right?

13
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,088
Right.

14
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,490
Like anything that self-important fuck says
could change the fact...

15
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,724
that we'll be filing for bankruptcy
by the end of the year.

16
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,924
You're new here, aren't you?

17
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,925
Yeah, about six months.

18
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,481
I'd start sending out my résumé now...

19
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:02,206
unless you're one of
Parkinson's fucking inner circle.

20
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:03,971
If you are, then...

21
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:06,971
fuck me, right?

22
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,485
-Do you wanna go and get another drink?
-Please.

23
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:16,563
Excuse me. I guess I'm the asshole...

24
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,848
for telling the fucking truth!

25
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:20,682
Shit!

26
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,445
That's not fair.

27
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,929
You suck!

28
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,608
-Morning.
-God, you scared me!

29
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,045
-You're up early.
-I slept like a fucking baby.

30
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,013
-Yeah, me, too.
-After the night we had?

31
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,684
The sheer exhaustion factor alone.

32
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,492
Yeah, I gotta say it was worth the wait.

33
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,926
-So does this mean the ebb is over?
-For now.

34
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,492
Want a coffee?

35
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:08,765
-Wow, this is kind of racy.
-Hey, no!

36
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:13,445
-Is that your novel?
-I don't know what it is yet.

37
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,288
-When do I get to read it?
-When it's ready, if it's ever ready.

38
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,410
Well, who's Christina?
Is that your fictional alter ego?

39
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,370
Your Holden Caulfield?

40
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,126
She's more like my Humbert Humbert.

41
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,967
You know, my Constance Chatterley.

42
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,488
She's like Hermione
in the Harry Potter books.

43
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,325
What would you rather have:

44
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,688
some overly-educated gasbag like Trevor...

45
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:41,685
or a semi-literate fuck machine like me?
Come on.

46
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,367
That's a no-brainer. No pun intended.

47
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,163
I have something for you.

48
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:54,883
I know it's small, but it is a diamond.

49
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,487
You think I care about diamonds?

50
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,649
Will you marry me, Brenda Chenowith?

51
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,849
Haven't we done this already?

52
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,610
-What?
-I love you.

53
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:13,922
Good.

54
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,291
Something else?

55
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,691
I thought we could announce it to my family
at dinner tonight.

56
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,048
I was gonna ask my mom to make dinner.

57
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,249
Look, we have to do this sometime.

58
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,562
-And what about your family?
-Are you kidding?

59
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:32,929
They are way too consumed
in their own divorce drama to even notice.

60
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,652
Let's just not tell them and say that we did.

61
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,645
And what about Billy?

62
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,171
You know, I haven't really talked to him
for a while.

63
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:45,288
Why don't I make you pancakes
from scratch...

64
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,726
like a good little wife-to-be...

65
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,122
before I fuck your brains out
and send you to work?

66
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:51,443
How about we skip the pancakes?

67
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,886
Shit, you're already dressed?
Am I holding you up?

68
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,486
No, not really.

69
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:06,163
-Well, maybe a little.
-You've got the best shower.

70
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:10,132
Mine's just this weird bolt
sticking out of the wall that sends out mist.

71
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:12,966
It takes five minutes just to get wet.

72
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,887
How come I always stay here?
It's time for you to stay at my place.

73
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:20,443
-After that great recommendation?
-It's nice.

74
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,411
MGM built it back in the '30s
to house starlets.

75
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,527
Great parquet floors,
unbelievable molding...

76
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:31,243
but some idiot did an '80s retro-fit
and ripped out all the good fixtures.

77
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,649
I'll be happy to stay at your house,
fixtures aside.

78
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,247
You know, I never thought
you'd call me back after that second date.

79
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,402
Why?

80
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:49,090
Because I never think
the good guys are gonna call back.

81
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,606
Who said I'm a good guy?

82
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,332
Well, it's been three weeks.
That's usually a sign.

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,962
Check with me in three months.
I'll tell you how you're doing.

84
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,931
Good morning. Sit. Have some breakfast.

85
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,602
-Most important meal of the day.
-Good morning, dear.

86
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,212
Apparently.

87
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,328
How would you like your eggs?

88
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:19,932
Surprise me.

89
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:25,129
Now, this is good, yeah?
All together for breakfast.

90
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:31,763
Well, I see it's Good Neighbor Day
at the Fisher house.

91
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:35,532
David, was that a new friend I saw
leaving this morning?

92
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:38,730
-Mom, please, I'd rather not discuss...
-What does he do?

93
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,486
He's a public defender.

94
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,849
You should have asked him in for breakfast.
We'd all like to meet him.

95
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:47,005
Yes, bring him next time.
I would like to meet him.

96
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,727
Where's Nate?
We have an intake in 15 minutes.

97
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:53,930
He called from the car.
There was an accident on the 10...

98
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:57,085
and he told me to ask everyone
to be here for dinner tonight.

99
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:59,812
He has something important to tell us.

100
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:03,004
A big family dinner.

101
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,291
It will be fun.

102
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,730
Everybody had gotten off...

103
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,851
and the lights were on.

104
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:15,809
You could see what a dumpy little boat
it actually was....

105
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,372
And he just wasn't there.

106
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:25,924
-It's hard to believe right now, but time...
-I got dumped at a party in college once...

107
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:28,362
it was the Kappa Sig luau...

108
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,567
by some guy whose name
I don't even remember.

109
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,882
The sun was coming up, and I just...

110
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,090
sat there staring at this stupid pig carcass...

111
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,607
in my stupid Hawaiian-print sundress.

112
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,125
Mrs. Collins, have you thought about...

113
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:48,602
Matthew and I had been married
for almost 20 years.

114
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,490
Can you believe that?

115
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,568
I met him when I was barely 20.

116
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:59,851
And now he's dead...

117
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:05,127
and I'm just that much closer to it.

118
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,851
I'm sorry, we don't allow smoking inside.

119
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:15,731
Please put that out. It's against
California State Law. We could be fined.

120
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,121
Sorry.

121
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,926
How long will it take?

122
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,005
It depends on the kind of service
you were thinking of.

123
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,766
Length of visitation,
should you choose an open casket...

124
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:40,287
My husband was dredged up
from Long Beach Harbor...

125
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,933
with a propeller slice
halfway down his body.

126
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:44,765
Closed casket, then.

127
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,970
How much? I can't spend a lot of money.

128
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:53,090
We're probably looking at around $7,000.

129
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:55,212
That seems like a lot.

130
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,807
It's about average, maybe a little less.

131
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,963
We'll take care of everything...

132
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,408
make it as easy on you as possible.

133
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,209
I need to think about this.

134
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:13,206
-Of course. Let us know what you decide.
-I can show myself out.

135
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:20,082
-Shopping around for the best deal.
-Isn't that her right?

136
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,164
She's wasting our time.

137
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,641
Oh, dear, when did you get so dried out?
You must be thirsty.

138
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,442
The flowers are lovely, Sarah. Thank you.

139
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,603
I just cut them on my walk
through the canyon.

140
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,923
Don't worry, you didn't put me out one bit.

141
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:52,565
This kitchen is exactly the same.

142
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,332
Yes, it is.

143
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,006
You look well.

144
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,566
-So do you.
-I only just got your messages.

145
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,086
I was in Madrid.

146
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,926
I wanted to stay through Christmas,
but I ran out of money.

147
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,732
The reason I was calling was because....

148
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,967
What I want to say was that...

149
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,532
I forgive you.

150
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,929
You're the only family,
apart from the children, that I have left.

151
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,925
I didn't want more time to go by
with our not talking.

152
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,846
We're sisters. We shouldn't be estranged.

153
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,565
I took this course called The Plan.

154
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:33,730
You did The Plan? You're shitting me.

155
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:37,284
That is so great, Ruth. You, of all people.

156
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,682
-What's that supposed to mean?
-No, it's very brave.

157
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:43,129
I know it couldn't have been easy for you.
I did it back in the '70s...

158
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:46,046
when it was still called
"Transitional Focus. "

159
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,131
Before Ernst Vollhoffer was busted
for tax evasion...

160
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,885
and sold it to the Canadians.

161
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:53,168
That's when it became The Plan.

162
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,964
I met Vollhoffer at a party once...

163
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,450
and he came on to me.

164
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:03,125
But I'd just dropped acid for the first time...

165
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,646
and I thought he was
some Mayan death priest...

166
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,521
who wanted to cut out my heart
and throw it into a pit.

167
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,651
So I blew him off.

168
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:23,490
Catherine Collins has decided to go
with the Unger mortuary.

169
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,165
Well, I guess that's that.

170
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:27,562
Unger is a Kroehner home, Nate.

171
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,686
Yeah, so?

172
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:32,765
So Kroehner charges about double
what we do.

173
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,041
That's the third funeral
Kroehner has stolen from us...

174
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,886
since Mitzi Huntley came to visit.
They are after us again.

175
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,089
Look, now you're just being dramatic.

176
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,892
This from a man
who basically lives in denial.

177
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:49,571
Look, Stan told me at lunch last week
that Kroehner stock had taken a nosedive.

178
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,645
Why would they be wasting their time
with small potatoes like us?

179
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:56,248
Maybe because you told Mitzi
to shove her good-faith gesture up her ass?

180
00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:00,326
I told you guys that Kroehner wasn't
gonna let up, but nobody listens to me.

181
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,371
Not now, Federico. We needed that funeral.

182
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,842
How else are we paying for the fine
from the DCA?

183
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,367
That's $1,800 we don't have right now.

184
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,125
I asked you to check the proof.

185
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:13,046
No license number on a billboard
opposite a retirement home...

186
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,125
makes us look like amateurs.
We cannot afford to be vulnerable.

187
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:20,092
I'm not comfortable starting
on this woman's perm until I have a photo.

188
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,687
Any idea when that's supposed to arrive?

189
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:25,207
I have an inspector coming to my house
this afternoon.

190
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,887
It came in this morning
and I put it in her file...

191
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,726
which you would know
if you bothered to look.

192
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,973
I'm calling Catherine,
and I'm going to lowball Unger.

193
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:40,683
Even if we cut our profits in half,
we can show Kroehner we're willing to fight.

194
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:51,567
Hey, Mom.

195
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,322
Hello.

196
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:55,492
Who are you?

197
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,370
I'm your Aunt Sarah.

198
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:02,730
Claire, the Goddess
is clearly manifesting through you.

199
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,122
-It's very obvious.
-Thanks.

200
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:08,050
I thought you were dead.

201
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:14,204
The skin like milk. Treasure it while it lasts.

202
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,843
Ruth, you told your daughter I was dead?

203
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,366
Shame on you.

204
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,569
I never told her any such thing.

205
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,531
Claire, why would you lie about that?

206
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:28,730
Whenever you talked about her,
it just sounded like she was dead.

207
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,132
I just assumed.

208
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:32,813
Well, I've made a miraculous recovery.

209
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,483
Tell me exactly what you were feeling
when you made this.

210
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,604
-Boredom.
-Liar.

211
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:49,412
There's anger and yearning...

212
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:53,811
passion, resentment of the status quo,
some jealousy of it, as well.

213
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:58,328
Not the most original perspective,
but it's authentic.

214
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:00,891
I love this!

215
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:06,603
The technique: very precise, very adult.

216
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:11,763
The death of romance
in a regimented, artificial world.

217
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,521
Lovely.

218
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:16,645
Actually, I found it in the garbage.

219
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:20,965
My dad threw it out after a funeral.
I thought it looked cool, so I kept it.

220
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:24,964
You're an artist, Claire.

221
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:28,407
-Please.
-I'm not saying you're any good, yet.

222
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:32,566
But if you focus and live fully,
you could become something.

223
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,243
If you're lucky and don't self-destruct.

224
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,244
-Right.
-You've got an eye.

225
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,484
You see through the veil.

226
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,243
It's a blessing and a curse.

227
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,482
Okay.

228
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:49,045
You need something red
in your relationship corner...

229
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:52,250
like a red velvet pillow.

230
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,930
Something bordello-ey.

231
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:58,210
You're resisting the carnal.
That's your mother rubbing off on you.

232
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:02,730
Put a plant in your knowledge corner
if you want to grow into your potential.

233
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:06,729
What is that, Feng Shui?
You're kidding, right?

234
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,652
You can drop the generic apathy crap.

235
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:13,843
That's just laziness.
You're more than that and you know it.

236
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:20,203
Hey, baby, sorry I'm late.

237
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,329
Rico, we are fucked.

238
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,926
It's definitely mold.

239
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:27,130
I told you so. See, this is why
Julio's cold don't get any better.

240
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,647
Maybe you've got structural damage
in your chimney...

241
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,691
and water's leaking in.
When the rain starts, it'll get worse.

242
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,172
Okay, what can we do?

243
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,245
I got to rip this all out
and see what's going on inside.

244
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,291
Maybe we can patch things up,
maybe it'll be bigger than that.

245
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:43,604
-How much is it all gonna cost?
-You got serious water damage here.

246
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,845
It could be anywhere from $3,000
to maybe $7,000 if your roof is involved.

247
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,685
Excuse me one second.

248
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,242
-We can get Ramon to fix it.
-Fix it?

249
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,530
He didn't even spot it. You heard him.
There's serious water damage.

250
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:01,764
-Any idiot would know that.
-Don't call my cousin an idiot.

251
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,411
Okay, no, I'll call you an idiot...

252
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:06,371
because you were too cheap
to get a real inspector initially.

253
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,681
I'm an idiot?

254
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,333
Maybe it wasn't the smartest idea
to go to your sister...

255
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:14,372
and buy this piece-of-shit house
behind my back. Now you think about that.

256
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,369
-God damn it!
-What happened?

257
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,372
I just got snapped running a red light.

258
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:26,923
We are living in a motherfucking
police state, I tell you what!

259
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,685
Any calls while I was at lunch?

260
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:32,561
The Unger mortuary called to say the funeral
we poached from Fisher & Sons...

261
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,372
-is going back to them.
-You're kidding!

262
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,927
We undercut them by almost $500.

263
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,766
Well, now they've undercut us
by nearly $1,000.

264
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,651
Oh, my God, I love this!

265
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,290
They're cute,
but they are such bad businessmen.

266
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,170
Well, they won't last.

267
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,124
What have I got tomorrow?

268
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,646
Your trainer at 9:00...

269
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,850
then back-to-back performance reviews
from 1:00 to 5:00.

270
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,924
Cancel everything except the trainer.

271
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,082
All right.

272
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:06,291
I think I need to spend a little quality time
with the fabulous Fisher boys.

273
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:12,325
-Ruth, do you have any tarragon?
-All the spices are in that cabinet.

274
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,245
Well, now I know what to get you
for Christmas.

275
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,372
Dean & Deluca have these
fantastic spices in test tubes.

276
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,411
Very mad scientist. You'll love them.

277
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,882
-What are you making?
-I'm not sure yet.

278
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,691
I'm making Chicken Kiev.

279
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,082
I bought all the ingredients
to make Chicken Kiev.

280
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,368
So we'll make Chicken Kiev.

281
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,448
Have tarragon, will travel.

282
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:38,561
Tarragon is not listed in the ingredients.

283
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,372
Following instructions?
Where's the creativity in that?

284
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,444
Cooking is alchemy, not a science.

285
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,649
It is if you want it to turn out right.

286
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,201
Is there anything I can do to help?

287
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,127
Smell.

288
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,411
This vodka is from Poland. You will like it.

289
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:02,051
Ruthie, why don't you join us?

290
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,682
Thank you, but I'll wait till dinner is served
to have a glass of wine.

291
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,331
Okay, suit yourself.

292
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,602
Where you learning to speak the Russian?

293
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,685
It's a long story.
Let's just say there was a man involved.

294
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,684
Of course there was.

295
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,082
Claire, when you are finished
mixing the herbs in...

296
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:40,768
you want to form the butter into little logs.
Eight of them.

297
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:44,172
No, not at all. It's deliciously sensual.

298
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,483
Wash your hands first, Claire.

299
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,003
You wild woman.

300
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,926
Nikolai is adorable and hot.

301
00:19:56,573 --> 00:20:00,486
The sex must be spectacular! Good for you.

302
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,482
Oh, my God!

303
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,962
You're all grown up,
but your face is still 12 years old.

304
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:17,647
David, you remember your Aunt Sarah?

305
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,685
Yes, hi.

306
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:22,885
I'm sure you couldn't forget her if you tried.

307
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,612
-David, have some vodka.
-Yes.

308
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,969
This is so surreal.

309
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,569
The engagement dinner.

310
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:36,692
I feel like I'm in a training movie from
the '50s about how normal people behave.

311
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,809
Well, my family's anything but normal.

312
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,202
Compared to mine,
they're the fucking Cleavers.

313
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:44,205
Just relax and enjoy yourself, all right?
You look gorgeous.

314
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,329
-Everybody loves you.
-Not your mother.

315
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,973
All you have to do is sit back...

316
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,966
and be the center of attention, all right?
Come on.

317
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:58,483
So, Linda, what do you do?

318
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:02,090
-It's Brenda.
-Forgive me, I'm drunk.

319
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:04,205
It's all Nikolai's fault.

320
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:08,411
He's been plying me with vodka
since the moment he arrived.

321
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,924
I'm a massage therapist.

322
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:14,849
She's an amazing massage therapist,
and she's writing a novel.

323
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,048
You are?

324
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,966
I'm writing something.
We'll see what it turns into.

325
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,772
Have you ever read
Charlotte Light and Dark?

326
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:24,731
-Yes.
-Well, she's Charlotte.

327
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:28,164
-I didn't know that.
-What is this, Charlotte light and who?

328
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,972
It's this book
about this girl who's being analyzed...

329
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:33,931
and she's smarter than the people
who are analyzing her.

330
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:37,642
And so she's constantly fucking with them.
It's hilarious.

331
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:42,568
You continue to be drawn
to strong, complex women. Bravo.

332
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,088
Mom, this dinner is delicious.

333
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,769
I think it's a little sour, myself.

334
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,845
-No, it's one of the best you've ever made.
-It's great.

335
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,969
-Here, more vodka?
-Please.

336
00:21:57,613 --> 00:22:00,366
I had a lover who was Russian.

337
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,045
He once told me...

338
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,842
that vodka was to Russians
what therapy is to Americans.

339
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,722
Something habit-forming and expensive...

340
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:12,488
that totally destroys your ability
to lead an authentic life.

341
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,127
Sorry, both my parents are shrinks.

342
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:20,487
And that was very painful for you.

343
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:24,407
But if it weren't for that, you probably
wouldn't be writing your novel, right?

344
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:28,725
Speaking of creativity, is everyone aware
of the budding artist in the family?

345
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:31,812
-No, who?
-You haven't seen Claire's work?

346
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,731
Shame on you. She needs feedback...

347
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,805
even if it's just so she can learn to ignore it.

348
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:41,442
Claire, I know so many creative people
from all over the world.

349
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:45,287
You must come stay with me
in Topanga Canyon and meet some of them.

350
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:46,522
Okay.

351
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,408
What?

352
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,484
Now's as good a time as any, I guess.

353
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:09,249
The reason that I wanted us all
to get together for dinner tonight...

354
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,166
is that Brenda and I
have decided to get married.

355
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:15,933
Good, married. This calls for a toast, yes?

356
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:17,651
Absolutely!

357
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,292
There you go. Something to toast with.

358
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:24,284
To romantic love:

359
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,571
both the inspiration and utter folly of it.

360
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,482
Thank you. That's really kind.

361
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,967
-Cheers.
-Congratulations.

362
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,206
So, Linda, I never would have taken you
as the type to get married.

363
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:42,646
Show us the ring.

364
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,008
Yeah, don't blink.
You might miss the diamond.

365
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:48,130
-Here you go.
-No, it's beautiful.

366
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:50,443
It's lovely. Ruth, did you see?

367
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,125
Yes, very nice.

368
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:56,723
I'll go put on some coffee.

369
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,327
Is there any more of that vodka left?

370
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,610
Ruthie, what's wrong?

371
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:21,929
Your son is going to marry.
This is a beautiful thing.

372
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:24,527
It's been a long day, that's all. I'm fine.

373
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,204
Just look at this mess.

374
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,210
Don't worry. I'm going to help you clean up.

375
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:44,046
Thank you.

376
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:50,411
God, there is so much emotion to navigate
where family is concerned.

377
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,691
Vicodin anyone?

378
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:56,771
No, thanks, I'm fine.

379
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,686
Okay, what's the deal
with me going to Topanga Canyon?

380
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,604
Mom totally freaked.

381
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:05,967
No one ever told you? Oh, my!

382
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,932
It seems I'm a terrible influence.

383
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,853
David and I went to stay
with Aunt Sarah one weekend...

384
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,969
and I kind of lost my virginity.

385
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,725
How old were you?

386
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,283
-Fifteen.
-How old was she?

387
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:24,445
-I'm not sure. 20-something.
-She was 32.

388
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:27,846
Oh, my God, that's totally fucked up!

389
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:32,211
Your mother has never forgiven me
and she never will, no matter what she says.

390
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:36,172
Granted, there was an awful moment
when David was lost...

391
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:40,132
but he was found completely unharmed
in the canyon the next morning.

392
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:44,768
Damn, I miss out on all the best stuff
in this family.

393
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:48,808
Well, that was a disaster.
Your mother hates me more than ever now.

394
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,963
-She does not hate you.
-Come on, Nate.

395
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,884
Who cares if she does?

396
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,169
I'm just glad it's over.

397
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,088
On to the next. We have a whole lifetime...

398
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:03,768
of tense and uncomfortable
family gatherings to look forward to.

399
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:23,412
-Hello?
-Hey, where have you been?

400
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:27,448
We had kind of a family dinner.

401
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,410
My brother's getting married.

402
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,688
-Are you drunk?
-Yes.

403
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,242
My mother's boyfriend kept pouring vodka.

404
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,370
I'm gonna have
such a fucking headache tomorrow.

405
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,444
Your mom's boyfriend was there?

406
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,842
So how come you didn't invite me?

407
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:46,126
Because I knew it would be excruciating...

408
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,010
and I wanted to spare you?

409
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:53,125
I wish you were here, or me there.

410
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,408
Why?

411
00:26:56,693 --> 00:27:00,163
So we could have hot sex
and then fall asleep together.

412
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:03,209
You could always come over here.

413
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:05,682
I'm too drunk. I shouldn't drive.

414
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,129
Or I could come over there.

415
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:10,647
I'm too drunk. I shouldn't drive.

416
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:17,003
Take some aspirin before you go to bed,
and vitamin C. Drink lots of water.

417
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:20,729
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

418
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:22,007
Okay, bye.

419
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,407
Hey, Mom.

420
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,164
Here, let me help you.

421
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,412
You ready?

422
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:44,051
You should have used
your grandmother's ring.

423
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:46,642
God knows your brother
isn't going to use it.

424
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,406
And who knows
if Claire will ever settle down.

425
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,085
That ring was for you.

426
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,846
-I didn't even know about it...
-You are the firstborn...

427
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,812
and probably the only opportunity
for grandchildren that I will ever live to see.

428
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,487
Mom, you never even told me about it.

429
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,404
What I think this is really about
is you don't like Brenda.

430
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:11,085
That's not true.

431
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:14,201
I just don't want you to get hurt.

432
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:16,091
Is she pregnant?

433
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,526
No, she's not.

434
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:22,322
But she is the woman I love, Mom.

435
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:27,123
You may not think she's the best person for
me, but I do, and I need you to accept that.

436
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,442
We're glad you came back to Fisher & Sons.

437
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,843
You gave me the best price.
That's the only reason I'm here.

438
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:50,484
That other place wanted me to sign
some waiver before I could see the body.

439
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:52,571
Do you want me to do that, as well?

440
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:55,372
Mrs. Collins,
I don't think you want to go through that.

441
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:58,286
Your husband's body
experienced severe trauma.

442
00:28:58,373 --> 00:28:59,772
It's beyond restoration.

443
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:02,651
Restoration? No, I don't want him restored.

444
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,491
What's the point?

445
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,687
Perhaps we should choose a casket.

446
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:15,047
You think it's a day like any other.

447
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:19,290
What you don't realize
is that anything can happen.

448
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,771
And then it does.

449
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:24,166
It happens.

450
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:28,245
And there's so much left unsaid.

451
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:32,162
And it was all just wasted time.

452
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,211
I just want somebody
to help me understand.

453
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:42,332
Just to help.

454
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,525
Can you help me?

455
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:54,286
The first line of C. S. Lewis'
A Grief Observed is:

456
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:57,490
"No one ever told me grief felt so like fear. "

457
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:01,051
I'll get you a copy. I think it will help.

458
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,210
It's going to be okay.

459
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,006
No, it's not.

460
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:17,772
What's wrong?

461
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,448
Doesn't it ever get you down?

462
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:24,245
Sure, all the time.

463
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:28,930
You know, I keep thinking
it's going to get easier, but it just doesn't.

464
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:30,811
No, it doesn't.

465
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,723
It just gets more familiar.

466
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,608
Hello? Anybody home?

467
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,407
Hello?

468
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:53,847
Don't you two look sharp!
Just as sharp as a couple of little tacks.

469
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:56,527
Miss Huntley. What can we do for you?

470
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,002
Well, for one thing, you can call me Mitzi.

471
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:00,924
Stop being so goddamn formal.

472
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:05,006
Now, how come y'all have not thanked me
for this snazzy casket wall?

473
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:10,442
Maybe I should thank you for selling
our beautiful and highly profitable caskets.

474
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:15,084
Seeing as how you've bought up, absorbed,
and shut down every other competitor?

475
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,209
What the fuck do you want?

476
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,404
What the fuck do I want?

477
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:24,652
I want you boys to come the fuck with me
on a little fucking trip.

478
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,246
What do you fucking say?

479
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,732
What kind of fucking trip?

480
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:29,769
Well, see, now that's a secret.

481
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:32,686
-We're very busy.
-Well, I suggest you get unbusy.

482
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,491
I understand Fisher & Sons...

483
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:37,929
forgot to put their license number
on a recently-printed advertisement.

484
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:40,971
We've already been fined for that.
So you can just turn around...

485
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:42,771
No, I'm not talking about the billboard.

486
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:46,528
I'm talking about the two-column incher
in the funeral pages of the FILENAME.

487
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,410
It's run three weeks in a row now.

488
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:52,008
So that is three fines that you can avoid
if you just...

489
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,881
drop the attitude and come with me.

490
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,209
Federico, hi, it's David.

491
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,523
Nate and I are tied up
for the rest of the day...

492
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,764
so we need you to pick up the Collins body
from the Unger mortuary.

493
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:12,129
-You can't just expect me to drop...
-Federico, I need you to do this.

494
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,328
Fine.

495
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:17,171
Collins? You bad boy.

496
00:32:17,253 --> 00:32:20,404
That wasn't very nice of you,
stealing a funeral from us.

497
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,768
-One that you stole from us first.
-Oh, please.

498
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,321
This whole self-righteous
chip-on-the-shoulder thing...

499
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:27,643
kind of worked for Russell Crowe
in Gladiator.

500
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:30,088
But you don't have the special effects
to back it up.

501
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:32,164
You get a big kick out of yourself,
don't you?

502
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,608
And you are a big stick-in-the-mud,
aren't you?

503
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:35,967
Lighten up.

504
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:39,045
The whole purpose of this trip
is to have fun.

505
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,725
Just ask Bobo.

506
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,964
I said, now what's Mitzi doing
hiding all the way in the back?

507
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,170
Hi, darling, you know the Fishers?

508
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:49,687
-Bobo.
-Good to see you guys again.

509
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:53,368
Well, I need to mingle.
I'm not being a very good hostess.

510
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:57,491
She's quite a little spitfire, isn't she?

511
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,133
So when did you all become members?

512
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:01,407
Members?

513
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:05,850
Nothing beats flying out to Palm Springs
twice a month for a little golf.

514
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:09,209
You know, I met Merv Griffin last time.
Hell of a guy.

515
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,648
We're never selling to Kroehner.

516
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,892
Well, then you're idiots. No offense.

517
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,367
It must have been fun
having a sister growing up.

518
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:19,921
"Fun" is not the word I would choose.

519
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:22,573
God, I can't believe
I never even met her before.

520
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:26,726
It's for the best. Sarah has no boundaries
and she's completely self-involved.

521
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,373
She would have only disappointed you.

522
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,372
Whatever.

523
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:40,050
You know that I think if you work hard...

524
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:43,330
you can be good
at whatever you put your mind to.

525
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:45,405
Yeah, sure, Mom.

526
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,083
How long is my house gonna be like this?

527
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:59,243
This is a big job. You got to be patient.

528
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,769
Patient? Where was patient when
you told us to buy a house full of mold?

529
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,367
I'm not a licensed house inspector.
You knew that.

530
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,604
Besides, you should call that realtor
and sue her for nondisclosure.

531
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:11,526
Shit. I got to head down to Long Beach
before rush hour.

532
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:15,288
No, come on, baby. You got to stay here.
You have to deal with this.

533
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,927
I got to pick up a body.
That's what pays the mortgage.

534
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:20,686
-Let David do it. What are you, his lapdog?
-Shut up!

535
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:24,209
-Just shut up. Can you do that for once?
-Rico, calm down, man.

536
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:27,365
She's just stressed with the mess
and two kids. Who wouldn't be?

537
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:29,683
-Cut her some slack.
-Thank you.

538
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:32,445
I'm out of here.

539
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,970
He can be a real pain.

540
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,927
Yeah, you don't have to tell me that.

541
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:44,131
Don't you worry. We'll get this fixed
just as soon as we can, okay?

542
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,850
The house was built in '59 for Frank Sinatra.

543
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,242
If these walls could talk.

544
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,964
I don't even want to know what all happened
on that coffee table. Come on.

545
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,886
You see what you boys are missing?
This is the life.

546
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:05,725
Don't hurt yourself, Bobo.

547
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:09,931
Would you be a dear darling and fix us up
another batch of those frozen margaritas?

548
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,651
Thank you, lovely.

549
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,883
-She's single.
-I'm engaged.

550
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,164
Yeah, well, I'm married.

551
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:20,690
There are swimsuits and towels and such
in the cabana out by the pool.

552
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,806
Pepper used to be
captain of the USC swim team.

553
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,884
Now he's trying to make it as an actor.

554
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,089
God, they're a dime a dozen, aren't they?

555
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:33,812
-Why are we here?
-To have fun.

556
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:37,681
My God, boy, I don't even think
you know what that is.

557
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,241
Listen to me. I understand...

558
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,645
exactly how exhausting and depressing
running a small business like yours can be.

559
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:48,169
Your only job today
is to forget about all that.

560
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:51,322
Enjoy.

561
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,408
Well?

562
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,091
We should at least try to have a good time.

563
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:30,206
What's up?

564
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:33,041
I was just leaving you some laundry.

565
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,452
Thanks.

566
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,801
You got room for me in there, boys?

567
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,763
I want you to know Matt Gilardi
never got to come here.

568
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,329
Is that supposed to make us feel better
about how he harassed us?

569
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,404
And how you're continuing to harass us?

570
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:04,406
Please, you boys have got to get over
this victim mentality.

571
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:11,449
Finally, the sales pitch.

572
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:18,962
That's considerably more money
than we've ever offered you.

573
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,803
You know, this was our father's business.

574
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,248
It's not something
we can just walk away from.

575
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,972
David, nobody is asking you to leave.

576
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,967
We like things just the way they are.

577
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:32,806
We like our lives just the way they are.

578
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:44,364
Honey, it may be tomorrow,
it may be 10 years from now...

579
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:46,887
but y'all are going under.
It is just evolution.

580
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:50,852
Kroehner's got the size, resources,
market share, lobbyists in Washington.

581
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:53,242
What do y'all got? Your pride.

582
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:59,131
Car's leaving for the airport in five minutes.
Y'all better hurry.

583
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,562
Should we have taken that offer?

584
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:20,488
-What?
-Why are we doing this?

585
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:24,882
Fighting so hard? Maybe she's right.
Maybe this is a losing battle.

586
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,851
Don't tell me you got seduced by a hot tub.

587
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:31,324
So she dangled a fat check in front of us.
So the fuck what?

588
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:35,652
No, we can't give up, David, all right?
We can't. We just can't.

589
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,011
No medication?

590
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:51,609
Have you told Brenda yet?

591
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,330
Yeah, like a week ago.

592
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,167
-How'd she take it?
-You know Brenda.

593
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:01,526
She pretends to be stronger than all of us.

594
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:20,812
Hey, you.

595
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,762
I didn't think you were coming.

596
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,891
Well, you know me.
I can't sleep without you.

597
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:39,971
You're the only thing in my life that works.

598
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:46,565
Oh, shit.

599
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,806
My client.

600
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,525
I got to get this.

601
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,209
Oh, God, I love you so much.

602
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,925
I just love you.

603
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:27,810
I enjoyed the sermon.

604
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,612
So do you have to work today?

605
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:31,331
-Not really.
-Good.

606
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:34,042
I thought you had to prepare
for a hearing tomorrow.

607
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:37,648
I'm thinking about blowing that off.
The guy's totally guilty.

608
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,883
I'd rather spend the day with you.

609
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:47,809
Hey, I didn't know you were here.

610
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:51,169
That's a big-ass lie.
I saw you staring in church.

611
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:53,562
-Who's this?
-This is Taylor.

612
00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:56,167
-Taylor, this is my friend Ben.
-Hi.

613
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:00,126
So how are you?

614
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:04,727
-You want to go over and say hi?
-No, we'll be late for the movie.

615
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,849
You guys not talking now?

616
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:09,362
We had an argument. It's nothing.

617
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:13,765
Taylor, come on. Got to go.

618
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:15,892
I miss you.

619
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:18,087
Me, too.

620
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:26,372
Who's she?

621
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:29,807
Her uncle's an old friend of mine.

622
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:32,521
Roll onto your back, nice and slow.

623
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:39,167
I'm sorry. Happens to me all the time.

624
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:43,805
It's nothing I haven't seen before,
so don't be embarrassed.

625
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:45,884
Who said I'm embarrassed?

626
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,567
Easy.

627
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:14,487
Feels good.

628
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:16,211
-Like that?
-Yeah.

629
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:22,881
Harder.

630
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,842
Oh, God! Yeah.

631
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:30,605
Yeah, faster.

632
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:36,721
Come on.

633
00:43:57,773 --> 00:43:59,126
So thanks.

634
00:44:00,493 --> 00:44:03,451
Can I make another appointment
for next week?

635
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,532
I don't think that's such a good idea.

636
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:09,242
Okay.

637
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:12,447
I don't think I can see you again.

638
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:16,089
Well, thanks again.

639
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:18,812
Take care.

640
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:38,048
I know your brother doesn't want me to,
but I have to see him.

641
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:42,331
I really don't think you should
put yourself through that before the service.

642
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,051
There's been no restoration.

643
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,408
Seeing him like this
could make it that much worse.

644
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:49,007
I spent over half of my life with that man.

645
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:51,766
I slept with him every night for 20 years.

646
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:53,923
Please just let me see him.

647
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:57,289
I have to see him once more.

648
00:44:58,133 --> 00:45:00,488
I want to see him.

649
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,332
All right.

650
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:36,763
Look at you now, you fucking pig!

651
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,490
I'm glad you're dead!

652
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:41,929
I'm fucking glad!

653
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:44,773
And I hope it hurt like hell!

654
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:55,643
He can't hit me anymore...

655
00:45:57,093 --> 00:45:58,321
can he?

656
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:06,806
Thank you.

657
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,932
I could really love you, David Fisher.

658
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:50,606
Not quite the response I was hoping for.

659
00:46:55,453 --> 00:46:59,162
-I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
-I'm sorry.

660
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,851
I'm really sorry.

661
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:06,963
I like you a lot, Ben.

662
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:09,008
But?

663
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:18,327
But I'm in love with someone else.

664
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:20,727
I see.

665
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:24,646
And when exactly
were you planning on telling me this?

666
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:28,567
It's not that I haven't enjoyed
being with you. You're a great guy.

667
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:31,565
You're a catch, and he's not even available.

668
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,683
I don't want to lie to you.

669
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:42,965
I just thought
it would be a good idea for me...

670
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:46,363
to get involved with someone else,
you know, healthy.

671
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:47,642
Great.

672
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:51,203
So next you'll be saying
you just want to be friends.

673
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:55,647
Well, now I know why you never wanted
to introduce me to your family.

674
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,846
Organic herbs and spices
from the Farmers Market.

675
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:12,811
-Is Claire here?
-No, I don't know where she is.

676
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:16,569
If I'm going to avoid traffic,
I'm going to have to miss her. Damn.

677
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:19,690
Tell her this is for her knowledge corner.

678
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:21,884
She'll know what to do.

679
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:24,282
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

680
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:27,572
Okay, Ruth, what the hell is going on?

681
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:29,245
What's going on?

682
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,321
You waltz in here after 20 years...

683
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,450
insulting my cooking,
getting drunk with my boyfriend...

684
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:38,093
filling my daughter's head
with all kinds of ideas...

685
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:40,892
and reminding my sons
of traumatic events in their lives.

686
00:48:40,973 --> 00:48:45,364
Jesus Christ, the boy
was gonna lose his virginity sooner or later.

687
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:48,331
And Fiona is a great woman.
Very compassionate...

688
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:49,528
He was molested!

689
00:48:49,613 --> 00:48:53,447
He was a horny 15-year-old
who couldn't believe his good luck.

690
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:57,802
I shouldn't be surprised you won't take
any responsibility. You never have.

691
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,851
Okay, that's what this is about.

692
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,607
When mother died, someone had to step up.

693
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:06,844
Someone had to take care of Nanny,
but you just did as you pleased.

694
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,003
You never let anybody help you.

695
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:13,211
God forbid anything should interfere
with you feeling sorry for yourself!

696
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:16,444
If that's what you need to believe
to justify your own selfishness...

697
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,922
What do you want me to say, Ruth?

698
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:20,492
I want you to apologize.

699
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:25,089
Fine. I apologize!
Does that make it any better?

700
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,245
No, because you had more fun than I did!

701
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,168
Fun?

702
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:37,928
The only man I ever loved...

703
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:40,891
died when I was 21.

704
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:48,212
The children I so desperately wanted
were impossible...

705
00:49:48,773 --> 00:49:51,651
because my ovaries are dry as stone.

706
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:55,204
And I'm a terrible artist...

707
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,807
but I surround myself with people...

708
00:49:57,893 --> 00:50:00,771
who have talent that I will never realize.

709
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,130
It's all hard, Ruth.

710
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:08,242
We just made different choices.

711
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:24,768
I'm sorry. I didn't know about the ovaries.

712
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:32,046
It's fine.

713
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:38,123
I'm sorry about Nathaniel.

714
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:40,732
Thank you.

715
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:45,282
I got your flowers a couple of months later.

716
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:48,286
I was in Peru.

717
00:50:58,173 --> 00:51:00,050
Let me finish mopping.

718
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:18,724
-How's the writing?
-Good, really good.

719
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,329
Somebody had a good day.

720
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:28,084
It's just this woman...

721
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:33,248
who was screaming at the mangled body
of her dead husband who used to beat her.

722
00:51:39,093 --> 00:51:43,052
Can you imagine hating someone that much
and staying with them for 20 years?

723
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:47,365
What makes you think people stay together
because it makes them happy?

724
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,126
Promise me...

725
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:56,013
if things ever start to go nutso,
or you ever hate me...

726
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:58,368
that we'll deal with it.
We won't just cover it up?

727
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:02,685
Don't worry, I'll be long gone
before you can hate me.

728
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:06,813
I don't think I could ever hate you.

729
00:52:07,853 --> 00:52:10,321
Besides, we know what we're doing here.

730
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:11,812
Absolutely.

731
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,169
So what did you do today?

732
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,361
Not much.

733
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,287
A client.

734
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:26,406
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:29,690
Releasing your cock
from the prison of your pants.

736
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:33,049
-Do you think that's wise?
-Do you want me to stop?

737
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:47,212
It's just me.

738
00:52:47,493 --> 00:52:49,006
Are you busy?

739
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:53,083
I was just chatting
with this friend of mine online.

740
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,971
I found some things
I thought you might want.

741
00:52:56,053 --> 00:52:57,202
What things?

742
00:52:57,293 --> 00:53:00,365
Just some things
I've collected over the years.

743
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:08,004
-Are these all mine?
-Yes.

744
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:11,727
No way.

745
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:18,047
Oh, my God, it's Blue Pajama Man.

746
00:53:19,293 --> 00:53:21,124
I totally forgot about him.

747
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:23,522
I kept everything you ever did.

748
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:27,648
Mom.

749
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:40,846
Where's Nate?

750
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:43,044
He had left home already.

751
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:46,166
What about Dad?

752
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:49,284
He was probably working.

753
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:57,601
My God.

754
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:17,646
English
