1
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,723
She really looks like Nate.

2
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,166
Let me see.

3
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,609
Claire, they're in order.

4
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,445
Do vegans breastfeed?

5
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,171
You got butter on it.

6
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,404
Sorry, Mom, I know you only have
2,000 other ones just like it.

7
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,610
But this one was the first time
she ever smiled at me.

8
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:30,092
You sure it wasn't gas?

9
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:34,212
-No, I know gas. Nate...
-Was an extremely gassy baby. We know.

10
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,363
But David never made a peep.

11
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:39,126
And no one remembers
anything about Claire.

12
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,285
I'm starting to think
I walked in off the street when I was nine.

13
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:43,647
That's not true, dear.

14
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:47,089
David, Claire's graduation
is this Saturday at 3:00.

15
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:50,483
-Did you hear that, Nate? Saturday at 3:00.
-For what?

16
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,803
My idiotic graduation.
You don't have to come.

17
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:54,292
Of course he does.

18
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,570
-What's that?
-Just a few pictures of Maya.

19
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,088
Wait, you haven't even seen her?

20
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:13,492
It's weird that I can't have anything to do
with this kid, and you go take pictures.

21
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:16,292
Giving up custodial rights
doesn't mean you can't visit.

22
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:17,601
Lisa said that?

23
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:21,652
-I'm not getting in the middle of this.
-Well, then, don't. Stay out of it.

24
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,327
Whatever problems you and Lisa have,
I don't care.

25
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,372
But Maya is my granddaughter,
and I intend to be part of her life!

26
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,852
You okay?

27
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:51,687
Go away.

28
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:00,449
-Let me get someone for you.
-They can't help me.

29
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,407
I got it.

30
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:15,846
All right.

31
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,684
-I don't want you to see this shit.
-It's okay.

32
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,521
You can't wait for this to be over.

33
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,922
-I'm right here for you.
-So what?

34
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,243
I don't even know you.

35
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,092
Oh, fuck!

36
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,323
-It's okay.
-I can't breathe.

37
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,565
Nate, I'm not ready.

38
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,807
Help me.

39
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,731
It's gonna be okay.

40
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,565
Just try to let go.

41
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,524
Go into the light?

42
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,652
There's no fucking light.

43
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,405
Please, just...

44
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,369
-just try to let go.
-I don't want to.

45
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:08,966
Let it go.

46
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,403
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

47
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,052
It's okay.

48
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,852
It's okay.

49
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,569
Yes, I need to see Dr. DiPaolo
as soon as possible.

50
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,485
I can't wait two weeks.
This is an emergency.

51
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:50,041
I have to schedule an embolization.

52
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,732
No, but....

53
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,882
I think I waited too long already, all right?
I have to fucking do this.

54
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,486
Nate, this is John Gerson.

55
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,801
Thank you.

56
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,532
Tomorrow at 11:00. Yes, thank you.

57
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,528
Bitch.

58
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:05,762
From the DCA.

59
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,287
I'd like to look around, if you don't mind.

60
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,603
We don't have an inspection till February.

61
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:13,002
-We received a complaint.
-From who?

62
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,851
I'm not at liberty to say.

63
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,926
If I could use your little boys' room,
then we'll start with your billing records.

64
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,288
It's that door directly across.

65
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,766
I thought Kroehner folded.

66
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,448
This must be the final mindfuck
of Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

67
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,326
Claire Fisher.

68
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,525
Can I start again?

69
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:45,608
Fuck!

70
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,367
Claire?

71
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,241
Claire!

72
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:06,090
So I had this idea:
We should put a pool in the backyard.

73
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,492
Careful of the puddle.

74
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:09,052
That's nasty.

75
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:13,724
A little kidney-shaped pool. We can dip
in the summer. It's not even that expensive.

76
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,043
We're paying back your sister.

77
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,885
She doesn't need to be paid back.
She doesn't even want it.

78
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:24,410
You only don't want to be paid back when
you want to have something over someone.

79
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:29,044
Do you know much she's getting paid
to play that slutty neighbor on the WB?

80
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,443
-Where's my hot sauce?
-It's on there.

81
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,162
I don't see why we can't get
one thing nice for ourselves.

82
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,448
Don't talk about the money in front of him.

83
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,285
Get rid of the food!

84
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,484
I hope I didn't interrupt your lunch.

85
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,609
I'm sure they weren't eating.

86
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,526
This is our embalmer's wife.
She was just stopping by.

87
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:54,366
Does she have a license to be down here?

88
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:11,165
Shouldn't Mr. Buchbinder
be in the refrigerator?

89
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,770
I'm just about to take him
to the crematorium.

90
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:16,328
Really?

91
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:20,725
It looks to me like you've got yourself
a no-vacancy situation at the fridge motel.

92
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,485
He's not even staying here.

93
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,165
I'd love to let this slide...

94
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:28,405
but since Mr. Buchbinder paid for two days'
refrigeration in his pre-need contract...

95
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:32,247
I'm going to have to write you up
for a consumer disclosure citation.

96
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,653
And we are knee-deep in human waste.

97
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:55,369
Why did your grades take
such a plunge in the spring?

98
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:59,849
I don't know. I guess I sort of
stopped relating to high school.

99
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,208
Did something happen last year?

100
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,250
Well, bad boyfriend.

101
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:07,722
Okay.

102
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:14,208
That's it, unless you have any questions,
or anything else you'd like us to know.

103
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,245
Well, good luck, Claire,
it was nice to meet you.

104
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,485
Also, not that this is, whatever...

105
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:31,202
but my father died last year.

106
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,006
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:38,563
I don't think it had anything to do with
getting bad grades, but maybe it did a little.

108
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:41,963
It would if it were me.
Thank you for letting me know.

109
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:45,363
You know, I'm not like,
"Oh, poor me" or anything.

110
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,002
You know, I just thought of this.

111
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,330
But before that happened...

112
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:56,883
I always liked to make stuff for people,
like presents, or whatever...

113
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,771
and then, when my dad died, I couldn't....

114
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,727
I don't even know how to talk about it,
I mean, even now, you know.

115
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:08,362
But then I started to make stuff
that was sort of about that at first...

116
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:12,082
you know, and then stuff
that was about other things, too.

117
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,243
And I'm sorry that I'm rambling, now...

118
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,292
but, I guess, I just wanted you to know
that I feel like I have this...

119
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,772
way now of, like, dealing.

120
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,769
And it's so much better.

121
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:31,290
I'm sorry, excuse me.

122
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,210
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This is so queer.

123
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:41,569
It's fine.
I constantly cry at inappropriate moments.

124
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,644
Yeah, but I really don't.

125
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,526
Here, sweetie.

126
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,406
Thank you.

127
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,247
Thanks.

128
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,727
We'll have your ashes on Saturday.

129
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:21,443
He actually asked that I be here for it
to start the machine.

130
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,682
Can't do it today.

131
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,890
A pacemaker exploded in the retort,
so they're fixing the burners.

132
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:29,249
Come back tomorrow afternoon.
We'll torch him then.

133
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:52,684
Is Taylor in her room? I got her
an air purifier that's also a humidifier.

134
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,721
Taylor!

135
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,366
Where's all her stuff?

136
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,967
My parents came today
to take her down to San Diego.

137
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,009
-For how long?
-For good.

138
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:14,648
Why?

139
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,722
There's no way we could've kept her.
Not after what I did.

140
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,290
We could have tried.

141
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,084
-You could have told me...
-I got suspended today.

142
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,845
Oh, my God, until when?

143
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,845
It doesn't matter. I'm not going back there.

144
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,167
-You don't know how you'll feel...
-Don't tell me what I know!

145
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,365
You know, it's summer.

146
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:58,331
Maybe it's 'cause, when I was growing up,
there were seasons...

147
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:02,406
but it still gives me this charge.
And it's not just the nipples.

148
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,372
It's that the whole world's out there,
feeling sexy in their skin.

149
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:14,163
I can't sit with a beer in my hand
and watch the ass parade anymore.

150
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,404
Because it takes me out of my f-ing reality.

151
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,404
It's a drug.

152
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:25,208
That little shine of sweat.

153
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,650
Some chick in traffic.

154
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:33,127
I just want to jump in that car
and lick it right off of her.

155
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,126
On my wife, it makes me sick.

156
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,172
I can see the stains under her arms...

157
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:47,243
the red bumps where she shaves,
all the f-ing details.

158
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,728
But thanks to my higher power,
and this program...

159
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:55,725
I haven't crossed my bottom line
in three years.

160
00:14:56,493 --> 00:15:00,042
And for me, that means no sex
outside my marriage.

161
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,651
No prostitutes, no strip clubs,
no masturbation.

162
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,809
And it also seems to mean
no sex in my marriage.

163
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,849
I stopped doing all the other stuff...

164
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,562
because I wanted to learn
how to be more intimate with my wife.

165
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,812
And I have.

166
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,372
I love her.

167
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,003
I love her more than anything.

168
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,250
I just can't touch her.

169
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:35,452
I couldn't even kiss her
any more than I could kiss my own mother.

170
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:40,049
The fact is, I have this f-ing disease,
and this is how it's showing up today.

171
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:42,408
So, thanks. Three years, right?

172
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,648
You really have to love someone
to have their face burned into your flesh.

173
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,689
Or just be really drunk.

174
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,123
The lowest I could get was 38.

175
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,450
Thousand? The lowest?

176
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:12,761
They have to dig up the whole foundation
of the house to replace those pipes.

177
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:15,083
We can try another contractor.

178
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:18,241
-Fuck!
-What is this?

179
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,012
We're going to have to shut down
the home for a while.

180
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,766
-What?
-This inspection just totally fucked us.

181
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,242
The maximum fine is $2,500 at a time...

182
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,609
We've two weeks to fix the drainage system.
We don't have the money.

183
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,048
And Kroehner
can't even buy us out anymore.

184
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,524
So what does this mean?

185
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,292
We hope you'll consider
taking something temporary...

186
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,682
so when we work things out,
you can come back.

187
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,968
You mean if you work things out.

188
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,089
We know it's a lot to ask.

189
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,727
Scott?

190
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,125
Candace Bouvard.

191
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:09,805
I am so sorry, Candace.
I had sex with like 200 women last year...

192
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:12,728
and all the faces are a blur.

193
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,047
Why are you only taking
50 milligrams of the Dilantin?

194
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,045
-That's what you prescribed.
-But you're still having seizures.

195
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,772
You were supposed to tell me
so I could adjust the dosage.

196
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:25,129
-Well, you didn't tell me that.
-I'm sure I did.

197
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:33,171
Now there's a bleed.
This was so unnecessary.

198
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,732
What's a bleed?

199
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:36,326
That's blood.

200
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,205
The AVM ruptured,
probably during your last seizure.

201
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,887
-Wouldn't I have felt that?
-Apparently not.

202
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:46,886
If I'd done the embolization last summer,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

203
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,441
AVM is very treatable, if you treat it.

204
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,171
Wait a minute, you didn't....

205
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:55,603
-Okay, I want to do it now.
-So would I, if I were you.

206
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:59,527
But, at this point, my only option is
immediate cranial surgery.

207
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,365
What does that mean?

208
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:05,969
It means it looks like this sucker
is bordering an eloquent area in the brain.

209
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,966
-Well, you said it wasn't last time.
-You must have misheard me.

210
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:12,409
It's a lot of information.

211
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:17,005
What does that mean?

212
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,051
I'm not gonna lie to you.
There's a high risk of paralysis...

213
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,727
loss of speech, vegetation, or death.

214
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:26,562
But I have a very strong record
with this kind of surgery.

215
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,569
-How many deaths?
-Not many.

216
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:34,332
I can't fit this in tomorrow.
I'm gonna have to come in Saturday for this.

217
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,529
But I need your blood work done today.

218
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:40,447
Connie will tell you
where to go for that when you check out.

219
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,207
I really don't like the idea that I'm sick.

220
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:48,762
Nobody does.

221
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:51,606
Come on.
It's a little self-indulgent, don't you think?

222
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:54,082
When there are people dying of leukemia,
or whatever.

223
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,492
These guys are like:

224
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:59,691
"It's not my fault I blew 25 guys last night.
I have a disease. " I mean, deal with it.

225
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:03,322
When I tried to deal with it, I ended up
with a sexual harassment lawsuit...

226
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,246
filed against me
by half the female associates in my firm.

227
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,448
Fuck.

228
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,766
I'm really glad we didn't.... You and I.

229
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:17,604
I was spreading gonorrhea
all over LA last summer.

230
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:30,128
So when did you admit you were powerless?

231
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:33,171
-I haven't yet, by the way.
-I can tell.

232
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:37,086
Five months, two weeks,
and three days ago.

233
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:40,843
And now your life is
just one long hot fuck with God?

234
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,722
-I'm an atheist, actually.
-Yeah?

235
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:48,283
And who do you
turn over your will and your life to?

236
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,006
I just pray to nothing.

237
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:55,405
I say, "Dear God,
who I don't believe in, help me...

238
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,450
"with whatever it is. "

239
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,323
To stop thinking about...

240
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:08,282
undressing this incredibly sexy woman
who I am trying to have a real moment with.

241
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,284
Or something like that.

242
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:13,966
Does it work?

243
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,248
Unfortunately, yeah, it does.

244
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,684
Well, I'm not gonna stop drinking
or smoking pot.

245
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,687
All you can do
is just take it one day at a time.

246
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:31,049
All those fucking slogans
make me want to tear off my clothes...

247
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,522
and run screaming out of the room.

248
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,770
You know, I'm curious.

249
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,447
How does having compulsive sex
with strangers...

250
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:41,605
no close relationship
with friends, or family...

251
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:44,730
a job that you hate,
and a broken engagement...

252
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,324
feel manageable to you?

253
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,371
I didn't say
that my life wasn't unmanageable.

254
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,762
I just said that I hadn't admitted
that I was powerless.

255
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,445
I don't want to hate my parents
any more than I already do.

256
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:08,970
-You'll probably end up forgiving them.
-Well, I don't want to do that either.

257
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:15,127
I don't want to be one of those people
that walks around in pain all the time.

258
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,522
What about when you are in pain?

259
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,531
I choose not to be.

260
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,047
What's so bad about a little pain?

261
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,443
I feel like it'll kill me.

262
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:29,001
It won't.

263
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:39,204
I can't believe that guy blew up in the retort.

264
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:44,852
We usually check for the pacemaker,
but this guy was, like, 20.

265
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,812
Go ahead.

266
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:56,968
And built. He looked like
he worked out five hours a day.

267
00:21:57,373 --> 00:22:01,332
Vanity. These guys are out there
taking pills, getting implants.

268
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,610
Men are the new women.

269
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,048
-Yeah, no kidding.
-I hate gyms.

270
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,328
All those people on machines
staring at the TVs.

271
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:11,405
They looks like pod people
training to live among the humans.

272
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:15,882
Shit!

273
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:20,485
Hang on. I got to reposition him.

274
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:36,886
I've got to make sure the chest
is right under the main burner.

275
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:39,646
That's where
most of your mass and fluids are.

276
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,611
All that stuff that really fuels the burn.

277
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:59,242
We used to leave it chunky, so people
would know it was real cremains...

278
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,405
not just wood chips,
like that place in Georgia.

279
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,729
But then we did this baby...

280
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:13,409
and the dad saw a little tooth,
and he freaked, like, "This isn't my baby!"

281
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:18,443
We had to get a doctor to explain to him
that they have teeth embedded in their jaws.

282
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,205
Man, he was upset.

283
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:24,408
But, you know, when a baby goes,
it's a lot of dead hope.

284
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:38,726
You going to Lisa's?

285
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:42,601
-I have every right to see my granddaughter.
-I'm coming with you.

286
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:45,325
Did you talk to her?

287
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:47,772
You've got a key?

288
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:51,209
Sometimes I stay with the baby
when Lisa has to work.

289
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,444
They should be here soon.

290
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:24,364
See? I told you...

291
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,809
Granny was gonna be here.

292
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:28,726
Hi, Granny.

293
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:30,531
Hello, sweet pea.

294
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:33,446
Carole made me come with her
to this intuitive nutritionist...

295
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:36,252
who told her she's allergic to everything.

296
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,642
She squeezed Carole's fingers
for 10 minutes...

297
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:42,169
and I had to spend two hours
looking for burdock root.

298
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:44,523
I think Erewhon has burdock.

299
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:48,321
Thanks.

300
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:52,926
I'm sorry to show up like this.
I won't stay long.

301
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,208
I'm really happy you're here.

302
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:04,290
You know who this is?

303
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,331
This is your daddy.

304
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,725
This is where you get your little mouth from.

305
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,168
Hi.

306
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,687
Hi, Maya.

307
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:30,688
I know you're thinking "Maya"
is "illusion" in Buddhism...

308
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:34,652
but it's also another name for Durga,
the Mother, in Sanskrit.

309
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,448
And, in Greek, it's "messenger of the Gods. "

310
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:40,331
And my mother was half-Greek,
so, you know....

311
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,369
My gosh, she's so small.

312
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:47,522
Mom, come on.

313
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,968
You'll thank me when you're old.

314
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:51,772
I'll get it.

315
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,844
Hi, Barbara, how are you?

316
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,242
I'm fine. Did you get the tape?

317
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,251
She's just as precious as precious can be.

318
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:05,564
Hold on. Lisa, it's Barb.

319
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:07,769
Tell her I'll call her back.

320
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:09,852
Who's Barb?

321
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:11,926
My sister.

322
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:13,806
Carole's movie?

323
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:17,488
No, I just don't enjoy films
about retarded people.

324
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:19,723
But Lisa went to the premiere.

325
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:21,690
She said it was great.

326
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:27,650
Sorry about my mom.
I guess she's been a little lonely.

327
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,884
She's a godsend.
She's been such a help to me.

328
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,565
She looked wonderful.

329
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:36,646
We altered a purple chiffon caftan
I had in the closet from the '70s.

330
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:39,327
She's just so loving and fun.

331
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:42,925
I just hope I can be
half as good a mother as she is.

332
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,287
I'm sure you can.

333
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:45,886
Okay, bye, now.

334
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:51,126
-Ruth, is this the blanket?
-That's the one I made for Nate.

335
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:52,362
I love it.

336
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,930
In certain ways,
Lisa really reminds me of myself.

337
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:05,762
Something about the way
you two are together...

338
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,128
reminds me of your father and me.

339
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:10,886
I was raised
with a very small-town mentality...

340
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:14,329
and getting married was really the only way
you could have sex at all.

341
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:17,450
So, I never tried to find
the perfect someone, you know?

342
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:20,206
But that doesn't matter
when there are children.

343
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,648
It becomes its own very real kind of love.

344
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:25,964
-Mom, I'm not marrying Lisa.
-Did I say you should?

345
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:32,128
I think you should consider the profound
effect a child can have on your life.

346
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:36,206
Mom, you should find some place
and pull over for a minute.

347
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:39,205
-Why, are you all right, dear?
-No, I'm not.

348
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,681
Saturday?

349
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:47,731
I kind of need to do it as soon as possible.

350
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,770
Have you told David?

351
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,562
Yeah.

352
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,722
Would you like me to tell Claire?

353
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:04,972
She knows.

354
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:10,210
She saw me have a seizure,
so I had to tell her.

355
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,246
I'm sorry, Mom.

356
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,130
I'll go to the hospital with Nate...

357
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:32,285
David will take Robbie's video camera
to Claire's graduation...

358
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,091
so we can all watch it later.

359
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,323
-Mom...
-It's fine. I already asked him.

360
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:39,962
And he's bringing it over later
to show you how it works.

361
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:44,012
We're not going to my lame-ass graduation
when Nate is having major surgery.

362
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:46,323
Claire, Nate is going to be just fine.

363
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:49,644
There is no reason for this procedure
to ruin your special day.

364
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,122
It's not even special. I'm just going for you.

365
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:54,283
It is special. It's a rite of passage.

366
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:58,127
I'm not going to let you get overshadowed
by your brothers, like you always do.

367
00:28:58,213 --> 00:29:01,330
If Claire doesn't care about this,
I'd like to be with Nate, too.

368
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:03,722
David, god damn it, I am the mother here!

369
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:07,601
And I am a good one, no matter what
you think from your limited point of view.

370
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,763
This is what we are doing!

371
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,210
Now, who wants milk?

372
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:22,209
So? Now you can
get them to make you a partner.

373
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,409
It's Fisher & Sons, remember?

374
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:26,449
It's not Fisher & Sons & Diaz.

375
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,331
That was before
you had $100,000 they need.

376
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,246
I want to put it
in a mutual fund, or something.

377
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,723
Some, okay, but nothing's worth
as much as being your own boss.

378
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,611
Julio, check the bath isn't running over.

379
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,892
I don't know.

380
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:43,009
The business isn't even going so great.

381
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:45,926
So? You go in there, you make it go great.

382
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,725
He didn't do it.

383
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,486
Julio, turn off the bath!

384
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:52,608
I'll do it.

385
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:56,083
No, he needs to learn
to do something when I tell him.

386
00:29:56,493 --> 00:30:00,771
You'll let the whole house get flooded
so you can teach him something?

387
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,446
Thank you.

388
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:11,526
I want to be cremated.
I don't want to be embalmed. No viewing.

389
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:15,483
This is very difficult for me.

390
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,929
Do you want me to fill it out by myself?

391
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:20,048
Yes.

392
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:26,007
-I don't think we should do this now.
-We have to, all right?

393
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:30,365
I don't want you
to have to deal with the funeral.

394
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,409
You're not going to die.

395
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,483
I have to get ready for it.

396
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:41,969
And I think you should, too.

397
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:50,203
-What about a service?
-Yeah.

398
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:52,771
I want Ari...

399
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:56,807
the rabbi who did Jeffrey Shapiro.

400
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,208
A rabbi? Why not Father Jack?

401
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,767
Is Father Jack doing your service?

402
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:07,005
No, but that's just because
I don't want to give him the wrong idea.

403
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:10,165
What kind of idea is he going to get
when you're dead?

404
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:14,246
I don't know, I just don't want him
cruising me in the afterlife.

405
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,885
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

406
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:25,125
What do you think the afterlife is?
Some sex club that never closes?

407
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:29,643
Yeah, and no one ever tells you
if it's heaven or hell.

408
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,404
Fuck, I am really scared.

409
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:38,441
Me, too.

410
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,163
I wish you could come with me.

411
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:44,565
Okay, I'm not going to Claire's graduation.
Mom is insane.

412
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,884
No, go to the graduation.
That's not what I meant.

413
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:01,808
Oh, God!

414
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:49,325
You're home early.

415
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:56,926
Where were you?

416
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:59,363
Just getting something to eat.

417
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:04,569
I was going to make dinner.

418
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:06,689
You can still make dinner.

419
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:08,605
You mean for myself?

420
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:12,205
Whatever. I might be kind of hungry later.

421
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:17,845
You sure you want to eat that?

422
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,642
I was going to make
a poached Chilean sea bass and polenta.

423
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,722
With a wild mushroom cassoulet.

424
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:40,045
You could've gotten me something.

425
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:42,203
I didn't know you'd be home.

426
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,569
Did you do anything today?

427
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:52,008
What's that supposed to mean?

428
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:54,091
Did you call that guy?

429
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:57,051
I don't need to pay
to learn I can get a job in security.

430
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,442
I'm sure there're options
you don't know about.

431
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:02,127
I know a lot of ex-cops.
They all work in security.

432
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:04,852
What's wrong with security?
It's a national obsession.

433
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,446
It's the new freedom.

434
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,411
You know what?
My career isn't your problem.

435
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,923
I have new pictures of Maya.

436
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:36,571
Yes, I have seen.

437
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:38,928
The new ones? I don't think so.

438
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:45,649
Is very cute. I have seen.

439
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:50,042
You haven't seen these. The smiling ones?
I just got these yesterday.

440
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,682
Ruth, is not my grandbaby.
I don't need every day to see.

441
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,691
I quit. Consider this my two-week notice.

442
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,522
Because I don't looking at your photos?

443
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:12,683
No, I'm not growing in this environment.

444
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:15,412
And I want to be available
to help watch my granddaughter.

445
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:20,169
And since I don't have the money to help
pay for a sitter, it's the least I can do.

446
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:21,681
You take other job?

447
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:25,482
Eventually, I suppose I'll have to,
under the circumstances.

448
00:35:26,613 --> 00:35:30,049
Okay, then, Ruth. Is also better for me.

449
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,203
This way only have to pay Robbie.

450
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:33,567
Well, yes.

451
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,123
And also, you should know, you may be
losing Fisher & Sons as a client.

452
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:41,570
We may close the business because there's
no money to replace the septic system!

453
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:43,848
This is my fault? Is that what you're saying?

454
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,051
No. I just thought you should know
you might be losing the account.

455
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,251
-I will pay you back this money.
-I said it was a gift.

456
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,972
Even though you said it was gift,
I will pay back.

457
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,841
Well, that's very sweet,
but we both know that's not possible.

458
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:07,049
Here, every week, I pay some part of it.

459
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,442
Here, this is the first payment.

460
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,691
$62.

461
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,329
It was a very slow week.

462
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,247
I did knock.

463
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,483
I'm sorry. Was that too loud?

464
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:52,487
I just thought I'd stop by, say hi.

465
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,528
Okay.

466
00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:00,285
I thought you were going to that art school.

467
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,364
I so blew the interview.

468
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:05,411
There's no way.

469
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:08,489
I totally started bawling.

470
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,684
What do you mean, why?

471
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,608
I started talking about Dad,
for some, like, insane reason.

472
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,483
And I just fucking lost it.

473
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,173
So is this operation really serious?

474
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:35,804
Nah, I just gotta, you know,
get rid of this thing.

475
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:38,450
It's so not a big deal.

476
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,572
Well, good.

477
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:42,967
Because....

478
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,486
Just good.

479
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:54,484
Okay, that was
before you talked to me, so....

480
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:58,205
Did you take these? These are amazing.

481
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,811
Well, they're okay.

482
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:06,573
This guy's a total fucking freak...

483
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:08,970
but the pictures are awesome.

484
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,281
Thanks.

485
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,766
I thought you were going to yell at me.

486
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:20,050
I didn't yell. I was just looking out for you.

487
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:23,121
Okay, don't take this the wrong way...

488
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,726
and I know...

489
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:28,765
I have a tendency
to fall for kind of insane boys...

490
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,048
but you have a tendency...

491
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:35,567
to dole out the wisdom
like you're the Dalai Lama, or whatever...

492
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:41,324
and it's not like you're incredibly together
that I'm just dying for your advice.

493
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:44,849
I never said I was incredibly together.
I'm just a lot older.

494
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:48,084
Yeah, and I don't think
you're that much better than I am...

495
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,892
at the relationship thing, like, at all.

496
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:52,645
Well, I disagree.

497
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:57,407
No one I dated ever attacked anybody
with a knife or a gun.

498
00:38:58,493 --> 00:38:59,608
Okay.

499
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:04,283
And I don't know what goes on
between you and Lisa, or Brenda...

500
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,568
or the other million missing girlfriends.

501
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,883
There have not been a million.

502
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:13,602
I just get the sense
that you're not fully dealing.

503
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:22,966
All right.

504
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:28,886
-Fine, I'll never give you advice again.
-No, give me advice...

505
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:32,729
just don't try and act like
you really know anything.

506
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,403
-Wait, is he nude?
-No.

507
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:40,562
God!

508
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,571
$50,000.

509
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:47,053
Do you have any idea
how much this business is worth?

510
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,363
Not much when it's shut down.

511
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,250
And I want to be equal partner.

512
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,005
-Rico, you...
-Wait!

513
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:06,489
I'm sorry I have to say this now,
but I think you might want another partner.

514
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,605
Not equal, no way.

515
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:28,444
$75,000 for 25%%.

516
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:29,961
Done!

517
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,886
All right, okay.

518
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:46,403
So I just wanted to tell you that I think
a lot of what you had to say...

519
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,927
-I'm so sorry.
-Just let me finish.

520
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,888
A lot of what you said was true.

521
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:57,727
I didn't have the right
to say anything to you.

522
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,644
I'm the one that's fucked up.

523
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,485
I am so fucked up.

524
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,162
Okay.

525
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:06,122
Maybe.

526
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:13,612
But you were right when you said that...

527
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:17,682
being with you made it easier for me
to feel so together.

528
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:21,845
That I was ready for something real,
and you weren't...

529
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,288
and that is just not really true.

530
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:27,162
Nate, I have a serious problem.

531
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,251
I think I'm....

532
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,962
God, I so don't want to say this.

533
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:38,202
Here.

534
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,001
I've been going to these meetings.

535
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:49,003
I went to one of these meetings
once up in Seattle. It freaked me out.

536
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:52,165
-Why?
-Just the people. It seemed like a cult.

537
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,050
No. What made you go?

538
00:41:57,613 --> 00:41:59,649
I thought it might apply.

539
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:08,412
Well, it says in the book
that once you realize what it is...

540
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:11,802
and you work really hard, you can....

541
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,885
People have
this whole new experience of love.

542
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:18,490
Some people, I mean.

543
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,767
So what?

544
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,931
I really love you.

545
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:38,322
And I don't think I would have done
what I did if I didn't really love you.

546
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,963
That's a very strange thing to say.

547
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:47,884
But I think it's true.

548
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,245
It was the fear of...

549
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:54,003
feeling something...

550
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,168
real.

551
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:01,088
Okay.

552
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:07,051
I love you, too.

553
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:17,125
I just wanted you to know that
even though you really pissed me off.

554
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:23,966
I still get so angry
if I let myself think about it...

555
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:25,691
Of course you do.

556
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,241
But I felt like this was something.

557
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:33,402
Being with you made me feel more....

558
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,609
Just feel more, I guess.

559
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:41,008
More than I used to feel.
More than I felt with anyone.

560
00:43:41,093 --> 00:43:44,369
Everything I was running away from,
I don't even know what it is.

561
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:46,648
Fear, I guess.

562
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:51,169
I felt all of that with you.

563
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:56,970
I'm good at making people feel fear?

564
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:03,007
But I can't.

565
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:06,165
-I'm not saying now...
-I can't even think about the future.

566
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:08,084
I'm just saying maybe.

567
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:11,009
I'm having surgery tomorrow.

568
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:16,049
It's an embolization. Totally routine.

569
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:19,685
Can I be with you?

570
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:21,722
No.

571
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:27,524
My mom's coming with me.

572
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:30,447
And it's really nothing.
I mean, I'm gonna be fine.

573
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:31,722
Nate.

574
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:34,725
-Look, I'm sorry. I got to go.
-Nate, please!

575
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:54,845
You know, I've been thinking...

576
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:59,324
it really could be good for you guys
to have a Latino point of view at the home.

577
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:03,528
Too bad it comes in the form of
a controlling homophobe.

578
00:45:04,173 --> 00:45:07,165
When we met,
you were a controlling homophobe.

579
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:10,570
And apparently that was
very attractive to you.

580
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:16,209
Will you come with me
to Claire's graduation tomorrow?

581
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:21,687
-I'd really rather not.
-Why not?

582
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:24,810
It's not a good time for me
to be dealing with your family.

583
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:28,488
It's not my family. It's me and Claire.
My mother's going to be with Nate.

584
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:31,485
-I really can't.
-You'd miss The Young and the Restless?

585
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:33,723
God, Keith, I ask you for one thing.

586
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:39,526
What do you think we are? Roommates?
It's like I don't even exist.

587
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,923
In case you haven't noticed,
I have a lot to deal with right now.

588
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:46,847
Not noticed? It defines my entire life.
Everything is about taking care of you.

589
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:51,643
For once. Which you can't deal with,
because you're the one who always needs it.

590
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:54,884
That is such bullshit!
Who were you taking care of...

591
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:58,170
when you sent Taylor away
without telling me? What am I, the dog?

592
00:45:58,253 --> 00:46:00,562
I made a decision, and it was mine to make!

593
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:03,690
-Why was it your decision?
-It's my family.

594
00:46:03,773 --> 00:46:06,890
-I thought I was your family.
-Well, you're not!

595
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:08,162
Yet.

596
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:09,402
David, you're not.

597
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,926
You just moved in
and now there's this pressure to be...

598
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:15,447
whatever family unit fantasy
you had in your head...

599
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,125
when you got engaged to Jennifer.

600
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:19,773
I care about Taylor.
She feels as close to me as...

601
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:22,526
That's not the point!
It's not always about what you want!

602
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,569
You are such an asshole!

603
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:26,812
I have been tiptoeing...

604
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:28,451
-Tiptoeing?
-Get off of me!

605
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:31,923
Lying on the couch, crying about this,
and pretending everything's fine?

606
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:34,481
I was crying about my brother,
you selfish fuck!

607
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:40,482
My brother could die tomorrow.
Do you even think about how I feel?

608
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:43,133
-Not if you don't tell me.
-You could notice!

609
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:47,001
You could give a fuck for once in your life
about somebody besides yourself.

610
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:02,842
I'm really gonna miss high school.

611
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:05,845
So, why does Monty Pappas think...

612
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:09,528
getting into Williams has made him
into someone anyone would ever fuck?

613
00:47:09,613 --> 00:47:12,081
As if the name of the college matters at all.

614
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:14,482
I don't even know
where Williams is. Virginia?

615
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:15,688
Vermont.

616
00:47:15,773 --> 00:47:19,846
It has that summer theatre program where
movie stars go to have sex and do Chekhov.

617
00:47:21,693 --> 00:47:25,572
-Oh, my God, how did your interview go?
-It severely sucked.

618
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,807
-Are you suicidal?
-No.

619
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,812
East Valley will be fine.

620
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:37,532
They've got a darkroom. They've got paint.

621
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:42,085
And everyone says you get out of college
what you put into it, anyway, so....

622
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,562
Whatever.

623
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:50,131
I'm glad you're so delirious about it,
because it looks like I'm going there, too.

624
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:52,012
What do you mean?

625
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:57,124
Yale found out about my SATs.
That little Indian bitch turned herself in.

626
00:47:57,453 --> 00:48:01,241
Hundreds of people are screwed
just so she won't come back as a rodent.

627
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:06,850
Okay, it isn't that funny.

628
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:09,162
Cunt.

629
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,652
Oh, God!

630
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,532
You ready to go, Mom?

631
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:53,208
-Is it time already?
-Yeah, just about.

632
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,847
-But you haven't even eaten.
-I'm not supposed to.

633
00:50:57,173 --> 00:50:58,845
Of course, I'm such an idiot.

634
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,088
No, you're not.

635
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,893
Clearly, there's something wrong with me...

636
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:07,722
that made you keep this from me
while your brother and sister knew.

637
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:11,044
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-But why? Why does this keep happening?

638
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:13,363
I just didn't want to worry you.

639
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:17,366
You're not supposed to protect me.
I'm supposed to protect you.

640
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:18,688
But you can't.

641
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:24,729
-You can't protect me from this.
-But I can try. That's what a mother does.

642
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:27,646
She tries to protect you,
and most of the time, she fails...

643
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:30,088
but it's the trying that makes you feel loved.

644
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,892
How will you feel loved
if you don't ever let me try?

645
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:34,042
I do.

646
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,167
I do feel loved.

647
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,685
It was just so many months
I could have loved you better.

648
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:46,287
You loved me fine.

649
00:51:49,813 --> 00:51:51,292
You're everything.

650
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:56,685
You don't even know.
You're everything to me.

651
00:51:56,773 --> 00:51:58,570
God, I don't want to go.

652
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,646
I won't go. I can't. I can't do this, I can't.

653
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,561
I don't want to go!

654
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,962
-I won't let you go.
-I don't wanna go.

655
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:07,486
I'll never let you go.

656
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:23,847
Almost ready?

657
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:29,172
We caught up with
LA's hottest high school graduate...

658
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:31,323
in a quiet moment at home.

659
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:36,687
So, Claire, how does it feel
to be leaving your childhood behind?

660
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:39,367
All right, you can really stop that now.

661
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:43,686
For many young people, graduation
brings up feelings of anxiety and pissiness.

662
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:47,364
No, really. Cut!

663
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:54,963
-Are you smoking pot?
-You want some?

664
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,288
Yeah!

665
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:03,007
God! These dust balls are like tumbleweeds!

666
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:05,732
When was the last time
anyone swept under here?

667
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:09,243
I don't know.
When did Mom start working for Nikolai?

668
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,847
Your mother is a very good woman.

669
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:16,451
God have mercy.

670
00:53:25,013 --> 00:53:27,732
How psyched are we
that we never have to call him "Daddy"?

671
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,565
Thank God she snapped out of it.

672
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:32,247
I think he's the one
who pulled the plug, actually.

673
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:37,283
Really? What a pig.
He thinks he can do better than Mom?

674
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:39,609
I'm guessing she was a little clingy.

675
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,567
Did Nate ever tell you
what happened with Brenda?

676
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,208
No, he was strangely nonverbal about it.

677
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:51,047
He's usually so eager to regale us
with the details of his personal life.

678
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:53,128
Not always.

679
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,766
I guess not.

680
00:54:03,013 --> 00:54:06,562
-So, when did they go?
-Really early.

681
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:09,049
I guess it's like a two-part thing.

682
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:12,047
Yeah, first they try to stop the bleeding
with glue.

683
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:15,170
They put a catheter in through his groin
and thread it up...

684
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,767
It's okay. I don't need the details.

685
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:19,722
Sorry.

686
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:25,128
That part must have happened already.
The cranial surgery is a few hours later.

687
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:27,602
So, like, now.

688
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:30,605
Soon, I guess.

689
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:39,611
There's no way
we're going to this stupid graduation.

690
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:42,327
-I know. Fuck it.
-Seriously.

691
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,202
-You're driving.
-Fine.

692
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:25,765
You're just going to feel
a slight sting, okay?

693
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,044
Count back from 10, please.

694
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:37,207
Ten, nine, eight...

695
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:40,927
seven, six....

696
00:59:00,693 --> 00:59:02,684
English
