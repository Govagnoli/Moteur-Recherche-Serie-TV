5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,640
I'd like talk about this all seeing other people thing

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,140
I’m not that into it.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,540
it's kind of has to be more organic for me,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,840
It has to evolve.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,340
I fucking deserve, a lot more attention

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,640
I will not feel ashamed about that!

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,400
If I had known you were hiring me to be your fucking wet nurse,

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,100
I would’ve asked for health insurance!

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,180
Where're you going?

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,680
I quit. We have to move.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,980
I kind of wish we could have talked this through before you quit.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,580
what were you thinking, that we’d go stay at my mom’s, I guess?

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,240
Well, yeah, for now.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,640
- Why not?
- Nothing was perfect.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Oh, I’m not buying anything.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,340
Nothing in life is perfect.

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,640
Well, that makes it easy to stay within a budget.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,240
If you don’t buy this black suit, I’m gonna buy it for you!

23
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,960
What are you doing?

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,860
It’s one of my little pleasures.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,950
there be just one other gay couple?

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,750
It just be nice on vacation to not have to deal with that.

27
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,350
So don’t. Offend people! Who cares? We paid for our room, right?

28
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,350
WE’RE GAY IN HERE!!!

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
This is it!

30
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,890
Can you see why this is good?

31
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,590
the way I tell if something is good is…

32
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,190
does it make me want to throw up?

33
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,990
I think it seems kind of obvious.

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,790
because you don’t recognize the beauty of your own truth.

35
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,710
Let me see! Let me see what’s in the—

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,690
{\i1}Now you know, Mother, I’m a gypsy! {\i0}

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,650
{\i1}I’m in the road company of “42nd Street”! {\i0}

38
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,650
And my feet are gigantic!

39
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,460
{\i1}You hit him with the shoes, didn’t you? {\i0}

40
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,860
Well, duh, bitch!

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,660
{\i1}You hit him with the shoes! That’s how he got those half- moon marks{\i0}

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,460
{\i1}on his forehead and his hands! {\i0}

43
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
Yeah, but what about those cigarette burns on his ass?

44
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,530
{\i1}Answer me! {\i0}

45
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,430
Mommy, you need to go on Prozac!

46
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,630
{\i1}And fast! {\i0}

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,230
{\i1}I had to hit him with the shoes…What else could I do? {\i0}

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,230
Flog him with those braids?

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,330
{\i1}But it was his fault! If he gave me the medal like I told him to, I wouldn’t have hit him! {\i0}

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,630
Oh, that still doesn’t explain why you fucked him!

51
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,370
{\i1}Okay, we’re going to start at the beginning, and you’re going to tell me the truth. {\i0}

52
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,740
{\i1}Now, I know you killed him, so there’s no sense lying. {\i0}

53
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,600
{\i1}Rhoda, I want you to tell me the truth! {\i0}

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,970
The truth? You’re too old to be my mommy!

55
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,470
Socialism is a better system!

56
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,670
You’re a man!

57
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,190
How can I be a man when my girdle hurts this much?

58
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,190
I don’t know! Ask Charles Pierce!

59
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,190
{\i1}…And I found him there. {\i0}

60
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,290
{\i1}And I told him I’d hit him with my shoe if he wouldn’t give me the medal! {\i0}

61
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,610
{\i1}Mommy, Mommy, please say you won’t let them hurt me! {\i0}

62
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,610
Honey, you’ll just kill them all anyway.

63
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,450
{\i1}I don’t know what must be done now, but I promise you nobody will hurt you. {\i0}

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,050
{\i1}I want to play the way we used to, Mommy. Will you play with me? {\i0}

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,930
Not unless you pay me first, you little freak.

66
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,430
{\i1}If I give you a basket of kisses…{\i0}

67
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,530
No discounts for family!

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,280
Hey, Lis. You awake?

69
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,290
Can you run by Whole Foods and pick up like six Mahi- Mahi filets for tomorrow?

70
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,590
Six?

71
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,990
Yeah, I’m making dinner for your mom’s birthday.

72
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,110
She told you not to do that.

73
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,910
Just because someone tells you not to do something doesn’t mean they don’t want you to do it.

74
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,310
Lisa, maybe your mother likes people to go out of their way for her birthday,

75
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,910
but, trust me, my mother never wants us to do anything for hers,

76
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,210
and we never do, and so far, that has worked out great on everyone.

77
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,110
You think she’d like Sarah McLachlan? It’s a party. We have to have music.

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,250
Play whatever you want. Just don’t come running to me when it blows up in your face.

79
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,640
Nothing’s gonna blow up in my face, Nate.

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,840
This is important. I want to do something for your mom,

81
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,340
now with us living here and all.

82
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,340
Okay, just…keep your expectations low,
is all I’m saying.

83
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,830
Lisa called while you were in the shower.

84
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,830
She wants us to come over for dinner tomorrow night.

85
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,450
I thought it was our turn to invite them.

86
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,950
No, she’s throwing a birthday party for your mom.

87
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,000
Who does she think she is? My mother does not like anything for her birthday!

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, come on, your mom deserves a party.

89
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,930
Oh, you wanna go?

90
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,430
What else are we gonna do, stay home and watch porn?

91
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,060
Which reminds me…you gotta return “The Gaytrix” to Video West.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Somebody wanna tell me why I should give a rat’s ass what’s in Salma Hayek’s purse?

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,150
are you something else, Fisher.

94
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,250
I’m sorry?

95
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,950
It’s your fuckin’ birthday! And you’re gonna spend it in the dentist’s office?

96
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,450
Well, I can’t just ignore my oral hygiene!

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,760
And I’m celebrating my birthday. There’s gonna be a party tomorrow night.

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,260
Oh, you bet ya there’s gonna be a party. I’ll make sure of that.

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,460
Even if I have to spike the punch with LSD!

100
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,160
Bettina, don’t, please.

101
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
Oh, speaking of LSD, your sister called me last night from Hazeldon.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,460
How is Sarah doing? She won’t return my calls.

103
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,460
She’s become best friends with someone who’s very famous,

104
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,860
but she won’t tell me who it is. All she’ll say is it’s somebody who’s fucked Michael Douglas!

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,890
Okay, this is not what I had in mind when I said I’d spend the day with you.

106
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,850
Excuse me. My friend had an appointment to get her teeth cleaned at 11 o’clock. It’s almost noon.

107
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,250
Our technician is running a little late today.

108
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,550
How much longer, you think?

109
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,110
I can’t really say.

110
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,120
- Oh, you can’t, huh?
- No.

111
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
You’re just gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else.

112
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,400
- Huh. What’s your name?
- Patty.

113
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,000
Hi, Pah- tee. I'm bettina.

114
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
I have another question for you, Pah- tee.

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,100
- Yes?
- I can understand our having to wait.

116
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,900
What I can’t understand is your need to be such a condescending asshole to someone,

117
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,600
- I don’t have to sit here—
- who is after all, a fellow human being.

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
- and listen to this!
- I mean, do you really think you’re so special?

119
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Or are you just pissed off because your life sucks?

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,100
I’m sorry…

121
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Well, I hate to break it to ya, honey, but it’s not our fault!

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
I’ll call to reschedule.

123
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,730
Dennis recommended you.

124
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,300
- From chorus?
- Yes

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,260
I’m a member, too. I haven’t been very active the past year since Bob got sick.

126
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,710
It wasn’t AIDS, even though we both fucked like bunnies during the 70s.

127
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,860
We buried half our friends. We thought we’d been spared and we’d grow old together.

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,980
Such hubris.

129
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,790
I’m so sorry.

130
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,790
It was cardiomyopathy.

131
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,790
Enlarged heart.

132
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,310
His heart was too big.

133
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,660
We used to joke about it.

134
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,560
It was caused by a severely leaking heart valve.

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,250
We used to joke about that too.
Bleeding heart.

136
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,620
Have any other members of his family been contacted?

137
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,720
I called his sister in Phoenix, but she’s not coming.

138
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,230
His family was never very accepting of…things.

139
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,190
Bob and I were together for 22 years, so…I’m his family.

140
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,950
We have durable power of attorney. I’ll have our lawyer fax it to you.

141
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,060
I’m sorry we have to ask you for that.

142
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,110
I’m a scenic designer for the Los Angeles Lyric Opera.

143
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,410
Bob was the Lighting designer.

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,500
I was told that you would be more open to accommodating certain requests.

145
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,280
You’ve gotta be kidding me. A fucking opera?

146
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,780
He just wants to design a set and rig some special lighting.

147
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,180
Well, how long is this gonna take?

148
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,780
They’re gonna need the slumber room for 2 days.

149
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh, no way! No! We could have 3 funerals.

150
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Apparently, he’s willing to pay for it.

151
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
For a fucking opera?

152
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Yes, Federico.

153
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,840
You know, Vanessa’s cousin won opera tickets once from KUSC, and she gave them to us.

154
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,720
It was just—it was so completely whacked.

155
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,820
It was like this magic mirror, ya know, and this dead swan, and this, like bleeding spear.

156
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,920
“Parsifal”

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,620
Yeah! And they had these flower chicks who were supposed to be hot, ya know?

158
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,720
And they were all just like major wide- loads!

159
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,360
And these lame- ass knights who were like,

160
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,260
they were like prancing around and singing at the top of their lungs. Ya know?

161
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,660
Ya know? It was just so, so, so fuckin’—

162
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,060
Gay?

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,460
I was gonna say stupid.

164
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,660
Bullshit! You don’t want to do this funeral. You think it’s too gay.

165
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,060
That’s not what I was gonna say!

166
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,360
Well, we’re doing it, and that’s final. These guys were together for 22 years,

167
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,260
and we’re going to show them the respect that they deserve.

168
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,570
You’ve gotta be kidding me. You’ve never had a massage before?

169
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,570
No.

170
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,270
Where have you been living, under a rock?

171
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,320
Lighten up, sister, this is her first time on the table.

172
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,220
Oh, no, what you’re doing is just fine, dear.

173
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,320
Nikolai was always trying to get me to come here.

174
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,020
- So why didn’t you?
- I don’t know. I was afraid.

175
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,020
I think if you’re afraid of something it probably means you should do it.

176
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,940
I don’t usually like being touched by strangers, but…this is…invigorating.

177
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,540
It’s mandatory!

178
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,040
I started getting a massage every week after I caught my second husband cheating on me.

179
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,780
Hey, I’m not a porcelain butterfly. You want a tip or not?

180
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,430
I cheated on my husband.

181
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,230
No way!

182
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,930
It’s true! With my hairdresser.

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
He’s the one who first took me hiking.

184
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Way to go, Fisher!

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,720
I cheated on Number Two, but only after I knew he was cheating on me

186
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
Well, that’s fair.

187
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
I even slept with his gastroenterologist!

188
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,840
For some reason, I thought that would really hurt him.

189
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,140
But he just laughed at me.

190
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,540
I will always hate him for that. Asshole.

191
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,610
I still feel guilty for cheating on Nathaniel.

192
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,610
Hey, ya gotta let go of that. It’s done. Move on.

193
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,810
Be careful with that.

194
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,400
Put it in there, and just make sure it doesn’t lean against the wall, okay? Thanks.

195
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I thought Puccini was Italian.

196
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,230
He is, but “Turandot” takes place in China.

197
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,490
Well…it’s big.

198
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,310
Well, Kevin obviously needs something to pour himself

199
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,910
into to take his mind off such an incomprehensible loss.

200
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,360
It was Puccini’s last opera, you know. He died before he got a chance to finish it.

201
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,920
Bob was much more of a formalist than I am.

202
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,650
But I think he would’ve liked it.

203
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
I know he would’ve liked that.

204
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,160
Jesus, you could serve breakfast on that ass!

205
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,960
If Bob were here, he’d be all over that boy like white on rice,

206
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,460
and I guarantee you, he’d have him in bed before nightfall.

207
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
I swear,

208
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,060
he could charm the pants off any man alive,

209
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
and he usually did.

210
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,260
I was never as lucky as he was in that department, but at least he liked to share.

211
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,100
Eric, you’ll have to make sure those risers are flush, alright?

212
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Well, that’s one way to grieve.

213
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,190
How did they ever last 22 years?

214
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,700
Well, it’s easy when you get to fuck whoever you want to the whole time.

215
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,320
There you go! Hand me that Makita.

216
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,340
So, were you guys a couple, or just hanging out?

217
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,430
Oh, well, I thought we were a couple but...

218
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,230
he thought we were just hanging out.

219
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,540
He was squirrelly, wasn’t he?

220
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah, totally.

221
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Nate used to be like that.

222
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,210
Sometimes you just have to hang in there and wait.

223
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,330
Wait for what?

224
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,210
For them to grow up.

225
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,210
If I had known he was gonna be such a jerk,

226
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,610
I would never have slept with him in that crematorium.

227
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,310
Okay, put me to work.

228
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,200
Ruth, no, it’s your night off!

229
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,990
Oh, I much prefer to be busy.

230
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,670
Mom, you really should’ve told me this party was gonna be such a big deal.

231
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,670
It’s not a big deal at all.

232
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,070
Cause I could’ve like tried to change my plans.

233
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,470
No, no, I won’t hear of it!

234
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,770
You’re not gonna be here?

235
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,270
No, I’ve gotta go to this guest artist lecture series. It’s Scott Phillip Smith.

236
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,130
He’s like this really radical artist with like death threats against him.

237
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,280
He’s very political.

238
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,580
Claire, it’s your mother’s birthday.

239
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,470
Don’t be silly! You go ahead!
This isn’t going to be my last birthday.

240
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,270
I’ll totally make it up to you.

241
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Ruth, would you prefer curried chickpeas or chickpea croquettes?

242
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,240
Oh…chickpeas give me gas.

243
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,980
This is an unusually gassy family.

244
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,980
But you know what? I love chickpeas anyway, and this is my birthday.

245
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,180
So you decide. You’re the chef.

246
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,820
- That’s such a lovely dress.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,570
Here.

248
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,120
I’d hate it if you got something on it.

249
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,820
Oh, too late! Maya spit up on it last time I wore it!

250
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,720
Isn’t that funny? I think all my dresses had spit- up on them!

251
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,000
- There you go.
- Thank you.

252
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,770
Has the party started yet?

253
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,590
- Hi, honey!
- Hello, dear!

254
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
1. 2. 3.

255
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,870
Hello!

256
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,090
Oh…Kevin never mentioned this.

257
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,890
I mean, a tongue stud I can sort of understand, but this?

258
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
That’s gotta hurt.

259
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,660
Not to mention getting it…y’know, installed.

260
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,020
So is that supposed to enhance pleasure and for who?

261
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,720
Apparently it worked for Queen Victoria.

262
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,610
Come again?

263
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,810
It’s called a Prince Albert.

264
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,670
She liked him to wear tight pants,

265
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:27,470
and the ring was attached by a strap to his thigh, thus enabling a…smooth trouser line.

266
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,080
How do you know all this stuff?

267
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,570
I read a lot.

268
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,790
Yeah, right!

269
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,990
You know what I’ve been noticing a lot lately?

270
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,490
A lot of guys coming in with their balls shaved. What’s that all about?

271
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Actually, it makes them more sensitive.

272
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,110
You know, for oral stimulation?

273
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Besides, no one likes getting pubic hair stuck in their teeth.

274
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,420
Do you want to ask me if I shave my balls?

275
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Uh, no, not really.

276
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,370
No, I’m happy to tell you. I am. And I do…shave.

277
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,070
Have to. Lotta hair down there. Keith doesn’t…have to.

278
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,430
Anything else you want to know? Now is the time.

279
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,430
Nope. I’m good.

280
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,050
In 1982, Ronald Reagan’s deregulation of the nation’s mental hospitals

281
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,550
left thousands of former inpatients homeless!

282
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,550
I believed these incapacitated victims of greed deserved to voice their dissent, so...

283
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,160
I spent 2 nights roaming the streets of New York City in the dead of winter,

284
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,460
asking them to wipe their asses with this flag.

285
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,830
When this piece was unveiled, a group of quote patriots unquote,

286
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,430
ripped it from the walls of the Whitney Museum, took it to the streets, and burned it!

287
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,820
That I was able to motivate
these right- wing assholes

288
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,620
into actually burning an American flag,

289
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,220
now this…this is what I consider to be the highlight of my career!

290
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,860
So what’d you think?

291
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,260
I think he’s amazing.

292
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Amazing?

293
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,560
He’s so like unafraid and so committed to what he believes in.

294
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Hmm. You should meet him. Come on.

295
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,350
Stop hitting on my students, you overrated piece of shit.

296
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,750
Bite my ass, you Nazi prick!

297
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,570
Scott, I’d like you to meet Claire Fisher and Russell Corwin, 2 very promising first years.

298
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,270
Oh.

299
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,670
- It’s a real honor to meet you, sir.
- Totally.

300
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,130
Do yourselves a favor and give up now.

301
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,830
Unless of course you’re willing to live as outlaws,

302
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,430
because this is a culture where art is not only a dirty word, it’s a fucking crime!

303
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,460
Now I’m starving, I’m thirsty, and more importantly I am your guest.

304
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,480
Why don’t you two join us?

305
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,380
Seriously?

306
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,080
Claire, an artist never questions her right to experience everything the world has to offer.

307
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,580
Never.

308
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,260
Okay.

309
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,700
Maybe we can do as much damage tonight as we did in Antwerp.

310
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,600
I hope you’ve got better health insurance this time.

311
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,290
Okay, I’m officially scared.

312
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,890
Don’t let them see that.

313
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,070
Oh no, that’s my—That’s the good good china.

314
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,170
- Yes.
- Well, we never use the good good china.

315
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,970
Then, what’s it for?

316
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,690
But we hardly ever use the good china.

317
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,970
Oh. Do you want me to put this back and use the good china?

318
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,070
If THAT isn’t the good china, then what is it?

319
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,570
The good good china.

320
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,570
Oh, what the hell? Let’s use the good good china for once in my lifetime!

321
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,070
Yippee!

322
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,470
Bettina, this is my daughter- in- law, Lisa.

323
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,470
- Hi!
- I’ve heard a lot about you!

324
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,170
Oh, don’t worry, it’s all good. She likes you a hell of a lot better than the one before you!

325
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,810
Hey, Fisher, happy birthday!

326
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,810
Oh, goodness, Bettina, you didn’t have to do this!

327
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,910
Now, don’t even think about returning it, okay?

328
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,710
Because there’s no receipt, if you catch my drift.

329
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,970
Okay, c’mon now, we have to move this table.

330
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,670
Why?

331
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,170
Because we’re gonna dance!

332
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,770
Oh, heavens no! We don’t dance in this family.

333
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,070
Ruth Fisher, we’re gonna celebrate you tonight, whether you like it or not!

334
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,870
Now, go put on your new clothes!

335
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,840
Alright! Thank you.

336
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,670
Help me move it up against the window.

337
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,770
Don’t you think we should wait until after dinner?

338
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,170
Oh, hell, honey, I’ll be too wasted by then!

339
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,830
Oh, and I brought some music.

340
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,630
I hope you weren’t planning on listening to this Lilith Fair crap all night long!

341
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,340
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

342
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,330
No, asshole, being an artist is not about being right all the time!

343
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,030
Being an artist is resigning oneself to a life of masochism!

344
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,130
Okay, okay, just answer me this…why are you an artist?

345
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,730
Because I’m angry!

346
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,530
Yuch! Disgusting! What do you have to be angry about, you and your fucking grants?

347
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,900
I don’t use that grant money to make art. I give it away.

348
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,200
Yeah, but everybody knows that it was YOUR shit on the flag,

349
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
because you were too fucking scared to actually go there!!!

350
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,400
You’re just pissed, because you have nothing original to say! You never did!

351
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,400
No, you latch onto politics, because you have nothing original to say!

352
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
There is nothing original to say! It’s all been said before!

353
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,700
Go to Hollywood, then! That is so pathetic! That is so fucking American!!!

354
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,030
Is there anything more infuriating than the moral vanity of Eurotrash?

355
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,830
Toi, tu manges le merde du cul d’une pouffiasse, espece de con.

356
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,230
Bwah bwah bwah fuck you bwah bwah.

357
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,530
Olivier Lun die scheise einer hure ist besser kunst als du jamels machen kanst!

358
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,130
Welcome to Epcot, kids!

359
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,430
I would rip your dick off and force- feed it to you if I didn’t think you would like it so much!

360
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,230
Fantastic rage!

361
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,470
I so fucking love you, you stupid bald peasant!

362
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,470
So prove it! Buy us another round!

363
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,600
And why are you an artist?

364
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,960
because I have, um…a lot of pain.

365
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,020
Good. Good.

366
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,890
- Pain is good for an artist.
- Bullshit, bullshit

367
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,080
Adolescent romanticism, all artists must suffer!

368
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,690
God, you are fucking beautiful!

369
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,860
Your skin is like Carrara marble.

370
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,810
Is this young man your lover?

371
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,110
No.

372
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,780
Why the hell not?

373
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Maybe Russell doesn’t think she’s beautiful.

374
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,590
I think she’s very beautiful.

375
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,340
And why are you an artist?

376
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,730
Because I don’t have a fucking choice.

377
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,040
If I can’t create art, I don’t want to live.

378
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,250
Atta boy!

379
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,310
Why do you validate these infantile notions?

380
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,020
I’ll tell you why, because you want them to love you.

381
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,340
Because I want them to trust their own vision, something which you have none of, arriviste!

382
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,820
And you want them to love you.

383
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
Can I get you anything else?

384
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,890
My friend will have a shot of Ouzo with a big dollop of shit in it!

385
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,530
And our room opened directly out onto the pool.

386
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,330
And the dregs of humanity, from the looks of it!

387
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,330
And that’s the Sunday Smorgasbord Brunch.

388
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,100
They come for the Breakfast Burrito and the free shuttle to the outlet mall.

389
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,300
I never really understood the concept of a breakfast burrito.

390
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay, so where are all the X- rated ones?
You leave those at home?

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
Oh, you’ve gotta go on the Internet
and pay $9. 99 a month for those.

392
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,550
Oh, poor David always looked so funny in a bathing suit!

393
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,850
I do not look funny in a bathing suit!

394
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,850
Actually, you do.

395
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,190
- She asleep?
- Yeah.

396
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,910
You, on the other hand, do not look funny.

397
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,930
Bettina!

398
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,250
What? I’m just flirting!

399
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,390
You’re barking up the wrong tree, lady!

400
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,690
Who wants coffee?

401
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,790
For God’s sake, Lisa, would you stop waiting on us?

402
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,090
C’mon, sit down! You deserve a break after that scrumptious meal!

403
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,190
This is David in front of the Geoffrey Beene outlet mall.

404
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,390
Oh my God!

405
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,270
See, now I get the attraction!

406
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,270
Yeah, he’s a hottie!

407
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,970
Oh, I almost forgot!

408
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,860
Happy birthday!

409
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,860
Oh, dear, you really shouldn’t have!

410
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,360
Ruth, shut up!

411
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,840
It’s just a little something I thought of at the last minute.

412
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,460
“For my mother- in- law, on her special day,

413
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,840
this coupon is redeemable for one free foot massage. Love, Lisa. ”

414
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Nice!

415
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,580
What happened to the bath salts?

416
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,280
It just felt so impersonal.

417
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
Can I have it now?

418
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,580
- You want it now?
- Yes, please!

419
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,880
I love massages!

420
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,830
Since when?

421
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,430
Since yesterday! Please!

422
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,370
You…wanna go on the sun porch?
Maybe it’ll be more comfortable.

423
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,710
Come on, maybe we’ll all end up naked!

424
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,410
Well, I wouldn’t bet on that!

425
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,240
Well, I would!

426
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,140
Does this party seem a little weird to you?

427
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,630
On a scale of 1 to 10? 90!

428
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,330
So what do you really think of his work?

429
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,410
I like…parts of it.

430
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,110
Not really, though.

431
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,570
It’s kind of on the nose.

432
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,020
It’s way too on the nose!

433
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,250
Good. Because every nasty thing I said to him earlier was the absolute truth,

434
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,250
and every flattering thing was a lie.

435
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,610
You didn’t say too much that was flattering.

436
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,160
You are a brilliant artist, Claire.

437
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,200
The piece you did last week in studio

438
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,600
was better than anything Smith has done in the last ten years.

439
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,040
Really?

440
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,140
Absolutely.

441
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,490
But you, Russell, you’re gonna be successful beyond your wildest dreams.

442
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,050
Do you honestly think so?

443
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,050
Would I lie to you?

444
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,080
I might.

445
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,050
But who gives a fuck?

446
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,760
The world is gonna love you.

447
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,160
That’s why, no matter what, you cannot care what other people think.

448
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
No, I don’t. I don’t care what other people think.

449
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Phony baloney, ka- ka shit!

450
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,340
Everybody your age cares what other people think.

451
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
You don’t even know what you think yourself.

452
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,860
I have to pee.

453
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
I’m serious about you, Claire.

454
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,150
Russell is good. He’s gonna make a lot of money.

455
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,250
But you…your talent is epic.

456
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,850
It’s like the tail of a comet.

457
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,740
You can change the world.

458
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,980
Oh, shut up! Oh, God!

459
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,120
I’m so envious of you.

460
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,140
You see the world with your own eyes.

461
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,740
Do you know what a rare and precious gift that is?

462
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,510
No.

463
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,180
And God created beauty, and then he retired.

464
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,250
Promise me you’ll do great things in your life. Nothing less!

465
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,120
Promise me!

466
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,020
I promise.

467
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,490
Alright, let’s get out of here, and leave that imbecile with the tab.

468
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,270
Oh my God, that feels unbelievably good!

469
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,270
I have strong hands.

470
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh, right there, that’s the spot.

471
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,930
How come you never give me a foot massage?

472
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,830
Because your feet stink.

473
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,400
They do not!

474
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,700
They do! You get that from your father.

475
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,410
How come you never give me a foot massage?

476
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,290
Because you never ask.

477
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
This is really weird.

478
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:07,440
I just remembered this dream I had
...about a month ago, I guess.

479
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,640
I was getting a foot massage, and I think you all know that I have extremely ticklish feet.

480
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,160
And you were all there. I mean, not you, Bettina, and not you, Keith,

481
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,090
no offense, but everyone else. You were there, and Lisa, and David, and Claire.

482
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,210
And, there I am, I’m getting this foot massage. I can’t remember who was giving it to me.

483
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,810
It think it may have been, um…I think it may have been Dad, um…

484
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,450
oh, yeah, and I’m holding Maya, and she’s really slippery, and she’s just squirming like a pig…

485
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,980
And she’s just squirming like a pig, and then what?

486
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,010
I don’t—I don’t remember the rest of it. Except that, uh…

487
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,470
I could never find my shoes.

488
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,560
I read somewhere that every person in your dream is actually you.

489
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,060
I’m gonna go check on the baby.

490
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,450
Did you know that there are more bones in the feet than there are in the rest of the entire body?

491
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,250
I didn’t know that, but now that you say it,
I totally believe it.

492
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,110
Thank you, dear.

493
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,510
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s done for me in a very long time.

494
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,110
It’s my pleasure. Just my little way of saying thank you for letting us live here.

495
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,510
Well, of course! You’re family!

496
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,280
Okay, nobody touches anything.

497
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,840
I love it!

498
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,220
Oh, my! It’s very large.

499
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,520
I’ve always wanted to see the Great Wall of China.

500
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,620
So have I! We should go!

501
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
What the hell is this?

502
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,020
The scenic designer of L. A. Lyric Opera created this for the funeral of his lover.

503
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,920
It figures!

504
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,620
What figures?

505
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,720
Only a gay man would build a fucking opera set for his lover’s funeral!

506
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,420
I think it cheapens their whole relationship.

507
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,020
Oh, pfft! Don’t be such a snob! It’s sweet!

508
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,020
You’d better be prepared to build me something like this when I go.

509
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,120
What, something involving Steve McQueen on a motorcycle?

510
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,520
Yeah, and an entire POW barracks.

511
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,220
Now, get over here.

512
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,670
What? Oh, come on! Why don’t you loosen up?

513
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,670
Oh, it’s unbelievable!

514
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,370
What’d I miss?

515
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,870
You and um, me and Lisa are going on vacation to China together!

516
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,670
Oh, me me me me me too! Me too! Can I come?

517
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,870
Baby, are you drunk?

518
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,180
It’s okay. I have like 4 days worth of milk in the freezer.

519
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,860
Why’d you change your shirt?

520
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,930
I just spilled something on the other one.

521
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,630
You’re such a klutz…but you’re my klutz!

522
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,910
You smell like Listerine.

523
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,610
Oh, yeah, yeah.

524
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,610
I’m dying.

525
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,860
His name was Simon Rodia, and he spent 33 years working on them,

526
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,230
and when he felt they were finished, he gave the deed to his house to a neighbor,

527
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
packed up, and moved away.

528
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,190
They’re amazing.

529
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,790
He put everything into them.

530
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,940
Whatever he’d find on his way walking to and from work,

531
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:11,670
steel rods, seashells, pottery, glass, old boots, corncobs.

532
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,670
He must’ve been out of his mind!

533
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,040
Well, he was a construction worker. But he was a real artist.

534
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,370
And all real artists are out of their mind.

535
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah? You think so?

536
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,970
Look at Olivier and Scott Smith!

537
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,370
Yeah.

538
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,370
Van Gogh cut off an ear.

539
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,750
- It’s so weird.
- What?

540
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,900
I mean, every single person at our school thinks they’re gonna be successful, right?

541
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,000
Otherwise they wouldn’t even be doing this.

542
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah.

543
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,250
But I mean…what is success?

544
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,740
Is it just money? Or fame?

545
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:05,090
Or is it, like, the critics, loving you? Or is it…is it you knowing that you’ve done good work?

546
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,370
Or what?

547
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,270
I mean, this is a fucking masterpiece.

548
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,770
But maybe the guy who made it just thought it was shit, and…

549
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,770
and now no one even knows his name!

550
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,070
Simon Rodia.

551
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,120
God. I feel like such a phony.

552
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,680
No, you’re fucking brilliant.

553
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,800
Because I can’t imagine ever being this dedicated or this consumed by anything.

554
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,060
Maybe you just haven’t found whatever it is that’s worth cutting off an ear for.

555
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,670
I would never cut off my fucking ear! Never!

556
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,910
Van Gogh did it for love.

557
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,480
He did it because he was totally insane!

558
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,490
Well, it’s only an ear.

559
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,080
You know, it’s not like he couldn’t hear out of it. I mean, there was still a hole there!

560
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,850
It’s almost 2.

561
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,150
Oh my God.

562
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,770
I’m not even tired, are you?

563
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,030
No.

564
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,500
Party pooper!

565
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,020
How come you’re not upstairs embarrassing yourself with everybody else.

566
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,030
I don’t know. I—

567
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,990
Wanted a little time to yourself?

568
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,030
I know this great little Indian restaurant in Hollywood.

569
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,320
The owner’ll give you the room upstairs. All you have to do is bury his wife for free.

570
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,070
Yeah, I’m not quite there yet.

571
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,810
Won’t be long!

572
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,720
You’re a funeral director, which you never wanted to be.

573
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,220
Just like your old man!

574
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,190
You married a woman that you knocked up because you thought it was the right thing to do.

575
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,910
Just like your old man!

576
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,750
You want one?

577
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,430
No, thanks.

578
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,830
So, when you wake up, you’re gonna throw away that pack you already have?

579
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,830
Probably.

580
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,860
I’M NOT YOU!

581
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
You just keep telling yourself that.

582
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,740
I’M NOT SHUT DOWN!

583
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,850
I’M NOT 500 FUCKING MILLION MILES AWAY! I HAVEN’T GIVEN UP!

584
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,210
I LOVE MY FAMILY!

585
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,950
Buddy boy, you think I would’ve stuck around if I didn’t love mine?

586
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,550
Check this out. “Ambiguous Figure Between Curtains” by Olivier Castro- Staal.

587
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,690
That is so intense.

588
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,660
It’s part of the permanent collection of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati.

589
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
It reminds me of Frances Bacon a little.

590
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,830
Oh my God. He was only 20 when he made this?

591
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,530
That means we have like a year to produce something this good.

592
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,750
I think it’s really cool that you live in a funeral home.

593
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,100
Believe me, it’s not.

594
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
Are you kidding?

595
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,660
I’m jealous!

596
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:43,060
It’s totally weird and excellent and perfect for when they write your biography.

597
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,270
I’m not gay, you know.

598
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,620
- What?
- I'm not...gay.

599
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,610
Who said anything about you being gay?

600
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,140
Well, you thought I was.

601
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,630
Most people think I am. But I’m not.

602
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,980
Okay.

603
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,700
And I don’t even know what it is, but guys hit on me like all the fucking time.

604
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,140
It’s probably because you’re hot.

605
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,540
You think I’m hot?

606
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,980
I do.

607
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,570
Really?

608
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,040
Because usually I get a “He’s cute! ”

609
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,540
No, you’re way more than cute.

610
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,230
- I am.
- Definitely.

611
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,690
So you didn’t think I was gay?

612
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,560
I thought you might be.

613
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,910
Well, I’m not.

614
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,640
I think we’ve just established that.

615
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,470
Okay.

616
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,300
I lit it exactly the way Bob would have.

617
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,890
I always needed his lighting to make me look good.

618
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,650
Thank you all for joining me today in celebrating Bob’s life.

619
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,160
We’re all so lucky to have experienced the joy of knowing him,

620
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,590
and I’m not just referring to the joy of knowing him biblically.

621
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,690
Although a lot of you here have experienced that as well.

622
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,900
I know, because I was there.

623
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:40,750
I never thought that I’d be in a relationship…at all.

624
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,480
I thought I didn’t have what it takes,

625
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,240
that no one could possibly love me enough to…stick around.

626
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,390
But Bob did.

627
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,670
He stuck around.

628
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,390
And so did I.

629
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:15,340
And for 22 years, we shared our hearts,

630
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,700
our bodies,

631
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,430
our souls.

632
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,350
It wasn’t always easy,

633
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,200
it wasn’t always fun.

634
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
But it was always worth it.

635
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,330
I don’t know what I did in a previous life,

636
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,270
but to quote Julie Andrews as Maria Von Trapp,

637
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,970
“it must have been something good, ”

638
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,730
because I’ve been rewarded a thousand fold in this life.

639
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,360
Nessun dorma!

640
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:31,540
Tu pure, o Principessa,

641
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,740
nella tua fredda stanza

642
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:43,940
guardi le stelle che tremano

643
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:54,040
d'amore e di speranza!

644
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:02,710
Ma il mio mistero è chiuso in me,

645
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,910
il nome mio nessun saprà!

646
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:21,010
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò,

647
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:26,710
quando la luce

648
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,340
How was the funeral?

649
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,140
It was pretty great, actually.

650
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,850
As far as funerals go.

651
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,770
I could hear the singing from here!

652
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,770
Yeah, the guy had an amazing voice.

653
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,590
Do you think your mother had fun last night?

654
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,370
Are you kidding me?

655
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,370
I haven’t seen her that happy in…well, maybe ever.

656
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,280
That was a really great thing you did, honey. I’m really proud of you.

657
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,230
And I’m really proud of us.

658
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,530
For what?

659
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,430
For making this work.

660
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,860
For being present. For showing up each day.

661
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,470
For being committed to being a family.

662
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,740
Is it that hard for you?

663
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,650
No, no, no, no, of course not.

664
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,350
- I thought this is what you wanted.
- It is what I want.

665
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,150
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

666
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,250
I mean like totally sure? 100% and absolutely? No doubts whatsoever?

667
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,640
I’m sure.

668
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,550
Oh, Nate, I love you so much, it terrifies me.

669
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,540
Do you think you might be able to run by Whole Foods for me some time tonight?

670
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,040
- Yeah, I’ll go right now.
- You will?

671
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,840
- Yeah.
- The list is on the fridge, in the main house.

672
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,940
Okay.

673
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,080
I won’t be long.

674
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,380
You’re home early.

675
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,680
Am I?

676
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,380
How was your day?

677
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,210
It was…okay. How was yours?

678
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,010
Oh, the usual.

679
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,060
Hey, what’s wrong?

680
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
I want us to last.

681
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,030
I want us to stay together.

682
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,400
Okay.

683
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,900
I just want it to be worth it.

684
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,820
Okay.

685
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,050
How was your birthday party?

686
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,520
You know what?
I thought it was going to be awful,

687
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,360
but it was truly one of the finest evenings I ever spent.

688
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,960
Wow! I’m sorry I missed it.

689
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,360
Lisa gave me a foot massage.

690
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,460
It was heavenly.

691
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,160
I got a little tipsy. We danced.

692
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,490
Okay. I’m really sorry I missed it.

693
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,820
I saved you a piece of birthday cake. It’s in the fridge.

694
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,320
Thanks.

695
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,320
How was your guest artist lecture?

696
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,470
Oh, it was…

697
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:12,310
Actually, it was truly one of the finest evenings I’ve ever spent!

698
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,500
We went out afterwards, me, Russell, and our teacher, and then this artist, and...

699
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,200
I’m not even sure what happened, but...

700
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,800
I just had this like glimpse of what might be possible, and...

701
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,200
for whatever reason, the world just seemed like really open...

702
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,400
and interesting and not totally screwed up. And...

703
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I don’t know. I don’t know.

704
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,930
I just felt really happy.

705
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,430
Mom, would you like to go to a museum with me today?

706
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:49,770
I would love nothing more!

707
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,030
Should I make lunch first?

708
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:57,230
No, let’s go out. We can go to Neddie’s. It’ll be my treat…for your birthday.

709
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,230
Well, thank you, Claire!

710
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,630
I was just gonna put this table back where it was.

711
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,630
Oh, do you want me to help?

712
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,060
No, we can do it later.

713
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,460
