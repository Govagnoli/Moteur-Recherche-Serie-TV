1
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,108
Why is it always up to me, Cindy?
I end up doing everything.

2
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,311
I'll bring the food,
but I think Ann should bring the drinks.

3
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,555
- What's their address again?
- On Orange.

4
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,160
She brought one lousy pizza
for the whole team.

5
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,555
- The exact address.
- I know how to get there.

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,591
- I want to use the GPS.
- You're dead!

7
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,710
- What are you playing?
- Mortal Kombat.

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,593
- Is that violent?
- It's not violent.

9
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,835
- I need a new DVD!
- Just use that one again.

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,075
- I need the exact address.
- It's Bobby's.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,430
Cindy says no way is Bobby
allowed to play that game.

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,675
- Where did he get it?
- Passed Crescent.

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,835
- I want a new DVD.
- Turn left.

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,677
- Which way?
- I'm waiting.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,188
- Just a second, honey.
- Just give her one.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,958
- Go left!
- Here?

17
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,998
There's something weird about twins.
About these twins, anyway.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,593
- They're cute.
- They smell like bananas.

19
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,799
You just don't think
any kid's as good as Maya.

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,831
Well, they're not.

21
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,270
Cos you're perfect, aren't you?

22
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,594
Why, yes.

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,119
We could have a pretty great kid.

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,632
What time are they coming down?

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,673
- Tomorrow afternoon sometime.
- Are we supposed to cook for them?

26
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,838
I really don't feel like making
dinner for someone who hates me.

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,919
Barb doesn't hate you.
She was just surprised to see you.

28
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,033
You're not her favourite person,
but this is a chance for her to get to know you.

29
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,551
Sure you don't want me to hide in the garage?
I can curl up real small.

30
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,558
So about that thing I just said,
that thing that you completely ignored?

31
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,397
I heard you.

32
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,231
We could have a great kid.

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,636
- So...
- So, it's something to think about.

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,033
To think about.

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,756
I already had a kid without thinking about it
and I don't want to do that again.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,396
When were you thinking about thinking
about it? I'm thinking sooner rather than later.

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,192
What's the rush?

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,994
Well... I'm kind of at an age where...

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,150
I can't commit to a relationship that doesn't
have the possibility of having a child.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,232
- So look, if you're saying no...
- I'm not saying no, I just...

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,510
It's overwhelming just dealing with
one child...and all this, kind of new.

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,429
You know, it takes a couple our age
on average, like, a year to get pregnant.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,598
So even if we started trying now
we might not have a baby for two years.

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm not saying no. I promise.

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,109
You got groceries?

46
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,436
Chandler walnuts from the farmers' market.

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,675
All of that is walnuts?

48
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,676
What are you going to do with them?

49
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,551
We're going to eat them.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,752
Some of them we can process into
walnut butter, but mostly we'll eat them.

51
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,439
They're full of protein and omega-3s.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,072
I got the brochure from
the Loving Couples Center.

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,271
- What's that?
- The retreat Kyle and Becky went on.

54
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,869
There's quite a list of weekend
workshops that they offer.

55
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,911
They sent a videotape as well.

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,799
Intimacy And Healing.

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,991
Finding The New In Your Partner.

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,828
And Tantric Love,
which you seem to have circled.

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,950
Hoping to add some spice to our sex life?

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,639
It's becoming very popular.

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,798
Woody Harrelson, Jill Eikenberry
and Sting are all practitioners.

62
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,831
Not with each other, but you know...

63
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,839
Ruth, if this is something you'd like to do,
I'd be more than happy to go.

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,314
Really? I'm so pleased.

65
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,271
I'll fill out the application.

66
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,558
I was wondering.
Where do you keep your extra water?

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,909
There's a pitcher in the refrigerator.

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,599
I mean for earthquakes
and other emergencies.

69
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,839
You should always have extra water on hand,
flashlights, batteries, canned food.

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,111
Do you know something?
Ls there going to be an earthquake?

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,151
Ls that why you got the walnuts?

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,839
I got the walnuts because I like walnuts.

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,031
And there most certainly
is going to be an earthquake.

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,437
We can't pinpoint exactly when, but could be
tomorrow, could be 100 years from now.

75
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,596
You had me concerned.

76
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,235
You should be concerned.
We should all be concerned and prepared,

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,919
If not for an earthquake, then a terrorist attack,

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,555
or a catastrophic drought,
or who knows what else?

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,037
George, lately it seems if it's not
one thing with you, it's another.

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,071
Exactly.

81
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,272
These are...amazing.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,840
Really.

83
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,632
Amazing, Claire.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,671
Yeah, they're so cool.

85
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,439
They remind me of that guy...
What's his name?

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,075
- The guy who does people in swimming pools.
- David Hockney.

87
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,908
And he did this one thing of photographs,
like of the desert...

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,555
- Pearblossom Highway.
- Yeah, that.

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,196
But it's like you took it ten steps further.
You made it personal.

90
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,832
Jean Baudrillard once said,

91
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,919
"Every possible art form
has already been explored.

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,839
"All that's left is to deconstruct
and play with the pieces."

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,668
That's literally what you did.
Explain the process.

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,191
Well, I'd take a whole bunch
of close-ups of someone,

95
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,031
like every inch of their face,
and then print those actual size,

96
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,517
and photocopy them
and then papier-mâchê pieces

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,711
over the person's face
and make an actual mask.

98
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,076
Then when that dried,
I had them put the mask back on

99
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,275
and then I would take a portrait
in a setting that hopefully reveals

100
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,675
something new about the person.

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,393
Yeah, there's so much depth to them.

102
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,556
Exactly, they're like sculpture.

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Is that what you were thinking?

104
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,991
I don't know.
I guess I was thinking more emotionally,

105
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,600
like how many layers
there are to a person,

106
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,916
and how we all wear masks,

107
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,077
even if that mask is our own skin.

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,159
But I think it was
my background in sculpture

109
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,988
that really allowed us to make that leap.

110
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,751
You know, when I first put the pictures
of Claire's open eyes

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,351
over her closed eyes,
I was thinking of her as sculpture.

112
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,038
So you helped her with these?

113
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,029
In terms of creating the original concept, yeah.
We worked together.

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,675
I mean, she's a photographer. I'm a sculptor.

115
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,191
Somehow we combined those two elements
and created something new.

116
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,275
I think they turned out great.

117
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,595
You look just like your mother.

118
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah, that's what everyone says...

119
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,470
or said.

120
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,476
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,197
Such a tragedy.

122
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,800
I still can't even quite...

123
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,431
It's just too much.

124
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,035
Does your family have a burial plot?

125
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,951
I don't know, I doubt it.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,991
Cremation is a popular option.

127
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,152
Do that, but then buried.
I want them somewhere all together,

128
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,839
- where I can go see them.
- We can arrange that.

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,475
Have you thought about
what kind of service you want?

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,671
I don't even know what
kind of services there are.

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,154
- Just a regular one.
- OK.

132
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,079
Did your family have a lot of friends?

133
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,319
They had friends,
but I don't know who all of them are.

134
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,751
We can post a notice in the paper.
We're also happy to make any calls.

135
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,268
Do you have any other family?

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,029
I don't think you should
be dealing with this alone.

137
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,628
One grandmother left, but she's in a home.

138
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,800
And an aunt and an uncle in Florida,
but I don't really know them. So it's just me.

139
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,195
My whole family...

140
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,112
What we're looking at is battery, assault
and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,720
Mr Pasquese suffered a torn earlobe,

142
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,355
inflicting acute pain and requiring
surgical resculpturing.

143
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,951
The pain rendered him unable to work. He
dropped out as producer of a motion picture.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,069
What?

145
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,715
His irreplaceable earring was lost
during the course of the attack.

146
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,514
It was just a little hoop!
Who wears earrings now anyway?

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,916
Mr Pasquese has also suffered
recurrent nightmares

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,078
and is unable to enter a sushi establishment,
lessening his enjoyment of life.

149
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,715
For these reasons we are asking
for restitution of $500,000.

150
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,311
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- We'll leave you to consider the details.

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,670
If they're not to your liking,
we'll institute a civil case

152
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,871
- and consider pressing criminal charges.
- Oh, my God!

153
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,471
This is ridiculous.
She can't possibly be serious, can she?

154
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,875
How strong is his case?

155
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,151
- Did you bite his ear, Mr Fisher?
- Well, yes!

156
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,395
Well, then his case is quite good.

157
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,319
But what am I supposed to do?
I don't have that kind of money.

158
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,148
Can't we do a temporary
insanity plea or whatever?

159
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,591
His therapist thinks he's suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,474
In the event that this case goes to trial,
that's a possibility.

161
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,511
But do you want this to go to trial?

162
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,348
Because that's when things
become very expensive.

163
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,193
I like this restaurant.
How'd you hear about it?

164
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,629
Joe.

165
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,671
Have you been speaking to him lately?

166
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,555
No, he hasn't called
and I feel too guilty to call him.

167
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,071
I think he feels like I betrayed him

168
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,159
and I never took him seriously.

169
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,670
Well, you certainly did...betray him.

170
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,114
- Mom, I know that, thank you.
- Come on, darling. I'm not judging you.

171
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,755
- I've done far worse.
- The thing is, I did take him seriously.

172
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,920
I really believed that I was going
to settle down and have his baby.

173
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,839
I never thought
that I could have that with Nate.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,716
That he would forgive me
and want to take me back.

175
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,195
I think Nate's been going through
some life-changing experiences himself.

176
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,196
He's still going through them.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,992
I think I understand his relationship
with Lisa better,

178
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,434
how you can settle for someone
who's just not the person you should be with.

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,028
You know, you and Nate
sound like me and Bern,

180
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,117
the way we knew each other.

181
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,072
I mean, we understood each...

182
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,119
We understood each other
like nobody else could.

183
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,196
God help you.

184
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,830
The chicken Caesar salad, please.

185
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,914
I'm going to have
the porterhouse steak, medium rare.

186
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,315
You're having steak for lunch? Thanks.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,989
Yeah, I'm just feeling a little anaemic lately.

188
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,869
Yeah, you do look a little pale.

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,708
No, I think I'll go to the bathroom.
Be right back.

190
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,197
Hi, my name is Albert Gross.

191
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,075
I was wondering if you might have a moment
to discuss your eternal happiness.

192
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,032
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

193
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,836
Through a global preaching campaign,

194
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,873
God is making known the good news about
His kingdom governed by Jesus Christ.

195
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,391
Those who respond are gathering into
a place of spiritual protection and healing.

196
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,750
Soon we'll experience freedom
from injustice and suffering.

197
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,360
Seems to me like
the opposite is happening.

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,234
That's because human government
is still under the control of Satan.

199
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,635
The perfect government is in heaven.

200
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,275
From there the King Jesus Christ
will rule all the earth.

201
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,118
So how do you think
King Jesus plans to address

202
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,038
the ever-widening holes in the ozone layer?

203
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,073
Or the missing stockpiles
of weapons-grade plutonium?

204
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,434
Well, I think that God will solve
all of mankind's problems in His own way.

205
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,350
Albert, look, this is an enormously
complex world we live in

206
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,188
and its problems are multiplying every day.

207
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,074
We're not going to solve them
by going door to door and asking people

208
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,271
to get down on their knees and pray to the sky!

209
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,269
Shouldn't a bright young man like you
be doing something constructive?

210
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,914
I'm going to write down
a couple of websites for you

211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,350
that will hopefully enlighten you a little bit.

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,631
Excuse me, are you Brenda Chenowith?

213
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,274
Your mom needs you in the ladies' room.

214
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,998
Thank you.

215
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,356
Mom?

216
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,517
I'm in here. Do you have any pads?

217
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,556
No, why do you need a pad?
Don't tell me you had that vagina surgery.

218
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,512
No, I just went in for a consultation.

219
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,269
Listen, I've been bleeding a lot lately.

220
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,796
God, Mom!

221
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
It won't stop. It just won't stop.

222
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,034
I'm calling 911. Don't worry, Mom.

223
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,755
Claire, it's me... Mom.

224
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,310
- I have your laundry.
- You didn't have to do that.

225
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,875
But it gives me an excuse
to come up and visit.

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
Well, you can come up any time you want.

227
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,431
Thank you.

228
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,358
There's no one in the house any more.

229
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,391
It's so quiet.

230
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,951
I know that smell.

231
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,955
Is this marijuana?

232
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,954
I used to smell it on Nathaniel
every once in a while.

233
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,837
I always thought it was some
sort of embalming chemical.

234
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,996
He never gave it to you, did he?

235
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,636
Oh, God, no. I discovered it on my own.

236
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,592
How funny that Nathaniel
would keep it a secret.

237
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,112
Do you smoke it a lot?

238
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
- Not too much.
- That's good.

239
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,595
I read somewhere that you should treat it
as a spice, just a little pinch here and there.

240
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,120
How striking.

241
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,153
- You used to make collages as a little girl.
- I did?

242
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,590
You were always tearing up my magazines
before I could read them.

243
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,837
I mean, sorry.

244
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,071
Back to my quiet house, I suppose.

245
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,315
Well, you got George in there.

246
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,839
He's not much of a noise-maker.

247
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,236
Hey, are things OK?

248
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,077
Yes, definitely better.

249
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,759
I can see he's trying, and so am I.

250
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,758
He's a good man, he just
needs to let me in a little.

251
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,155
I still want to grow old with him.

252
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,316
I mean, I'm almost there already.

253
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,955
Please, you have a long way to go.

254
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,992
He agreed to go
to a Loving Couples workshop with me.

255
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,235
Really? That's cool.

256
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,749
- On Tantric love.
- Mom!

257
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,873
I know! Don't tell the boys.

258
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
Hey, guys! How was the movie?

259
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,471
Augusto was scared.

260
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,792
- You took them to see a scary movie?
- No, it was a cartoon.

261
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,913
- They're too young to see scary movies.
- It wasn't scary.

262
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,679
You guys, go brush your teeth.
Get ready for bed.

263
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,794
So, Julio tells me that... What's her name?

264
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,755
Kenny's sister, Julie, has been watching them.
Isn't she some kind of druggie?

265
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,951
Please, she smoked a little pot
in high school. We all did.

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,560
- I didn't.
- I know, Rico, cos you were boring.

267
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,478
It's weird that Kenny's
whole family is moving in here.

268
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,398
You're so ridiculous.
I'm a single parent. I need help.

269
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,432
Julie's a good baby-sitter.
She's coming over tomorrow.

270
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,755
You're not a single parent. I can watch them.

271
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,351
- I don't want you here all the time.
- So I have to keep paying for a baby-sitter?

272
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,995
I work as much as you do.
You're not paying for anything.

273
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,560
Don't we have any rice? How am I supposed
to make risotto without any rice?

274
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,956
- So we'll have pasta.
- I don't want fucking pasta!

275
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,797
David, calm down.

276
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,116
Don't tell me to calm down.
We're going to lose everything.

277
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,993
- This lawsuit is going to bankrupt us.
- No, it's not.

278
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,999
Yes, it is! My liability insurance
won't cover any of this.

279
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,033
He's going to sue us and take everything
we have, that stupid motherfucker!

280
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
David, take a deep breath.

281
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,920
Now, hold it in.

282
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
Now, slowly let it out.

283
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,199
Do it again.

284
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,198
Feel yourself relax.

285
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,550
Instead of focusing on the negative,
think positive thoughts.

286
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,559
Does that include beating the shit
out of Roger fucking Pasquese?

287
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,239
Look, even if he does sue us, we'll be OK.

288
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,556
He can't take anything of mine
cos I had nothing to do with this,

289
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,636
and legally he has no right.

290
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,275
Maybe this is the upside
to us not being able to get married.

291
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,950
He'll take my part of the funeral home
and garnish my wages for life.

292
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,719
- No, he won't.
- Of course he will. He wants revenge.

293
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,276
He didn't say a word the whole meeting.
I think his lawyer is putting him up to this.

294
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,959
He's probably a reasonable guy.

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,070
I don't think so.

296
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,032
Maybe we should try talking
to him away from his lawyer.

297
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,311
- See if we can settle this.
- He'll never agree to it.

298
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,716
I'm going to call him tomorrow.
We got nothing to lose.

299
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,270
<i>The Loving Couples Center</i>
<i>offers many different workshops</i>.

300
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>Whatever your needs,</i>
<i>we're sure you'll find one suited to you</i>.

301
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,592
- <i>Maybe even more than one</i>.
- <i>Let's not be pushy, Bob</i>.

302
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
I hope those people aren't going to be there.

303
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,232
I think they're just celebrity spokespeople.

304
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,635
They're celebrities?

305
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,989
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

306
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,713
Mom, can you come downstairs, please?

307
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,638
- Now?
- Now would be good.

308
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,068
- That's a lot of water.
- Yes. What is it doing in there?

309
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,951
What happened to my cremains urns?

310
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,560
- I put them in the smaller closet.
- You did this?

311
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,355
- I told you I was going to order extra water.
- This is more than I anticipated.

312
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,913
I thought you understood.

313
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,032
This is only the bare minimum
you'd need in an emergency.

314
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,877
Sorry, but we can't keep it in here.

315
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,309
I can't just put it out in the driveway.

316
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,148
- Maybe one of the spare bedrooms.
- Fine, just get it out of here.

317
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,078
Or maybe that old bomb shelter
would be better.

318
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,430
- Whatever.
- You have a bomb shelter?

319
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,348
- Brenda...stop!
- I'm trying to make you more comfortable.

320
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,234
- Well, then get me some more Vicodin!
- You just had some.

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,431
I tell you what I need and you say no.

322
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,675
Mom, could you try to be more reasonable?

323
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,395
Don't be reasonable.
Be as mean as you want. Let it all out.

324
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,032
Thank you.

325
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,915
That's exactly what I'm going
to be...a nasty old crone,

326
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,757
now that I'm no longer a woman.

327
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,189
This doesn't make you any less of a woman.

328
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,832
Really?

329
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,599
Then give me your uterus.

330
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,470
- Maybe I should come back?
- Of course not, have a seat.

331
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,360
Yeah, stay.

332
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,033
Mom, I brought you your favourite flowers,
as did Brenda.

333
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,355
Flowers...are for pretty girls,
not someone like me.

334
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,039
She's not a woman any more.

335
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,470
Come on, you're still young and beautiful.

336
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,115
Of course they're going to say nice things
to you. They're your kids.

337
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,948
But me, I'm a miserable prick who cares
nothing about anyone but myself,

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,230
and I look at you in your hospital bed,

339
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,555
tired and worn out from surgery,

340
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,512
and I selfishly wonder, how long must I wait

341
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,357
before I can fuck you?

342
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,718
Finally somebody said something right.

343
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,630
It would have been weird if I'd said it.

344
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,750
Not in this family.

345
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,475
Darlings, would you please
give us a little privacy?

346
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,959
- God! Mom, you're not going to...
- I just want to be with Olivier for a minute.

347
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,755
Now, go. Go on, go. Get something to eat.

348
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,832
Look at all the flowers. A plastic monkey.

349
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,111
Look, it's like a parade float without the parade.

350
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,355
These flowers are amazing.

351
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,996
If they used an actual tiger, that would
occasionally maim an innocent passer-by,

352
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,031
then maybe I'd like it.

353
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,957
Isn't it sad, though?

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,073
Nothing we can ever create
will be as beautiful as this flower.

355
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,755
I don't know. Those Lego dinosaurs
you made were pretty fucking amazing.

356
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,473
Why are you so above everything?

357
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,675
Excuse me, but you can't do that.

358
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,996
It's OK, Dick Cheney is my uncle.

359
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,595
- Hey, what's your problem?
- What's my problem?

360
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,428
I can't fucking believe
you would try to take credit for my work.

361
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,471
I wasn't taking credit for your work.

362
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,080
I was taking my share of credit for our idea!

363
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,554
Please.

364
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,878
Jesus Christ, are you that insecure
you have to take credit for everything?

365
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,118
- I don't want to have this conversation.
- Because you know you're wrong.

366
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,312
You know I tore that photograph
and put the pieces on your face.

367
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,999
That was the idea.
That was the fucking idea!

368
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,270
I can't believe you'd try and take credit.

369
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,118
You tore up a picture. Big fucking deal!

370
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,799
I told you to photograph it! I saw the potential!

371
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,435
Great. So if Picasso painted a picture,
it would be all right

372
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,199
if you took photos
and told everyone it was yours.

373
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,959
I can't believe you'd
compare yourself to Picasso.

374
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,831
I wasn't.

375
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,671
Look, one of the coolest things
about this was that we did it together.

376
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,508
I like that, just working with you.

377
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Excuse me, young lady!
I need to speak with you.

378
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,116
- Run!
- Fuck.

379
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,390
Did you want soup?

380
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,353
No, I always have such
ridiculously high expectations of hospital soup,

381
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,868
and I'm always so very disappointed.

382
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,275
Thanks.

383
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,350
You know, I should probably...

384
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,755
You don't have to say anything.

385
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,675
- I will, though.
- I know, but you don't have to.

386
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,633
You think I should tell Mom
I slept with Olivier once in college?

387
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,831
I kind of wish you hadn't told me.

388
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,757
Thank you.

389
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,189
It would be fun to see Mom's reaction.

390
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,276
We are the most sexually inappropriate people
in the world, aren't we?

391
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,233
Yeah, well, look who our mother is.
I don't think we had a choice.

392
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,274
Yeah, but it's too easy for me
to blame her for all my horrible behaviour.

393
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,834
If you stop blaming her,
I'll have to do the same.

394
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,318
Maybe it's time.

395
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,476
What about Dad, can we blame him?

396
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,078
I'm thinking about having kids.

397
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,350
- With Nate?
- Yeah.

398
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,035
You think I'm crazy.

399
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,071
No, not at all.

400
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,155
I think it's great.

401
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,240
I think you are going to be a great mother.

402
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,751
It's good to see you.

403
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,108
<i>Nathaniel's father had it built</i>
<i>during the Cuban missile crisis</i>.

404
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,358
His mother used to keep
her canned goods in here,

405
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,755
but I haven't been down here in ages.

406
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,554
This door is lined with lead.

407
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,230
- See, it's just an old...
- Not a drop of moisture.

408
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,475
Somebody knew what they were doing.

409
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,238
The boys used to play down here.

410
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,078
And David, when I'd scold him...

411
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,556
this was his little hideaway
place to sit and pout.

412
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,917
It's so dusty.

413
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,155
- It smells like...
- Life.

414
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,192
It smells like life.

415
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,710
Yes, sir, this'll do just fine.

416
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,600
I always put black actors in my films.

417
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,555
Even if the part doesn't say it's a black guy,
I always think, "Why not a black guy?"

418
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,351
You ever do any acting?

419
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,755
Me? No.

420
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,509
You should. You got a face like a movie star.

421
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,599
Don't you think he should be in movies?

422
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,232
Sure.

423
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,477
I'm pretty happy doing what I'm doing.

424
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,432
Ex-cop who becomes a security specialist,
that's a movie right there.

425
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,237
I love cops.

426
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,111
Sorry...this'll just take a second.

427
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,840
Check.

428
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,031
OK, not only is he suing me,
now he's hitting on my husband.

429
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,073
I've met so many guys like him
with their big black sex cop fantasies.

430
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,918
He hasn't the faintest
idea that I'm a real person.

431
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,757
I'm not sure he cares.

432
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,315
Thank you very much.

433
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,796
I'll pay this up front.

434
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,398
No, let us get that.

435
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,034
You think you can buy me off with a dinner?

436
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,548
- No, I was just...
- It's not personal, you know,

437
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,879
but you really fucked up,
and, well, someone's gonna pay.

438
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,315
Did he just make us an offer?

439
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,318
I think he'll drop the lawsuit if I let him blow me.

440
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,035
I think you're right.

441
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,752
Hey, I hate to play the cop,
but I'm thinking you've been drinking,

442
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,155
and I should drive you home.

443
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,397
Play cop all you want.

444
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,829
It's a Porsche.

445
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,551
Follow us.

446
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,631
You working on a new one of these?

447
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,193
I really like making them.

448
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,390
What's the deal between you and Russell?

449
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,318
Anita said he was talking
about it like it was his idea.

450
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,478
I am so sick of him. He thinks it was his idea
because he was there when we...

451
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,751
When I... You know what? I don't give a shit.

452
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,030
Did he help with those photos you gave me?

453
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,471
He was just the one
who tore up the first photo.

454
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,117
So he needs to lay off, then.
Let him do his own thing with them, Jesus.

455
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,310
Everything's derivative of everything.

456
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,478
I just wish he wasn't
connected to it in any way.

457
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,590
I showed them to my gallery manager.

458
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,752
Really?

459
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,316
He went all crazy over them.

460
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,157
You're kidding.

461
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,316
He said he wanted to meet with you.

462
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,670
Holy fuck!
I can't believe you did this for me.

463
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,035
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

464
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,916
Who is it?

465
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,951
It's me, Rico.

466
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,115
Hey, Julie.

467
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,675
I haven't seen you since high school.

468
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,668
- Where are the kids?
- Asleep.

469
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,591
Well, you can go now.

470
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,392
What?

471
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm here. You can go now.

472
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,076
Vanessa didn't say you were coming by.

473
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,111
They're my kids, too.

474
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,115
Araucanas, you really should get some.
They're beautiful chickens.

475
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,957
We got four right now.

476
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,788
There's Petey, Pepe, Polly and...

477
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,751
Pogo.

478
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,394
Well, we don't have room for chickens.

479
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,997
Lisa loved animals.

480
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,672
Did anyone want coffee?

481
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,757
- Sure, I'll have some.
- Yeah.

482
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,395
Nate, we should probably tell you
why we wanted to see you. It's about Lisa.

483
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,470
Her ashes. How come they weren't,
you know, processed?

484
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,075
- What do you mean?
- They were all...chunky.

485
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,270
They weren't pulverized.

486
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,791
The funeral director in Cœur d'Alene
said it was very old-fashioned.

487
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,230
- I'm not aware of that.
- That's not something you oversee?

488
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,955
No, we have a regular
crematorium that we use

489
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,393
and I don't know, I mean, sometimes...
I guess they just rushed the last step.

490
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,113
Then I want their number
so I can look into this.

491
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,991
Barb, please, I'll take care of it.

492
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,031
I'd really like to see it through.

493
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,154
It was suggested that they may not
even be Lisa's ashes.

494
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,676
OK, look, I need to tell you guys
something. I...

495
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,351
I gave Lisa what she wanted.

496
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,391
What do you mean?

497
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,795
I mean, you know...

498
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,914
She didn't want to be cremated,
so I...buried her in the desert.

499
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,995
What?

500
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,033
I should have told you, but I thought
it would be less complicated this way.

501
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,073
So...those aren't even Lisa's ashes?

502
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,793
- No.
- Whose are they?

503
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,798
Somebody's ashes that were
never claimed from the '70s.

504
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,831
Sometimes people don't pick them up.

505
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:52,399
So, in Lisa's vault, with her name on it,
where my parents go to visit her and pray,

506
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,829
are some complete stranger's ashes?

507
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,350
- Look, I wanted to honour her...
- And where is Lisa?

508
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,358
The desert, what desert?

509
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,756
- The Mojave.
- You dumped her by the side of the road?

510
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,870
No, of course not. I buried her.

511
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,593
It's really beautiful where I buried her.
There's a tree...

512
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,234
Was it off the 62 towards Joshua Tree?

513
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,319
- No, I drove out toward Palm Springs...
- Is there a marker?

514
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,113
- How do I go see her?
- Any Joshua trees around you?

515
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,913
- They're short...
- I know what a Joshua tree is.

516
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,511
No, there's no marker, per se.
Lisa didn't want to have a... I'm sorry.

517
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,599
- I was a little out of it.
- It sounds like you were completely out of it.

518
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,112
What you did is probably illegal, Nate,
and it really pisses me off that you lied to us.

519
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,278
I gave her what she wanted, OK?
I thought that's what you wanted too!

520
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,075
I want Lisa to be alive and not have her
daughter be raised by a woman she hated!

521
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,236
- Barb!
- This is fucked up!

522
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,078
You completely erased her
off the face of the earth,

523
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,429
like she never even existed.

524
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,710
This raises a lot of questions, Nate.

525
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,070
- What questions?
- This is crazy! I can't talk about this any more.

526
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,078
Come on, Hoyt, we're leaving.

527
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,755
It raises a lot of questions, Nate.

528
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,231
So, you gonna drop the charges?

529
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,875
Yeah, forget it.
I'll call the lawyer in the morning.

530
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,276
But get your boyfriend some Prozac
or a muzzle or something.

531
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,438
He went through an awful experience
and is having problems dealing with it.

532
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,552
Yeah? How about you?

533
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,993
Me? I'm trying to be there
for him, you know? Be strong.

534
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,829
Doesn't that get a little old?

535
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,871
Sometimes it's kind of...

536
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,351
Tell me.

537
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,831
I understand, he went
through something traumatic.

538
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,158
I'm completely empathetic, but sometimes
I do get tired of hearing about it.

539
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,599
You're not his mother.

540
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,111
I wish he'd figure out a way to deal
with it rather than have these episodes.

541
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,398
Well, at least I finally got him into therapy.

542
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,273
That's a lot for you to handle.

543
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,551
You must be real tense, a little angry.

544
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,239
Exhausted. It's like living with an invalid.

545
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,877
You know, if you ever
need anyone to unload on...

546
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,916
Thanks, I'll deal with it my own way.

547
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,078
Really, though, any time you need
to let off a little steam...

548
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,918
I'm thinking this is the last time
we see each other.

549
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,713
Yeah, I figured.

550
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,278
You better go find your boyfriend,
before he bites my cat or something.

551
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,711
- How was it?
- I need to get home and shower.

552
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,438
Yeah, Julie called and
she said you sent her home.

553
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,119
I'm tired of my kids being left
with a baby-sitter

554
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,038
every night of the week while you
go out with Kenny Sims.

555
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,799
It's none of your goddamn business what I do.

556
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,150
And I have a right to see
my kids whenever I want.

557
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,955
You got the right? You can stay with them
all night, cos I'm not coming home.

558
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,317
It's what she wanted, all right?

559
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,831
I understand, it was obviously
a highly meaningful thing for you.

560
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,715
I'm disappointed that you didn't feel you could
share something that meaningful with me.

561
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,955
- One, I'm not your patient...
- Nice.

562
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,358
So stop talking to me like I am.
Two, what I did was between Lisa and me.

563
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,237
Look, I'm sorry. I'm just upset.

564
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,750
Yeah, well, it really sucks
that you keep things from me.

565
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,077
Why don't you just tell me, OK?

566
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,272
Tell me when you're ready to let me in
and make me part of your fucking life.

567
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,311
God.

568
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,635
You guys have your lunches? You have yours?

569
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,399
I made peanut butter and jelly.
I know you like it.

570
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,159
I made it really good, with extra peanut butter.

571
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,149
- Are you guys all ready for school?
- Julio, go put your brother in the car.

572
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,555
And buckle him up in his baby seat.

573
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,359
So, did you have a good night?

574
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,109
Very nice. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to treat a lady.

575
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,552
Really?

576
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,276
- So what did you guys do?
- You know...charity work.

577
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,915
I've had enough of this. I'm coming home.

578
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,839
If you step foot in this house
without my permission I'm calling the cops.

579
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,714
The cops won't do anything.
This is still my house. You can't keep me out.

580
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,595
I don't care. I'm still calling them
and I'll let you explain that to them.

581
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,431
- Barb.
- Hoyt and I have been talking.

582
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,392
We're upset. I don't want Maya
growing up in this house.

583
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,715
- What?
- We don't want her in a place

584
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,398
where Lisa isn't honoured.

585
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,431
I know this is really weird for you...

586
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,516
I don't want to hear a word from you!

587
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,439
- You're completely out of line.
- We want Maya to come live with us.

588
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
- No fucking way.
- Maybe part time.

589
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,275
- Are you crazy?
- No, but you are.

590
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,869
The last time I came here you said
a psychic told you Lisa was alive.

591
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,277
You know what? I was still in shock, I think.
Anyway, I was high.

592
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,754
You know what you did with Lisa was wrong.

593
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,952
- I hate to contact our lawyer...
- My God! What are you saying?

594
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,592
Get the hell out of here!

595
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,995
- Get the fuck off my property!
- Calm down.

596
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,430
- We're doing what's best for Maya.
- You don't care about Maya.

597
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,268
You're not going to get
away with this, Nate! You're not!

598
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,998
Don't you worry, baby.
Nobody's going to take you away.

599
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,632
No, of course not.

600
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,593
No way. It's not like enough bad shit
hasn't happened to me already.

601
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,200
- She has no legal right.
- Who the hell am I, Job?

602
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,755
There is no way that she can take Maya.

603
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,519
- I'm not taking her to daycare.
- Leave her with me.

604
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,678
- I have one class this morning, I can skip it.
- I don't want to let her go.

605
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,075
Hey, just come inside for a while.

606
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,999
Everything will be OK.
Just come in for a minute.

607
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,832
<i>Beautiful, Claire</i>.

608
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,036
Complex...

609
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,712
alluring...

610
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,711
and they're fucking creepy.

611
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,518
I love 'em.
How did you come up with the concept?

612
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,554
It's something I've done
ever since I was a kid, tearing things up.

613
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,352
A genius from birth.

614
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:40,273
I have a new show in a couple of weeks.
Let's put 'em in.

615
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,675
Really? All of them?

616
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,269
Fuck, yes, all of them.

617
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,637
That's great! Shit.

618
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,558
It's kind of hard to know what to say.

619
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,798
My family is gone
and no one can ever replace them.

620
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,430
But this is what life is, right?

621
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,879
Pain.

622
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,875
Pain followed by more pain.

623
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,078
Everything you have can be taken away
and it will be, you know that.

624
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,477
Lisa was just the beginning.

625
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,958
You're crazy to even think
of having another baby,

626
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,997
cos I promise you, from now on
only bad things will happen to you.

627
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,591
- Have you seen George?
- No.

628
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,631
I can't seem to find him anywhere.

629
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,310
They were so much a part of me
that I never imagined life without them.

630
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,557
But as deeply sad as I am that they're gone...

631
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,718
- George?
- I'm down here!

632
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,875
Oh, my.

633
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,753
The extension cord is
only temporary, of course.

634
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,429
We're going to need
at least a 5,000-watt generator.

635
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,439
There's been a cancellation
in the Tantric loving workshop.

636
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,438
They can fit us in this weekend if we'd like.

637
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,392
- This weekend?
- Yes, this weekend.

638
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,638
I don't think so. I've got this guy coming over
first thing Saturday morning

639
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,719
who's going to give me some advice
on the air filtration system.

640
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,639
- How long is that going to take?
- Jeez, I'm not sure.

641
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,717
It's not the sort of thing
you want to rush, is it?

642
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,751
I don't know.

643
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,555
I was thinking hammocks against this wall.
How does that sound?

644
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,111
What's with the baby monitor?

645
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,311
I feel safer knowing what's going on in there.

646
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,791
- I don't trust Barb.
- Come on, you don't think she'd...

647
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,991
I didn't think she'd do anything weird,
but she already has.

648
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,635
I think Barb is still trying
to deal with Lisa's death,

649
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,910
and it's driving her a little wacko.

650
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,030
You can relate.

651
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,231
I don't care. She's never seeing Maya again.

652
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,478
I'm sure this will all blow over.
Just let her work through it.

653
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,116
When someone threatens my family,
they don't get to work through anything.

654
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,839
Your family is going to be fine.

655
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,871
I promise.

656
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,996
I'm sorry, but this is definitely not
a good time for us to have a baby, so...

657
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,600
I'm just saying.

658
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,428
I'm sorry, but we've got to focus
on Maya right now, just Maya.

659
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,631
Man, what a day.

660
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,995
Would you believe I spent the last six hours

661
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,600
outside a Japanese businessman's hotel room,

662
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,676
then found out he wasn't even in there.

663
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,270
Did you make anything for dinner? I'm starving.

664
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,719
Shit. I'm going to fucking kill him.
He promised he'd drop the lawsuit.

665
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,399
It's not that.

666
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,353
- Then what is it?
- The police called.

667
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,996
They arrested someone whose fingerprints
match the ones taken off the van.

668
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,395
I have to go in and identify him.

669
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,069
English
