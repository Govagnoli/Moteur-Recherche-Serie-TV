1
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:52,432
Hi, Mom. And Paul and Patricia.

2
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,752
Well, I'm here.

3
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:57,787
It's not exactly the Holiday Inn,
as you can see.

4
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:04,551
Mostly... Mostly we're filling sandbags
and cleaning vehicle filters.

5
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:07,554
In this war, it's important
to keep the mechanisms clean...

6
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,589
...because of all the sand,
which can be as much of a threat...

7
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:16,588
...as any missile that Saddam can send,
Capt. Sommers says.

8
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:20,507
I can't say much, but pretty soon
we're gonna get into the real action...

9
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:23,995
...and we're well-prepared, I'll tell you.

10
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,152
Guys, can you...? Do you mind?
I'm sending this home to my folks.

11
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,238
I'll be done in a minute! Just...
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,038
What else?

13
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,829
We're protecting your ass, folks!

14
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,396
I love you, America. Thank you!

15
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,354
Bailey, come on, I'm just...

16
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,680
- You want to say hello to Victor's folks?
- Hi, Mom!

17
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:48,918
Come on, you guys, damn it!

18
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,718
Sorry, Mom,

19
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:56,839
Some of these guys are kind of crazy,
They're good soldiers,

20
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,762
I'm getting a lot of responsibility here,

21
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:04,800
I think it's been very beneficial, in terms
of personal leadership skills...

22
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,919
...and getting a job,
A lot more than had I stayed at home,

23
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:11,325
Well, I've got a lot to do before
lights out, so until next time...

24
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:15,237
...this is Pvt, 1st Class
Victor Kovitch signing off,

25
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,919
Hey, buddy,
brought you the latest South Park,

26
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,524
Fuck, David.

27
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:47,647
Hey, sleepyhead.

28
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,614
You know, I had the weirdest dream.

29
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,932
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:58,609
This guy comes into my house
at, like, 4 a. m.

31
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:03,653
He climbs into my bed,
but instead of having his way with me...

32
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,371
...he just passes out!

33
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,128
And all night long, he keeps jerking.

34
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,168
That is weird.

35
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,089
- And he talked in his sleep.
- Yeah, what did he say?

36
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,089
It was completely unintelligible,
but angry.

37
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,817
- There was even teeth-grinding.
- Well, that explains the headaches.

38
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:28,015
I was thinking that exposure
to formaldehyde gives me a brain tumor.

39
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,214
Would you like some caffeine
with that tumor?

40
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,141
Okay.

41
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:38,178
- David, I can't.
- Why not?

42
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:42,776
Because last night, I drove Mr. Senopolis'
body to San Jose, then straight back.

43
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:45,136
I barely got four hours' sleep,
and frankly...

44
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,814
...I'm tired of getting the shitty jobs
you don't want.

45
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:51,417
- I'm half-owner of the business,
- You can't legally do intake without me.

46
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,504
You're not a licensed funeral director.

47
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,586
- I'm getting my license next month,
- If you pass the test.

48
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,386
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

49
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:01,308
How am I supposed to study
for that test on four hours' sleep?

50
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,147
Coffee and diet pills worked for me.

51
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,544
I can't pick her up,
I've got a deacon's meeting...

52
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,509
...and Rico's got Vanessa's ultrasound.
- Shit,

53
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,059
Last time I picked somebody up
at a nursing home...

54
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,910
...nobody told the roommate
she was dead. I had to.

55
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,147
Just be thankful we've got the business.

56
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:20,746
Just thankful I'm not you.

57
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,146
What?

58
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:34,109
Oh, it's Mr. Senopolis, sorry.

59
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,627
Fuck, I smell like a dead guy!

60
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:40,306
No, you smell fine. Your life stinks,
you complain all the time...

61
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,746
...and that's really dull.

62
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:47,947
- Didn't realize I was boring you.
- Nate, you need to take a break.

63
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:52,356
Some major stress release that's not me.
It's too much responsibility.

64
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:55,437
I thought you liked being
an undertaker's girlfriend.

65
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,272
Is that what I am to you?
Your girlfriend?

66
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,431
I like to think of you as my mistress.

67
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,032
Well, then, you better start
buying me a lot more shit, mister.

68
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,391
God, I love you.

69
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:15,358
Okay.

70
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,519
I said it. Let's just move on.

71
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:21,158
Let's go to Two Bunch Palms
this weekend.

72
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,592
- What?
- Fuck it, yes.

73
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,194
I'm gonna take the weekend off,
and David can bite me.

74
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,756
- This weekend?
- Yeah, we'll sit in hot mud...

75
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,402
...we'll get massages,
we'll eat like pigs, we'll drink a lot.

76
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:34,279
If we leave Friday night,
we can be naked for two whole days.

77
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:39,003
- I got three clients this Saturday.
- Well, postpone, cancel, lie.

78
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:43,599
Come on, we've never taken
a trip together. We need to do this.

79
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,685
Two whole days?

80
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:49,598
- What if we drive each other crazy?
- Well, we don't.

81
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,443
Hovering.

82
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:13,043
Claire, I've invited a friend of mine
over for dinner tonight.

83
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:17,042
- Okay.
- And I want you to be nice to him.

84
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,610
Is this the guy?

85
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,685
- The guy that...?
- Yes.

86
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,613
Okay.

87
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,450
Thanks for your patience, everybody.
I know we're running late.

88
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,618
By the way, I spoke to Father Clark
this morning. He's holding up well.

89
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,971
He says you folks are the most thorough
search committee...

90
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,819
...he has ever encountered.

91
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,621
David, I understand you're the last one
to meet with him.

92
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,539
- This afternoon.
- Good.

93
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:58,178
We've been interviewing
associate priests for three months.

94
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:00,101
It'll be nice to have an open mind.

95
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:05,617
Clark struck me as a player, man of God,
wants to listen, but there's ego there.

96
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,223
You didn't want Jack.

97
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:10,143
Connie, you say that so easily,
and you know it's not true.

98
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:11,858
I've never seen you so desperate.

99
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,137
Listen, you folks have to represent
the whole congregation.

100
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,302
And believe me, if Clark's not right...

101
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,623
...I'm ready to start from the beginning.
- Let's vote right now.

102
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:24,740
You know him, David. He's been
a visiting rector. You've got his r'esum'e.

103
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,463
All the deacons are here. You can vote
now. I'll be happy to leave the room.

104
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,938
No, I want to meet
with Father Clark myself...

105
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:33,384
...so I can make
the most informed decision.

106
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,587
This how it works? You bring in
the new-generation deacon...

107
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,304
...the new deacon brings in
the radical priest you want?

108
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,903
I can assure you there's
no agenda here, Mr. Kriegenthaler.

109
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,510
Except yours.

110
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:48,421
Don't worry, Dave. I had a parish
in Ohio where punches got thrown.

111
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:52,227
Steelworkers.
St. Bart's doesn't even come close.

112
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:56,552
Actually, David,
your father was against Jack here.

113
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:00,713
And as I said at the time,
your father was wrong.

114
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:03,189
Roll over,

115
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,427
Okay, okay.

116
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:11,389
There you go, there you go.

117
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:23,035
Shit! Fuck, Billy!

118
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:26,356
- Fuck you!
- I've seen pictures on the Internet, but...

119
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,597
The rule is, you call before
you come over, okay?

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,997
Sorry, I was biking down the boardwalk.
I didn't have my cell phone.

121
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,998
Good morning, Nate.

122
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,749
Bill.

123
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:41,030
I got some great shots of these hookers
on Sunset I want to show you.

124
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:44,917
Real human tragedy shit.
I think they're really good.

125
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,680
Well, your mom walked in on us once...

126
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:58,353
...so I guess we're even.

127
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,879
This chick has seen
the fucking worst life has to offer.

128
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:07,080
- Jesus, Billy, these are incredible.
- And what is that thing on her neck?

129
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,040
She's got, like, this big tumor,
and she's still turning tricks.

130
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:14,366
And you just know there is some freak
for whom that is a big turn-on.

131
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:17,129
I love the Bank of America
in the background.

132
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,878
- Well, I have to go to work.
- Bring out your dead!

133
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,603
They're great.

134
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,086
Don't forget,
cancel those appointments on Saturday.

135
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,684
See you later.

136
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:39,801
So, what's Saturday?

137
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:43,845
We're going to California Cactus World
out on Rosemead Boulevard.

138
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:46,966
I want to get something really weird
to plant out back.

139
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:53,294
- Yo, Dave!
- In here!

140
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:58,293
I'm sorry, there was an accident
on the 405. Both cars totaled.

141
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,010
I should've handed out cards.

142
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,336
This is Paul Kovitch.
His brother, Victor, just passed away.

143
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,012
- I'm sorry.
- This is my brother, Nate.

144
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,010
Paul Kovitch,
you went to Bonaventure High.

145
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,178
- Yeah.
- I was there when you pinned that guy...

146
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,894
...and won the wrestling championship.
You were the man!

147
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,696
Me and my friends were jealous
because we knew you were getting laid.

148
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,932
- You wrestle?
- No, played baseball, but we always lost.

149
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:29,731
- So, what are you doing now?
- I run Kovitch Trucking up in Camarillo.

150
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:32,059
Why, so you know how expensive
you can be?

151
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,420
- No...
- Paul and I were just going over...

152
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,501
...the options for his brother's funeral.

153
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,343
Okay, I run a business too.
Let's just cut right to it.

154
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:41,775
- Of course.
- I buried both my parents...

155
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:44,818
...and, no offense,
but I hate you guys. I hate what you do.

156
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,779
The whole thing of "let's gather
and look at this plastic...

157
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:50,705
...dead version of our loved one. "
It's really twisted.

158
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:54,217
I want Victor cremated.
No coffin.

159
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:57,704
Put him in one of those cardboard boxes
you charge 100 bucks for.

160
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:01,380
I'll take him up to where
our mother's buried up in Tehachapi...

161
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,625
...and let his ashes blow away.

162
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,504
I see Victor's a veteran. If you like, we
can research benefits he might be due.

163
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,944
No, Vic hated the Army. Me and him
been fighting the Army for seven years.

164
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:19,541
His unit cleaned up a place
called Bunker 73 in the Iraqi desert.

165
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,301
Chemicals all over,
Saddam's stuff we blew up.

166
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,310
As soon as he came back, he got sick.

167
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,904
Lung cancer at the age of 29,
never smoked a day in his life.

168
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:32,504
Still, no one will say the words
"Gulf War Syndrome. "

169
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:36,031
He just wasted away
in and out of that hospital.

170
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:43,908
So fuck the Army.
Let them keep their fucking money.

171
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,950
I gotta fly up to Idaho Falls
to tell my stepfather.

172
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:50,468
He's got Alzheimer's.
I don't know if he'll hear me or not.

173
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:53,351
You're absolutely sure
you wouldn't like the opportunity...

174
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,989
...to say goodbye to Victor before...?
- I already said goodbye.

175
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:58,427
Just do it.

176
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,598
And as for a receptacle
for his cremains...?

177
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,712
A paper sack ought to do just fine.

178
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:09,841
Nine hundred bucks.

179
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:13,359
Well, he obviously doesn't
know about the Poseidon Society...

180
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,194
...or that's 900 we'd be out of.

181
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,957
That guy was the shit
when I was in high school.

182
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,960
You know,
I never knew he had a brother.

183
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:23,679
It's time you introduced yourself.
He's at the VA Hospital.

184
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,039
First, I just gotta talk to you
about something.

185
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,800
It's out of the question. I cannot spare
you. We have three bodies right now.

186
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,156
Mr. Jacobsen's going
into the ground tomorrow...

187
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,556
...and Vic Kovitch
will be toast by the weekend.

188
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:39,396
What if we get another body? Or two?
We cannot afford to turn down business.

189
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:42,041
- No, I'm sorry.
- I don't need your permission.

190
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,921
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had two days off?

191
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:48,326
See, here's the difference.
You're willing to live like that, I'm not.

192
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,646
I've invited my friend Hiram Gunderson
over to dinner tonight.

193
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,363
You're welcome to join us.

194
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,084
Wouldn't a restaurant be better?
This is our home.

195
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,648
This is my home.

196
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:02,730
Oh, the camping guy. Okay.
Can I bring Brenda?

197
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,888
Hiram will be cooking.

198
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:10,411
He spent 17 years
as a top chef in Chicago.

199
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,573
The critic of the Sun-Times called him
the "father of the new rustic cuisine. "

200
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:18,130
And then, he gave it all up
to become a hairdresser.

201
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:21,168
And he has never been happier!

202
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:32,175
You're multiplying differing variables,
so you have to simplify.

203
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,495
Okay, and then finally,
oops, look at that.

204
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:39,930
Same variable, okay?
Four and four gives us what?

205
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:44,496
Eight! And finally, these two binomials...

206
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,571
...right here, are exactly the same...

207
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,771
...so we what?

208
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,779
Combine!

209
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:56,691
Two X to the third,
Y to the fourth.

210
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,420
Okay?

211
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,136
Any questions?

212
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,175
Claire Fisher.

213
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,379
What?

214
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:15,940
Can you explain this formula
to the class?

215
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,019
Not really.

216
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:20,615
Maybe if you paid attention
instead of reading.

217
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:24,661
Maybe if you talked about something
that was gonna be useful to me, I would.

218
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,301
Oh, algebra is useless?

219
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,863
I know a lot of physicists
who'd beg to differ.

220
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:32,463
Well, I don't want to be a physicist.

221
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,581
Algebra forces your mind
to solve problems logically.

222
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:40,022
- It's one of the only perfect sciences...
- You think the world runs on logic?

223
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,144
- Come on, open your eyes.
- I'll see you after class, Miss Fisher.

224
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,623
What are you doing?

225
00:15:57,953 --> 00:16:02,152
All right, now let's try another one,
and I'm gonna make this a little tougher.

226
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:09,268
Okay, X to the A power
times Y to the B power.

227
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:10,704
Okay, now we've got two...

228
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,995
Of course we have catalogs
for wedding package...

229
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:24,032
...but you have to come in and look.
I can't show you over the phone.

230
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:28,153
Website? What website?
We don't have website.

231
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:33,751
Mister, you have to come into my shop
and look at my work.

232
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,072
Website.

233
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,829
- The day just gets brighter.
- Hush.

234
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,239
So who's dead now,
and what do you need?

235
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:47,276
Nobody's dead.
I came to return these vases.

236
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,117
You should recycle them,
save a little money.

237
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,997
So thoughtful. I am touched.

238
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,240
Don't be silly. It's wasteful, that's all.

239
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,122
Here.

240
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:02,318
- You still have that sign in the window.
- Yes, you know somebody good?

241
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:06,155
- I do. Me.
- You?

242
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,726
I am interested. Let's talk.
Robbie, I going to lunch.

243
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,443
I'm not going to lunch with you, Nikolai.
I'm seeing someone.

244
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:16,077
- So what? This is business.
- I hope so.

245
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:20,919
- Because otherwise, I withdraw my offer.
- Tell me, why I should hire you?

246
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:25,009
I've been working with people for
30 years, and I treat them with respect.

247
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,438
I respect people too.

248
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,205
You're pompous and arrogant
and you're full of yourself.

249
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,608
- You act like the customer needs you.
- Of course the customer needs me.

250
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,884
- I have what he wants.
- You'll never build a business that way.

251
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,242
I'm better with people
and I know about flowers.

252
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,171
If you don't think so,
you can fire me.

253
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,365
Fire you? How I can fire you?
You don't even work yet.

254
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:51,733
My parish in New Mexico,
I think they were afraid of me.

255
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:56,134
- They recommend you highly.
- They always do after I'm gone.

256
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:01,414
I won't lie to you, David,
I'll push for some change at St. Bart's.

257
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:04,893
This is one of those congregations
that thinks sitting through church...

258
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:09,649
...absolves them of moral responsibility
and they can ignore the plight of others.

259
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:13,454
Don't get me wrong,
they're good people.

260
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:15,737
They're just lazy.

261
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:19,774
I don't think that's entirely fair, Clark.
We have a homeless outreach...

262
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,256
You know you're the swing vote.

263
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:27,011
I've been a deacon three weeks. I'm still
getting used to how political this is.

264
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,782
Religion is politics, David.

265
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,896
Jesus was a revolutionary.

266
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,902
He threatened those in power,
and they had him assassinated.

267
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,095
They'd do the same thing
to him today.

268
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,934
I'm not sure how much luck you'll
have getting St. Bart's to stage a coup.

269
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:47,382
The last thing that God
wants from us is complacency.

270
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,419
- You should be in the Peace Corps.
- Already done it.

271
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:53,220
Three years in Nicaragua,
fresh out of divinity school.

272
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:55,224
That's where I lost my wife.

273
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,104
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:06,100
The hardest part about my work
is the fact...

275
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,939
...that most people don't want
a real relationship with God.

276
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,664
Sure, they'll pray
to a man nailed to a cross...

277
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,147
...but they'll ignore the gay kid
who gets strung up...

278
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,706
...or the black man
who gets dragged behind a car...

279
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,028
...or someone's mother living in a box.

280
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:24,508
Were you this forthcoming
with the other deacons?

281
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:26,427
Hardly.

282
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,662
What did you and Walter Kriegenthaler
talk about?

283
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:32,705
Golf.

284
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:37,786
So why did you decide
to be so honest with me?

285
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:44,905
Because I can tell that right and wrong
actually matter to you.

286
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,232
Fuck.

287
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,836
This is medieval. We gotta get it fixed
before somebody loses a finger.

288
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,554
You never cared until it was your finger.

289
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,479
- Rico, a little help?
- Why should I?

290
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:12,151
You know, it's because of you I'm gonna
work double shifts this weekend.

291
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:14,193
That's just David being dramatic.

292
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:17,479
We'd have to get at least two new
bodies for that to be necessary.

293
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,073
They come in bigger numbers than that.

294
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,880
Just forget it. I know the score.

295
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:27,679
It's never gonna be
Fisher & Sons & Diaz. I know that.

296
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,674
- Let's see what we got.
- This one's a cremation.

297
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:35,276
- Nothing for you.
- Oh, fuck, what is that?

298
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:38,603
Shouldn't just burn people
like they're garbage.

299
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,519
What the...?

300
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,244
Look, it came with fries.

301
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,438
Look at this.

302
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,959
Doesn't even look like the same guy,
does it?

303
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,889
This says he applied to be buried
at the National Cemetery.

304
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:07,521
He signed requests
for a flag fold, military escort.

305
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,245
Oh, man.

306
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,809
Then you can't burn him.

307
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:16,048
I can make him look like that again.

308
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,331
Well, almost.

309
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,334
You could ace algebra, Claire,
and we both know it.

310
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:23,730
"Power rests on the kind
of knowledge one holds. "

311
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,891
What's the use of knowing
something useless?

312
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:30,129
- Don't quote Castaneda at me.
- Why not? You quote Bob Dylan at me.

313
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:33,693
- You need algebra for college.
- You're assuming I'm going to college.

314
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:37,208
You're taking the PSAT tomorrow.
That means you're thinking about it.

315
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:40,967
Is that the only option? Go to college,
get a job, be a good consumer...

316
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:43,898
...until you drop dead of exhaustion.
I don't want that!

317
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,976
So, what do you want?

318
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,931
I just want something to matter.

319
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:57,650
Maybe I should wander around the desert
and eat peyote and see God.

320
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:00,575
Yeah, be a homeless drug addict.

321
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:03,293
You'd get bored with that pretty fast.

322
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:08,779
Hey, have you heard
of the Sierra Crossroads program?

323
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,054
What's that, like,
bungee jumping for Jesus?

324
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:16,180
No, no, it's not affiliated with any
religion. It's actually a great program.

325
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,620
I spent a couple of years there
as an instructor.

326
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,896
- I think you might really like it.
- Why?

327
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,338
Because it would get you out of yourself,
get you out of your head.

328
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:27,903
Now, I'll warn you,
it's hard but exhilarating.

329
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:30,417
It might give you the challenge
you're looking for.

330
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,505
There's an expedition over spring break.

331
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,064
I could pull some strings,
see if I could get you in.

332
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,784
- Why do you care what happens to me?
- Because I like you.

333
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:43,019
And I want to see good things
happen for you, and I know they can.

334
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:48,780
We had to dig his service records
out of St. Louis.

335
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:52,583
Then there's the question of whether
his cancer was service related.

336
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,306
That means finding a doctor
who thinks it was.

337
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:58,710
It took me four months
to get all the approvals...

338
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:03,345
...but it means a burial allowance
of up to 1500 from the VA.

339
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:06,507
Might as well take that stuff too.
I packed it up for him.

340
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:09,144
That's too bad nobody
told his brother what he wanted.

341
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,583
I did.

342
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:14,755
Oh, yeah. I gave Paul the forms.
I found them later in the trash.

343
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:17,872
It's mostly somebody else's writing
on the forms.

344
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:20,113
It doesn't match Victor's signature at all.

345
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,511
I filled them out for him.

346
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:26,951
He tried to do it himself,
but those boxes are pretty small...

347
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:30,310
...and he shook a lot.

348
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,318
Gulf War Victory Parade?

349
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,355
Victor said marching in it
was the proudest moment of his life.

350
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:46,633
Why would he keep it and watch it
over and over if he hated the Army?

351
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,358
- Did Paul visit him much?
- Yeah, three or four times a week.

352
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,042
He was really good about it.

353
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,996
- So how come he...?
- He couldn't.

354
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:57,122
Paul would say,
"The fucking Army stole your life, Vic. "

355
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,997
And Vic would keep his mouth shut.

356
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,157
I can tell you this.

357
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:06,484
Victor wanted to believe that what
he did in the Gulf meant something...

358
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:10,441
...that his life was not a waste.

359
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:14,920
I only counsel. I'm not supposed
to interfere with what the family wants.

360
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:19,087
So you taped his medals to him, fished
his files out and passed them to me.

361
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,166
Well, you can always blow it off.

362
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,679
I mean, you didn't
even know the guy, right?

363
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,802
What are you doing?

364
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:38,966
There was a form that said
he's getting a military funeral.

365
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:42,085
- Who authorized this? Nate?
- Yeah.

366
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,965
How many times have I told you...

367
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,483
...when Nate gives you instructions,
check with me?

368
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:47,843
Turn him off.

369
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,043
I'll drive him
to the crematorium right now.

370
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:54,685
Do I have to do it myself?

371
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:59,646
Fucking Nate. Paul Kovitch
is who our contract is with...

372
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:04,209
...and if he finds out about this,
he will either sue us or break our legs.

373
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:11,248
- Tomatoes right there.
- Okay.

374
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,254
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Mrs. Fisher.

375
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,015
Hello, dear.

376
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:27,290
- Hello, I'm Brenda.
- Hiram Gunderson.

377
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:30,017
I understand you like to camp.

378
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:33,297
Why, yes, I do.

379
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:37,814
I wish I could tell you where Nate is,
but I have no idea.

380
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:40,902
It's okay. I can exist without him.

381
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:48,181
- Toasted sesame seeds in the salad?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

382
00:25:57,827 --> 00:26:01,264
There's my little girl.
Claire, honey, this is Hiram Gunderson.

383
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,221
Pleasure to meet you, Claire.

384
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:07,904
Hi.

385
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,744
This is delicious, Mrs. Fisher.

386
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,145
Hiram is a chef.

387
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:29,742
I can't get enough of his cock!

388
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:38,785
Mom, I need $ 1200 so I can go
to Sierra Crossroads over spring break.

389
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:42,671
And I need you to sign this form,
like, in case I die or something.

390
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,594
Is this a school trip?

391
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:47,755
No, you go to the mountains
and confront fear...

392
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:51,347
...and get in touch
with your most basic self.

393
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:55,708
It looks good on your college application.

394
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:58,877
Sorry I'm late. There was an
accident on the Long Beach Freeway.

395
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,229
You always seem to hit
the bad traffic.

396
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,000
- Hi, I'm Nate.
- Hiram, I've heard a lot about you.

397
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,316
Well, don't believe a word of it.

398
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,556
Hey, I'm sorry.

399
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,195
Don't be. I'm having fun.

400
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:15,557
- So, what did I miss?
- I want to go to Sierra Crossroads.

401
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:17,832
We'll talk about it later, Claire.

402
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:20,193
Mom, you should let her go.
Crossroads is great.

403
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:21,631
- You went?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:24,995
We went kayaking down the Colorado
River the summer I was, what, 17?

405
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:28,162
- I don't think you were even born yet.
- I don't remember this.

406
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,875
That's because I lied to you and Dad.

407
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:38,003
Dad would never let me go, so I told you
I was going to Sacramento...

408
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:41,319
...to witness state government in action.

409
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:48,204
Oh, by the way, everyone, I got a job.

410
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,439
- Cool.
- I'll be working at Nikolai's flower shop.

411
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:54,162
I start tomorrow.

412
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,440
It's just part-time.

413
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,367
- You didn't tell me about that.
- Didn't I?

414
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:04,162
Need some help?

415
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:08,003
Incidentally, I dropped Victor Kovitch off
at the Oak Valley Crematory.

416
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:09,964
I need you to pick him up tomorrow.

417
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:13,802
Oh, fuck, David, he wanted
a military funeral. He filled out the forms.

418
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:16,004
Is he paying our bill?

419
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:19,604
You were with his brother. It was clear
he did not want the body embalmed.

420
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:22,009
He could sue us,
and we wouldn't have a case.

421
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:23,853
Okay, you know what?

422
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:27,491
When you talk to me like this,
it makes me want to not listen to you.

423
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:31,245
You and I could lose everything.
Mom could lose her home.

424
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:36,527
Vic is eligible for a bigger allowance
from the VA than we thought.

425
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:37,692
Really?

426
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:41,174
- I'm leaving.
- I'll walk you down.

427
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,419
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

428
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:49,576
Why don't you come over,
spend the night?

429
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,409
I've gotta be in Pasadena tomorrow.
It would add an extra hour to my trip.

430
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,340
Okay.

431
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,337
Give me five minutes. I'll follow you.

432
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:10,376
- Tonight wasn't so bad, was it?
- I suppose not.

433
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:13,574
I don't know why I was so nervous.

434
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:16,937
I mean, for heaven's sake,
I gave birth to those people.

435
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:28,059
You know what occurred to me tonight
that's really strange?

436
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,979
I wish you'd known my husband.

437
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:36,105
I think the two of you
would've liked each other.

438
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,308
Oh, Ruth.

439
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,503
Who would get me a gift basket?

440
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:50,386
It's probably some Hollywood bigwig
that secretly wants to sleep with you.

441
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:56,790
It's from my brother,
and it is addressed to both of us.

442
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:03,550
"Sorry about this morning.
Have fun at Cactus World. "

443
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,303
Who knows.

444
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:08,552
This is nice. We can take it
with us this weekend.

445
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:12,509
I cannot wait to get out of here. I'm in
dire need of some serious relaxation.

446
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:17,592
- Oh, fabulous.
- Smoked oysters.

447
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:19,515
Really, is there any caviar?

448
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:23,596
No, but there are condoms.

449
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:28,912
- And, okay, edible underpants.
- That's a little scary.

450
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,953
- I'd say this whole thing's a little scary.
- No, it just means he likes you.

451
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,438
Believe me, there are guys Billy
didn't like. It's much better this way.

452
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,840
I've been meaning to ask you.

453
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:44,080
What's up with those matching tattoos
you and he have?

454
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:48,679
We were in Vegas,
we were very drunk, and...

455
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:50,551
Oh, dear.

456
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,641
These things always struck me
as kind of ridiculous.

457
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:55,721
Would you just stop that?

458
00:30:57,244 --> 00:31:00,281
What does he think we're gonna do
with this? This is, like, hostile.

459
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,438
Look, Billy's bipolar. He's medicated.

460
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:09,083
His sense of what's appropriate
can be a little off at times.

461
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:13,563
Look, you have no idea
what he's been through.

462
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:16,245
Don't judge him, please.

463
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:19,041
All right.

464
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,646
All right.

465
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,441
Thank you.

466
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:54,526
You're never gonna get out of this one,

467
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:57,295
I was nowhere near the latrine, sir,
I promise,

468
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:01,085
- Give it up, private, Your ass is busted,
- Yeah, you're in big trouble,

469
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,287
But my father's
on the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

470
00:32:03,536 --> 00:32:07,132
Well, maybe we can't court-martial you,
but there is something else we can do,

471
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,892
Yeah, come on, private, yeah,

472
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:17,731
You love that, don't you?

473
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,257
- Hello?
- David, Walter Kriegenthaler.

474
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,498
- Did you meet with Father Clark?
- Yes, today.

475
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,660
We'd like to meet at 9:30 tomorrow
and vote,

476
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:33,057
- Can you make it?
- Absolutely.

477
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,976
Let me ask you a question, David.

478
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:40,580
Do you think Clark is gay?

479
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:47,980
I don't think so. He mentioned something
about having a deceased wife.

480
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:53,340
I mean, I don't care if he is, I just don't
want him to push that agenda,

481
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:56,584
You know, marriage, that whole thing,

482
00:32:56,827 --> 00:33:00,820
I have a cousin in D.C.
Whose church split because of that.

483
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:03,383
Literally half the congregation left.

484
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:09,022
I don't want that to happen to St, Bart's,
I've been going there for 40 years,

485
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:14,306
Well, it's late, I'll see you
tomorrow morning, Good night,

486
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:36,148
Okay, I got Victor, but I called
the National Cemetery from the car...

487
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:38,231
...and you know what?
They can bury an urn.

488
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,665
They call it "inurnment. "
We can do it today at 3.

489
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,594
Why are you so determined
to sabotage our business?

490
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:46,151
I don't think Paul knew
how his brother really felt.

491
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:50,270
- Nate, why do you even care?
- Because it's what Victor wanted.

492
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:52,513
And he deserves it.
He got a raw fucking deal.

493
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:56,677
Victor Kovitch did not hate the Army.
Watch these tapes he made in the Gulf.

494
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,429
Yes, sir, fuck me, sergeant,

495
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:05,632
- Fuck, yeah, Give it to me,
- Come on, private,

496
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,713
Oh, come on!
Come on, that was funny!

497
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,752
I have someplace I have to be.

498
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:14,078
Dave, Dave, it's okay!
I watch porn too!

499
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:44,804
So you guys taking the PSAT
this afternoon too?

500
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,321
Yeah.

501
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:57,087
So, what happens to you guys?

502
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,519
I go to UC Irvine
and Northwestern Law...

503
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,120
...meet a totally great guy,
he's a triathlete...

504
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,090
...we get married
and I practice law for eight years...

505
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:11,245
...and we get really rich,
and then I have two great kids.

506
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:15,168
- So you're, like, unbelievably happy?
- Kind of.

507
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:19,367
I get a master's in French
and then live in Paris for 6 months...

508
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:23,487
...and hate it, so I come back,
become a TV development executive...

509
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:25,526
...and I work out all the time.

510
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:29,570
I'm fairly miserable and have
a slight substance-abuse problem.

511
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:32,967
- But you look great.
- Thanks.

512
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:36,249
I start an interior-lighting design firm
with my college roommate...

513
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:38,129
...and it totally takes off...

514
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,091
...and then I die of ovarian cancer
before I'm 30.

515
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:44,489
- Oh, that sucks.
- Tell me about it.

516
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,893
Well, good luck.

517
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:03,859
What a freak.

518
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:12,182
- Father Jack?
- David. Come in, sit.

519
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:17,219
And call me "Jack. " We're beyond that.

520
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:21,177
- Meeting over already?
- Yes.

521
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:26,816
- Damn.
- We all admire Clark's energy...

522
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:30,303
...but there is some concern
that he may end up being divisive.

523
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:33,665
As you said yourself, if we have
to start over from the beginning...

524
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:38,067
And find some conservative lap dog,
who won't challenge anybody?

525
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:41,667
Yeah, that's what we need here.

526
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,389
Scotch?

527
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,747
No, thank you.

528
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,868
- Clark thought he came on too strong.
- I liked him, Jack.

529
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,626
The world would be better
if there were more like him.

530
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:57,744
I just don't think that he's a good fit
for St. Bart's.

531
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:00,547
Do you really think that Father Clark
would be happy here?

532
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,910
Why should he be happy?
How happy are you?

533
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,871
You're right, I'm not happy.

534
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:12,509
My life is very complicated
and confusing.

535
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:16,425
I've experienced a lot of loss
recently, my father and my...

536
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,670
And the thing that helps me deal with it
is having a place...

537
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:24,596
...that hasn't changed
like everything else in my life.

538
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:27,551
There's a reason they call it
a sanctuary.

539
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,597
I think the majority of our congregation
feels the same way...

540
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,269
...and my responsibility
is to them, not you.

541
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,474
Well, I've got a business to run.

542
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:03,397
Yo.

543
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,523
Speaking.

544
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:11,719
Yes.

545
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,839
What can I do for you, Mr. Gilardi?

546
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:20,521
- Here, this is good choice here.
- I don't like yellow.

547
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:23,121
The bridesmaids' dresses are lilac.

548
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,446
If the flowers are yellow,
it's gonna look like an Easter egg hunt.

549
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:30,279
How about white tulips? Very simple.

550
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,242
Just bunched together with a ribbon.

551
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,443
I was kind of thinking I would be
the only one with white flowers.

552
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:39,526
Or you could be the only one holding
a gorgeous bouquet of color...

553
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,882
...against your white dress.
- People do that?

554
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:44,812
It's your day.
You can do whatever you want.

555
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:47,483
Don't you think that would be pretty?

556
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:52,082
- I love the tulips thing.
- Tulips are one of my favorite flowers.

557
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:56,971
So graceful and classic,
like little ballerinas.

558
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:04,694
Only reason I even met Victor was I
jumped off a humvee and broke my feet.

559
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:09,929
Here I am in the hospital with this guy
who's dying, listening to me complain.

560
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,851
Playing cards, giving me his dessert.

561
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:16,974
I wish he didn't die. It sucks.

562
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:19,812
Thank you.

563
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,297
Have you heard from Paul yet?

564
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,174
Not since I told him his brother
was ready to be picked up.

565
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:31,169
Well, without his consent in writing,
I cannot allow this funeral to take place.

566
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:32,576
Fine.

567
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:34,500
At least we'll know
we made an effort.

568
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,380
When we were in the Gulf...

569
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,734
...Victor used to make these videotapes
to send home to his family.

570
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:42,339
We were always giving him a hard time...

571
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:46,139
...messing him up.
He was a real good sport.

572
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:49,061
The perpetual optimist.

573
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:52,622
- So my brother ready?
- Yes, he's right in here.

574
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:56,423
- What is this?
- Victor's friends wanted to say goodbye.

575
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,379
The hospital referred them.
It's no problem for us.

576
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:00,384
And no charge to you.

577
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:04,179
- Excuse me, are you his brother?
- Yes, I'm Paul.

578
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:08,056
This man here, I don't know
if you people know it...

579
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:10,385
...was like a lion for Victor.

580
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:14,026
He made federal waves
over Victor's disability case.

581
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,861
I found a couple pictures of us
playing baseball.

582
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:26,348
Vic was a lousy batter
but a pretty good infielder.

583
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:31,191
He's grinning like such a fool in these.

584
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,183
I thought you might like them.

585
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:41,388
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:45,190
- You sick?
- No.

587
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,910
Never got sick. I don't know why.

588
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:50,186
A lot of guys I knew over there did.

589
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:53,866
Thanks.

590
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,190
Thank you for letting Victor
have his military burial.

591
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:59,707
Even though I know
you were against it.

592
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,628
I'm sure this means a lot to him.

593
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:07,314
What the fuck is this military burial shit?

594
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,910
It's an option that can
easily be canceled at no charge to you.

595
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,919
Vic didn't want a military funeral.
You think I'm lying?

596
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:17,074
I think he was afraid to tell you
what he wanted.

597
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,318
He filled out those forms,
he kept the videos.

598
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:22,799
They filled out those forms.
This is all fucking Army PR.

599
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:26,075
- I threw those forms in the trash.
- I'll call the service off.

600
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,559
He kept Saudi Arabian candy
for 10 years.

601
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:32,473
- You just want to jack up your price.
- No, it's paid for.

602
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:35,563
I want your brother to have
the funeral he wanted for himself...

603
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:38,036
...because that's his right.

604
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,398
Victor wanted to believe he died for
something. You wanna take that away?

605
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:47,799
Jesus.

606
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,322
He's the only family I had left.

607
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:57,319
And he can't even tell me
what he wants when he's dead?

608
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,968
He thought
I would've talked him out of this.

609
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:07,447
And he's right, I would've.

610
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:12,642
Why don't you sit with his friends.

611
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:24,727
Glad to have you here, man.

612
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:00,293
- Where is Ruth?
- She's in the back.

613
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,698
Crying.

614
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:15,500
What is wrong?

615
00:43:16,104 --> 00:43:18,141
It's the smell of the flowers.

616
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:21,377
- You'll get used to it.
- I am used to it!

617
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:27,061
Today, I helped people choose flowers
for weddings...

618
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:30,737
...for anniversaries, for new babies.

619
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:35,457
I can't remember being surrounded
by so much happiness.

620
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:39,384
I'm used to the smell of flowers meaning
something completely different.

621
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:43,221
I'm used to people crying
and being exhausted.

622
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:45,421
People being shattered!

623
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,464
Do not worry. We get funerals too.

624
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:54,825
I'm so happy. I can't wait
to come back tomorrow.

625
00:43:59,352 --> 00:44:03,426
You're not going to be like this
every day, though, right?

626
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:49,712
This flag is presented on behalf
of a grateful nation as a token...

627
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:52,675
...of our appreciation for honorable
and faithful services...

628
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:55,113
...rendered by your loved one.

629
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:12,756
Give it to one of his friends.

630
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:39,008
I love you, David.

631
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:41,049
I always will.

632
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:48,124
I could get hit by a bus on the way
to the desert tonight.

633
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,053
Just wanted to make sure
you knew that.

634
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:55,771
I love you too.

635
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:03,651
- You did the right thing today.
- I know. Feels kind of good, doesn't it?

636
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,135
- Hello.
- She can't go.

637
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,339
Why not?

638
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,933
She has to help me pick prints.

639
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:32,251
- Does she have to do it tonight?
- Yes, she does.

640
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:35,693
Billy's got a show coming up
at a gallery in Westwood.

641
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:41,977
Sometimes she gives me her eyes
because sometimes I go blind.

642
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,017
Forty-six hours I've been looking
at these pictures...

643
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:48,414
...and sometimes I see amazing things...

644
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:52,174
...and sometimes I just see shapes,
and that's when I go blind.

645
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:57,863
Because what if I lost the ability
to tell the difference?

646
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,146
For real.

647
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:02,219
- For good.
- You won't.

648
00:47:02,427 --> 00:47:04,019
You say that and give me your eyes.

649
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:06,788
But what if one day,
I can't give them back to you?

650
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:09,707
Well, that won't happen.
We won't let that happen.

651
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,540
God, this is crap!

652
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,025
This is pretentious, derivative crap!

653
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,668
Well, then that's one less
you have to consider. Right?

654
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:27,345
Right.

655
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:34,304
Billy, I'm gonna talk to Nate
on the porch, okay?

656
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:36,869
All right. Then he's gonna go away.

657
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:39,225
We'll be right outside.

658
00:47:40,314 --> 00:47:41,383
Pick out five you like...

659
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:43,233
...and show me when I come back.

660
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:46,632
- Only five?
- Or 10 or 20.

661
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,505
And I'll look at them,
and I'll tell you what I see.

662
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,354
Okay.

663
00:47:57,117 --> 00:47:59,154
You can fuck her some other time.

664
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,354
Sorry. He's obviously off his meds.

665
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,639
- Intentionally?
- No, it happens occasionally.

666
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,321
It's been a while.

667
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:23,520
- Brenda, come on.
- Sorry, Nate, I can't.

668
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:26,953
I'm all he has when he's like this.

669
00:48:27,163 --> 00:48:30,474
- You are letting him manipulate you.
- You don't know him.

670
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:33,278
- You don't know what he's doing.
- I know he doesn't like me.

671
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:36,602
I have a feeling he doesn't like
any man in your life. Am I right?

672
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:39,679
- Answer me!
- What, you think I fucked my brother?

673
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:44,518
- Jesus, I never said that!
- Nate, he's sick!

674
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:47,520
He's my brother, and he's sick
and he needs me!

675
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:51,004
This is who I am,
this is what you get.

676
00:48:52,328 --> 00:48:54,205
Fuck you.

677
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:03,201
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go with you.

678
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,205
- Can I do anything to help?
- Yeah.

679
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:15,482
You can go to the desert and sit in mud
and relax and forget about everything...

680
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:18,524
...including us.

681
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:23,571
Oh, shit.

682
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:26,648
Just go, okay? Goddamn it.

683
00:49:47,409 --> 00:50:02,064
