1
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:50,376
Let me see what...

2
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,867
Now you know, Mother. I'm a gypsy.

3
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:03,429
- I'm in the road company of 42nd Street.
- And my feet are gigantic.

4
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:08,949
- You hit him with the shoes, didn't you?
- Well, duh, bitch.

5
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:12,952
That's how he got those half-moon marks
on his forehead and hands.

6
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:16,702
What about those cigarette burns on his ass?

7
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:20,109
- Answer me.
- Mommy, you need to go on Prozac.

8
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:23,748
- And fast.
- What else could I do?

9
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:28,309
- Flog him with those braids?
- But it was his fault.

10
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:31,982
If he gave me the medal like I told him to,
I wouldn't have hit him.

11
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:35,423
That still doesn't explain why you fucked him.

12
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:37,862
All right, now.

13
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:41,269
We'll start at the beginning.
You're going to tell me the truth.

14
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:45,431
I know you killed him, so there's
no sense lying. Rhoda, tell me the truth.

15
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:49,261
- The truth? You're too old to be my mommy.
- Socialism is a better system.

16
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,543
You're a man.

17
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:54,744
How can I be a man
when my girdle hurts this much?

18
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,227
Ask Charles Pierce.

19
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:06,306
I found him there
and I told him I'd hit him with my shoe

20
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,311
if he didn't give me the medal.

21
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:12,311
Mommy, please say
you won't let them hurt me.

22
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:14,913
Honey, you just killed 'em all anyway.

23
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:21,784
I don't know what must be done now,
but I promise you nobody will hurt you.

24
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,792
I want to play the way we used to, Mommy.
Will you play with me?

25
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,223
Not unless you pay me first, you little freak.

26
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:34,267
- If I give you a basket of kisses.
- No discounts for family.

27
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:36,304
Please.

28
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:00,910
Lise, you awake?

29
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:30,549
Can you run by Whole Foods and pick up
six Mahi-Mahi filets for tomorrow?

30
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,471
- Six?
- I'm making dinner for your mom's birthday.

31
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:40,186
- I told you not to do that.
- Doesn't mean you don't want me to do it.

32
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,511
Maybe your mother likes people
to go out of their way for her birthday,

33
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:50,742
but, trust me, my mother never wants us
to do anything for hers and we never do.

34
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,148
So far that has worked out great for everyone.

35
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,151
Do you think she'd like Sarah McLachlan?

36
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:58,787
It's a party. We have to have music.

37
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:03,628
Play whatever you want. Just don't run to me
when it blows up in your face.

38
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:05,823
Nothing's gonna blow up in my face.

39
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,990
This is important.
I wanna do something for your mom.

40
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,105
- Now with us living here and all.
- OK.

41
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:17,068
Just keep your expectations low,
that's all I'm saying.

42
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:25,226
Companies were forced to restrict
how they market cigarettes...

43
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:29,425
Lisa called. She wants us
to come over for dinner tomorrow.

44
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:34,547
- I thought it was our turn to invite them.
- She's throwing a birthday party for your mom.

45
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:39,990
Who does she think she is? My mother
does not like anything for her birthday.

46
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,228
Your mom deserves a party.

47
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,423
You want to go?

48
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:47,909
What else are we gonna do?
Stay home and watch porn?

49
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:52,071
Which reminds me, you gotta return
The Gaytrix to Video West.

50
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:09,911
Somebody wanna tell me why I should give
a rat's ass what's in Salma Hayek's purse?

51
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,222
- You're something else, Fisher.
- I'm sorry?

52
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:19,743
It's your fucking birthday
and you spend it at the dentist's?

53
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,626
I can't just ignore my oral hygiene.

54
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,187
And there's going to be
a party tomorrow night.

55
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:29,863
You bet there's gonna be a party,
even if I have to spike the punch with LSD.

56
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,505
Bettina, don't, please.

57
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:34,784
Speaking of LSD,
your sister called me last night.

58
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,903
How is she? She won't return my calls.

59
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:41,390
She's become best friends with someone
very famous, but she won't tell me who.

60
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,506
All she'll say is it's somebody
who fucked Michael Douglas.

61
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:55,432
OK. This is not what I had in mind
when I said I'd spend the day with you.

62
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:03,143
Excuse me. My friend had an appointment
to get her teeth cleaned at 11 o'clock.

63
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:07,425
- It's almost noon.
- Our technician is running a little late today.

64
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:11,022
- How much longer do you think?
- I can't really say.

65
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:15,628
- You can't, huh?
- No.

66
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,790
You're just gonna have to wait your turn
like everyone else.

67
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:23,106
- What's your name?
- Patty.

68
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:27,863
Hi, Patty. I'm Bettina.
I have another question for you, Patty.

69
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,632
- Yes?
- I can understand our having to wait.

70
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:34,712
What I can't understand is your need
to be such a condescending asshole...

71
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:37,551
Excuse me. I don't have to sit here
and listen to this.

72
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:43,145
Do you really think you're so special or are you
just pissed off because your life sucks?

73
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:47,232
I hate to break it to you, honey,
but it's not our fault!

74
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,548
I'll call to reschedule.

75
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,431
Dennis recommended you.

76
00:07:56,473 --> 00:08:00,102
- From chorus?
- Yes. I'm a member, too.

77
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:04,465
I haven't been very active the past year,
since Bob got sick.

78
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:10,702
It wasn't Aids. Even though we both
fucked like bunnies during the '70s.

79
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:17,782
We buried half our friends. We thought
we'd been spared and we'd grow old together.

80
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,223
- Such hubris.
- I'm so sorry.

81
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:25,630
It was cardiomyopathy. Enlarged heart.

82
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,791
His heart was too big.
We used to joke about it.

83
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,746
It was caused by
a severely leaking heart valve.

84
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:38,264
We used to joke about that, too.
Bleeding heart.

85
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:43,062
Have any of his family been contacted?

86
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:46,708
I called his sister in Phoenix,
but she's not coming.

87
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:52,388
His family was never very accepting of things.

88
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:59,105
Bob and I were together for 22 years,
so I'm his family.

89
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:05,667
We have durable power of attorney.
I'll have our lawyer fax it to you.

90
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,102
I'm sorry we have to ask you for that.

91
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,748
I'm a scenic designer
for the Los Angeles Lyric Opera.

92
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,023
Bob was the lighting designer.

93
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:25,989
I was told that you would be more open
to accommodating certain requests.

94
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,952
You gotta be kidding me. A fucking opera?

95
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:35,463
He just wants to design a set
and rig some special lighting.

96
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,346
- How long is this gonna take?
- Two days.

97
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:41,510
No way. We could have three funerals.

98
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:44,784
- Apparently he's willing to pay for it.
- For a fucking opera?

99
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,506
Yes, Federico.

100
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:55,385
Vanessa's cousin won opera tickets once
and she gave them to us.

101
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,152
It was so completely whacked.

102
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:01,424
There was, like, this magic mirror

103
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:06,183
and this dead swan and this bleeding spear.

104
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:09,145
- Parsifal.
- Yeah!

105
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:13,186
And they had these flower chicks
who were supposed to be hot.

106
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,748
And they were all just major wide-loads.

107
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,308
And these lame-assed knights
who were prancing around

108
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,992
and singing at the top of their lungs.

109
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,183
It was just so fucking...

110
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:28,111
- Gay?
- I was gonna say stupid.

111
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:31,225
You don't wanna do this funeral.
You think it's too gay.

112
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,992
- That's not what I was gonna say.
- We're doing it.

113
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,024
These guys were together for 22 years.

114
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:39,463
We're going to show them
the respect they deserve.

115
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,345
Hey.

116
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:56,071
You gotta be kidding me.
You never had a massage before?

117
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,944
No.

118
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:00,826
Where have you been living? Under a rock?

119
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:05,183
Lighten up, sister.
This is her first time on the table.

120
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,031
What you're doing is just fine, dear.

121
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,463
Nikolai tried to get me to come here.

122
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:15,506
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know. I was afraid.

123
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:19,148
If you're afraid of something,
it probably means you should do it.

124
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,832
I don't usually like being touched by strangers,

125
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:26,230
but this is invigorating.

126
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:30,391
It's mandatory.
I started getting a massage every week

127
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:34,028
after I caught my second husband
cheating on me.

128
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:38,305
I'm not a porcelain butterfly.
You want a tip or not?

129
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,982
- I cheated on my husband.
- No way.

130
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,423
It's true. With my hairdresser.

131
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,907
He was the one who first took me hiking.

132
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,944
Way to go, Fisher.

133
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:02,671
I cheated on number two, but only after
I knew he was cheating on me.

134
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,305
That's fair.

135
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:08,107
I even slept with his gastroenterologist.

136
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,986
For some reason I thought
that would really hurt him.

137
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,422
He just laughed at me.

138
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:16,351
I will always hate him for that.

139
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,668
Asshole.

140
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:23,061
I still feel guilty for cheating on Nathaniel.

141
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:27,186
You gotta let go of that. It's done. Move on.

142
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,224
Careful with that.

143
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:58,191
Put it in there. Just make sure
it doesn't lean against the wall. Thanks.

144
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,622
I thought Puccini was Italian.

145
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:05,189
He is, but Turandot takes place in China.

146
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:11,185
It's big.

147
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,952
Kevin needs something to pour himself into

148
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,827
to take his mind off
such an incomprehensible loss.

149
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:23,869
It was Puccini's last opera.
He died before he got a chance to finish it.

150
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,825
Bob was much more of a formalist than I am.

151
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,228
But I think he would have liked it.

152
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,550
I know he would have liked that.

153
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:42,142
Jesus. You could sit breakfast on that ass.

154
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:47,069
If Bob were here, he'd be all over that boy.

155
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:51,311
I guarantee you,
he'd have him in bed before nightfall.

156
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:57,747
I swear, he could charm the pants
off any man alive, and he usually did.

157
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:01,263
I was never as lucky as he was
in that department,

158
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:03,702
but at least he liked to share.

159
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:11,904
Eric, you'll have to make sure
those risers are flush. Let me do it.

160
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:18,670
- That's one way to grieve.
- How did they ever last 22 years?

161
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:23,582
It's easy when you get to fuck
whoever you want to the whole time.

162
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:27,342
- Hand me that Makita.
- Here.

163
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:31,264
So were you guys a couple
or just hanging out?

164
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:37,024
I thought we were a couple,
but he thought we were just hanging out.

165
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:41,271
- He was squirrelly, wasn't he?
- Totally.

166
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,702
Nate used to be like that.

167
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:47,462
Sometimes you just have
to hang in there and wait.

168
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,231
Wait for what?

169
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:53,907
For them to grow up.

170
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:59,346
If I'd known he was gonna be such a jerk,
I would never have slept with him.

171
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,544
- OK, put me to work.
- Ruth, no. It's your night off.

172
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,709
I much prefer to be busy.

173
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:09,543
You should have told me this was a big deal.
I could have changed my plans.

174
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:12,232
- I won't hear of it.
- You're not going to be here?

175
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:17,472
I've got to go to this guest-artist lecture series.
It's Scott Philip Smith.

176
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:21,222
He's this really radical artist
with death threats against him.

177
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:24,629
- He's very political.
- Claire, it's your mother's birthday.

178
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:30,030
Don't be silly. You go ahead.
This isn't going to be my last birthday.

179
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,826
I'll totally make it up to you.

180
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:37,503
Ruth, would you prefer curried chickpeas
or chickpea croquettes?

181
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,021
Chickpeas give me gas.

182
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,667
This an unusually gassy family.

183
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:46,626
But I love chickpeas anyway
and this is my birthday.

184
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,551
So you decide. You're the chef.

185
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:52,665
- That's such a lovely dress.
- Thank you.

186
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:56,183
Here. I'd hate it if you got something on it.

187
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:59,191
Too late. Maya spit up on it last time I wore it.

188
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:03,545
Isn't that funny? I think
all my dresses had spit-up on them.

189
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,022
- There you go.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:12,027
Has the party started yet?

191
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,665
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, dear.

192
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:17,382
One, two, three.

193
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:24,551
Hello.

194
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:30,506
- Kevin never mentioned this.
- I mean...

195
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:34,262
A tongue stud I can sort of understand.

196
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:37,589
But this, that's gotta hurt.

197
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,989
Not to mention getting it, you know, installed.

198
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,506
So is that supposed to enhance pleasure?
And for who?

199
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:49,670
Apparently it worked for Queen Victoria.

200
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:53,023
- Come again?
- It's called a Prince Albert.

201
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:55,064
She liked him to wear tight pants.

202
00:16:55,113 --> 00:17:01,746
The ring was attached by a strap to his thigh,
thus enabling a smooth trouser line.

203
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,353
How do you know all this stuff?

204
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,953
I read a lot.

205
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,346
Yeah, right.

206
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,422
You know what I've been noticing a lot lately?

207
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,510
A lot of guys coming in with their balls shaved.

208
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:18,147
What's that all about?

209
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,865
Actually, it makes them more sensitive.

210
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:26,428
For oral stimulation.

211
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:31,388
Besides, no one likes getting pubic hair
stuck in their teeth.

212
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:37,031
Do you want to ask me if I shave my balls?

213
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:38,984
No, not really.

214
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:43,311
I'm happy to tell you. And I do shave.
Have to. Lot of hair down there.

215
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,264
Keith doesn't have to.

216
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:47,907
Anything else you wanna know,
now is the time.

217
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:49,944
No. I'm good.

218
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:58,303
In 1982, Ronald Reagan's deregulation
of the nation's mental hospitals

219
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:01,823
left thousands of former inpatients homeless.

220
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:07,311
I believed these incapacitated victims of greed
deserve to voice their dissent.

221
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:12,427
So I spent two nights roaming the streets
of New York City in the dead of winter

222
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:16,910
asking them to wipe their asses with this flag.

223
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:22,112
When this piece was unveiled,
a group of, quote, "patriots", unquote,

224
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:24,951
ripped it from the walls
of the Whitney Museum,

225
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:27,348
took it to the streets and burned it.

226
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:31,070
That I was able to motivate
these right-wing assholes

227
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:33,946
into actually burning an American flag,

228
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:38,305
this is what I consider to be
the highlight of my career.

229
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,272
- So what'd you think?
- I think he's amazing.

230
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:45,541
Amazing?

231
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,869
He's so unafraid and so committed
to what he believes in.

232
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:54,547
You should meet him. Come on.

233
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:00,553
Stop hitting on my students,
you overrated shit.

234
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:03,949
Bite my ass, you Nazi prick.

235
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:10,023
Scott, I'd like you to meet
Claire Fisher and Russell Corwin,

236
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:12,985
two very promising first years.

237
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:16,184
- It's a real honour to meet you, sir.
- Totally.

238
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:21,151
Do yourselves a favour and give up now,
unless you're willing to live as outlaws.

239
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:25,789
This is a culture where art is not only
a dirty word, it's a fucking crime.

240
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,304
I'm starving, I'm thirsty
and, more importantly, I am your guest.

241
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:33,504
- Why don't you two join us?
- Seriously?

242
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:39,384
An artist never questions her right
to experience everything the world has to offer.

243
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,947
- Never.
- OK.

244
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,872
Maybe we can do as much damage
as we did in Antwerp.

245
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,825
Hope you got better health insurance this time.

246
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,546
- OK, I'm officially scared.
- Don't let them see.

247
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,788
- No, that's the good-good china.
- Yes.

248
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,791
- We never use the good-good china.
- Then what's it for?

249
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:04,308
But we hardly ever use the good china.

250
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:07,186
Do you want me to put this back
and use the good china?

251
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,146
- If that isn't the good china, then what is it?
- The good-good china.

252
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,387
What the hell. Let's use the good-good china.

253
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,469
Yippee.

254
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,630
Bettina, this is my daughter-in-law Lisa.

255
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:24,506
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't worry, it's all good.

256
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:28,228
She likes you a hell of a lot better
than the one before you.

257
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:31,982
- Happy birthday.
- You didn't have to do this.

258
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:37,505
Don't even think about returning it.
There's no receipt, if you catch my drift.

259
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,908
- We have to move this table.
- Why?

260
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:43,787
- We're gonna dance.
- Heavens, no. We don't dance in this family.

261
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,109
Ruth Fisher, we're gonna celebrate
you tonight, like it or not.

262
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:50,304
Now go put on your new clothes.

263
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:53,868
- All right. Thank you.
- Help me move it up against the window.

264
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:58,429
- Shouldn't we wait until after dinner?
- I'll be too wasted by then.

265
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,866
And I brought some music.

266
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:05,464
I hope you weren't planning on listening
to this Lilith Fair crap all night long.

267
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:08,152
Ready? One, two, three.

268
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:11,193
Being an artist
is not about being right all the time.

269
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,111
It's resigning oneself to a life of masochism.

270
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:18,271
OK. Just answer me this.
Why are you an artist?

271
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,907
Because I'm angry.

272
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:24,741
Disgusting. What do you have to be angry
about, you and your fucking grants?

273
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,988
I don't use that to make art. I give it away.

274
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:31,470
It was your shit on the flag.
You're too fucking scared to actually go there...

275
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:34,550
You're pissed because
you have nothing original to say.

276
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,665
You latch onto politics
because you have nothing original.

277
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,103
There is nothing original to say.
It's all been said before.

278
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:44,111
Go to Hollywood, then. That is so pathetic.

279
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,542
That is so fucking American.

280
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:50,711
Is there anything more infuriating
than the moral vanity of Eurotrash?

281
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,305
Fuck you.

282
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,310
Welcome to Epcot, kids.

283
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:03,631
I would rip your dick off and force-feed it to you
if I didn't think you would like it.

284
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:06,062
Fantastic rage.

285
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:10,150
- I fucking love you, you stupid bald peasant.
- Prove it.

286
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,582
Buy us another round.

287
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,624
And why are you an artist?

288
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,064
Because...

289
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:28,191
Because I have a lot of pain.

290
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,824
Good.

291
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,552
- Pain is good for an artist.
- Bullshit.

292
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:39,188
Adolescent romanticism.
"All artists must suffer."

293
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,273
God, you are fucking beautiful.

294
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:48,428
Your skin is like Carrara marble.

295
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,506
Is this young man your lover?

296
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,032
No.

297
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,824
Why the hell not?

298
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,868
Maybe Russell doesn't think she's beautiful.

299
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:06,703
I think she's very beautiful.

300
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:12,629
And why are you an artist?

301
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,585
Because I don't have a fucking choice.

302
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:21,664
If I can't create art, I don't want to live.

303
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,193
Attaboy.

304
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:31,543
Why do you validate these infantile notions?

305
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:34,471
Because you want them to love you.

306
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:39,712
I want them to trust their own vision.
Something which you have none of, arriviste.

307
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,268
- And you want them to love you.
- Can I get you anything else?

308
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:47,306
My friend will have a shot of ouzo
with a big dollop of shit in it.

309
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,908
Our room opened directly out onto the pool.

310
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:57,865
And the dregs of humanity, from the looks of it.

311
00:23:57,913 --> 00:24:00,552
And that's the Sunday smorgasbord brunch.

312
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:04,142
They come for the breakfast burrito
and the free shuttle to the outlet mall.

313
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,868
I never really understood the concept
of a breakfast burrito.

314
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:13,068
So where are all the X-rated ones?
You leave those at home?

315
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:18,267
You gotta go on the internet
and pay 9.99 a month for those.

316
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,703
Poor David always looked so funny
in a bathing suit.

317
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:28,985
- I do not look funny in a bathing suit.
- Actually, you do.

318
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,749
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

319
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:36,546
You, on the other hand, do not look funny.

320
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:40,586
- Bettina!
- What? I'm just flirting.

321
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,752
You're barking up the wrong tree, lady.

322
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:49,025
- Who wants coffee?
- For God's sake, stop waiting on us.

323
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:52,509
Sit down. You deserve a break
after that scrumptious meal.

324
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:55,113
This is David at the Geoffrey Beene outlet mall.

325
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:57,144
Oh, my God.

326
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:02,232
- Now I get the attraction.
- He's a hottie.

327
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:04,264
I almost forgot.

328
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:11,708
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, dear, you really shouldn't have.

329
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:13,744
Shut up.

330
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,988
It's just a little something
I thought of at the last minute.

331
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:24,063
"For my mother-in-law on her special day.

332
00:25:25,153 --> 00:25:30,147
"This coupon is redeemable
for one free foot massage. Love, Lisa."

333
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:32,184
Nice.

334
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:38,665
- What happened to the bath salts?
- It felt so impersonal.

335
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:40,704
- Can I have it now?
- You want it now?

336
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:43,825
Yes, please. I love massages.

337
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:47,183
- Since when?
- Since yesterday. Please?

338
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:51,465
You wanna go under the sun porch?
Maybe it'll be more comfortable.

339
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:56,152
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll all end up naked.

340
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:59,549
- I wouldn't bet on that.
- I would.

341
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:02,061
Does this party seem a little weird to you?

342
00:26:02,113 --> 00:26:05,025
On a scale of one to ten, ninety.

343
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,108
Which foot first?

344
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,394
So what do you really think of his work?

345
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,159
- I like parts of it.
- Not really, though.

346
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:27,520
- It's kind of on the nose.
- It's way too on the nose.

347
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,792
Good.

348
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:36,313
Because every nasty thing I said to him earlier
was the absolute truth.

349
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,671
And every flattering thing was a lie.

350
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,634
You didn't say too much that was flattering.

351
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:48,841
You are a brilliant artist, Claire.

352
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:51,476
That piece you did last week in the studio

353
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:55,993
was better than anything Smith has done
in the last ten years.

354
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,632
- Really?
- Absolutely.

355
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:07,790
But you, Russell, you're going to be
successful beyond your wildest dreams.

356
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:12,516
You honestly think so?

357
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,871
Would I lie to you?

358
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,913
I might.

359
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:22,433
But who gives a fuck?
The world is gonna love you.

360
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:25,440
No matter what, you cannot care
what other people think.

361
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:27,598
I don't care what other people think.

362
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:30,679
Phoney baloney, ka-ka shit.

363
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:33,953
Everybody your age
cares about what other people think.

364
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:37,392
You don't even know what you think yourself.

365
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,073
I have to pee.

366
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:51,113
I'm serious about you.

367
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:56,201
Russell is good.
He's gonna make a lot of money.

368
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:00,877
But you, your talent is epic.

369
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,561
It's like the tail of a comet.

370
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:09,876
- You can change the world.
- Shut up. God.

371
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,311
I'm so envious of you.

372
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:18,475
You see the world with your own eyes.

373
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:22,231
Do you know what a rare
and precious gift that is?

374
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:24,273
No.

375
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:31,359
And God created beauty. And then he retired.

376
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:38,237
Promise me you'll do great things in your life,
nothing less.

377
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,193
Promise me.

378
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,998
I promise.

379
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:49,911
All right. Let's get out of here
and leave that imbecile with the tab.

380
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:06,512
Oh, my God. That feels unbelievably good.

381
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,951
I have strong hands.

382
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,916
Right there. That's the spot.

383
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:17,193
You never give me a foot massage.

384
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:20,552
- Your feet stink.
- They do not.

385
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:23,560
They do. You get that from your father.

386
00:29:23,602 --> 00:29:25,957
How come you never give me a foot massage?

387
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,994
Because you never ask.

388
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:33,042
This is really weird.

389
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,955
I just remembered this dream I had.

390
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:40,517
It was about a month ago, I guess.

391
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,952
I was getting a foot massage.

392
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:47,074
You all know I have extremely ticklish feet.

393
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:51,638
You were all there. Not you, Bettina.
Not you, Keith. No offence.

394
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:55,391
Everyone else. You were there,
Lisa, David and Claire.

395
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,798
I'm getting this foot massage.

396
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:04,758
I can't remember who was giving it to me.
I think it may have been Dad.

397
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:10,599
I'm holding Maya and she's slippery.
She's squirming like a pig.

398
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,239
She's squirming like a pig and then what?

399
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,911
I don't remember the rest of it, except that...

400
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,992
I could never find my shoes.

401
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:45,513
I read somewhere that every person
in your dream is actually you.

402
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,998
I'm gonna check on the baby.

403
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:55,633
Did you know that there are more bones
in the feet than in the rest of the entire body?

404
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,877
I didn't know that.

405
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,914
But now that you say it, I totally believe it.

406
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:07,751
Thank you, dear. That's the nicest thing
anyone's done for me in a very long time.

407
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:12,398
My pleasure. It's just my little way
of saying thank you for letting us live here.

408
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:15,752
Of course. You're family.

409
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:48,155
Nobody touches anything.

410
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:50,716
I love it.

411
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:53,151
Oh, my. It's very large.

412
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,762
I've always wanted to see
the Great Wall of China.

413
00:31:55,802 --> 00:31:59,795
- So have I. We should go.
- What the hell is this?

414
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:05,758
The scenic designer for LA Lyric Opera
created this for the funeral of his lover.

415
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:07,793
- It figures.
- What figures?

416
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:13,041
Only a gay man would build a fucking
opera set for his lover's funeral.

417
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:15,516
I think it cheapens their whole relationship.

418
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:18,554
Don't be such a snob. It's sweet.

419
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,639
You'd better be prepared to build me
something when I go.

420
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:25,277
Something involving
Steve McQueen on a motorcycle?

421
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:28,632
An entire POW barracks. Get over here.

422
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:34,320
What? Come on. Why don't you loosen up?

423
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:37,434
- It's unbelievable.
- It's made out of wood.

424
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:40,201
- I know.
- What did I miss?

425
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:45,270
You and me and Lisa are going on vacation
to China together.

426
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:48,155
Me, too. Can I come?

427
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,477
- Are you drunk?
- It's OK.

428
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:53,753
I have four days' worth of milk in the freezer.

429
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:57,157
Why'd you change your shirt?

430
00:32:57,202 --> 00:33:02,674
- I just spilled something on the other one.
- You're such a klutz. But you're my klutz.

431
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:05,077
Look at the pagoda.

432
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:11,759
- You smell like Listerine.
- Yeah.

433
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:14,953
I'm dying.

434
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:22,754
His name was Simon Rodia
and he spent 33 years working on them.

435
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:27,193
When he felt they were finished, he gave
the deeds to his house to a neighbour,

436
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:29,278
packed up and moved away.

437
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:34,513
- They're amazing.
- He put everything into them.

438
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,952
Whatever he'd find on his way
walking to and from work.

439
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:40,800
Steel rods, seashells, pottery,

440
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:44,994
glass, old boots, corncobs.

441
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,795
He must have been out of his mind.

442
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:51,960
He was a construction worker,
but he was a real artist.

443
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:58,081
And all real artists are out of their mind.

444
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:02,276
Yeah? You think so?

445
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:06,559
- Look at Olivier and Scott Smith.
- Yeah.

446
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:09,116
Van Gogh cut off an ear.

447
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,553
- It's so weird.
- What?

448
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:23,277
Every single person at our school
thinks they're gonna be successful

449
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:26,712
otherwise they wouldn't even be doing this.

450
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:29,913
But what is success?

451
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:33,193
Is it just money or fame?

452
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:35,915
Or is it the critics loving you?

453
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:39,875
Or is it you knowing
that you've done good work?

454
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:41,480
Or what?

455
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:50,918
This is a fucking masterpiece.

456
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:54,079
But maybe the guy who made it
just thought it was shit

457
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:56,113
and now no one even knows his name.

458
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,153
Simon Rodia.

459
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:04,195
God, I feel like such a phoney.

460
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:06,472
Why? You're fucking brilliant.

461
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:12,552
Because I can't imagine ever being
this dedicated or this consumed by anything.

462
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:19,000
Maybe you just haven't found whatever it is
that's worth cutting off an ear for.

463
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:22,432
I would never cut off my fucking ear.

464
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:30,077
- Van Gogh did it for love.
- He did it because he was totally insane.

465
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:33,080
It's only an ear.

466
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:38,116
It's not like he couldn't hear out of it.
There was still a hole there.

467
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,953
It's almost two.

468
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:52,193
Oh, my God.

469
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:57,154
I'm not even tired, are you?

470
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:02,593
No.

471
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:48,873
Party pooper.

472
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:55,437
How come you're not upstairs
embarrassing yourself with everybody else?

473
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,473
I don't know.

474
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,875
Want a little time to yourself?

475
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:07,351
I know this great little
Indian restaurant in Hollywood.

476
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:13,272
The owner'll give you the room upstairs.
All you have to do is bury his wife for free.

477
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:18,638
- I'm not quite there yet.
- Won't be long.

478
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:23,839
You're a funeral director, which you never
wanted to be, just like your old man.

479
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:27,511
You married a woman you knocked up
because it was the right thing to do,

480
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:29,951
just like your old man.

481
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,870
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

482
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:38,675
So are you gonna
throw away that pack you already have?

483
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,713
Probably.

484
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:46,598
- I'm not you.
- You just keep telling yourself that.

485
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm not shut down.

486
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:53,441
I'm not 500 fucking million miles away.
I haven't given up.

487
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:56,993
I love my family.

488
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:07,716
Buddy boy, you think I would have
stuck around if I didn't love mine?

489
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:34,961
Check this out.

490
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:39,393
Ambiguous Figure Between Curtains
by Olivier Castro-Staal.

491
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,001
That is so intense.

492
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:47,877
It's part of the permanent collection
at the Contemporary Art Centre in Cincinnati.

493
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:50,516
Reminds me of Francis Bacon a little.

494
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:56,158
Oh, my God. He was only 20
when he made this.

495
00:38:56,202 --> 00:39:00,514
That means we have a year
to produce something this good.

496
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:04,191
I think it's really cool
that you live in a funeral home.

497
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:07,837
- Believe me, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

498
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:11,431
I'm jealous. It's totally weird.

499
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,432
And excellent and perfect
for when they write your biography.

500
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,637
I'm not gay, you know.

501
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:29,078
- What?
- I'm not. Gay.

502
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:34,282
Who said anything about you being gay?

503
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:36,358
You thought I was.

504
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:41,155
Most people think I am, but I'm not.

505
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:45,676
OK.

506
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:50,512
I don't even know what it is.
Guys hit on me all the fucking time.

507
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:54,600
It's probably because you're hot.

508
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:59,150
You think I'm hot?

509
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,193
I do.

510
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,792
Really?

511
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:09,711
Cos usually I get, "He's cute."

512
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:12,595
No, you're way more than cute.

513
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:14,633
- I am?
- Definitely.

514
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:19,711
So you didn't think I was gay?

515
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,712
I thought you might be.

516
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:27,276
Well, I'm not.

517
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:30,758
I think we just established that.

518
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,799
OK.

519
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:27,154
I lit it exactly the way Bob would have.

520
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:33,072
I always needed his lighting
to make me look good.

521
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:44,600
Thank you, all, for joining me today
in celebrating Bob's life.

522
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:50,156
We're all so lucky to have experienced
the joy of knowing him.

523
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:55,837
And I'm not just referring to the joy
of knowing him biblically,

524
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:00,956
although a lot of you here
have experienced that as well.

525
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:03,721
I know because I was there.

526
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:14,390
I never thought that I'd be
in a relationship at all.

527
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,913
I thought I didn't have what it takes...

528
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:28,634
that no one could possibly
love me enough to stick around.

529
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:33,553
But Bob did.

530
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:37,837
He stuck around.

531
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:40,840
And so did I.

532
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:49,674
And for 22 years, we shared our hearts,

533
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:53,761
our bodies, our souls.

534
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:59,191
It wasn't always easy.

535
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:03,960
It wasn't always fun.

536
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:06,436
But it was always worth it.

537
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:11,719
I don't know what I did in a previous life,

538
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:16,233
but to quote Julie Andrews
as Maria von Trapp,

539
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:19,433
it must have been something good,

540
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:25,635
because I've been rewarded
a thousandfold in this life.

541
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:08,953
How was the funeral?

542
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:12,438
It was pretty great, actually.

543
00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:14,552
As far as funerals go.

544
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:16,593
I could hear the singing from here.

545
00:45:16,642 --> 00:45:19,031
That guy had an amazing voice.

546
00:45:23,002 --> 00:45:26,278
Do you think your mother had fun last night?

547
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:32,318
Are you kidding me? I haven't seen her
that happy in... maybe ever.

548
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,681
That was a really great thing you did.

549
00:45:37,722 --> 00:45:39,713
I'm really proud of you.

550
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:45,278
- And I'm really proud of us.
- For what?

551
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:49,600
For making this work. For being present,
for showing up each day.

552
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:52,440
For being committed to being a family.

553
00:45:53,602 --> 00:45:57,038
- Is it that hard for you?
- Of course not.

554
00:45:57,082 --> 00:45:59,755
- I thought this was what you wanted.
- It is.

555
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,952
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

556
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:05,995
Totally sure, a hundred per cent, absolutely,
no doubts whatsoever?

557
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,837
I'm sure.

558
00:46:11,922 --> 00:46:14,595
I love you so much, it terrifies me.

559
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,515
Do you think you might run by
Whole Foods tonight?

560
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:24,315
- I'll go right now.
- You will?

561
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:27,354
The list is on the fridge in the main house.

562
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,033
I won't be long.

563
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,913
How do you know Dennis?

564
00:46:40,962 --> 00:46:44,921
When he isn't spray-painting walls,
he's president of Green Earth.

565
00:46:44,962 --> 00:46:48,511
He was one of the founders
of Green Earth in the late '80s.

566
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:51,599
- You're home early.
- Am I?

567
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,317
- How was your day?
- It was OK.

568
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,956
- How was yours?
- The usual.

569
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:09,393
What's wrong?

570
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,593
I want...

571
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:24,631
I want us to last.

572
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:30,554
I want us to stay together.

573
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:32,593
OK.

574
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:36,591
I just want it to be worth it.

575
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,113
OK.

576
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,476
How was your birthday party?

577
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:12,235
You know what?
I thought it was going to be awful.

578
00:48:12,282 --> 00:48:16,355
But it was truly one of
the finest evenings I ever spent.

579
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:20,830
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Lisa gave me a foot massage.

580
00:48:20,882 --> 00:48:26,081
It was heavenly. I got a little tipsy. We danced.

581
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:30,514
OK. I'm really sorry I missed it.

582
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:33,599
I saved you a piece of birthday cake.
It's in the fridge.

583
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:37,840
- Thanks.
- How was your guest-artist lecture?

584
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,237
It was...

585
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:46,473
Actually, it was truly one of
the finest evenings I've ever spent.

586
00:48:46,522 --> 00:48:51,118
We went out afterwards, me, Russell
and our teacher and this artist.

587
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,676
I'm not even sure what happened.

588
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,839
I just had this glimpse
of what might be possible.

589
00:48:56,882 --> 00:49:01,797
For whatever reason, the world just seemed
really open and interesting,

590
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:06,632
and not totally screwed up, and I don't know.

591
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:10,072
I just felt really happy.

592
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:20,761
Mom, would you like to go
to a museum with me today?

593
00:49:20,802 --> 00:49:23,191
I would love nothing more.

594
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:27,555
- Should I make lunch first?
- No, let's go out.

595
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:30,162
We can go to Neddy's.
My treat for your birthday.

596
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:35,401
Thank you. I was just gonna put
this table back where it was.

597
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:38,400
Do you want me to help?

598
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,400
No, we can do it later.
