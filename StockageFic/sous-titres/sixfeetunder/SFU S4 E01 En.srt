1
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,277
See, we think we know what we're capable of...

2
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,999
but maybe there's even more to being human

3
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,508
than even the scientists know, right?

4
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,120
I dig science. I dig oceanography the best.

5
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,232
I mean, this acid that we're on right now...

6
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,519
is made by science.

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,199
That's what so fuckin' mind-blowing about it.

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,595
It's scientific.

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,512
- I love you.
- I love you too.

10
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,270
Bruno, your...

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,198
your face is all, like, glowing from underneath.

12
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,669
It's like you're one of those lava lamps.
It's like you're made of human taffy.

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,278
I am.

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,359
- Let me try.
- No, come on. I wanna show you something.

15
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,671
I made it! I didn't buy it!

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,671
Hey, Bruno, man, nice party.

17
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,996
- Crambone, it's all happening, man!
- The moments?

18
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,271
The motherfuckin' moments,
they keep on coming!

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,389
Right, right.

20
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,751
Where are we going?

21
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,791
Higher.

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,829
Come on.

23
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,435
- We shouldn't be up here.
- No, we should always be up here.

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,277
See...

25
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,197
That's the tragedy of life.

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,555
- The fucking tragedy, Sandy, is we're all...
- My name is Cindy.

27
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,031
See?

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,150
That is a beautiful name too.

29
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,031
There are so many beautiful names!

30
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,993
I just want to tear every fucking name out
and love every name.

31
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,474
- And the hearts and blood...
- Let's go back.

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,715
No, l gotta go.

33
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,711
Bruno?

34
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,676
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

35
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,550
I had nowhere else to go.

36
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,111
It's not a problem.

37
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
Where did you get yourself so messed up?

38
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,111
It doesn't matter.

39
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
Some bar.

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,798
<i>When do l get to self-destruct?</i>

41
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,991
And when do you? I mean it.

42
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,837
I'm sick of Nate's bullshit.

43
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,908
I hate that he didn't come
to our mother's wedding. I'm sick of...

44
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,430
I'm just sick of everything
being so fuckin' awful all the time.

45
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,551
I'm sorry, but l am.

46
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,270
I'll take Maya tonight if you want.

47
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,754
No, it's OK, I'll do it.

48
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,870
It's obviously my thing.

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,276
- Good night.
- Good night.

50
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,993
- Sweet dreams.
- Thanks.

51
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,348
- I feel like I've been eating this cake for a year.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

52
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,436
Well, l guess l better get going.

53
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,871
- You could stay over tonight. If you want.
- Here?

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
Yeah, if you're too drunk to drive or whatever.

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,238
- I could do that.
- What's wrong with here anyway?

56
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,032
- Nothing.
- I grew up here.

57
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,516
I've just never stayed over your house before.
That's all l meant.

58
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,710
You can if you want. That's all l meant.

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,471
Look, I'm tired, OK? My mother just married
some guy. Let me be edgy.

60
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,238
Be whatever you want, l don't care.

61
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,271
- So stay over.
- OK!

62
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,989
- Jesus.
- God.

63
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,953
I have to drive to Santa Barbara
to pick up her body.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,553
- To pick up my wife's body.
- Go to sleep.

65
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,870
I can't.

66
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,239
It's all so impossible.
It's all so fuckin' impossible.

67
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,111
Just sleep, Nate, it helps.

68
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,315
- It's weird.
- What?

69
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,154
It's quieter here than over at...

70
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,431
Your place?

71
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,159
Yeah.

72
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,874
Yeah, it's quieter.

73
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,388
And stranger.

74
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,670
What's so strange?

75
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,870
The thought that l just got blown

76
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,276
in the same bed where my mom
used to read me The Runaway Bunny.

77
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,719
And The Five Chinese Brothers.

78
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,270
- Oh, God.
- What is that?

79
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,038
Ls that Claire?

80
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,230
No!

81
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,071
<i>Georgel</i>

82
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,118
<i>Georgel</i>

83
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,390
That was nice.

84
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,355
It certainly was.

85
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,156
I'm married again.

86
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,478
- And?
- Nothing.

87
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,796
I just never thought I'd be married again.

88
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,355
- Are you happy?
- Very.

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,194
Me too.

90
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,991
I'm sorry your children
couldn't come to the wedding.

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,631
Well, they were...

92
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,432
very busy.

93
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,550
I get it.

94
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,068
I'd like to meet them, though, sometime.

95
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,998
Brian and Maggie? Sure.

96
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,270
You know so much about my family,

97
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,754
and l know so little about yours.

98
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,352
I'm sure you'll meet them someday.

99
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,960
- At my funeral, if not before.
- George!

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,470
- If they even bother to come to that.
- George, I'm serious.

101
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,270
Look.

102
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,149
You've lived your life one way,

103
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,156
I've lived mine another.

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,230
The costs are different.

105
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,069
But l can tell you this.

106
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,588
Every day when l wake up,

107
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,279
I'm glad that I'm alive,

108
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,199
and if people don't like
the way I've done things,

109
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,231
that's their business.

110
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,995
But right now,

111
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,355
I'm so very happy I've found you.

112
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,791
And I'm looking forward, not back.

113
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,108
OK?

114
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,275
Do you think we were too loud?

115
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,556
It's...

116
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,068
possible that we were too loud, yes.

117
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,631
You don't have to say it.

118
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,790
I know.

119
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,436
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

120
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,755
Call me if you need anything.

121
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,119
Yeah, l will.

122
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,473
I waited up until, like, four.
He never showed up.

123
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,034
God, I'm sorry.

124
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,799
- No, l couldn't sleep anyway.
- Could you believe it?

125
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,434
I was completely scandalised.

126
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,756
I never knew the word George
could sound so obscene.

127
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,111
Good for them.

128
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,232
- Want some more coffee?
- Yes, please.

129
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,793
We have to get out of this house
if they keep doing that.

130
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,910
Out of the state.

131
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,678
Out of the universe.

132
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,590
- What happened to you?
- Lisa's dead.

133
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,679
Shit.

134
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,474
Her body washed up near Carpinteria
a few days ago.

135
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,032
- Some kids found it.
- Fuck.

136
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,039
It took the lab till yesterday
to figure out it was her.

137
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,038
- Do they know what happened?
- She drowned.

138
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,755
- She just...drowned?
- That's what they said.

139
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,238
- No evidence of anything else.
- But she could swim, right?

140
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,114
Yeah, it just looks like she drowned.

141
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,073
God.

142
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,958
So l have to...

143
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,956
go to the coroner up there and get her.

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,877
I'll come with you.

145
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,949
Thanks.

146
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,514
Nate, what happened to your face?

147
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,551
I got in a fight.

148
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,718
Good morning, morning glories.

149
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,309
I hope we didn't keep
any of you folks up last night.

150
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,394
They found Lisa's body.

151
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,319
- She's dead.
- Oh, Lord.

152
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,278
I'm sorry.

153
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,359
So am I. So am I.

154
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,712
Angelica!

155
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,754
Sweetie, l gotta be at work in like ten minutes,
David's going up there with Nate, so...

156
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,712
Wait a minute, honey, OK? Angelica, come on!

157
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,115
Gimme a second.

158
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,790
- Why were you so late last night?
- I was at work.

159
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,832
We had this body come in, this young girl.

160
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,871
You don't even want to know.

161
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,471
Thank you for taking such good care of us.

162
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,874
Angelica, I'm serious!

163
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,031
So... Keith.

164
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,558
- So what about him?
- Are you guys back together?

165
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,238
No.

166
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,119
He was there this morning.

167
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,553
He was a little drunk last night,
l let him stay over. I was being polite.

168
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,591
Polite and horny.

169
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,110
And horny. Thank you for bringing that up.

170
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,114
I never really thought Lisa
and I'd be together for ever.

171
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,631
I always knew
something would come along and end it.

172
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,719
I just didn't want it to be me.

173
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,117
You wouldn't believe the time l wasted
thinking, "Don't let it be me that fucks it up."

174
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,469
- And it wasn't.
- No?

175
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,551
Good for me.

176
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,916
<i>You smell terrible</i>.

177
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,838
Cavity fluid. Sorry.

178
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,031
- The smell of it just permeates everything.
- It always smells so cold and lonely.

179
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,311
But then also weirdly sweet,
like an old lady's hair.

180
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,191
That's Velvetone.

181
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,239
Moisturiser.

182
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,390
It's to mask the other smell.

183
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,078
I'll take a shower before bed.

184
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,429
When l die, l don't want any of that stuff in me.

185
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,710
- Yeah, l don't blame you.
- No, I'm serious.

186
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,593
I don't want to be chemicalised and boxed up.

187
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,598
I just want to be taken out to some open space

188
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,315
in the forest somewhere,
buried right in the ground.

189
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,715
Nothing between me
and the earth that made me.

190
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,551
You don't want to end up in a graveyard.

191
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,070
Nate, the whole world's a graveyard.

192
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,318
Anybody home?

193
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,635
- Hello?
- It's Joe.

194
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,798
From across the way? The guy
that you didn't... go on a date with last night.

195
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,114
Oh, hi.

196
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,831
Yeah. Come on in.

197
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,474
- Hey.
- Hey, what's in the bag?

198
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,436
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right, l guess.

199
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,591
Well, what's the matter?

200
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,795
Oh, a friend of mine died.

201
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,354
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

202
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,633
- I can go if you wanna...
- No, stay. Stay.

203
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,116
I've just been sitting here
staring into space all morning.

204
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,152
I've got to get my shit together at some point.

205
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,676
- Chinese food?
- Yeah, yeah.

206
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,998
Do you want some? I got a little extra
just in case you were around.

207
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,079
It's not a date thing. It's just a neighbour thing.

208
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,078
All right.

209
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,471
You eat shrimp?

210
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,797
There is some salt and pepper shrimp
in here somewhere.

211
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,799
- I eat everything but mushrooms.
- I don't like mushrooms either.

212
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,910
They're too much like parts of people.

213
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,951
They just taste dirty to me.

214
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,991
- Here.
- Thanks.

215
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,197
- What's funny?
- I don't think I've ever had a neighbour

216
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,151
who just stops by before.

217
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,111
So, how is it?

218
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,032
It's interesting.

219
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,031
I don't want to go in there.

220
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,991
OK. I'll handle it.

221
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,791
Thanks.

222
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,115
This is the worst one I've had in a long time.

223
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,469
It's like those whales when they die.

224
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,158
- You know what happens?
- No.

225
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,111
Their guts turn to cream and explode.

226
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,232
All that's left when they wash up on shore
is a bag of blubber.

227
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,353
- This is my sister-in-law.
- Oh, shit, shit.

228
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,914
Shit. I'm sorry. I thought
you were here on business.

229
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,511
I am and this is my sister-in-law.
You shouldn't talk like that about anybody.

230
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,755
- Just wait, hold on a sec.
- What?

231
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,634
It's her jawbone.
They used the dental work to ID her.

232
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,470
And here's your death certificate.

233
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,596
- I can help, if you want.
- I've got it.

234
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,557
- I'm really sorry, man.
- You didn't know.

235
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,317
- I just need to drive for a while.
- That's fine.

236
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,798
Oh, God, Jesus. Fuck.

237
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,479
Oh, God, let's get the fuck outta here.

238
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,353
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi.

239
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,433
I miss her so much. It's so screwed up.

240
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,471
I know.

241
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,277
- You guys made it.
- Where's Maya?

242
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,673
Napping.

243
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,950
You have to come up
to Santa Cruz to the farm.

244
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,676
She'll have a blast and Hoyt
is so great with the little ones. She'll love him.

245
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,112
Yeah, we will. That'll be fun.

246
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,430
And you remember Simon and Shawn.

247
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,194
So, which one of you is which?

248
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,117
- Him.
- Him.

249
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,237
Do people ask you that
every time they see you?

250
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,550
Sorry.

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,591
How was the flight?

252
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,550
Very, very long.

253
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,309
Flying over those mountains
is a little scary to us.

254
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,557
I... l took a couple of Ativan.

255
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,556
But you found us OK? Once you got here?

256
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,398
Nope, good directions, no problem.

257
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,715
- And the hotel?
- Everything.

258
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,399
Those were good... good directions.

259
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,431
Love that MapQuest.

260
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,519
Oh, that's a good site. Hell of a site.

261
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,120
Extremely helpful.

262
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,232
I'm still a little...shaken up.

263
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,748
Of course you are.

264
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,678
My little girl is...dead.

265
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,390
You want to take a peek at Maya, maybe?

266
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,431
Yeah, that would be great.

267
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,553
- You're Michaela.
- I am.

268
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,351
- I'm David.
- I remember. I met you at the wedding.

269
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,311
I'm sorry about your Aunt Lisa.

270
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,310
We're not gonna have to see her, are we?

271
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,038
- No.
- That's a relief.

272
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,717
Are you...

273
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,588
- Do you think you want something to eat?
- Not me.

274
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,438
But l bet the rest of 'em do.

275
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,152
They all love to eat.

276
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,269
I have had this goofy feeling in my ear
for a week now.

277
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,916
I think it started the other day, you know,
when l took the boys to the beach.

278
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,194
- Angelica?
- What?

279
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,196
I was... l was wondering, maybe,

280
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,119
if it wasn't time for you
to start looking for a new place.

281
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,958
Is he making you do this?

282
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,912
- He is, isn't he?
- No.

283
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,839
- You know that's bullshit.
- It's time you got on your own two feet.

284
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,031
I have always been there for you,
whenever you needed me.

285
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,640
- And I've been there for you.
- When it's easy for you.

286
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,592
When it fits for you, you're there for me. Shit.

287
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,551
Watch your mouth in front of my kids.

288
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,513
I'm sorry, but this ear thing is driving me crazy.

289
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,993
- Angelica...
- No.

290
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,113
Don't even talk to me, Vanessa.
Don't even talk.

291
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,151
Congratulations.

292
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,230
I'm gonna go pack my things.

293
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,590
Come in.

294
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,871
- Can l escape in here for a second?
- Sure.

295
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,717
This house is crawling with people.
There's nowhere to hide.

296
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,793
What are you doing?

297
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,910
I'm trying to break my eye open.

298
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,192
Ouch.

299
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,153
That's what Olivier called it.
It's learning to see things differently,

300
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,033
without all the same tired associations

301
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,277
we've made all our sad lives, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,591
That one's pretty cool.

303
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,714
Yeah, that one is cool. They're all really cool.
It's fucking Nan Goldin, hello.

304
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,552
So you're back together with Keith, huh?

305
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,072
I don't know, maybe.

306
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,991
Do you wanna be?

307
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,391
What l want is...

308
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,394
l think l could be happy going back if l could...

309
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,398
Break your eye open a little?

310
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,308
Yeah. If we both could.

311
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,749
- Why? Ls it that hard?
- You tell me.

312
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,117
Yeah, it's the hardest fuckin' thing in the world.

313
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,515
Yeah, it is.

314
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,552
Are you seeing anybody?
Got a thing for anybody?

315
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,639
Are you kidding? Everyone is an asshole
who ultimately fucks you over.

316
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,035
I am totally done with that.

317
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,958
I'm thinking about becoming
a crazy hermit recluse.

318
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,912
- You won't always feel that way.
- Yes, l will.

319
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,678
What?

320
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,793
- Everybody's waiting in the dining room.
- ..kitchen.

321
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,674
Gotta go. Thanks for the hide-out.

322
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,272
Thanks for listening to me
complain about my cushy, alienated life.

323
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,193
Any time.

324
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,957
OK, here we go, gentlemen.

325
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,598
<i>That's not what Lisa wanted</i>.

326
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,559
With all due respect, Nate,

327
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,068
you only knew my daughter for a few years.

328
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,716
I think l have a little better idea than you
of what she would have really wanted,

329
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,639
if she hadn't been so busy throwing everything
in my face with her strange ideas.

330
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,956
- Mom...
- No, Barb.

331
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,831
She is getting cremated

332
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,952
and she is going in the family mausoleum
in Coeur d'Alene.

333
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,592
That is final.

334
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,112
- Peg, at times like these...
- The Kimmels have always done it this way.

335
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,435
Tell him, Ed.

336
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,756
We've got a real nice space set aside for her.

337
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,554
It's almost like a little chapel unto itself
up on the hill there.

338
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,036
That's not what she wanted.
Does that matter to you people at all?

339
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,629
Did she have a plan,
or a will or something that we could consult?

340
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,511
- Of course she didn't.
- Honey.

341
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,279
- She wanted... She didn't want...
- What?

342
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,838
She didn't want to be embalmed or cremated.
She just wanted to be put...

343
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,713
back into the earth somewhere.

344
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,432
No casket, nothing.

345
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,439
Well, that is just the sickest thing
I've ever heard.

346
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,479
Mom.

347
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,550
- To be eaten by bugs and worms?
- Yeah, well, you should know

348
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,354
that a lot of her already has been eaten
by sharks and fish and shrimp!

349
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,868
- Nate!
- Stop yelling at me... Tell him to stop.

350
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,832
She just wanted to return to the earth,
is how she put it.

351
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,031
Well, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, right?

352
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,598
Seems pretty clear to me.

353
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,110
I can't believe you don't want to honour
your daughter's wishes.

354
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,879
- It seems to me...
- What?

355
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,991
I think we all need to be a little more aware
of each other's grief right now,

356
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,793
and a little less aggressive.

357
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,109
It would be nice to do something that bears
some relation to what Lisa would have wanted.

358
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,229
Thank you.

359
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,671
But if that's not possible...

360
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,995
I'm sorry, l can't deal with this.

361
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,077
David, you're gonna have to deal with this.

362
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,478
Why not...

363
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,670
Why not what, David?

364
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,115
Let's all start to try
thinking in terms of a middle ground.

365
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,593
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

366
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,433
Hey.

367
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,512
What's going on?

368
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,317
Not much.

369
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,871
Or a fuckin' lot, l guess.

370
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,033
- Where are you, can you talk a second?
- <i>Sure</i>.

371
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,834
Yeah. I was just on my way
to grab coffee with these...

372
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,189
two idiots who think they're revolutionaries

373
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,959
because they just went
to their first flash mob.

374
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,594
<i>So the later l am, the better</i>.

375
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,876
Say something, speak.

376
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,871
Well...

377
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,470
you know my sister-in-law Lisa?

378
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,513
<i>She was missing for, like, a really long time</i>.

379
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,437
<i>They just found her body</i>.

380
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,755
<i>She's dead</i>.

381
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,234
Holy fuckin' shit, Claire.

382
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,319
Yeah. It's really fucked up, isn't it?

383
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,193
<i>Claire, I'm so sorry</i>.

384
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,191
Yeah.

385
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,068
She's their girl. If something happened
to Maya, you'd be a nightmare to deal with.

386
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,795
- That's not the point.
- It's their last chance to be her parents.

387
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,116
- I'm her husband, so the fuck what?
- Should I, perhaps, leave?

388
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,472
- No! Look, you know I'm with you on this.
- I'm sorry, that's not fuckin' obvious!

389
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,398
That's because
I'm trying to keep everybody happy!

390
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,556
- It's working.
- I know it's not working!

391
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,479
I could go re-alphabetise
those unclaimed cremains while you guys...

392
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,593
- Arthur.
- Or l can do that later, also is good for me too.

393
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,830
You just tell me,
do you think it's OK for that fuckin' hydra,

394
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,792
which was what Lisa called her, OK?

395
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,674
Do you think it's OK for her to burn my wife up
in an oven and stick her in a drawer?

396
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,269
When all that Lisa wanted was to be outside
somewhere under the stars?

397
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,996
No, but what you're suggesting
is against the law. We could lose our licence.

398
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,310
Look, l know you want
to do a good thing for Lisa.

399
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,878
They do too, so do I.
We all want to do a good thing.

400
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,432
I'm over here.

401
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,232
What can l do for you?

402
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,874
I'm looking for someone to...

403
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,551
l wanted to make a confession.

404
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,758
- Do l know you?
- No, no. I didn't want to go to my own church.

405
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,360
Oh, OK. Well, have a seat.

406
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,836
We're not going in there?

407
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,793
We can if you like. But nowadays,
a lot of people prefer to do it face to face.

408
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,072
Well...

409
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,792
OK.

410
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,552
I say everything else the same, right?

411
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,750
Like the official way?

412
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,997
You can say it however you like.

413
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,992
Well...

414
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,952
I'm married and l have two kids,

415
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,959
but the other night,
l went to a strip club called The Seventh Veil.

416
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,230
I'm not really familiar with it.

417
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,398
Neither was I,

418
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,795
but this guy made me go,

419
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,310
and l met this girl, and l let her give me a...

420
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,758
You know? She...

421
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,758
She orally...

422
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,678
Do you know what the scriptures
say about marriage?

423
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,950
Yeah, yeah, kinda. You know?

424
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,076
I know the basic position of the scriptures,
and... whatever, yeah.

425
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,999
- Good. Do you know the act of contrition?
- Yes, sir. Yes.

426
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,309
Oh, my God,
l am heartily sorry for having offended Thee.

427
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,035
I detest all my sins, but most of all
because they offend Thee, my God,

428
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,196
who art all good and deserving of all my love.

429
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,314
I firmly intend to confess my sins,
do penance, and amend my life. Amen.

430
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,316
That was fast.

431
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,591
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,471
Hi, it's me.

433
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,794
<i>What's up?</i>

434
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,277
I just wanted to know
when Lisa's funeral is gonna be.

435
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,874
Yeah, I'm here.

436
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,478
It's tomorrow, ten o'clock.

437
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,711
Do you want me to come?

438
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,710
- <i>Honestly? No</i>.
- OK.

439
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,719
It's just there's a load of people here, Brenda,
Lisa's family from ldaho.

440
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,558
- <i>It's a mess</i>.
- You don't have to explain.

441
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,838
- Is that all right?
- <i>Sure</i>.

442
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,599
You do what you got to do to get through this.

443
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,710
Yeah, I'm trying.

444
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,509
Thanks.

445
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,549
OK. Bye.

446
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,711
<i>Bye</i>.

447
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,595
My sister Lisa didn't believe in borders.

448
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,519
She didn't see the edges
and the lines in between things

449
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,950
that most of us think keep life manageable.

450
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,310
And this meant
if you were her sister growing up,

451
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,830
she would always come
into your room without knocking.

452
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,919
Or she would come into the bathroom
and open the shower curtain

453
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,599
just to tell you about some article she'd read,

454
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,713
or some boy she'd met.

455
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,595
And it meant later on that she would...

456
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,715
call me on the phone,
sometimes very, very late at night,

457
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,709
just to tell me about
a new recipe l needed to try,

458
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,276
or, more recently,

459
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:35,839
some new, completely amazing thing
that Maya had done.

460
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,668
Or about how well things were going with Nate.

461
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,709
It also meant that she looked for ways,

462
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,151
every day, to reach out
to the people around her,

463
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,591
to extend kindness to strangers
when it wasn't expected.

464
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:04,350
And to push everyone around her
to see the things that unify us with nature,

465
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,595
with each other...

466
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,989
With life itself.

467
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,395
Lisa didn't believe in borders and that's why
l know that wherever Lisa is right now...

468
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,674
she's...

469
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,915
everywhere.

470
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,595
She's everywhere and that means she's home.

471
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,589
- So you ready, guys?
- Yeah.

472
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,517
I guess.

473
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,552
This was one of Aunt Lisa's favourite songs.

474
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,152
One, two, three, four.

475
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,151
That was an amazing service, Nate.

476
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,952
Lisa would have loved it.

477
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,279
So where is she gonna be buried or scattered?

478
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,074
We're gonna put her ashes
in the family mausoleum in Coeur d'Alene.

479
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,634
Oh, good. Idaho, good.

480
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,399
See, l didn't even know she was from ldaho.

481
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,600
We've lost three friends in the last month or so,

482
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,870
it's kinda taking a toll.

483
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,672
Oh, you poor thing.

484
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,711
And we're not even 40 yet, you know?

485
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,354
What's it gonna be like when we're 50 or 60?

486
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,709
There's so much death.

487
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,748
And Maya, what is she gonna do?
She's never gonna know her mother.

488
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,836
I don't know how you deal with it.

489
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,555
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

490
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,390
I'm just sorry
it's under such totally crappy circumstances.

491
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,552
But it's so good to see you.

492
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,673
- What have you been up to?
- Not much.

493
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,679
Making bad art.

494
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,154
Saying stupid things.

495
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,270
Continuing implementation of my master plan

496
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,155
to be completely forgotten when I'm gone,
and totally forgettable while I'm here.

497
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,750
- You?
- Not much.

498
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,990
I got an abortion.

499
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,717
When?

500
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,798
Like, right after we broke up.

501
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,559
So, OK. Give me a minute.

502
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,354
Did you...just tell me that

503
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,516
we got pregnant,

504
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,711
that you had an abortion and it was mine?

505
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,796
Ours, yeah.

506
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,919
And you didn't call me?

507
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,918
You didn't think you should at least tell me?

508
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,712
I'm telling you now.

509
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,548
Why are you telling me now
when there's nothing l can do about it?

510
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,591
Because I'm lonely.

511
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,751
Because l need somebody to talk to about this.

512
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,159
Claire, l could've been there.
I could've done something.

513
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,668
Russell, believe me, there's nothing to do.

514
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,558
- There would have been if I'd been there.
- Like what? I wasn't gonna have it.

515
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,750
I know that.

516
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,510
- I could have comforted you.
- With what, flowers?

517
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,118
Balloons?

518
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,675
- Believe me, you'd already done enough.
- Jesus.

519
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,712
- Look, I'm sorry that...
- Just give me a second.

520
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,069
OK, just...

521
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,836
Just give me a second to get used to the idea
of living with this for the rest of my life.

522
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,633
- Are you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not!

523
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,638
I'm not kidding you, Claire! It's fucking sad!

524
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,875
It's fucking sad and it's fucked up!

525
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,558
I mean, did you cry?

526
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,591
Did you?

527
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,193
I cried more than you have ever cried
in your whole life.

528
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,309
Then give me one fuckin' second
to feel bad about this, OK?

529
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,715
Just a motherfuckin' second.

530
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,231
- Is everything all right in here?
- Yes, George, we're fine. Thank you.

531
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,680
OK. Sorry.

532
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,759
Do you need me to come with you
to the crematorium?

533
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,189
No, thanks.

534
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,708
It will be good to have some time alone.

535
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,548
I could run by in the morning
and get the ashes.

536
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,716
It's on my way, Nate. It's cool.

537
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,915
No, thanks, Rico,

538
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,191
l told them Lisa's folks
have to leave first thing tomorrow.

539
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,755
They'll do it when l get there
and I'll bring her right back.

540
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,677
All right.

541
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,236
I'm really, really sorry, Nate.

542
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,711
Thanks.

543
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,273
- Well, I'm gonna go straight home.
- OK.

544
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,509
Say hi to Vanessa and the kids for me.

545
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,232
I will.

546
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,638
So I'll see you in about an hour?

547
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,671
Yeah.

548
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,438
<i>You could take a handkerchief and drape it</i>
<i>over the top and you'd be in business</i>.

549
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,077
Hey.

550
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,751
Hi.

551
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,792
- Nate's gone?
- Yeah.

552
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,236
I hope this whole thing helps him...

553
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,396
move on.

554
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,795
It probably will.

555
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,438
If l lost you, Keith, l don't know what I'd do.

556
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,157
You'd find somebody else.

557
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,235
I don't want anybody else.

558
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,035
I really don't.

559
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,832
And neither do I.

560
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,118
Then why do we...

561
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,196
- Keep fuckin' it up?
- Yeah.

562
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,357
Because we're human?

563
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,952
If there was a way to start over,

564
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,549
if there was actually a way to start over,
I'd do it, l really would.

565
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,279
But is there even really a way to start over?
Really?

566
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,390
- Just even in general?
- I don't know.

567
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:38,754
I mean, l was talking to Claire and she's trying
to see in this new way, you know, for her art.

568
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,829
I don't know how it happens.
I don't know where the new comes from.

569
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,030
The genuinely new.

570
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,836
God, l don't.

571
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,998
So stay with me. Maybe we'll find out together.

572
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,117
Things would really have
to be different though, Keith.

573
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,311
- I think so too.
- I mean it, l can't...

574
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,398
l mean,
l don't want to sit through any more therapy.

575
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,032
I don't either.

576
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:19,030
But...we have to look for ways to bring
the good things we feel about each other

577
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,993
more into the way
that we get through each day.

578
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,634
See, that sounds a little like therapy to me.

579
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,398
- Well, it's cheaper.
- Yeah.

580
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,238
And it's true, l know.

581
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,630
- Quit my job, that's the one thing l gotta do.
- You should.

582
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,797
I mean it this time.
Everybody in security is an asshole.

583
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,354
- Then quit.
- I'm gonna!

584
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,711
Jeez.

585
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,231
So did we just... What did we just do?

586
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,032
- Did we just get married?
- No!

587
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,153
- It seems kinda like we did.
- Yeah, well, don't over-think it.

588
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,591
Come here.

589
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,751
What were you just watching when l came in?

590
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,231
I have no fuckin' idea.

591
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,955
Well, put it back on, whatever it was.
Just something.

592
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,040
<i>Very, very cool. Isn't this great-looking?</i>

593
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,709
You must go through a lot of money
feeding all these cats.

595
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,230
Actually, l think it saves me money
in the long run.

596
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,431
This way l get to walk by all the homeless
people and think,

597
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,359
"You know, I'd love to help you out,
but l take care of cats."

598
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,153
You don't do that.

599
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,191
Yeah, l do.

600
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,031
That was nice, the way you dropped by.

601
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,231
No, that was selfish. I just wanted to see you.

602
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,510
Well, l appreciated it.

603
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,710
- Any time.
- Like tonight?

604
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,673
- I could be free.
- So could I.

605
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,193
Come here.

606
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,956
So what do you wanna do?

607
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,548
- I'm so sorry.
- Here you go.

608
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,797
Thanks for everything you've done for us.

609
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,639
Thank you, Nate.

610
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,551
I'm sorry things got so complicated.

611
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,517
I am too.

612
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,031
Well, things have a way of doing that, though,
don't they?

613
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,672
They do.

614
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,834
Well, bye.

615
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,837
Take care.

616
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,276
I'm glad you're in my family.

617
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,395
I'm glad you're in mine.

618
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,438
Come on, guys.

619
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,070
- Watch your step there.
- Everybody in.

620
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,991
So are you gonna go?

621
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,431
Yeah.

622
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,597
There's still some stuff to clean up
down in the basement.

623
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,756
I'll take care of it.

624
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,196
Thanks.

625
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,871
Oh, God.

626
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,549
English
