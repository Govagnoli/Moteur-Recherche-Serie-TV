1
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,721
Fuck, we're bleeding.

2
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,800
Great. Now I got brain
coming out of the wound.

3
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:57,562
Raise his head
and give him 100 grams of Mannitol.

4
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:59,559
Let's put him in burst suppression.

5
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:02,595
- What's his blood pressure?
- 117 over 72.

6
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:04,713
Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion?

7
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:08,278
- Body temperature's 34.5
- 117 over 72.

8
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,393
Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion?

9
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:14,914
Body's temperature's 34.5. We've loaded him
with Dilantin and Decadron.

10
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,316
Fuck.

11
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:21,594
Fuck. Julie, I need two Fraziers
and some aneurysm clips.

12
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,599
We've got to stop all this bleeding.

13
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,192
- I'll need Gelfoam and cottonoids.
- We got to stop this bleeding.

14
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:30,792
- This aneurysm.
- Absolutely. Gelfoam and cottonoids.

15
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:35,963
- The CT scanners will come in after surgery.
- If we make it that far.

16
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:38,233
If we make it that far.

17
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,682
That shit smells awful.

18
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:01,520
Fenugreek.

19
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,201
Fenugreek?

20
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,121
What the fuck is fenugreek?

21
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,313
Try some. It's delicious.

22
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:09,762
No, thanks.

23
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:12,715
You put a little maple syrup on it.

24
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,277
Can you hurry up?
I don't want to be late for my funeral.

25
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,799
Relax. We got plenty of time.

26
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,038
You've got nothing but time.

27
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,643
Which doesn't exist anyway, so...

28
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:40,793
You don't know what you're missing.

29
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:42,118
Damn it, David. I told you
I wanted to be cremated.

30
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,037
You can do this.

31
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,355
Cat.

32
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,875
Tac.

33
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,678
No, reverse it.

34
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:14,161
Cat.

35
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,636
Cap.

36
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,514
Almost. Cat.

37
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,475
Let's try another one.

38
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,516
Duck.

39
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,842
Fuck.

40
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,874
Close.

41
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,797
Goat.

42
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:49,318
Go...

43
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,154
Let's take a break.

44
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:03,876
Go...

45
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:14,637
She's definitely got your nose.

46
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,400
And your eyes.

47
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,083
Look at that face.

48
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:25,195
Look at this little person we created.

49
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,718
I love it when she does that.

50
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,994
When she sort of jerks
right before she falls off to sleep.

51
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,113
Wakes herself up.

52
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,280
You freaked out
the first time she ever did it.

53
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:42,033
I remember that feeling of falling
when I was little.

54
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,837
Like I was falling out of bed.
It always woke me up.

55
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,239
Like I was scared of
what I was going to fall into.

56
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,039
That never happens to me any more.

57
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,071
God.

58
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,756
We lose so much, you know?

59
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:12,552
Oh, great!

60
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:17,631
- Great. He's got the hiccups again.
- So shake him and scream in his face.

61
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:20,993
The world is a hostile, terrifying place.
He needs to learn that.

62
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:25,878
If your mom says what a gassy baby you were
and how he gets it from you, I'll scream.

63
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,075
- And I'll start farting.
- Thank God we got high before we came.

64
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:36,442
Call me crazy, buddy boy, but I don't think
it makes a damned difference who won.

65
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,156
- They're all crooks.
- How can you not care?

66
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:42,161
- That bullshit acceptance speech!
- Language.

67
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:44,558
"I was not elected to serve one party."

68
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:47,959
- The operative words being "not elected".
- Want the end piece?

69
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,312
- I don't eat red meat.
- I made you chicken.

70
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,561
Nate, if you didn't want Bush in
the White House, why did you vote for Nader?

71
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:59,313
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was, like,
severely ridiculous.

72
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:01,354
Ruth.

73
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:05,157
- Merry Christmas.
- Claire. You don't look well.

74
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:09,879
- I may be coming down with a cold.
- Let me feel your head.

75
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:12,278
- The end piece?
- It's OK. People get colds.

76
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,873
Anybody want the end piece?

77
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:17,881
- Nate?
- Sure, I'll take it.

78
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,237
Everyone save some room for dessert.

79
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,956
Mother, are you trying to sabotage my diet?

80
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,712
Of course not, Tricia. I support
your commitment to hating yourself

81
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:37,676
for not having the ass of a ten-year-old boy.

82
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:39,714
Why do you have to be so crude?

83
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:42,402
Because God is punishing you through me.

84
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,953
Fisher Funeral Chapel. Nate Fisher speaking.

85
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,394
I'm so terribly sorry. Yes, we are open today.

86
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:54,799
Any time before eleven.

87
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:58,677
I wish we could make it through
Christmas dinner without somebody dying.

88
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,759
We'll be waiting for you.

89
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:05,472
- Heart attack.
- Thank God for small favours.

90
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:08,276
Ah, shit. I've seen this one before.

91
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:13,921
That was Dr... Schrödinger.
Kitty...

92
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:17,351
didn't make it.

93
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,793
What are we watching this for?

94
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,754
Cos it's what's on.

95
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,442
Quit flapping your trap. I like this show.

96
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:30,920
So, the universe is split in two.

97
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,832
Two? Try two billion.

98
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,673
What's gonna happen to us?

99
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:43,998
There, there.

100
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,921
We always end up in a universe
in which we exist.

101
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,960
Remember Copenhagen?

102
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,521
Oh, yes.

103
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,271
The Eigenvalues in bloom.

104
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:03,522
You just keep telling yourself,
everything that can happen does.

105
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,600
- Somewhere.
- Shit. I seen this one before.

106
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:13,278
- Tell me what's going on.
- I need you to answer some questions.

107
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,995
Do you believe your consciousness affects
the behaviour of subatomic particles?

108
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:22,396
Am I alive or am I dead?

109
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:26,959
Do you believe that particles appear
in all possible places at once?

110
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:29,597
And if I am dead, is this heaven or hell?

111
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:33,318
Do you believe the universe is splitting
into billions of parallel universes?

112
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:37,481
- What the fuck do I care?
- You only get one choice. Think about this.

113
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:40,674
Just tell me. Am I dead?

114
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:42,281
Yes or no?

115
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,874
Yes.

116
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,193
And no.

117
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:55,236
Some places you're dead, some you're alive.
Some places you never existed.

118
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,638
Possibly. Theoretically.

119
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:02,279
Or who knows? This could just be
the anaesthesia talking.

120
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:05,962
Go ahead.

121
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,311
Open the box.

122
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,914
Fuck it.

123
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,352
No, I never actually flatlined. I just woke up.

124
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:44,042
Later they told me
the AVM ruptured in surgery.

125
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,721
What does that mean, ruptured?

126
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:51,119
Well, just, you know, exploded.
My head actually exploded.

127
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:53,393
I should have died or had brain damage

128
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:58,392
but I pulled through and seven months later,
nothing even shows up on an MRI.

129
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,515
Wow. You're really lucky.

130
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,280
So fucking lucky.

131
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,802
So fucking lucky.

132
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:10,118
- Right?
- Oh, that is so beautiful.

133
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:13,712
- His doesn't have the inlay.
- Where did you get this?

134
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:18,518
My boss, Carol, had to have a lot of jewellery
made for this King Arthur cable movie.

135
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:21,123
She turned us on to the guy who did it.

136
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,996
I still can't believe how fast
you two got married.

137
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:27,797
It wasn't that fast.
We've actually been together eight years.

138
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:31,040
You know, on and off.
Between here and Seattle.

139
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,280
- Well, you look really happy.
- I am really happy.

140
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,791
Good.

141
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,562
- My sister-in-law's an astrologist.
- And a drunk.

142
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:46,994
And she was telling me about this weird thing
her profession is facing.

143
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:50,035
When did astrology become a profession?

144
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,712
You know, with the whole possibility
of interplanetary travel.

145
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:55,958
This pasta salad is so good.

146
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,042
- I want to spend a weekend alone with it.
- That makes me feel weird.

147
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:05,282
Say in your chart, Mars is in Scorpio. Well,
what about when people are born on Mars?

148
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:10,351
Their Mars isn't in anything
but their earth, it's in Virgo.

149
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:15,477
- Honey, no one's listening.
- I know. I'm boring myself.

150
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,879
Oh, I made some pasta salad
without tuna in it for you.

151
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,959
No, I'm nursing. I need the protein.

152
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:23,437
Spencer! Put the kitty down.

153
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:27,641
- So the breast-feeding thing is better now?
- Yeah.

154
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,753
- I'm taking fenugreek.
- Fenugreek.

155
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,000
- Oh, I've heard of that. How?
- It's amazing.

156
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,557
Nursing was so painful for me at first.

157
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:38,959
My milk production would never
catch up with her demand.

158
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,234
Put the kitty down!

159
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,513
But now there's always enough.

160
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:47,919
The only drawback is my sweat
smells a little like maple syrup.

161
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:50,915
Thank you.

162
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:54,114
Breasts are actually
modified sweat glands.

163
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:58,361
And I hardly ever sweat. Which is maybe
why it was so painful for me at first.

164
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:02,555
I wish I got more of those elliptical ones.
They're better for your knees.

165
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:05,834
But I'm sure I wouldn't be using that one either.

166
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,481
- Todd, thanks for having us.
- Taking off so soon?

167
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,560
- I got to work tonight.
- Want a hit for the road?

168
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,033
- I'd better not.
- All right.

169
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,961
I think I know somebody
who wants to buy a motorcycle.

170
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,278
Somebody already bought it.

171
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,642
Oh, well.

172
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:26,162
Yeah.

173
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,921
All right. Thanks again.

174
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,397
- I'll see you next time.
- All right. Later.

175
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:42,203
- It was fun.
- Yeah, I like them.

176
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,598
She's nice. He's a little weird.

177
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,520
The food was good.

178
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:49,282
Nate, we totally grabbed the wrong bag.

179
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,915
Oh, shit.

180
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,874
- All right. Be right back.
- Keys.

181
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:57,119
I feel... judged.

182
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:01,752
I feel criticised.

183
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:06,599
I feel like nothing I do is good enough.

184
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,798
I feel ashamed of who I am,

185
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,357
like I'll never be the person
you want me to be.

186
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,598
I don't want you to be anyone except you.

187
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,602
Keith, now is about you listening.

188
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,520
You'll get your chance in a moment.

189
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:25,554
Yeah, OK.

190
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,482
I feel like I'm living in a minefield.

191
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:36,072
Sometimes. Your anger is
so random and arbitrary.

192
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:41,117
Let's try to avoid making judgments
about Keith's behaviour right now

193
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:44,599
and really stay focused on what you feel.

194
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm afraid of pissing you off, so...

195
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,472
I'm constantly editing myself.

196
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:03,322
I guess I'm confused.
I don't even know who I am any more.

197
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,475
I'm done.

198
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:15,832
Now, Keith. What did you hear?

199
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,714
A lot of whining.

200
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:22,078
Perhaps you have some feelings of your own
you'd like to share?

201
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:26,594
Yeah. I hate my job. I feel like a fucking loser
driving around in a Home Alert uniform

202
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,952
answering alarms set off by poodles

203
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:32,757
and sucking up to rich assholes who make
more in a day than I make in a year.

204
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:37,274
I ought to be able to blow off steam when
I come home without you taking it personally

205
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,757
because it's very rarely about you.

206
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:43,079
- David?
- I don't think that's fair.

207
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:46,081
You don't want me to have any feelings.

208
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:49,274
No, I'd just like to have fun
now and then like we used to.

209
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:52,315
- We don't have fun?
- Rarely.

210
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:54,960
Rarely?

211
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,994
On occasion.

212
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,881
How's your sex life?

213
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,040
It's kind of great.

214
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,914
Yeah, that part works.

215
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:14,515
So it seems engaging passionately
is comfortable in that arena

216
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:16,793
but not so in other areas.

217
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:20,313
What other things do the two of you
like to do together?

218
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,842
We go to movies sometimes.
We go to dinner.

219
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:27,839
We used to play racket ball.

220
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:32,274
He was so much better than me it was a joke.
I wasn't challenging enough.

221
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:34,883
- I never said that.
- It made me feel inadequate.

222
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,716
What kinds of things do you do on your own?

223
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:42,073
- Besides work, work out.
- Yeah.

224
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:45,035
My job kind of keeps me from doing much else.

225
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,472
Friends?

226
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,633
Most of my friends are cops.

227
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,196
But I don't see 'em any more
since I left the force.

228
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,918
- David never really had any close friends.
- That's not true.

229
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:07,395
There's a group of independent funeral
directors I get together with every month.

230
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,911
You hate those guys.

231
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,514
We're out of time.

232
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,958
This week, should any conflicts arise,

233
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:22,722
try to focus on expressing what you're feeling

234
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,960
instead of criticising and blaming, OK?

235
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:32,634
Change.

236
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:04,040
Good, Russell.

237
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,392
Change.

238
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:24,713
Fuck, it's almost five.
Rico's gonna have my head.

239
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:27,357
- Mom.
- Hello.

240
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,439
How is my precious girl doing today?

241
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,758
She has the hiccups again.

242
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:36,194
She gets that from her daddy.
He was a very gassy baby. Yes, he was.

243
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:38,438
I'll get her some gripe water.

244
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:41,600
- Do you burp her often when she's nursing?
- Of course.

245
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:45,594
What's wrong with you?

246
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:49,715
Uh, I don't know. I think I just had
the weirdest deja vu.

247
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,355
Hello!

248
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:56,959
Every time I pop by, there are more people
here. Hi. I'm Carol Ward, Lisa's boss.

249
00:20:57,003 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm Ruth Fisher, Nate's mother.
We've met several times.

250
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,155
You're not living here now too, are you?

251
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,398
I'm kidding. Calm down.

252
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:08,879
- I hate to keep harping on this.
- I parked in the driveway again.

253
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:11,483
- There are two cars today.
- Sorry, I didn't know.

254
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:15,357
Oh, please, it's no biggie.
I'm sure you didn't know.

255
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:17,997
- What's your excuse?
- I was just dropping off...

256
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,797
I could get a sign made.
"Nate, back it up. Put it on the street."

257
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:27,034
- I'm kidding.
- If you want, I'll move it right now.

258
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,677
Don't be silly. Whenever. Doesn't matter.

259
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,078
Sooner rather than later.

260
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,877
Lisa, I'm having dinner with Penny Marshall
tonight so I want you to cook.

261
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:38,481
OK.

262
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:44,234
But I'm hosting an impromptu gathering
tomorrow. I'm trying a new pitch on friends.

263
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,035
Shouldn't be more than...

264
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,233
30.

265
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:50,922
- OK.
- You have time to go over a menu with me?

266
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:53,523
- Now?
- Yes!

267
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:58,398
- Take your time, dear. I've got all afternoon.
- Nice to meet you, Nate's mother!

268
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,115
She's energetic.

269
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:02,199
She's a lunatic.

270
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,551
- Hey, Rico.
- Nate, hey.

271
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,434
- How's it going?
- Good.

272
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:12,795
Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.
Listen, I don't know if you're aware of this,

273
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:15,562
or if you even care,
but we have two viewings tonight.

274
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:18,436
- 6... 30, and one at eight.
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

275
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:22,840
Good. Because your brother
is nowhere to be found.

276
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,192
And he's not answering his cellphone.

277
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,041
- And there's only so much I can do.
- Sure.

278
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,233
I can't be in two places at the same time.

279
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:34,242
I get it, Rico, OK? Lay off the lecturing.
I'm not your kid.

280
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,275
I'm not your employee, I'm your partner.

281
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:41,032
I am a licensed funeral director now. OK?

282
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:46,956
You guys took my money, you made me
a partner, it's time you treated me like one.

283
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:48,755
Goodbye.

284
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:03,595
So, Claire, how's art school?

285
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,996
It's OK.

286
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:07,477
What kind of stuff are you doing?

287
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:12,517
Well, yesterday, we had to draw
this naked guy in, like, 30 seconds.

288
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:17,193
- Well, that sounds fun.
- Not really. It's hard.

289
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:20,952
And, like, I don't even wanna be
an illustrator or painter or whatever.

290
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:24,439
But they say we need to know
how to do everything, like Picasso.

291
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:28,954
- It's intense.
- But you get to be creative every day.

292
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:30,516
Good morning.

293
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,155
- Hey!
- Hello, pumpkin.

294
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,798
- How's it going?
- It could not be going any better.

295
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,879
Would you look at this little girl?

296
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,914
Is that the face of God or what?

297
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:42,079
There's stuff coming out of God's nose.

298
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:45,195
Who's precious, is it you? Yes, it is.

299
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:48,121
Can you help with her today?
Lisa's got to help Carol.

300
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:50,916
Carol's having this big Hollywood
ass-lick dinner.

301
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,954
Of course.

302
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:57,193
You guys, she took
the most amazing poop this morning.

303
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,676
Who, Lisa?

304
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:04,597
Seriously. It was just so perfectly formed,
so healthy and compact.

305
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,998
It was like an adult poop.
It made me so happy.

306
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:11,082
When you live with a baby you see
the world as being totally new all over again.

307
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:14,911
They're just so pure and uncorrupted.
It's a fucking privilege.

308
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,761
How come neither of you's been over
to visit recently?

309
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:22,081
Because being a father has turned you
into a dithering idiot.

310
00:24:23,843 --> 00:24:28,553
Wow. You're so tough and cool
and above it all. I wish I was you.

311
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:30,833
Does anybody want the end piece?

312
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:38,872
Oh, Nate. Can you drop Mrs Folger
at the crematory this afternoon?

313
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:41,562
No. I've got the Polp funeral.

314
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:46,154
- Yeah, well, I've got the Bennett funeral.
- Can't Rico do it?

315
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:51,835
His exact words were, "No fucking way,
I'm not your fucking gofer any more."

316
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:53,874
Claire, can you give us a hand?

317
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,160
Sorry, I have homework.

318
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,560
Pay you 50 bucks.

319
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,879
You'd pay a delivery service more than that.

320
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:09,396
All right.

321
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:13,800
- As long as I don't have to touch dead skin.
- She's all boxed up.

322
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:18,200
I can't do it till around four, cos I have
to practise drawing a perfect circle.

323
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,562
That takes seven hours?

324
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:24,631
I have to be able to do it on command in class
tomorrow. It's not as easy as it sounds.

325
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:26,712
Is that the box that needs
to go to the crematory?

326
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,162
The...?

327
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,753
Yeah.

328
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:33,794
Well, I can take it now.

329
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:40,800
- You're taking it?
- Yeah.

330
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:44,199
They hired me to do runs
since nobody else wants to do it.

331
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:48,282
- Really?
- Yeah, for 50 bucks a shot.

332
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:53,074
But you're gonna need to help me
get that into my car.

333
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:01,318
So what kind of music do you guys play?

334
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:04,673
It's kind of like early Peter Gabriel meets Tool.

335
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:09,522
Emotionally vulnerable
like Sunny Day Real Estate

336
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:14,159
but politically conscious, like Public Enemy.

337
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:17,838
We're still working on it.

338
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,681
When you guys play, let me know. I'll come.

339
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,237
Why don't you hang out, while we practise?

340
00:27:24,123 --> 00:27:26,079
I don't think I can.

341
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,918
I've got this thing, I'm supposed to...

342
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,273
OK.

343
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,632
- I'm Phil.
- I'm Claire.

344
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,200
- You want a beer?
- Sure.

345
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:51,313
You really amaze me, Lisa.

346
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:55,759
- Why?
- Your energy. It's boundless.

347
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:59,876
You should be bottled as an alternative
energy source. You'd save the world.

348
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:06,633
Well, that's kind of funny
because... I feel tired all the time.

349
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:12,756
- Really?
- Yeah. I think it comes with being a mom.

350
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:17,274
- Yeah.
- Not that I'm complaining.

351
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:22,319
I mean, Maya's totally transformed my life.

352
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:26,515
I can't even imagine going back
to the way things were before.

353
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:30,112
- Wow.
- So what if I have to work extra hard?

354
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,801
I want to.

355
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,795
It's worth it. It is so worth it.

356
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,040
Carol?

357
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,392
Don't pay any attention to me.

358
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:57,358
I'm just nervous. Nervous about
this meeting next week.

359
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,715
I have to pitch to McG in person.
Whoa, is he intimidating.

360
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:10,721
Can I make you some camomile tea?

361
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:14,358
For Christ's sake, I'm not your grandmother.
I'm your boss.

362
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,432
Stop looking at me, Lisa.

363
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:36,561
Carol, I'm always here for you.

364
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,318
Also, I swim laps in the morning.

365
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,151
I used to be able to do that naked.
Which was a great way to start the day.

366
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:47,478
Like I was Artemis.

367
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:52,358
I went out feeling like a warrior, a huntress,
which is what you have to do in my business.

368
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:55,998
Now I can't do that any more
because there's a man here.

369
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:00,233
- I'm sure Nate wouldn't mind.
- I would.

370
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:06,553
I don't appreciate the hostility he shows
by parking in the driveway.

371
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:09,913
I'm sorry. I will talk to him about it.

372
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,278
I'm going to swim some laps.

373
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,517
- Are you ready for the pak-choi?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:31,872
- What are you doing?
- Adding pepper.

375
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:33,800
I already added pepper.

376
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:41,835
OK, I feel shamed.

377
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:45,034
- What?
- When you said, "I already added pepper."

378
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,962
My perception was that you were irritated
with me for not knowing that

379
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:52,632
and that you were angry with me,
that I shouldn't have done it.

380
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,560
Why would I be angry with you?

381
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,073
Maybe you don't want me to be involved
in the cooking process.

382
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,081
Maybe you just want me to prepare
the ingredients,

383
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:04,638
maybe you want total control over
what happens in the wok.

384
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:08,153
So we have a little extra pepper in the wok -
it's not a big deal.

385
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,680
I know it's not a big deal.

386
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,999
OK. I heard what you said.

387
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:21,993
It was not my intention to shame you.

388
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:26,198
I know.

389
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:29,076
Good. I love you. Are the carrots ready?

390
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:39,396
I grew up in a family where people
express their anger on a regular basis.

391
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,638
So that's what intimacy feels like to me.

392
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:45,475
You grew up in a family
where no one expressed anything.

393
00:31:45,523 --> 00:31:48,037
We also never hit each other.

394
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:51,359
So whenever I'm slightly irritated,
it scares you?

395
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:53,874
Right.

396
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,357
It just means I'm comfortable with you.

397
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:04,359
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

398
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:13,237
Did you pick up the dry-cleaning today?

399
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,080
Yeah, it's in the closet.

400
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:50,361
There. Isn't that delicious?

401
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:54,399
Your daddy used to love peanut butter too.
Yes, he did.

402
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,240
So did your uncle David.

403
00:32:56,283 --> 00:33:00,435
Not your aunt Claire.
She absolutely hated it, always did.

404
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:02,474
Still does.

405
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,352
Isn't it funny?

406
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:08,758
They were all little babies once too.

407
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:12,239
But their daddy's mommy
never liked spending time with them

408
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,922
the way I like spending time with you.

409
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:19,593
She never really liked me,
and she never liked my children.

410
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:22,715
She was convinced I'd gotten pregnant
on purpose

411
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:25,323
to trap Nathaniel into marrying me.

412
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:30,153
Which wasn't true at all. I certainly never
intended for that to happen.

413
00:33:30,203 --> 00:33:32,512
Especially when I was so young.

414
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:38,956
I was terrified when your daddy was born.
Absolutely terrified.

415
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,240
Hey, Mom.

416
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:54,116
- Goodness, you startled me.
- She give you any trouble?

417
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:56,233
Heavens, no. She's an angel.

418
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,114
Are you ready to go home, angel?

419
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,279
I made you a chicken breast.

420
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:03,042
No, thanks, I got to be getting home.

421
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,758
But... put it in the fridge. I'll eat it tomorrow.

422
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:10,398
If you and Lisa want a night off,
I'd be happy to watch her.

423
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:14,277
You could go out to eat, see a movie.
I could keep her here overnight.

424
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:18,953
Thanks, but Lisa's working tonight and
Maya hasn't slept outside the family bed yet.

425
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:22,962
Well, maybe it might be better for her
to try a night sleeping on her own.

426
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:26,118
Mom, we know how you feel about it.

427
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,756
You're very clear on that.
We feel differently.

428
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:34,831
She's almost nine months old. She's going
to have to leave the family bed sometime.

429
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,316
Maya will let us know when she's ready
to leave, all right? Good night.

430
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:46,518
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.

431
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,315
Are we having sex?

432
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:08,078
OK.

433
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:10,591
Just let me take a shower first.

434
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,562
Morning.

435
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,880
What time is it?

436
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,039
A little before ten, I think.

437
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:51,599
How do you take it?

438
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,998
Black.

439
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,398
So what do you have to do today?

440
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:12,081
Class.

441
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:15,274
- What kind of class?
- Drawing class.

442
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:19,799
We're learning how to draw a perfect circle.

443
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:23,074
- That sounds cool.
- It's not. It's stupid and tedious.

444
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:24,272
And pointless.

445
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:30,193
I went to art school to be expressive, not
to perform some pointless task like a lab rat.

446
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,632
You want to play hooky?

447
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:39,674
Yes.

448
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:45,880
Nate, I need you to do me a big favour
and cover the Folger funeral today.

449
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:49,757
- Who's Frank Muehler?
- Frank who?

450
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:53,000
Muehler. He's in the date book
every Wednesday at two.

451
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,638
I have no idea.
Must be somebody Rico put in there.

452
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:02,079
There's a phone number.
I'm gonna call and find out.

453
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:04,000
All right, no.

454
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,474
Keith and I are in couples counselling.

455
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:12,196
- Really?
- It's not that big a deal.

456
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:14,598
- Are you guys OK?
- Of course we're OK.

457
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:19,194
We're just seeking the advice of a professional
to help us to establish boundaries

458
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:22,713
and write the rules of our relationship together.

459
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:26,199
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

460
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:28,916
Keith has anger issues
he inherited from his father

461
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:32,353
and I have a lot of doormat issues
I inherited from Mom.

462
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:37,193
- Can we never talk about this again?
- Sure. You're OK though?

463
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:40,633
- Can we never talk about this again?
- Got it.

464
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:57,834
And how are you and Lisa?

465
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:03,398
We're great.

466
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:06,037
It's still a little bizarre to me.

467
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:10,956
All the possible ways my life could have gone.

468
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:19,641
I mean, it's just about a year ago
I got engaged.

469
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:21,639
You remember that?

470
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,913
I thought I loved Brenda.

471
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:30,197
Maybe I thought I could make it work
just out of sheer will.

472
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:35,712
But... you just never know.

473
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:41,511
You have no fucking idea
what life has in store for you.

474
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:52,559
So can you cover
the Folger funeral for me or not?

475
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,754
Are you sure you're all right?

476
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:58,192
I'm fine.

477
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:03,512
I've got an audition for the Gay Men's Chorus
of Los Angeles.

478
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:07,231
- What?
- That sounds fun.

479
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:11,879
I'm trying to create something for myself
outside of my job and my relationship.

480
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:15,715
- I could use your support.
- All right. Don't worry.

481
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:19,233
The Folger thing's a walk in the park.
You just knock 'em dead.

482
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,513
No pun intended.

483
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:25,238
- I'm so nervous.
- David, you'll be great.

484
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:27,478
From your mouth to God's ears.

485
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:29,514
All right.

486
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:32,832
- Thanks, Nate.
- Any time.

487
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,439
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Lisa.

488
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:01,520
- Hello.
- Ruth, did you give Maya peanut butter?

489
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:03,838
Yes, and she loved it. Nate...

490
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:07,478
You never give babies peanut butter
under the age of one.

491
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:11,038
They can develop horrible allergies.
Didn't you know that?

492
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,961
No, I didn't. Is she all right?

493
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:17,962
Yes, but that's not the point.
You should never give her peanut butter.

494
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:21,279
Or honey, or strawberries, or egg whites.

495
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:23,359
- Please.
- Of course.

496
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:28,319
- I'm sorry to be so abrupt with you.
- No, I'm sorry.

497
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,081
I had no idea.

498
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:34,162
Peanut butter was never a problem
when my children were young.

499
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,115
- Are you sure she's all right?
- She's fine.

500
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:41,912
Do you need any help with her today?
I could come over.

501
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:45,080
Ruth, no. You spend so much time over here.
I feel bad.

502
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:49,036
- It's no problem, I like...
- Seriously, take some time to yourself.

503
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:54,111
I hardly saw Maya at all yesterday.
I really just wanted it to be the two of us today.

504
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,478
- OK.
- But thanks. I'll talk to you later.

505
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:22,480
Thank God. It's very frightening.

506
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,195
I didn't know who to call.

507
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,552
Ma'am, calm down
and tell me what happened.

508
00:42:26,603 --> 00:42:28,514
Come. I'll show you.

509
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:05,880
It's weird when you find stuff like that out
later in life.

510
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:10,280
I mean, I had no idea that I wasn't planned.

511
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:14,436
I'm not sure what difference it makes.

512
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:18,317
I mean, Maya wasn't planned
and we couldn't love her any more.

513
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:25,039
It's just...

514
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:29,122
I don't know.

515
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:32,594
What?

516
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,478
I don't like knowing
that my whole existence is an accident.

517
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:42,201
It's just too fucking... random.

518
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:46,401
Yeah, but that's the way it happened.

519
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,197
Things happen the way they're meant to, Nate.

520
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:55,920
See, that's a kind of fatalism
that I just don't buy.

521
00:44:56,923 --> 00:45:01,314
Well, what's the alternative?

522
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:10,479
We make choices.

523
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:16,075
But maybe your parents never would have
chosen to get married if you hadn't happened.

524
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:20,514
And then not only would you not exist,
but Claire and David wouldn't either.

525
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:23,123
It's just not what was meant to happen.

526
00:45:24,323 --> 00:45:28,521
But surely we're more
than just things that happen?

527
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:30,997
Maybe we are, maybe we're not.

528
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:38,277
I love it when she does that.

529
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:40,359
When she sort of jerks.

530
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:43,520
Right before she falls off to sleep.

531
00:45:43,563 --> 00:45:45,554
Wakes herself up.

532
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:50,793
You freaked out
the first time she ever did it.

533
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:55,432
I remember that feeling of falling
when I was little.

534
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:59,635
Like I was falling out of bed.
It always woke me up.

535
00:45:59,683 --> 00:46:03,596
- Like I was scared of what...
- You were going to fall into?

536
00:46:03,643 --> 00:46:05,634
Yeah.

537
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:08,958
It never happens to me any more.

538
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,917
Don't be so sure of that.

539
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:18,317
What's going on with you?

540
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:21,116
- I think I dreamed this.
- What?

541
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:25,875
This moment.

542
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:30,682
Just this. This life we have together.
You and me, Maya.

543
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,391
Here.

544
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,721
Now.
