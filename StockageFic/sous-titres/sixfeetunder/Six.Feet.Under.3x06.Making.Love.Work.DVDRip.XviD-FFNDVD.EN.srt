1
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,889
OK, ten o'clock audience, listen up.

2
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:55,848
Please have your questions ready for Dr Dave
on your yellow question card.

3
00:01:55,893 --> 00:02:01,650
You must have your question card filled out
before you enter the studio. Thank you.

4
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:04,803
What's yours say, Karen?

5
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:07,845
How can I stop feeling competitive
with my mother-in-law?

6
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:11,329
I've heard that one before.
Try to make it more specific.

7
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:16,288
How can I stop feeling competitive with
my chain-smoking bitch of a mother-in-law?

8
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,724
I do not have any pens. If you need a pen,
please ask someone near you.

9
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,492
- Read yours.
- Oh, OK.

10
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,843
I feel I should be happy
because I have everything,

11
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:31,171
but I'm not happy and that makes me feel guilty
and then I hate myself.

12
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,852
(Both) Aw.

13
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,965
I wanna write, "I love you, Dr Dave."

14
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,323
Is that crazy?
Do you think he'll get mad at me?

15
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:43,251
- Is he married?
- Karen asked if he was married.

16
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,966
You live in a hole? Of course he's married.

17
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,527
And he's sensitive and loving with the kids

18
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:52,771
and he wants to make love only when you do
and he never ever passes gas.

19
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,008
You're mad!

20
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:58,523
We will be opening the studio
in approximately one minute.

21
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:03,124
- Jesus, it's time.
- Please have your bags ready to be inspected.

22
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,245
- Do you have a Kleenex?
- I think I do.

23
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,811
- I might need another Kleenex.
- Don't get it on your suit.

24
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:17,287
Go through the metal detector.

25
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,530
- We're going.
- The studio is now open.

26
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:24,282
- The studio's opening.
- It's just been so dry, you know.

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,688
And the wind's just... Oh, dear.

28
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,851
- Here, keep the pack. Should I call someone?
- Keep moving, people.

29
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,646
You go on. This will stop.
Save me a seat up close.

30
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,729
- OK.
- Do you want my cellphone?

31
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,333
You'll miss the best seats.

32
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,730
Wow.

33
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:44,492
Ma'am? Are you...

34
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,168
We got a situation here.

35
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:06,531
(Music playing in background, indistinct)

36
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,568
What you got?

37
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,968
The coroner said she died from a nose bleed.

38
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:16,289
That's whacked, losing that much blood
through your nose.

39
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,324
Not as uncommon as you might think.

40
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:21,888
Your dad and I had a couple of these
back in the day.

41
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:26,245
She was probably born with a deviated septum
and at some point they fixed it.

42
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,762
Yeah, and they gave her a cute little nose
while they were at it.

43
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,043
That could be a nose job.

44
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,891
Sometimes plastic surgery
creates this scar tissue

45
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:41,404
which can end up choking a major artery
until it just explodes one day.

46
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,887
Jesus, we're all just walking time bombs.

47
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,924
You can pop her in the reefer for now.

48
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,522
My large friend's gonna need both tables
till we can casket him.

49
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,451
Hey, that Triple X come in from Appleby yet?

50
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,485
- Er... no.
- Shit.

51
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:59,651
Let me know where you'll be in a couple
of hours. It'll take a few of us to move him.

52
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,890
I can't. I'm going away for a couple of days.

53
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,208
Oh, yeah? Where to?

54
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,448
Camping. Finally.

55
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,882
In Seattle I used to go every other weekend.

56
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:14,245
There's nothing I love more than getting away
with my tent where there's nobody.

57
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,205
- Sounds nice.
- Yeah.

58
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:21,690
Well, Lisa decided she wanted to come
and bring Maya, so we're all going.

59
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,930
Plus some friends of ours and their kid.

60
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,043
You and Vanessa ought to get away.

61
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,768
Yeah, well, every weekend
since Vanessa's mom died

62
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:33,850
we're at her house cleaning out her stuff.

63
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:37,806
- How's Vanessa holding up?
- Misses her mom, I guess.

64
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:41,892
Doesn't talk about it a whole lot.
What's to say, really?

65
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,164
Oh, dammit.
Where the hell did my new mousse go?

66
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,048
We're gonna have so much fun, baby girl.

67
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:54,563
The skies aren't smoggy there,
so you get to see real stars.

68
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,366
Not the fuzzy invisible LA stars.

69
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:00,762
And you get to play with Spencer,

70
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:03,247
smell your first campfire.

71
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:08,287
Shall we bring your baby Deadhead onesie,
or is that too obvious?

72
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,449
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

73
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,290
Hey. How you doing?

74
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,842
Right. Listen to this.

75
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:25,041
- Hikes near Hungry Valley. Difficult.
- Do we need more than one spatula?

76
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,210
Catch the intense scenery
from atop Suicide Rock,

77
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:33,373
which received its name when
a Native American princess threw herself off it.

78
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:36,246
- We gotta see this.
- Bring the book just in case.

79
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,843
- Did you check my tent bag for the stakes?
- We rented a tent cabin.

80
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,805
I know. Just in case
we wanna sleep out one night.

81
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:48,845
With Maya? You can't sleep
on the hard ground with a baby.

82
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,168
You can.
This is how everyone used to live.

83
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,249
We're in the land of the Chumash.

84
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,807
You think Native Americans had tent cabins?

85
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,845
They didn't have clip bars
and we're bringing those.

86
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:01,009
Let's see
what Todd and Dana wanna do.

87
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,648
We're sharing a cabin,
not doing everything with them.

88
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,446
- If we could afford our own...
- How does that apply?

89
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,361
Never mind.

90
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,048
I'm just glad we finally have couple friends.

91
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,845
- You're shitting me.
- What?

92
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,125
Deer Springs Trail starts where we're staying
and heads straight to Suicide Rock.

93
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,246
- Let me pack your books.
- Do you mind if I look at them?

94
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,761
- Bless you, Arthur.
- Thank you.

95
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,403
Isn't that wonderful?

96
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:42,172
- What's that?
- The handkerchief.

97
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,807
Such a lovely custom.

98
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,242
Shame it's fallen by the wayside.

99
00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:00,172
- Oh, darn it all.
- What's wrong?

100
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,808
Silent Running was playing over the weekend.
I missed it.

101
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:07,289
- I don't believe I know Silent Running.
- Phenomenal film.

102
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,052
Science fiction,
but overlooked in the genre.

103
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,082
Ah.

104
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:15,729
It's about a botanist
who's marooned on a space freighter.

105
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:20,563
His only companions are three little robots
that look like TV sets.

106
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,411
He names them Huey, Dewey and Louie.

107
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,365
- They play poker with him.
- They sound adorable.

108
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,847
Oh, they are.

109
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,963
Quite lovable indeed.

110
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,891
And yet benign.

111
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,365
Obedient.

112
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,608
Much like television itself.

113
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:42,487
Perhaps the writer's comment
on how technology can be controlled

114
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,605
and used effectively for humankind.

115
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,644
Perhaps not.

116
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,764
Starring Bruce Dern.

117
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:55,125
- With music by Joan Baez.
- I used to love listening to her.

118
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,082
Ah, well, I'll see it another time.

119
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:09,765
- You need more coffee?
- No, I just filled it.

120
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,122
Of course you did.

121
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,045
(Russell) This is gonna look
hot, hot, hot, baby.

122
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,402
(Claire) I did blue hair in eighth grade.

123
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,763
That was sincere blue hair.
This is a comment on blue hair.

124
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:31,091
Maybe it was more magenta.
Maybe this is my first blue hair.

125
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,124
- Tinfoil thingy?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:41,689
You're taking it from the same place
as the other side so it's even?

127
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:44,725
If it's too even
it looks like you're trying too hard.

128
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,845
If it's haphazard, it's more like "fuck you".

129
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,726
Just not too uneven.

130
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,812
Oh, good. The "enter without knocking" sign
is clearly legible.

131
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:01,051
I'm only here because Rico said
you took some of my brushes without asking.

132
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,608
- Russell, this is my brother David.
- Hi.

133
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:06,405
Hey.

134
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,523
I'm sorry, I'm blue.

135
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:13,082
I understand.
I work with dangerous chemicals myself.

136
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,888
Claire, we use this brush
to spread Velvetone on people's faces.

137
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:26,169
Sorry. I should have told you you were using
something with dead people on it.

138
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,204
I ain't scared of no dead people.

139
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:33,202
- Anyway, it's your hair.
- My hair was raised with dead people.

140
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:36,165
All right, well, we're done.

141
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,521
We got 15 minutes.

142
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,207
Oh.

143
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:46,007
- This is great.
- Liar. It sucks.

144
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:50,251
- It doesn't suck at all.
- First, you're crazy. It's totally perfect.

145
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,649
Second, all Olivier says is,
"Look at Russell's work, people.

146
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,412
"Russell's work is pulsating.
It's making me hard."

147
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,569
- (Russell laughs)
- Your teacher says that?

148
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,683
(Claire) Yeah, but it's not like harassment.

149
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:03,486
It's more like a comment on harassment.

150
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:08,090
Well, I'm going downstairs.
Nice to meet you, Russell.

151
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,204
When do we rinse?

152
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:15,882
Oh, ass. I forgot what time we started.

153
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,288
Oh, ass.

154
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,962
- Doesn't smell too bad in here.
- Yeah.

155
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:34,481
Maybe we can push a couple of beds together.

156
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,603
But Maya might fall through the middle.

157
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:39,292
Maybe we can push a bed against the wall.

158
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:46,284
- Just one six-pack?
- We won't be drinking the whole time.

159
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,643
Of course not, but Todd likes his beer
and I like to have a few.

160
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,490
Sure, but he doesn't drink-drink.

161
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:57,448
I know, but between him and me
we'll go through a six-pack tonight, minimum.

162
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:00,132
Isn't that the point of sitting round a campfire?

163
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:04,086
- You told me to bring my weed.
- If you have weed, why do you need beer?

164
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,611
(Sighs)

165
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:09,292
Maybe because I like
to unwind and kick back

166
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,211
and forget that I spend my days
surrounded by death.

167
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,484
All I really care about
is that you don't smoke cigarettes.

168
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,172
Not out here where the air's so pretty.

169
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,727
I already pretend
I don't know you smoke at home.

170
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,449
- I appreciate your pretending.
- Not here. I hate the smell on your clothes.

171
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:26,812
Heel.

172
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:28,923
- Hey!
- Hey!

173
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,964
- How you doing, Spencer?
- Hey.

174
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:33,527
- All right!
- Hey.

175
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,245
- Hey.
- How you doing?

176
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:36,851
- How are you?
- Good.

177
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:39,965
- How you doing?
- How are you?

178
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,732
Help me with the cooler.
We brought a ton of beer.

179
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:45,003
Sure. Absolutely.

180
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,722
So which bed do you want?

181
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:54,891
- What's your preference?
- One that doesn't have scorpions in it.

182
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,527
I was thinking
we could check out Suicide Rock.

183
00:12:57,573 --> 00:13:01,486
What a great fucking hike.
I was up there last winter by myself.

184
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,252
- I don't see it happening this trip.
- Why not?

185
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,090
Not with the kids.

186
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,728
- Just you and I can go up.
- Dana wouldn't be into me taking off.

187
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:13,482
- We should go up there another time.
- (Sighs)

188
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,524
Come on.

189
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:19,532
We're here now, dude.
I'm sure we can get a couple of hours.

190
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:23,248
How long you two been married, brother?

191
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,924
(Arthur) Come in.

192
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:35,362
- Please... please enter.
- Oh, I don't need to come in.

193
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,883
I wanted to tell you
that I was running errands at the mall.

194
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,686
You know, the new mall
that's just opened.

195
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,521
A mini-mall but with underground parking.
What do they call those?

196
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,007
I pulled in to see what they had done with it

197
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,648
and lo and behold they had a video store and...

198
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,684
I got Silent Running.

199
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,247
(Ruth giggles)

200
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,727
'Now, Huey, you're gonna plant a tree.

201
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,492
'Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.

202
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,967
'We're gonna do it right here.

203
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,924
'Side of the hill. '

204
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,168
He has to teach them everything.

205
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,248
UU. It stands for Unitarian Universalist.

206
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,728
But it's about as not religious
as a religion can be.

207
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,764
That would be nice.

208
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:24,726
Not a place that preaches
but one where we can be with people like us.

209
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:29,563
No big God. No crosses
or dripping blood or shit. Exactly.

210
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,047
Just people getting together.

211
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,730
Anyone wanna catch a buzz?
Shall I go get my bullet?

212
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:40,604
- Sure.
- Yeah, go ahead.

213
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,644
All right.

214
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,968
How often does Jesus come up?

215
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:49,647
Pretty rarely, but when he does
they remind us that he was black.

216
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:53,891
Right. As opposed to the Brad Pitt Jesus
America tries to sell us.

217
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,401
Jesus wasn't black.

218
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,411
Yes, he was. Everyone was black.

219
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,564
No, thanks.

220
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:19,730
Uh, well, I'm not gonna have any
if you're not going to.

221
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,764
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,766
If you're not gonna have any,
I guess I'll pass too.

223
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:28,771
Great. Now I'm the only one who's stoned.

224
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:39,731
'! Doomed

225
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:44,051
'! In his innocence

226
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:48,052
'! In the sun

227
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,323
'! Gather your children...! '

228
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,411
'Come on, fuck me hard. Do it. '

229
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:10,092
I've got to get the dishwasher running.

230
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,603
- Do you have anything?
- My glass.

231
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:28,083
- It's so great to be out of the city.
- I know.

232
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:31,170
Wouldn't it be cool to have to live off the land?

233
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:34,649
To be a part of nature
instead of just looking at it?

234
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,172
Not that cool.

235
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:43,047
I'm getting
my "I need my Starbucks" headache.

236
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:50,605
I guess in the past
I dated a lot of crazy girls.

237
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:53,850
- Needy attention-suckers.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:58,091
Artists/writers/psychos.
Always this whole drama thing.

239
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,772
If I say something
she might take it the wrong way.

240
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,203
It's like I'm walking
through this minefield of her childhood.

241
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:07,723
There should be a sign.
"Caution, unexploded daddy issues."

242
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:11,766
- I've been there.
- But Lisa's different, you know.

243
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,692
All that bullshit fairy-tale stuff
isn't real anyway.

244
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,611
Working through it, wanting to.

245
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,931
It's probably the first adult relationship
of my life.

246
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:27,489
Ours is more like
we can't keep our hands off each other.

247
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,888
She just loves to bang.

248
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:37,052
Sometimes I feel, when we're having sex,
he secretly hates me.

249
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,812
That's not possible.

250
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:43,050
Not conscious,
not like he knows it on any level.

251
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:46,085
I know it's stupid
but I really feel like that sometimes.

252
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:50,445
It is stupid, because you're a beautiful woman
and the mother of his child,

253
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,609
so why would he hate you?

254
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:58,046
I know it's crazy, but sometimes it's like
there's this unspoken thing between us.

255
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,926
- Unspoken what?
- I don't know.

256
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:05,967
Yeah, I'm the mother of his child
so he has to Madonna-fy me.

257
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:10,609
Maybe I'm just mad at the whole world
because my orgasm thing is screwed up.

258
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:14,362
- Since you had Maya.
- You've heard of this?

259
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,563
Something is different. It freaks me out.

260
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:20,447
It took me a couple of months to be able
to come after Spencer was born.

261
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:24,406
I can come, but only half the time
and half as intense.

262
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:28,731
- Could childbirth have reorganised me?
- I've heard that.

263
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,764
But I'm sure it'll get better.

264
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:37,252
Do you just say, "It's not happening tonight
so you're on break, hon"?

265
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:39,727
No.

266
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:43,527
- Please don't tell me that you fake it.
- Of course not.

267
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,086
OK, maybe I do exaggerate here and there.

268
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:58,088
Realising everything has happened in my life
so I could be ready for this.

269
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,361
Mm-hm.

270
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:03,292
It's like your heart is outside your body.
You see it for the first time.

271
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,929
And knowing that all of it...
it's always been about her.

272
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:11,966
Yes. God, yes. I feel
the exact same way about Maya.

273
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,003
No, I was talking about Dana.

274
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,844
Right.

275
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:27,001
I don't know. Our thing, it's incredibly hot still.

276
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:30,329
He's got the dirtiest mouth. I love it.

277
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,046
Like what?

278
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,288
The dirty talk, what does he say?

279
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,690
- Children in the vicinity.
- So whisper. Just tell me one.

280
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:43,248
They sound so stupid out of context.

281
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:46,888
OK, like, "Oh, baby,
I wanna come on your tits."

282
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:50,005
See, it sounds so stupid.

283
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,883
- (Child cries)
- Oh, my God! There's a snake.

284
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:04,327
Come on.

285
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,728
- Don't make any noise. And don't move...
- It's OK.

286
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,401
(Lisa) Nate.

287
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,284
What did you do that for?

288
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,245
- Is it dead?
- It's way past dead.

289
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:40,122
- Poor little guy.
- (Todd) That's not cool, man.

290
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:45,566
- It's not poison. It's a gopher snake.
- I don't care what fucking snake it is.

291
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:51,404
Oh, fuck! Goddamn! Don't any of you fuckers
wanna go for a fucking hike? Come on!

292
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,371
- Agh!
- (Child cries)

293
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,928
Mediocre.

294
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,969
Redundant.

295
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:07,884
Terrible.

296
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,124
Blah, blah, blah.

297
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,604
Hm.

298
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:18,451
Elephant art.

299
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,565
Does anyone know what elephant art is?

300
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:26,528
A term the Fluxists invented.
My dad was a Fluxist.

301
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,403
Does anyone know what a Fluxist is?

302
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:33,684
Fuck that. Why doesn't anyone know
what elephant art is?

303
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,928
Who are you people? Don't you guys read?

304
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:38,487
This is elephant art.

305
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:42,162
My head is on backwards.
I feel like my head is on backwards.

306
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,804
Yes, we get it.

307
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:48,929
Termite art.

308
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,043
Look at me, Claire.

309
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:55,525
Tiny, beautiful termite art.

310
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,568
Termites work secretly at night,

311
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:04,401
but they can tear down a house
as fast as an elephant can.

312
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:07,968
But they don't stop. They infest.

313
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,683
Good job.

314
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,050
- (Arthur) Like that?
- Exactly.

315
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:23,210
Light touch.
You don't wanna go all Joan Crawford on him.

316
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:25,483
No, I certainly don't.

317
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,206
Hello! Arthur!

318
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:32,923
- Is it OK if I return this?
- Don't keep it for me.

319
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:35,043
Good. Well, I'll take it back, then.

320
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:39,006
Nothing else you'd like me to pick up
while I'm there?

321
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:43,285
- Not that I can think of.
- OK, then.

322
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:48,649
There's leftover blintzes in the fridge
if you get hungry. Either of you.

323
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,372
Thank you.

324
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:58,964
Don't think just because you're living here
you have to do things with the Munsters.

325
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:02,892
- I don't think that.
- I mean, take a load off, Arthur.

326
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:12,205
OK, Biggie Smalls' viewing
is tomorrow morning.

327
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:15,450
- Ever worked with the Triple X casket?
- Not quite this size.

328
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,530
This is what we call
Advanced Casketing Techniques 101.

329
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:22,088
The viewing is tomorrow
but we're gonna lay him out upstairs tonight

330
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,250
because you don't wanna worry about it
the morning of.

331
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,971
- I thought it was great.
- It's not the point.

332
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:41,007
Everybody makes crap sometimes,
but what's with the big need to humiliate me?

333
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,524
I don't know.

334
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:49,046
I don't do well at this kind of thing.

335
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,563
I don't need somebody telling me that I suck.

336
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:58,645
Particularly in front of people
who suck way worse than I do.

337
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:05,844
Did you see that whatshername Levine's
stupid fucking mermaid?

338
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:14,409
How can you grow as an artist if you don't have
the freedom to fail now and then?

339
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,048
- I've failed.
- He likes yours.

340
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:22,325
- Really? It wasn't that clear to me.
- Fuck it. What difference does it make?

341
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:26,161
The world's gonna be blown to smithereens
any day now.

342
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,681
We just kissed.

343
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,807
We just kissed again.

344
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:27,562
Nate, go hike.

345
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,322
- Don't you wanna come with?
- I have my magazines.

346
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,887
You sure?

347
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,128
- Go.
- All right.

348
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,607
I'll only be an hour or two-ish.

349
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:45,887
OK, I just wanna make sure
you're not saying go ahead and hike

350
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,970
and what you mean is stay here
and help me with the baby.

351
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,848
Now's the perfect time.
I have my magazines, Maya's mellow.

352
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:55,645
- Go.
- All right.

353
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:59,288
Thanks, honey. See you later, OK?

354
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:22,652
Oh, my God! No fucking way!

355
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:27,130
What in the world are you doing up here?

356
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:30,006
We're on a camping trip.

357
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:33,732
We're at the end of the trail.
What are you doing here?

358
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:39,723
I'm at a B&B in Hungry Valley
with some friends. They're right behind me.

359
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:42,810
I don't believe this. It's like fate.

360
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,125
How are you doing?

361
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:54,008
At this moment, not great,
to be perfectly honest.

362
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:59,081
- I think it's really weird that you're up here.
- I am hiking with my friends.

363
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,124
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:05,371
- Friends? What are their names?
- Frank and Douglas.

365
00:28:05,413 --> 00:28:10,089
- You think I can't tell when you're lying?
- Whoa. What's with the paranoia?

366
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,569
- What, are you high?
- Are you stalking me now?

367
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,366
- Don't flatter yourself.
- You're stalking me!

368
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,768
You followed me and my family up here.

369
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,646
What the fuck do you want,
you crazy fucking bitch?

370
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,923
Oh, yeah, I'm crazy. Whoo!

371
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:29,046
Crazy, scary, crazy, psycho, right?

372
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:32,324
(Barks)

373
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,728
Tell me the fucking truth!

374
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,248
- I needed to talk to you.
- We already talked.

375
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:48,172
Claire said you were up in Kern County,
so I came up here...

376
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:50,408
Were you watching me
when we were camping?

377
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:54,685
- No, nothing like that.
- Dammit, stop bullshitting me!

378
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,843
Nate, I miss you.

379
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,884
So much.

380
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:05,005
- Don't you miss me?
- No, I do not.

381
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,613
Yes, you do, you do. You think about me.

382
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:10,565
No, this is not gonna happen. All right?

383
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:13,889
Just kiss me. Just kiss me once.

384
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:16,447
Just once, baby, and then we're done.

385
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:26,925
Oh, I remember that feeling.
Flowing into each other like water.

386
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,727
- Look, I can't.
- I can't live without you. I won't.

387
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,764
You're gonna have to.

388
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,648
I'm so sorry.

389
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:43,123
I'm sorry for everything.

390
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,845
Brenda!

391
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:05,131
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this to you.

392
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:10,923
That was my first time.

393
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:13,362
Shut up!

394
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:20,282
Oh, my God!

395
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,086
Oh, my God, I did that to you?

396
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,249
Well, the first time.

397
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:28,205
So technically that was
your first and second time?

398
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:29,686
Uh-huh.

399
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:32,372
- That's impressive.
- Yeah?

400
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,883
I would have thought
it was your fifth or sixth time.

401
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,005
I feel really safe with you, Claire.

402
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,088
You are really safe with me.

403
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:54,206
- (Loud thud)
- What the fuck was that?

404
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,726
- Goodness!
- Rico's gonna have my behind.

405
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,004
Claire?

406
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:19,089
Claire? Claire?

407
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:22,967
- What?
- I'm sorry. I can see you're entertaining.

408
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:26,210
I wouldn't ask if this weren't a genuine crisis.

409
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:29,928
David's not here, Nate's camping.
I'm gonna need your help.

410
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,888
Would you mind asking your friend, please?

411
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:40,851
Stay here.

412
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:47,089
Claire, please. Go get your friend right now.

413
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:50,887
Ruth, wait right here. I'll be right back.

414
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:53,049
You have a friend in the house?

415
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:55,607
The boy with the tattoo?

416
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,689
Another one.

417
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,325
Oh.

418
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,448
I'm not bringing him down here.

419
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,802
Russell, you really don't need to be here.

420
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:12,003
- Yes, he does.
- It's OK. I'm cool.

421
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:16,012
- Hello, Mrs Fisher.
- How nice to see you again, Russell.

422
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:20,046
Dead weight is the hardest weight to move.
I'll need everyone's strength.

423
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,367
Tell me what to do.

424
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:25,724
We don't have much time.
His facial cartilage is collapsing.

425
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:29,163
Our first concern
is rolling our friend onto the board.

426
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,764
On the count of three. One, two, three.

427
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,122
(All straining)

428
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:43,164
Well done.

429
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,404
He doesn't look too bad.

430
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:56,246
Now, I want you to position yourself
at a corner.

431
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:01,005
- Is this corner OK?
- Yeah.

432
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:04,250
Lift the board onto the gurney
so I can get it downstairs.

433
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:06,602
On the count of three, give it everything.

434
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:10,931
Everything. Lift with your legs. One, two, three.

435
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,611
Lift.

436
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,531
(Straining and gasping)

437
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:24,087
- I guess that didn't work
- Oh, God.

438
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:29,484
OK. I'm starting to get a little freaked out now.

439
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:32,001
Just a little.

440
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,525
Claire, I'm sorry I raised you
around so much death

441
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:39,485
and that your friend had to see this.

442
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:50,044
The cranial-facial work is tricky,
but I'll do what I can before you arrive.

443
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:54,689
Of course I'll wait for your assistance
before I hoist.

444
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,530
I think that's a good idea.

445
00:33:56,573 --> 00:34:01,089
And again, Federico,
I am so sorry about what happened.

446
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,966
No, it couldn't have happened to anyone.

447
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,891
I shouldn't have let it happen on my watch.

448
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,924
I'm sorry.

449
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:11,407
OK. Sorry.

450
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:14,804
Sorry.

451
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:22,931
Well, I think I'm going up
to make some hot cocoa.

452
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:25,168
Would you like to join me for a cup?

453
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:28,888
Thank you, but this requires
my immediate attention.

454
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,686
I suspect I'll be pulling an all-nighter.

455
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:34,201
I can bring it down to you.

456
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:37,086
Chocolate makes me queasy.

457
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:39,124
OK.

458
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,524
- Tea?
- No, really. Nothing.

459
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,971
Spencer will sleep for an hour.

460
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:05,846
If she wakes, give her
Thomas the Tank Engine.

461
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:09,681
If you guys wanna take a private nature hike
later, we'll watch Maya.

462
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,167
- It's only fair.
- Fair's fair.

463
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:15,046
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

464
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:21,048
I hate couples like that.
Letting you know how great their sex life is.

465
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:24,324
Yeah. I think
they doth protest a little too much.

466
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,046
Like sex is everything. Sex is everything.

467
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:29,653
She's always talking about it
like it's the glue.

468
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:34,084
But what if someone gets throat cancer
or diarrhoea and you see the real person?

469
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:39,207
Then you have to be able to help them into
their electronic car or make their vitamin drink

470
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:42,689
and still love them
even though no one feels sexy.

471
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:47,249
- Yeah, it's so much more than just...
- "Todd and I have the greatest sex.

472
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:50,205
"I just love it when he comes on my tits."

473
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,884
She said that?

474
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,363
OK, I'm ready.

475
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:08,207
- Knotted up back here.
- Mm-hm.

476
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,686
Yes.

477
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:19,604
Oh, so now you're both
going through your blue period?

478
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,403
Don't get mad at me, Fisher.

479
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,047
If Russell has something to say to me,
he can say it.

480
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:29,129
- How's my pressure?
- Go deeper.

481
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:32,688
- Why has he turned into such an asshole?
- Just ignore him.

482
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,770
You ignore him too. It's just hair.

483
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,804
I don't understand what the big deal is.

484
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:42,643
Fuck elephant, termite, whatever.
I already forgot who was which.

485
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:46,652
- What's the point of humiliating people?
- I was the elephant.

486
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:50,447
- Why do you even give a shit?
- You're my teacher and I respect you.

487
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:53,841
Don't you fucking respect me.

488
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:56,009
I'm an idiot. I'm not God.

489
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:59,125
Don't ever respect anyone
except your fucking self.

490
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:03,768
Fucking babies.

491
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,009
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello, dear. I washed your sheets.

492
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:31,047
- What's that?
- Arthur's handkerchief.

493
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:35,006
- You're doing his laundry?
- It must have gotten mixed into my things.

494
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,125
- That's gross.
- It's just a hanky.

495
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,051
I know, and hankies are gross.

496
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,052
- First of all, the word is gross. Hanky.
- It's just a word.

497
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:49,211
Hankies are gross. A snot-covered rag
that sits in your pocket all day.

498
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,926
- That will be fine.
- The snot could be anywhere.

499
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,203
You put it back and save it for later.

500
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,689
Mom, not all progress is bad.
There's Kleenex. Hello.

501
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:54,124
I know.

502
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:58,925
Tonight you're just trying to be cute.

503
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:01,123
Forgive me. Hot.

504
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,609
Yes. Of course I do.

505
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:07,451
More so now than ever.

506
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:09,643
Mom's vacuuming my room.

507
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:16,486
I gotta go. OK.

508
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,801
Shut up. No, I'm not.

509
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:26,327
I'm not. I'm not. Stop.

510
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,447
I'm hanging up. Goodbye.

511
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:36,243
- You and Phil back together?
- Phil? No. Russell.

512
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,329
The gay one?

513
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,801
- What?
- The guy in your room the other day?

514
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:46,244
- What makes you think he's gay?
- Oh, we can smell it on each other.

515
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:49,126
- David.
- Let's see. You told me he was.

516
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:52,245
You referred to him as "my gay friend Russell".

517
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:56,729
- Oh.
- He's not any more?

518
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:59,492
No, he never was. I was just confused.

519
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:08,809
Claire, listen.
When I was in high school, I dated girls.

520
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:12,482
- We're in college.
- And when I was in college. And after college.

521
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,728
I didn't know what I was,

522
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:17,924
and while I was trying to figure it out
I went back and forth...

523
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:21,204
You don't get it.
There's no back and forth with Russell.

524
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,448
He's never been gay. I was just assuming.

525
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:27,770
He's never been gay.
He's never had sex with anyone before me.

526
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,690
OK. My mistake.

527
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,567
I can't even make a phone call in this house

528
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:37,970
because I don't get cell reception anywhere,
my mother's in my fucking room...

529
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,443
At what age did you completely stop
sleeping with women?

530
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:49,930
I know when you first slept with that boy,
but did you overlap after that?

531
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:54,284
Yeah.

532
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:59,043
There were ten years when I wasn't sure.
Or I was sure but didn't want to be.

533
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,891
I was with some women pretty seriously.

534
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:04,811
- What, Jennifer?
- Yeah.

535
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:11,362
I was with a ton of women.
I liked fucking women.

536
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:13,404
Yeah, I know. You've told me.

537
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:19,164
What I mean was I did
this whole emotional deal with girls... women.

538
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:24,765
Like "Honey, I could really think
about spending the rest of my life with you.

539
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:31,528
"I don't know, buy some land
in Northern California and build a house,

540
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,803
"design it ourselves.

541
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:37,528
"What about Willem for a boy
and Coco for a girl?

542
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:39,848
"Willem and Max if we have twin boys,

543
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:42,487
"or if we have twin girls,
Coco and Clementine."

544
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,842
Are you sure they didn't know you were gay?

545
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:47,566
They didn't suspect.
They thought I was their man.

546
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,808
They'd look right back into my eyes.

547
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:55,649
All the while I was just trying that guy on
to see if I could make it fit.

548
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,891
'Oh, yeah! Right there, right there. '

549
00:42:13,653 --> 00:42:16,850
- She's down.
- Great.

550
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:19,248
You guys wanna take your turn?

551
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:21,523
- We're leaving today.
- We should pack.

552
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,406
- You can pack later. Go take the hour.
- Go on.

553
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:28,048
- If she wakes up...
- She'll be fine. Go.

554
00:42:28,093 --> 00:42:30,846
- You guys have fun.
- Are you set?

555
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:42,681
- She can't come, you know.
- (Chuckles)

556
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,083
- Really?
- Really.

557
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,601
- Pretty.
- Yeah.

558
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,603
Do you want to...

559
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:57,604
Not really.

560
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:00,725
I'd be afraid to take my clothes off.

561
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:03,367
Something could crawl on me.

562
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:07,326
We're not really Todd and Dana, are we?

563
00:43:10,493 --> 00:43:12,085
What's that supposed to mean?

564
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:18,366
I was just acknowledging that the reasons
we're together aren't the same as...

565
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:20,051
Say it.

566
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:24,323
- What? There's nothing to say.
- Say it, Nate.

567
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:27,763
Why are you even with me?
What are you even here for?

568
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:32,091
- On this trip? What?
- Why did you marry me?

569
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:34,488
You think Maya and I need you?

570
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:38,048
You don't want this. You want your daughter
but you don't want me.

571
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,685
I can't say anything!

572
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:43,806
Not hurtful things, and it's hurtful to suggest
we're together because of Maya.

573
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:47,562
I am not trying to hurt you.
That was me thinking something.

574
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:51,686
You know how friends do?
But that would mean you'd have to like me.

575
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:54,930
- That's stupid.
- No, it's not. Think about it.

576
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:58,283
When I say something
that doesn't fit into your fairy tale...

577
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,324
This is no fairy tale. That I know.

578
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:04,048
- You made up a story, cast me in this role.
- You cast yourself.

579
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:07,847
Making the mother of my child happy
is a role? I don't think so.

580
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:12,409
But you have this narrow path I can walk on
where I'm on your fucking leash.

581
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:16,765
No smoking, two beers a night,
no pot without prior written approval.

582
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:19,885
- Smoke your lungs out.
- I don't give a shit about smoking.

583
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:22,003
I give a shit about being myself.

584
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:29,124
About saying what I need to say
and not having you fucking freak out on me.

585
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:32,765
I'm sorry, then.

586
00:44:34,453 --> 00:44:36,091
(Sighs)

587
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,532
Fuck.

588
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,403
I'm sorry.

589
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:10,607
Kiss me.

590
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:13,247
- What? No.
- Honey, I wanna get better at this.

591
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,132
Help me, OK?

592
00:45:39,413 --> 00:45:41,643
Take your jeans off.

593
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:44,412
- Take them off.
- Here?

594
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:47,729
Yeah. Lie down on that rock.

595
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:50,685
That rock is hard and cold.

596
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,052
Lay down on that.

597
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:04,482
Close your eyes.

598
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:09,611
I wanna fuck you on this rock.

599
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:13,009
But first I'm gonna make you scream

600
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:16,363
so that everybody back at camp can hear you.

601
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:19,485
And then when you're exhausted

602
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,286
and you're laying here coming down,

603
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:27,487
I'm gonna fuck you right here on this rock.

604
00:46:53,773 --> 00:46:57,971
There were a couple of times back in Seattle
when we had sex like that.

605
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:04,809
When you came home from a party
at that costume designer's house

606
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:07,765
who worked for Seattle Rep.

607
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:10,008
What was her name?

608
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:12,283
- Tessa.
- Right.

609
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:16,372
She'd just broken it off with you
and you were so drunk and pissed

610
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:22,488
and you came home and we ended up having
the most amazing sex I'd ever had in my life.

611
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:37,482
The other time was the night
after you ran the marathon the first time.

612
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:40,284
Yeah.

613
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,645
And that girl you met from Portland
was supposed to come over and celebrate.

614
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:50,046
But she never showed up.

615
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:54,968
Lise, it's all behind us.

616
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:58,244
I know. I'm...

617
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:04,532
It's nice now. That it's just us.

618
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:09,204
I love you, Nate.

619
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:13,041
God, I've loved you for such a long time.

620
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,403
I love you too, honey.

621
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,842
(! Come And Find Me)

622
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:32,401
! Come and find me now

623
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,527
! I keep you in a flower vase

624
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,962
! Your fatalism and your crooked face

625
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:08,926
! With the daisies and the violet brocades

626
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:15,126
! And I keep me in a vacant lot
In the ivies, forget-me-nots

627
00:49:15,173 --> 00:49:18,961
! Hoping you will come and untangle me
one of these days

628
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:27,251
! Come and find me now!
