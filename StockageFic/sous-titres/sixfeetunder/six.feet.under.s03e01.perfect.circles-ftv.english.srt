1
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,749
Fuck, we’re bleeding!

2
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,671
Great, now I’ve got brain coming out of the wound.

3
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,914
Raise his head and give him a hundred grams of Mannitol.

4
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,175
Let’s put him in burst suppression. What’s his blood pressure?

5
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,081
117 over 72.

6
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,166
Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion?

7
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,032
Core body temperature is 34. 5.
117 over 72.

8
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:08,648
Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion?

9
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,251
Core body temperature is 34. 5.

10
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,944
We loaded him with Dilantin and Decadron.

11
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:15,866
Fuck!

12
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:20,670
Fuck! Julie, I need two frasers and some aneurysm clips.

13
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,987
Aneurysm clips. I’ve gotta stop all this bleeding.

14
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:25,505
Fuck! Julie…And I’ll need lots of gel foam and cottonoids…

15
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:26,627
We’ve gotta stop all this bleeding

16
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:28,296
Are we going to do a ventriculostomy?

17
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,393
Absolutely. Gel foam and cottonoids.

18
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,889
Let the C- T scanners know we’ll be coming in after surgery.

19
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,293
If we make it that far.

20
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,448
If we make it that far.

21
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,017
If we make it that far.

22
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,239
That shit smells awful.

23
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,022
It’s fenugreek.

24
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,365
Fenugreek? What the fuck is fenugreek?

25
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,836
Want to try some? It’s delicious.

26
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,269
No thanks.

27
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,016
Here, put a little maple syrup on it.

28
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:12,728
Mmmm!

29
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,796
Would you hurry up? I don’t wanna be late for my funeral.

30
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:26,151
Relax, you’ve got plenty of time. Hell, you’ve got nothing but time!

31
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,300
Which doesn’t exist anyway, so

32
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,999
You don’t know what you’re missing!

33
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,212
Goddamnit, David, I told you I wanted to be cremated.

34
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,789
Come on, Nate, you can do this.

35
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:54,652
You can do this.

36
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,859
Cat.

37
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,355
Tac.

38
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:13,268
No, reverse it.
Cat.

39
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,289
Cac.

40
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:21,128
Almost. Cat. Cat.

41
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:23,818
Cac.

42
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:30,412
Let’s try another one.
Duck.

43
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,514
Huck.

44
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:39,084
Close.

45
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,647
Goat.

46
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,582
Let’s take a break.

47
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:16,974
She’s definitely got your nose. And your eyes.

48
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,777
Look at that face. Look at this little person we created.

49
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:27,441
I love it when she does that.

50
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:33,059
When she sort of jerks right before she falls off to sleep, and then wakes herself up.

51
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,228
You freaked out the first time she ever did it.

52
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,103
I remember that feeling of falling, when I was little,

53
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,543
like I was falling out of bed, and it always woke me up.

54
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,941
Like I was scared of what I was going to fall into.

55
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:54,098
But...that never happens to me anymore.

56
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:05,742
God. We lose so much, ya know?

57
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:10,911
Oh, great!

58
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,293
Oh, great, he’s got the hiccups again!

59
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:16,191
So shake him and scream in his face!

60
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:20,197
What? The world is a hostile and terrifying place. He needs to learn that.

61
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,938
If your mother starts talking about what a gassy baby you were and him getting that from you again, I will scream.

62
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,000
I’ll start farting.

63
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,101
Thank God we got high before we came!

64
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:35,823
Call me crazy, buddy boy, but I don’t think it makes a damned bit of difference who won.

65
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,013
They’re all crooks anyway.

66
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,186
How can you not care?

67
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,994
I mean, what about that bullshit acceptance speech
Language!

68
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:42,395
he gave a couple of weeks ago

69
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,291
when he said, “I was not elected to serve one party but one nation, ”

70
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,230
yeah, the operative words there being “NOT elected”!

71
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:47,533
You want the end piece?

72
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:48,635
I don’t eat red meat.

73
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:49,933
Nate, I made you a chicken breast!

74
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:54,069
Nate, if you didn’t want to see George Bush in the White House,
then you shouldn’t have voted for Ralph Nader.

75
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:58,817
I’m sorry I’m late. The traffic was like severely ridiculous.

76
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,593
Ruth

77
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,523
Merry Christmas

78
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,609
Claire, you don’t look well.

79
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,730
I think I may be coming down with a cold.

80
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,165
Oh, dear! Let me feel your forehead.

81
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:11,410
It’s okay, Mom. People get colds.

82
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,422
Okay, who wants the end piece?

83
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,256
Nate?

84
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,792
Sure, I’ll take it.

85
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,700
Everyone, save some room for dessert!

86
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,035
Mother, are you trying to sabotage my diet?

87
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:30,756
Of course, not, Trisha.

88
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:35,456
I fully support your commitment to hating yourself for not having the ass of a 10 year old boy!

89
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,848
Why do you always have to be so crude?

90
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:41,135
Because God is punishing you through me.

91
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,074
Fisher Funeral Chapel, Nate Fisher speaking.

92
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:53,140
I’m so terribly sorry. Yes, we are open today. Ah, any time before eleven?

93
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,294
Just once, I wish we could make it through Christmas dinner without somebody dying.

94
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,979
We’ll be waiting for you. Heart attack.

95
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:03,885
Thank God for small favors.

96
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,077
Aw, shit, I’ve seen this one before!

97
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:15,695
That was Dr. Schroedinger. Kitty, didn’t make it…

98
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:20,820
What’re we watchin’ this for?

99
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:25,433
‘Cause it’s what’s on. Quit flappin’ yer trap. I like this show.

100
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,747
the universe is splitting two

101
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:34,410
Two? Try two billion!

102
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,689
What’s gonna happen to us?

103
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,170
There, there.

104
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,763
We always end up a universe in which we exist. Remember Copenhagen?

105
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:57,245
Ah, yes! The Eigenvalues in bloom!

106
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:03,940
You just keep telling yourself everything that can happen, does…somewhere.

107
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,597
Aw, shit, I’ve seen this one before!

108
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,602
you want tell me what is going on?

109
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:12,682
I just need you to answer a few questions for me.

110
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:20,165
Do you believe that your consciousness affects the behavior of subatomic particles?

111
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,820
Am I alive or am I dead?

112
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:26,301
Do you believe that particles move backwards and forwards
in time and appear in all possible places at once?

113
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,096
And if I am dead, is this heaven or hell?

114
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,803
Do you believe that the universe is constantly splitting into billions of parallel universes?

115
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,444
WHAT THE FUCK DO I CARE?

116
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,379
You only get one choice, so you may want to think about this.

117
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:41,334
Just tell me. Am I dead? Yes. Or No.

118
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,346
Yes.

119
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,878
And no.

120
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,182
Some places you’re dead, some places you’re alive. Some places you never even existed.

121
00:11:54,835 --> 00:12:00,282
Possibly, theoretically. Or who knows, this could just be the anesthesia talking.

122
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:07,646
Go ahead. Open the box.

123
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:20,881
Fuck it.

124
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,027
No, I never actually flat- lined.

125
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:43,336
I just woke up, and later they told me the AVM ruptured during surgery.

126
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,047
So, what does that mean, ruptured?

127
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,588
Well, it just, ya know, exploded. My head actually exploded.

128
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,016
I should’ve died or had some kind of lasting brain damage,

129
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:57,185
but I pulled through and 7 months later, nothing even shows up on an MRI.

130
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,356
Wow, you’re really lucky!

131
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,378
I’m so fuckin’ lucky.

132
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:05,831
So fuckin’ lucky.

133
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,150
Right?

134
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:09,790
Oh, that is so beautiful!

135
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,231
His doesn’t have the inlay.

136
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,378
Where did you get this?

137
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:17,059
My boss, Carol, had to have a lot of jewelry made for this King Arthur cable movie.

138
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,626
She turned us onto the Todd who did it.

139
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,670
I still can’t believe how fast you two got married.

140
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:26,952
It wasn’t that fast. We’ve actually been together 8 years,

141
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,070
ya know, on and off, between here and Seattle.

142
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,114
Well, you look really happy.

143
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,619
I am really happy!

144
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,088
Good.

145
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:40,971
So, my sister- in- law’s an astrologist

146
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:42,054
And a drunk!

147
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:46,276
And she was telling me about this whole weird thing that her profession is facing right now.

148
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,335
Wait, when did astrology become a profession?

149
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,821
You know, with the whole possibility of interplanetary travel

150
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,886
This pasta salad is so good! I want to spend a weekend alone with it!

151
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,225
Honey, that makes me feel a little weird.

152
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,039
Okay, so, say in your chart, your Mars is in Scorpio.

153
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,080
Well, what about when people who are actually born on Mars?

154
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:09,782
Their Mars isn’t in anything, but their Earth is in, I don’t know, Virgo or whatever.

155
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,348
Honey? No one’s listening.

156
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:14,017
Oh, I know. I’m even boring myself.

157
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:18,301
Oh, Lisa, I made some pasta salad without the tuna in it for you.

158
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,453
No, it’s okay. I’m nursing. I need the protein.

159
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,338
Spencer, put the kitty down!

160
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,173
So the whole breast- feeding thing is going better now?

161
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,447
Yeah. I’m taking fenugreek.

162
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:28,577
Fenugreek.

163
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,543
Oh, I’ve heard of that. Have I heard of that?

164
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,461
It’s amazing! Nursing was so painful for me at first,

165
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,032
and my milk production seemed like it would never catch up with her demand…

166
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,281
Put the kitty down.

167
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:46,842
But now there’s always enough. The only draw back is my sweat smells a little like maple syrup.

168
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,229
Thank you!

169
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:52,733
You know, breasts are actually modified sweat glands,

170
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:56,998
and I hardly ever sweat, which is maybe why it was so painful for me at first.

171
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:01,182
I wish I got one of those elliptical ones. They’re supposed to be better for your knees.

172
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:04,868
But I’m sure I wouldn’t be using that one either, so

173
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,179
Hey, Todd, thanks for having us.

174
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:09,919
You’re taking off so soon?

175
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,315
Yeah, I gotta work tonight.

176
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:12,893
You want a hit for the road?

177
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,191
No, I better not.

178
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:20,129
Alright. Hey, I think I might know somebody who wants to buy your motorcycle.

179
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,519
Somebody already bought it.

180
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:23,519
Oh. Oh, well.

181
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,938
Yeah.

182
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:32,196
Alright, thanks again. I’ll see ya next time.

183
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,358
Alright, later.

184
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:34,365
Bye!

185
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:39,932
That was fun.

186
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:41,547
Yeah, I like them.

187
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,122
She’s nice, he’s a little weird.

188
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:44,693
Food was good.

189
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:46,831
Nate.

190
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:47,397
What?

191
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:48,666
We totally grabbed the wrong bag!

192
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:49,637
Oh, shit.

193
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:51,456
Keys.

194
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:52,427
Okay, be right back.

195
00:15:53,566 --> 00:16:00,621
I feel…judged. I feel criticized.

196
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:09,020
I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough. I feel ashamed of who I am.

197
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,954
I feel like I’ll never be the person you want me to be.

198
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:16,276
I don’t want you to be anyone except who you are.

199
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:21,274
Keith, now is about you listening. You’ll get your chance in a moment.

200
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,071
Yeah, okay.

201
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:35,511
I feel like I’m living in a minefield, sometimes. Your anger is so random and arbitrary.

202
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:39,738
Let’s try to avoid making judgments about Keith’s behavior right now

203
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,960
and really stay focused on what you feel.

204
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,748
I’m afraid of pissing you off, so...

205
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:54,276
I’m constantly editing myself.

206
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,536
I guess I’m just confused, like I don’t even know who I am anymore.

207
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,211
I’m done

208
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:15,307
Now, Keith, what did you hear?

209
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,547
A lot of whining!

210
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,941
Perhaps you have some feelings of your own you’d like to share?

211
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,492
Yeah. I hate my job. I feel like a fucking loser,

212
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,836
driving around in a Home Alert uniform, answering alarms set off by poodles

213
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,673
and sucking up to rich assholes who make more in a day than I make in a year! ,

214
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,137
I ought to be able to blow off some steam when I come home without you always taking it so personally

215
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:38,500
because it’s very rarely about you!

216
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:40,735
David.

217
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,289
I don’t think that’s fair.

218
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:43,989
You don’t want me to have any feelings!

219
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,669
No, I’d just like to have a little fun now and then, like we used to.

220
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:49,807
We don’t have fun?

221
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,200
Rarely.

222
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:53,685
Rarely?

223
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,127
On occasion.

224
00:17:58,712 --> 00:17:59,822
How’s your sex life?

225
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,021
It’s kinda great.

226
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:07,908
Yeah, that part works.

227
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,798
So, it seems engaging passionately is comfortable in that arena,

228
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,698
but not so in other areas. What other things do the two of you like to do together?

229
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,847
Um, we go to movies sometimes. We go to dinner.

230
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,083
We used to play racquetball.

231
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,774
He was so much better than me, it was a joke. I wasn’t challenging enough for him.

232
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:32,905
I never said that!

233
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:33,998
It made me feel inadequate.

234
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,495
What kinds of things do you do on your own?

235
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:39,854
Besides work? Work out.

236
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,864
Yeah. My job kind of keeps me from doing much else.

237
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:46,981
Friends?

238
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,569
Most of my friends were cops.

239
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,123
But I don’t see them anymore since I left the force.

240
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,515
David never really had any close friends.

241
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:00,078
That’s not true.

242
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:06,100
There’s a group of independent funeral directors I get together with every month.

243
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:07,972
You hate those guys!

244
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:15,518
We’re out of time.

245
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:21,551
This week, should any conflicts arise, try to focus on expressing

246
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,630
what you’re feeling instead of criticizing and blaming.

247
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:24,462
Yeah.

248
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:25,352
Okay?

249
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,231
Change.

250
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,741
Good, Russell.

251
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:23,173
Fuck, it’s almost five. Rico’s gonna have my head.

252
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,221
Mom!

253
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:28,750
Hello! How is my precious girl doing today?

254
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,071
She has the hiccups again.

255
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,337
:…got the hiccups again.

256
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,683
She gets that from her daddy. He was a very gassy baby,

257
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,640
wasn’t he? Yes, he was!

258
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,201
I’ll get her some gripe water.

259
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:39,941
Do you remember to burp her often, dear, when she’s nursing?

260
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,060
Of course.

261
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,119
What’s wrong with you?

262
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,817
I don’t know. I think I just had the weirdest déjà vu.

263
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:54,352
Hello! Every time I pop by, there are more people here.

264
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:56,533
Hi, I’m Carol Ward, Lisa’s boss.

265
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,191
I’m Ruth Fisher, Nate’s mother. We’ve met several times already.

266
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,200
You’re not living here now too, are you?

267
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:04,427
I’m kidding! Calm down.

268
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:06,924
I hate to keep harping on this.

269
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,308
I parked in the driveway again.

270
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:09,666
Well, there are two cars today!

271
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:11,033
I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

272
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,465
Please, it’s no biggie. I’m sure you didn’t know.

273
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:15,750
What’s your excuse?

274
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,224
Well, I was just dropping off

275
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,851
I could get a little sign made up, ya know?

276
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:20,752
Nate, back it up, put it on the street!

277
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:24,320
I’m kidding!

278
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,525
Look, if you want me to move it, I’ll go move it right now.

279
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,372
Don’t be silly, whenever, it doesn’t matter.

280
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:30,706
Sooner rather than later.

281
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:36,219
Oh, Lisa, I’m having dinner with Penny Marshall tonight, so I won’t need you to cook.

282
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:37,878
Okay.

283
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:41,840
But, I’m going to host an impromptu gathering tomorrow evening, just some close friends

284
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:46,083
I want to try out a new pitch on, shouldn’t be more than…30.

285
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,278
Okay.

286
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,262
Do you have time to go over the menu with me?

287
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,367
Now?

288
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,476
Yes!

289
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:55,085
Take your time, dear. I’ve got all afternoon.

290
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:56,790
Oh, nice to meet you, Nate’s mother!

291
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,209
She’s energetic.

292
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,813
She’s a lunatic.

293
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,468
Hey, Rico.

294
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,818
Nate, hey, how’s it going?

295
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:07,964
Good.

296
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,868
Good, good, I’m glad to hear it.

297
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,448
Listen, I don’t know if you’re aware of this,

298
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,197
or if you even care,

299
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:14,789
but we have two viewings tonight.

300
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,550
One at 6:30 and one at 8:00.

301
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:17,727
Yeah, I’m on my way.

302
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,124
Good, because your brother is nowhere to be found.

303
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,894
Yeah, and he’s not answering his cell phone.

304
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,519
And there’s only so much I can do, ya know?

305
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:27,391
Sure.

306
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,532
I can’t be at two places at the same time, Nate!

307
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:33,040
I get it, Rico, okay? Lay off the lecturing. I’m not your kid!

308
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:36,476
Yeah, well, I’m not your employee. I’m your partner.

309
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:39,788
I am a licensed funeral director now, okay?

310
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,789
You guys took my money, you made me a partner.

311
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:47,075
It’s time you started treating me like one. Goodbye.

312
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,527
So, Claire, how’s art school?

313
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,101
It’s okay.

314
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,627
What kind of stuff are you doing?

315
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:10,710
Well, yesterday, we had to draw this naked guy in like 30 seconds.

316
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,618
Well, that sounds fun.

317
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,975
Not really. It’s hard.

318
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,959
And, like, I don’t even want to be an illustrator or a painter or whatever,

319
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,453
but they keep saying that we need to know how to do everything, like Picasso.

320
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,143
It’s intense.

321
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:28,055
Yeah, but, at least you get to be creative every day.

322
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:29,564
Good morning!

323
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:30,619
Hey!

324
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,450
Hey, pumpkin!

325
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:32,418
Hey, how’s it going?

326
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:34,480
It could not possibly be going any better.

327
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:39,183
Would you look at this little girl? Is that the face of God, or what, huh?

328
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:41,473
Yeah, there’s some stuff coming out of God’s nose.

329
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,200
Who’s precious? Is it you? Yes, it is!

330
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,177
Hey, Mom, can you help me with her today?

331
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:47,940
Lisa’s gotta help Carol.

332
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,309
Carol’s having this big Hollywood asslick dinner, and Lisa gotta shop.

333
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:51,459
Of course.

334
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,713
You guys, she took the most amazing poop this morning.

335
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,985
Who, Lisa?

336
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,683
Seriously, it was just so perfectly formed, so healthy and compact.

337
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,364
It was like a regular adult poop! It made me so happy.

338
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:10,247
Look, I swear, when you live with a baby, you get to see the world as being totally new all over again.

339
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,079
They’re just so pure and uncorrupted.

340
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,472
It’s a fuckin’ privilege.

341
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:16,449
And how come neither of you has been over to visit her recently?

342
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:20,123
Because being a father has turned you into a dithering idiot.

343
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:27,341
Wow. You’re so tough and cool and above it all. I wish I was you.

344
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,351
Does anybody want the end piece?

345
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:30,372
Who wants the end piece?

346
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:36,682
Oh, Nate, could you drop Mrs. Folger at the crematory this afternoon?

347
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,007
No, I’ve got the Paulk funeral.

348
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,033
Yeah? Well, I’ve got the Bennett funeral.

349
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,087
Can’t Rico do it?

350
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,321
I believe his exact words were, “No fucking way.

351
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:50,428
I’m not your fucking go- fer any more.

352
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,634
Claire, can you give us a hand?

353
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,274
Sorry, I have homework.

354
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:01,415
We’ll pay you fifty bucks.

355
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:03,917
We’d pay a delivery service more than that.

356
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,228
All right.

357
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,003
As long as I don’t have to touch any dead skin.

358
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,329
No, she’s all boxed up.

359
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,764
And I can’t do it till around four, ‘cause I have to practice drawing a perfect circle.

360
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,114
That takes seven hours?

361
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:23,479
I have to be able to do it on command in class tomorrow, okay? It’s not as easy as it sounds.

362
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,803
Eeww. Is that the box that needs to go to the crematory?

363
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:29,762
The-- ? Uh, yeah.

364
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:32,611
Well, I can take it now.

365
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:39,543
You’re taking it?

366
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:43,105
Yeah, they hired me to do runs, since nobody else wants to do it.

367
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,129
Really?

368
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:47,252
Yeah, for 50 bucks a shot.

369
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,096
But you’re gonna need to help me get that into my car.

370
00:26:58,677 --> 00:26:59,842
So, what kind of music do you guys play?

371
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,208
I don’t know. It’s kinda like early Peter Gabriel meets Tool.

372
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:08,274
Emotionally vulnerable like Sunny Day Real Estate,

373
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:13,246
but politically conscious, like Public Enemy.

374
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,538
We’re still working it out.

375
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,364
When you guys play, you should let me know. I’ll come.

376
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:22,534
Why don’t you hang out, while we practice?

377
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:24,954
I don’t think I can.

378
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:36,352
I’ve got this thing I’m supposed to
Okay.

379
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,159
I'm Phil.

380
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,518
I’m Claire.

381
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:40,967
You want a beer?

382
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:41,529
Sure.

383
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:49,981
You really amaze me, Lisa.

384
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:52,556
Why?

385
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:57,580
Your energy, it’s boundless. You should be bottled as an alternative energy source.

386
00:27:57,788 --> 00:27:59,074
You would save the world, I’m serious.

387
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:05,911
Well, that’s kinda funny, because I feel tired all the time.

388
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:07,908
Really?

389
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:11,818
Yeah. I think it just comes from being a mom, ya know?

390
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,199
Yeah.

391
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:16,433
Not that I’m complaining.

392
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,762
I mean, Maya has totally transformed my life.

393
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,558
I can’t even imagine going back to the way things were before.

394
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:26,677
Wow.

395
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,962
I mean, so what if I have to work extra hard?

396
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:34,455
I want to. It’s worth, it is so worth it.

397
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,687
Carol?

398
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:51,531
No, don’t pay any attention to me.

399
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:56,091
I’m just nervous…nervous about this meeting next week.

400
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:00,857
I have to pitch to McG, in person! Whoa, is he intimidating!

401
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,303
Can I make you some chamomile tea?

402
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,620
Oh, for Chrissake, I’m not your grandmother, okay? I’m your boss.

403
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,272
Stop looking at me, Lisa!

404
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:34,905
Carol, I’m always here for you.

405
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:35,732
Eh!

406
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,416
Also, I swim laps in the morning, and I used to be able to do that naked,

407
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:45,940
which was a great way to start the day, like I was Artemis.

408
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:49,301
I would go out there feeling like a warrior, like a huntress,

409
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,431
which is what you have to do when you’re in my business.

410
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:55,049
But now I can’t do that anymore, because there’s a man living here!

411
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:57,884
I’m sure Nate wouldn’t mind

412
00:29:58,107 --> 00:29:58,963
I would!

413
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:04,896
Also, I don’t appreciate the hostility he shows by always parking in the driveway!

414
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,576
I’m sorry. I—I will talk to him about it.

415
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah. I’m gonna go swim laps.

416
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,803
Are you ready for the bok choi?

417
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,744
Yeah.

418
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:29,712
What are you doing?

419
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,140
Adding pepper.

420
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,442
I already added pepper.

421
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:33,952
Oh.

422
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:40,732
Okay, I feel shamed.

423
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:42,500
What?

424
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:45,059
When you said, “I already I added pepper, ”

425
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,482
my perception was that you were irritated with me for not knowing that already,

426
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,817
and that you were also angry with me, that I shouldn’t have done it.

427
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:53,656
Why would I be angry with you?

428
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:57,476
I don’t know. Maybe you don’t want me to be involved in the cooking process.

429
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,209
Maybe you just want me to prepare the ingredients for you?

430
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,924
Maybe you want total control over what actually happens inside the wok.

431
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:07,412
So, we have a little extra pepper in the wok. It’s not a big deal!

432
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:09,744
I know it’s not a big deal.

433
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:17,993
Okay, I heard what you said.

434
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,464
It was not my intention to shame you.

435
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:24,272
I know.

436
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,234
Good. I love you. Are the carrots ready?

437
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:30,126
Yeah.

438
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:39,185
You know, I grew up in a family where people expressed their anger on a regular basis,

439
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:40,956
so that’s what intimacy feels like to me.

440
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,931
But you, you grew up in a family where no one ever expressed anything.

441
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,455
Yeah, we also never hit each other.

442
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,376
So whenever I’m slightly irritated, it scares you, right?

443
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:52,102
Right.

444
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,580
It just means I’m comfortable with you.

445
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:02,941
It doesn’t mean I don’t love you.

446
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:11,638
Did you pick up the dry cleaning today?

447
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:13,981
Yeah, it’s in the closet.

448
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,016
There, isn’t that delicious?

449
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:53,528
Your daddy, he used to love peanut butter, too, yes, he did!

450
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:56,897
So did your uncle David. Not your aunt Claire, though.

451
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:00,726
She absolutely hated it. Always did, still does.

452
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:07,475
Isn’t it funny? They were all little babies once, too.

453
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,588
But their daddy’s mommy never liked spending time with them

454
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,514
the way I like spending time with you.

455
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:18,470
She never really liked me, and she never liked my children.

456
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:21,978
She was convinced I had gotten pregnant on purpose

457
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:26,237
to trap Nathaniel into marrying me, which wasn’t true at all.

458
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:28,524
I certainly never intended for that to happen.

459
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:32,268
Especially when I was so young.

460
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:38,166
And I was terrified when your daddy was born, absolutely terrified.

461
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:49,511
Hey, Mom!

462
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,006
Goodness, you startled me!

463
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:53,227
She give you any trouble?

464
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:55,267
Heavens, no, she’s an angel.

465
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,142
Are you ready to go home, angel?

466
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,454
Have you eaten? I made you a chicken breast.

467
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:02,004
Uh, no, thanks. I’ve gotta be getting home.

468
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:05,701
But put it in the fridge. I’ll eat it tomorrow.

469
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,524
You know, if you and Lisa would like a night off, I’d be happy to watch her.

470
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:13,155
You could go out to eat, see a movie. I could even keep her here overnight.

471
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:14,351
Well, thanks, Mom,

472
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:17,963
but Lisa’s working tonight, and plus Maya hasn’t slept outside the family bed yet, so

473
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,043
Well, maybe it might be better for her to try a night sleeping on her own.

474
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,431
Mom, we know how you feel about it. You’re very clear on that.

475
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:29,132
We feel differently, okay?

476
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:33,819
She’s almost nine months old. She’s going to have to leave the family bedsometime.

477
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:40,057
Well, Maya will let us know when she’s ready to leave, all right? Good night.

478
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,512
Good night, Grandma.

479
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:45,574
Good night.

480
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,673
Are we having sex?

481
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:09,020
Uh, okay. Just let me take a shower first.

482
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,452
Morning.

483
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:44,741
What time is it?

484
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,838
A little before 10, I think.

485
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,012
How do you take it?

486
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:53,003
Black.

487
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:01,217
Hey.

488
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:02,969
Hey.

489
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,026
So, what do you have to do today?

490
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:10,647
Uh, class.

491
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,900
What kind of class?

492
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:18,165
A drawing class. We’re learning how to draw a perfect circle.

493
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,523
That sounds kinda cool.

494
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:23,506
It’s not. It’s stupid and tedious and pointless.

495
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:28,031
I went to art school to be expressive, not to perform some pointless task like some lab rat.

496
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,406
You wanna play hooky?

497
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:37,983
Yes.

498
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:42,924
Nate, I need you to do me a big favor

499
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,095
and cover the Folger funeral for me this afternoon.

500
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:46,485
Hey, who’s Frank Muehler?

501
00:37:48,718 --> 00:37:49,380
Frank who?

502
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,945
Muehler. He’s in the date book here every Wednesday at 2.

503
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,273
I have absolutely no idea.

504
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,705
It must be somebody Rico put in there.

505
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,503
Hmm. There’s a phone number. I’m gonna call and find out.

506
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:04,495
All right, no.

507
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,236
Keith and I are in couples counseling.

508
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:09,680
Really?

509
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,377
It’s not that big a deal.

510
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:13,095
Are you guys okay?

511
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:14,427
Yeah, of course we’re okay.

512
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,869
We’re just seeking the advice of a trained professional to help us

513
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,632
to establish appropriate boundaries and write the rules of our relationship together.

514
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,050
What happened?

515
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,132
Nothing happened.

516
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,382
Keith has a lot of anger issues that he inherited from his father,

517
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,797
and I have a lot of doormat issues that I inherited from Mom.

518
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,506
Can we please never talk about this again?

519
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:36,656
Sure. You’re okay, though, right?

520
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:38,836
Can we please never talk about this again?

521
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:39,726
Got it.

522
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:56,890
And how are you and Lisa?

523
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:04,755
Uh…we’re great. It’s still a little bizarre to me.

524
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,952
All the possible ways my life could’ve gone, ya know?

525
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:12,930
Yeah.

526
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,771
Yeah, I mean, it’s just about a year ago I got engaged.

527
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:20,056
Remember that?

528
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,590
You know, I thought I loved Brenda,

529
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:29,259
or maybe I thought I could just make it work out of sheer will.

530
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:34,905
But, you just never know.

531
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:39,593
You have no fucking idea what life has in store for you.

532
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:51,541
So, can you cover the Folger funeral for me or not?

533
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,256
What is it, you just need some time off? Are you sure you’re alright?

534
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,463
I’m fine.

535
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,689
I’ve got an audition for the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles.

536
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:04,967
What?

537
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,440
That sounds fun.

538
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:11,119
I’m trying to create something for myself outside of my job and my relationship.

539
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:13,878
I could really use your support on this.

540
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,416
All right. Don’t worry. The Folger thing’s a walk in the park.

541
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,559
You just go knock ‘em dead. No pun intended.

542
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,584
I’m so nervous.

543
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,120
David. You’ll be great.

544
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,475
>From your mouth to God’s ears.

545
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:27,528
Right.

546
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:30,484
Thanks, Nate.

547
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:31,904
Any time.

548
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:56,667
Hello?

549
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:57,673
Hi, Ruth, it’s Lisa.

550
00:40:58,004 --> 00:40:58,642
Oh, hello.

551
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,952
Ruth, did you give Maya peanut butter?

552
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,285
Yes, and she just loved it! Now, Nate--

553
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:06,824
Ruth, you never give babies peanut butter under the age of one.

554
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,783
They can develop horrible allergies! Didn’t you know that?

555
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:12,955
No, I didn’t. Is she all right?

556
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:16,303
Yes, but that’s not the point. You should never give her peanut butter

557
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:21,250
…or honey…or strawberries…or egg whites. Please.

558
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:22,819
Of course.

559
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:26,151
I’m sorry to be so abrupt with you. I just—

560
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:28,426
No, I’m sorry. I had no idea.

561
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,937
Peanut butter was never a problem when my children were young.

562
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:34,648
Are you sure she’s all right?

563
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:36,170
She’s fine.

564
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:39,808
Do you need any help with her today? I could come over.

565
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:44,163
Ruth, no. You spend so much time over here. I feel bad.

566
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,489
It’s no problem at all. I like—

567
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,944
Seriously, take some time for yourself.

568
00:41:48,895 --> 00:41:50,416
I hardly saw Maya at all yesterday.

569
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:52,495
I really just wanted it to be the two of us today.

570
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,049
Okay.

571
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:57,159
But thanks. I’ll talk to you later.

572
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:23,399
Thank God! It’s very frightening! I didn’t know who to call!

573
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:25,720
Ma’am, just calm down and tell me what happened, okay?

574
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,665
Come, I’ll show you.

575
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,917
Where has the time all gone to?

576
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:45,206
Haven’t done half the things we want to

577
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:52,323
Oh, well, we’ll catch up some other time…

578
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:59,318
This day was just a token

579
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:05,036
Too many words are still unspoken

580
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:11,669
Oh, well, we’ll catch up some other time.

581
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,948
Just when the fun is starting

582
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:23,858
Comes the time for parting

583
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:29,452
But let’s be glad for what we’ve had

584
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:34,927
And what’s to come.

585
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:40,365
There’s so much more embracing

586
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,232
Still to be done, but time is racing…

587
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:55,778
Oh, well. We’ll catch up some other time.

588
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,422
It’s just always weird when you find stuff like that out.

589
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:05,600
You know, later on in your life.

590
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,086
I mean, I had no idea that I wasn’t planned.

591
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:12,825
I’m not sure what difference it makes.

592
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:15,423
I mean, Maya wasn’t planned either.

593
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:16,700
We couldn’t love her any more than we do.

594
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,750
Yeah.

595
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:25,958
It’s just…

596
00:44:26,114 --> 00:44:27,100
I don’t know.

597
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,749
What?

598
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,591
I don’t like knowing that my whole existence is any accident.

599
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:41,866
It’s just too fucking…random.

600
00:44:43,211 --> 00:44:45,380
Yeah, but that’s the way it happened.

601
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,821
Things happen the way they’re meant to, Nate.

602
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,491
See, there’s a kind of fatalism in that that I just don’t buy.

603
00:44:56,457 --> 00:45:00,116
Well, what’s the alternative?

604
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,217
We make choices.

605
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:13,789
Yeah, but maybe your parents never would have chosen to get married

606
00:45:13,946 --> 00:45:17,310
if you hadn’t happened, and then not only would you not exist,

607
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:19,117
but Claire and David wouldn’t either.

608
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,257
It’s just not what was meant to happen.

609
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:27,199
But surely we’re more than just…things that happen.

610
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,310
Maybe we are. Maybe we’re not.

611
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,490
Oh, I love it when she does that!

612
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:37,564
…when she does that.

613
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:39,300
When she sort of jerks, ya know?

614
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:40,816
Right before she falls…

615
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:43,692
…off to sleep, wakes herself up.

616
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,124
You freaked out the first time…

617
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,576
…she ever did it.

618
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:52,419
I remember that feeling of falling…

619
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:53,157
…falling…

620
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:56,218
…when I was little, like I was falling out of bed,

621
00:45:57,414 --> 00:46:00,665
and it always woke me up, like I was scared of…

622
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,428
…what you were going to fall into?

623
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:07,585
Yeah. But that never happens to me anymore.

624
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:12,928
Don’t be so sure of that.

625
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:16,524
What’s going on with you?

626
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,020
I think I dreamed this.

627
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,204
What?

628
00:46:23,856 --> 00:46:26,120
This moment.

629
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:31,259
This. This life we have together. You, me, Maya.

630
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:33,558
Here.

631
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,828
Now.

632
00:47:07,038 --> 00:47:13,654
I hope you enjoy the show. sync by youyoup
