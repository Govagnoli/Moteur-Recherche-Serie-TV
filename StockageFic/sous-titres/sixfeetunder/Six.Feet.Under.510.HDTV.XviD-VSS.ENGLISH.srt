Saison 5 Episode 10
"All alone"

8
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,634
It's crazy.

9
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:13,667
And I get there and guess what ?

10
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,601
There is no death !

11
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,567
Wasn't it a relief
when you realized that ?

12
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:22,267
Nate ! Thank god !

13
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:22,334
Maya ?

14
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,367
Hey, honey.

15
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,767
Where's my daddy ?

16
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,968
Um...

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Daddy's not here.

18
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,901
Ooh, I bet they love it !

19
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,067
Hi, greg.

20
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:45,334
Don't worry. Whatever it
was we will pay you for it.

21
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,701
It's okay.

22
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,133
Did you sleep at all ?

23
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,100
The bo aren't up yet, are they ?

24
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,634
I'll take care of breakfast.

25
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,467
Why don't you go back to bed
and try and get a little sleep ?

26
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:07,801
I can't. I have to pick up nate's body.

27
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
Can't rico do it ?

28
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,400
I should do it, keith. He's my brother.

29
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,434
- Well, maybe it's too much.
- It's not.

30
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:21,033
So right after breakfast you have to take
the boys to get suits for the funeral.

31
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,067
You know, I can be with you today.

32
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,100
I mean, it doesn't
matter what the boys wear.

33
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,801
It does matter to me.

34
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,400
I'd start at nordstrom's.
They're having a sale.

35
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,400
It's okay if the sleeves
are a little long,

36
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,667
But if you really need alterations...

37
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,767
Take them to lester's on vine.

38
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,234
Tell them that you need
it first thing tomorrow.

39
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,334
Say david fisher sent you.
I wrote down the address.

40
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,133
I didn't know he wanted
his organs harvested.

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,367
His wife approved it.
Is there a problem ?

42
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,734
No, of course not.

43
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:24,033
- It'll save a lot of people's lives.
- I know.

44
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,534
Oh, fuck !

45
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,801
You want one ?

46
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,934
I got them from your
brother, but they suck.

47
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,501
Stupid cunt !

48
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:01,100
You want me to make you something else ?

49
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,968
Yogurt ?

50
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,033
Oatmeal ?

51
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,000
How about a scotch and soda ?

52
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,334
Is it too soon for another pill ?

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,000
- When did you take your last one ?
- Three hours ago.

54
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,767
Sure, go ahead.

55
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,200
Don't worry. If you get addicted...

56
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:21,934
I have a lot of experience
getting people through withdrawal.

57
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,234
Mm.

58
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,067
- You can have it all.
- Mm.

59
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,801
I wish you were a food medicator.

60
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,868
When my second husband died...

61
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,968
I couldn't stop eating
for an entire year.

62
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,734
It really helped.

63
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,801
Hey there !

64
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,767
- Hi.
- There's coffee !

65
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:51,334
Oh, no thanks. I think I've
already had too much coffee today.

66
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,634
I made you some eggs.

67
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,033
You see how much your mom enjoyed hers.

68
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,200
- Oh, thank you, but I'm fine.

69
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:05,467
Why didn't you call dr. Paolo ?

70
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:08,033
Mom, I told you he was out of town.

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,467
But this was an emergency.

72
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,968
I don't understand why
no one even spoke to him.

73
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,501
They thought he was going to be fine.

74
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,434
He was talking to us, mom.

75
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:18,968
He really seemed okay.

76
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,767
But none of it makes any sense !

77
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,734
Sometimes things just don't.

78
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:28,367
David, is there anything i
can do to, like, help you ?

79
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,234
What do you mean ? Why
would I need any help ?

80
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,234
I just mean, like, dealing.

81
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,901
I can deal, thank you.

82
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,901
You can help me call people.

83
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,801
- The list is in the office.
- Okay.

84
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:43,567
- When's the service ?
- Tomorrow at noon.

85
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:47,334
I think we should wait a few days
so people have time to get here.

86
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,734
Nate didn't want to embalmed.

87
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,234
- How do you know ?
- He told me.

88
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,267
Twice.

89
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,467
But we're going to-

90
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,334
What ?

91
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,534
Nothing. Never mind.

92
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:15,634
This was the pre-Need he filled
out before the first surgery.

93
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,133
But that was three years ago.

94
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,133
He said he wanted a cremation

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,534
And rabbi ari hoffman to do the service.

96
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,000
She was supposed to
marry us the first time.

97
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,667
Oh, right.

98
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:33,000
But just last week

99
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:36,901
He said he wanted a "green funeral."

100
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,400
What's that ?

101
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:43,367
It's an environmentally, uh...

102
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,934
Friendly process. It's natural.

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,133
The body is placed in the
ground, wrapped in a shroud.

104
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,567
No embalming or casket.

105
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:56,133
And people often
purchase a resting place

106
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,167
In a designated park kind of area

107
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:02,000
As a way to conserve the land.

108
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,133
Well, that sounds nice.

109
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,834
Officially, we're supposed
to honor the signed document,

110
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,133
But I think he...

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,567
Intended to change the
pre-Need and just never-

112
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,567
Didn't have time to.

113
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,701
So it's up to you as his spouse

114
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,133
To decide what you think
he would have wanted.

115
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,167
I have no idea.

116
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,701
No fucking idea.

117
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,801
I mean, rabbi ari ?

118
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:38,934
And now, apparently, he
is some kind of quaker.

119
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,200
Was, I mean.

120
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:48,467
You know, maybe we should just ask
maggie what he would have wanted.

121
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,901
What does maggie have to do with it ?

122
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,501
Are you making decisions
about nate's funeral ?

123
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,501
We're just discussing
what he might have wanted.

124
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,901
Doesn't my opinion mean
something ? He's my son.

125
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:02,834
I
- I didn't think you'd want to talk about it.

126
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:06,934
I want him buried in the
family plot next to his father.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,667
Well, he wanted to be
buried in a nature preserve.

128
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,367
- But I want him next to me.
- Well, then you can go there too then.

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,067
Hey, david.

130
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,534
You okay ?

131
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:40,133
I know. I still can't believe it.

132
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,400
It's like... now we just
go on with everything ?

133
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,801
That's what people do.

134
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,834
Yeah, I guess so.

135
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,868
I guess so.

136
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,534
Uh, so, um...

137
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,133
Look, I'll, um...

138
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,801
- I'll take care of the felix pickup.
- What ?

139
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,234
The guy at the nursing home.

140
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,334
I'll take care of the whole funeral.

141
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,133
You don't have to worry about anything.

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,033
We can't take that funeral.

143
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,901
- What do you mean ?
- I don't want anyone else here during nate's service.

144
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:13,033
David, they have a pre-Need.

145
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,400
- They paid for the
funeral 10 years ago.

146
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,634
Rico, please, just work it out.

147
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,133
Maya, eat your apple sauce.

148
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,667
No.

149
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,801
Well, you have to eat something !

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,267
I'm sorry, honey.

151
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,501
I'm so sorry. I, um...

152
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,801
I knocked over your plant.

153
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,434
I'll replace it.

154
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,901
What are you doing here ?

155
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,901
I though you might need-

156
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,434
Um...

157
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,667
I made you guys a quiche.

158
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:04,767
I didn't want to bother you.

159
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,501
I was just gonna leave it.

160
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,567
But, uh, then...

161
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,601
Oh, brenda, I'm so sorry.

162
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,501
What is this, some kind of quaker thing ?

163
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,400
You fuck someone's husband to death

164
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,534
And then you bring them a quiche ?

165
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,901
Would you please just admit it ?

166
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,934
It would be such relief to know

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,567
When my marriage turned
into a total fucking lie.

168
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:33,033
- Oh, it's not like that.
- Like what ? God !

169
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,901
It's not like anything you're imagining.

170
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:37,667
Nate loved you.

171
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,300
I don't need you to tell me
how my husband felt about me !

172
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,868
Even if he was pissed off at me,

173
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:47,634
He certainly wasn't in love
with you even if he said he was.

174
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,467
Nate could be very convincing that way.

175
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:55,234
But all he ever wanted was
someone who could make him feel

176
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,801
Like he was a better
man than he actually was.

177
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,801
Could've been anyone.

178
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,200
Why didn't I er get a stupid cell phone ?

179
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,334
'Cause you hate 'em.

180
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,200
Well, if I had one like every
other person in the world...

181
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,300
It wouldn't have saved him.

182
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:45,467
Why did claire have to
make me go get my hair cut ?

183
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,567
I've been cutting my own hair for years.

184
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:52,734
Why did she have to
tease me about it now ?

185
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,834
When did you have your last pill, hon ?

186
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:59,167
I
- I don't want another pill.

187
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,801
I want my son.

188
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,067
I want my beautiful son.

189
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,567
I know.

190
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,667
I know you do.

191
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,334
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

192
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:40,834
- I know.
- Nate ?

193
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,267
Nate's the one who matters.

194
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,968
You know, I love you, son,

195
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,767
But nate
- Nate's my little m.

196
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,501
I'm a man, dad.

197
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,234
Oh, don't get your ass in a
knot. You know what I mean.

198
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,181
You were the one we
thought we could lose.

199
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:00,176
What, with aids and picking up
strange men on the side of the road,

200
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:03,867
And screwing a whore with no condom.
You know, all that sort of thing.

201
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,895
You've been begging for some kind
of annihilation your entire life.

202
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,669
- That's not true.
- It's like a cosmic joke.

203
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,552
Oh, god.

204
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,934
Your poor mother.

205
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,467
She-She must be going insane.

206
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,200
He was her favorite.

207
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,543
- Who was yours ?
- Claire has always been my little gal.

208
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,501
- You know how that is.
- You barely even knew Claire.

209
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,595
Pretty little heartbreaker.

210
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,210
Just like her mom...

211
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,656
Before she cracked.

212
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,717
- You make me sick.
- The feeling's mutual, cupcake.

213
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,271
Come on, Durrell, where are you ?

214
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,224
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

215
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,055
No. No, no, you have
to wear your new shoes.

216
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:47,037
The pants drag on the floor with those.

217
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,455
Just put them on. We've go to
drop off something at my boss's

218
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:50,671
Before we go to the fisher's.

219
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,525
Look, I'm telling you
the pants are too long.

220
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:56,351
All right, maybe we can
get them hemmed on the way.

221
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,055
But then we have to leave now.

222
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,868
David ?

223
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,087
Excuse me.

224
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,355
I'm sure Brenda brought
some clothes, but I...

225
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:25,443
I happened to see his
- His best suit,

226
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,194
Fresh from the cleaner.

227
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,213
- We're not having a viewing.
- Why not ?

228
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,147
Mom, I told you he didn't
want to be embalmed or made up.

229
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,959
But people need a viewing.

230
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,734
You can look at him now.

231
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:45,434
When he came out of the surgery

232
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:48,312
What exactly did the doctor say ?

233
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,334
Mom, I've told you this 100 times.

234
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,326
Well, you haven't been clear about it.

235
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,936
If he said everything was fine

236
00:17:56,973 --> 00:18:00,049
And nate was awake and talking, then...

237
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,481
Clearly something went terribly wrong !

238
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:05,767
What, do you think I killed him ?

239
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:07,875
Is that what you're
trying to get me to say ?

240
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,588
- How dare you speak to me that way !
- How dare you !

241
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,200
I lost him too, mom !

242
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,650
All you've been doing is accusing
me of doing the wrong thing !

243
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,834
At least I was there !

244
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,617
Fuck !

245
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,334
What ?

246
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,534
I, um...

247
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,467
I picked up the programs.

248
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,767
Thank you.

249
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,358
Thanks.

250
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,274
- Ted Fairwell.
- Hi, it's Claire.

251
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,786
Hey, how are you ?

252
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm bad.

253
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,950
My brother is dead.

254
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,213
Oh my god.

255
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,119
What happened ?

256
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,945
Uh, I kind of have to
get out of here and, um...

257
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:14,720
I don't think I can drive.

258
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,753
Are you like really busy ?

259
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:20,601
No.

260
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,167
No.

261
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,448
I'll be right over.

262
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,114
- Jesus christ !
- Roger ?

263
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,358
You trashed me !

264
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:34,865
- You two stay here.
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker !

265
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,185
God damn it ! River !

266
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,809
What are you doing ? That
was my coomb's kitty !

267
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:42,307
"Tit for tat," you said.
You got your fucking tit !

268
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,809
Now where's my cocksucking tat ?

269
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:46,171
I had to call in a lot of
favors to get you that part.

270
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,072
It's not my fault they fired
you after the table read !

271
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,077
I was "marky," man !

272
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,640
Why didn't you tell
them I have the chops ?

273
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,819
- I'm cool !
- I said you were a comic genius.

274
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:56,912
You think I wasn't embarrassed when
they told me you stunk up the place ?

275
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,481
You didn't fight for
me. Everyone sells me out

276
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,800
- My fucking life !
- What ?

277
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,363
You need to calm down now !

278
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,725
Now what am I gonna do ?

279
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,081
I told my mom. I did a mailing !

280
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,049
Keith, I need you to take
him to the Van Nuys airport.

281
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,975
I've got a friend at Warner's
letting me use the jet.

282
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,100
I can't go to Van Nuys.

283
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:15,951
That's a reoccurring
on "two and a half men"

284
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:16,871
I'm perfect for !

285
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:19,632
I just want to send him
to Cabo till he settles down.

286
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,017
- I've got my kids.
- It's fine. Take them with you.

287
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,918
I just wanna show you how good I can be.

288
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,604
Shut up, trevor. You got your shot.

289
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,458
Look, we're on our way to a
funeral. David's brother died.

290
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,604
I'm so sorry. That's awful.

291
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:33,125
- Is there anything I can do ?
- You can take care of this yourself.

292
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:36,266
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, but I've
been overpaying you for a year.

293
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:39,069
This is the first time I've
really needed you to do something.

294
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:42,022
Uh, Keith, we've got
to get my pants fixed.

295
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,923
You can't go to a
funeral without those hemmed.

296
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,289
Leave the boys with me and
i'll have my girl do them.

297
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,444
- She's a genius.
- I'm t leaving my boys with you !

298
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,289
We'll hem the pants and
drop them off with david.

299
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,256
Please, let me help you help me.

300
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,393
Keith, I'm a good father. I
can handle two kids for an hour.

301
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,191
Okay.

302
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,303
But don't talk to 'em too much.

303
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,853
- Can we have beer ?
- No !

304
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,956
- Have we met somewhere ?
- No ! Shut up !

305
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:13,017
Oh, sweetie.

306
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:17,444
My god.

307
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,585
Damn, you've had a shitty year.

308
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:25,219
- I got your dress.
- Thanks.

309
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,914
They swore to me it would fit.

310
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,285
And I picked up one for maya.

311
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,116
And I brought some lox and vodka.

312
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,740
Great. I can't drink. Lox has mercury.

313
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:39,031
Oh, please, a couple shots
of stoli won't kill the baby.

314
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:41,590
You know, in my day we
used to sit on our ass

315
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,594
Smoking parl iaments for nine months.

316
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:47,430
Today, you have one piece of
brie and everybody goes berserk.

317
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,247
Come on, sweetheart.

318
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,055
Here, have some of this.
It'll take the edge off.

319
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,073
I don't wanna take the edgoff.

320
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,191
I guess I'm just
blathering on like an idiot.

321
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,684
I don't know what to say, honey.

322
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,763
I'm just so sorry.

323
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,834
Hello, you.

324
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,886
How are you, maya ?

325
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,576
I think she's a little confused.

326
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,557
Where's my daddy ?

327
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:18,632
Oh, god ! I don't-

328
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,172
Your daddy...

329
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,012
Has gone away for a very long time.

330
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,332
Mom, you can't say that !

331
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:32,369
Honey, daddy's dead.

332
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,430
That means that he's
not coming back ever.

333
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,416
Brenda ! Jesus ! You know,
soften it up a little.

334
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,435
That's what #s the book said
to do. I even went online.

335
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:42,026
They all say you have to be
clear or she gets confused.

336
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,069
When is daddy coming back ?

337
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,491
Daddy's dead.

338
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,651
Remember, like, nemo's mom ?

339
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:49,721
Remember how we talked about that ?

340
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,102
You know what, Brenda ?

341
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,951
I think you should save this discussion

342
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,693
For a time when you're
less insane with grief.

343
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:59,515
I'm not insane with grief, mom !

344
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,407
Sweetie, you go on.

345
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:03,585
Go ahead, play with
your toys, sweetheart.

346
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,069
Have you talked to billy ?
He's not returning my calls.

347
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:09,707
Oh, I suppose he's still in dubal.

348
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,181
Jesus, I hope they
haven't taken him hostage.

349
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,829
He's not very docile.

350
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:15,843
I'm sure he hasn't
been taken hostage, mom.

351
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:18,599
You're right. It's
just that I'm a wreck.

352
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,125
I can't believe we're both widows.

353
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:22,623
It's just so horrifying.

354
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:24,773
At least you've got olivier.

355
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:27,454
Well, he walked out on me last week.

356
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,083
You know, I didn't want
to make today about me, but...

357
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,458
The truth is, I want
to fucking kill myself.

358
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,148
I mean, god, the pain is just searing.

359
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,928
I know it's not the same.

360
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,665
But we're both alone now.

361
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,416
No, it's not the same.

362
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,548
Not at all.

363
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:58,209
So... are we going
anywhere in particular ?

364
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,313
No.

365
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,519
Do you mind just driving ?

366
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,379
I don't mind.

367
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:12,519
What is this, a mix ?

368
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,430
Yeah.

369
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,801
I love "top 40."

370
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:20,271
I'm sorry, but it just
sounds so good sometimes.

371
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:33,024
I don't know why I keep thinking about

372
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,944
These stupid fights
I had with my brother,

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,695
Not like any of the
good times, or whatever.

374
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,845
- Isn't that horrible ?
- No.

375
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:47,338
I can't think of anything
nice about my sister.

376
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,474
But I like Nate.

377
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,132
I mean, you know I did.

378
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:58,939
- What are you thinking of ?
- Just weird things.

379
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:01,103
Like this time, um...

380
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:03,780
It was right after my dad died.

381
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,122
I had to write this
idiotic english paper

382
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:11,507
Where you're supposed to interview

383
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:14,967
The person in your family
that you knew the least.

384
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:17,244
My dad was dead.

385
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,911
And it was pretty much a
toss-up between those two anyway.

386
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:27,254
Until I asked nate if I could, uh...

387
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:31,409
Interview him, and he said no.

388
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,386
It was not like it was
some big traumatic thing.

389
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:37,376
It was just...

390
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,672
I'm sorry.

391
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:44,357
I'm sorry. This is so gross.

392
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:47,522
It's okay. It's okay.

393
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,200
It's okay.

394
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,376
I don't know why I keep
thinking about that time !

395
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:01,691
Thank you for being so
flexible. Okay. Bye-Bye.

396
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,803
Can you zip me ?

397
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,437
Where's angie ?

398
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:08,273
She called. She's gonna
be 10 minutes late.

399
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,907
- That's 20 minutes. Fuck !
- Hey.

400
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,418
- The kids can hear you.
- What's gonna happen with the business

401
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,309
Now that there's no one to stop david
from spending 300 grand

402
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,202
on a crematorium ?

403
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,785
What's wrong with you ? This
is what you're thinking about ?

404
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,526
Do you know how little savings we have ?

405
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,583
What if something were to
happen to me ? What would you do ?

406
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,301
- You and the kids, what would you have ?
- Nothing is gonna happen to you.

407
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,015
How do you know ? Something
could happen to you !

408
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,650
- We still don't have any life insurance.

409
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:33,663
Okay, we'll get it tomorrow.

410
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:34,977
Where is she ?

411
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,489
Did she need to get her
outfit right for baby-sitting ?

412
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:40,470
You want to go ahead of me ?

413
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,691
- Is that okay ?
- Yeah.

414
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:46,123
Okay. Uh, then I'll see you there.

415
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:47,944
Okay.

416
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:04,695
He's not there.

417
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:06,273
Yes, he is too.

418
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,813
Wow, you guys look great.

419
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,555
How do you like the length ?

420
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:12,559
It's perfect.

421
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:15,808
David, I am so sorry about your brother.

422
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,935
Thank you. Where's Keith ?

423
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,751
We had a situation.

424
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:24,793
I'm so sorry,

425
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,662
But he just threw this guy at me.

426
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:28,563
I just got to get him on
a plane and then I can go.

427
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:30,981
Well, couldn't you just say no today ?

428
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,465
I know. I'm sorry.

429
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,145
But I swear I'll be there soon, okay ?

430
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,174
David !

431
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:42,699
This is total bullshit, man.

432
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,554
I've got to get out of here.

433
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,798
Hey, I know where I know you from.

434
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,183
You're that guy in the blowjob video.

435
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,563
Sorry, wrong guy.

436
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,624
You are too, man.

437
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:59,455
- The one where Roger's giving you head.
- A video ?

438
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,310
Dude, I've seen it like 20 times.

439
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,502
Roger played it every time we had sex.

440
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,995
He can't come without it.

441
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,831
Does he pay you extra for that
or is that part of the job ?

442
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,380
Hey, where are you going ?

443
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,512
Hey, hey !

444
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:20,361
Where are you going ?

445
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,873
So why don't you like your sister ?

446
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,615
Just the older one, Caroline.

447
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,699
She's just kind of mean.

448
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:35,070
Which is kind of weird,
because she does this noble work

449
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,361
Helping refugees.

450
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,394
So to the world at large she's a saint.

451
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,681
But if you're actually
a person in her life,

452
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,582
She's just a bitch.

453
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:47,676
Like when my little sister
was going through chemo

454
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:51,634
Caroline came by to
help her like twice...

455
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,972
In three years.

456
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,634
That is pretty bad.

457
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:00,296
Is your other sister okay ?

458
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,371
Yeah. Betsy.

459
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,033
She was lucky.

460
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:09,756
That's good.

461
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,906
I have to go back.

462
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:25,685
Okay. Okay.

463
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,742
There you are.

464
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,131
How are you ?

465
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,709
Thanks for making it.

466
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,995
Are the boys okay ?

467
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,690
They're upstairs in a state of bliss.

468
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:47,394
Roger bought them iPods.

469
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:02,047
God wh take someone's son

470
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:05,144
At the one moment
they were ever in their whole lives

471
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:06,864
not able to be with him ?

472
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,774
What kind of a message is that ?

473
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:13,394
I don't think it's helpful
to see it as a message to you.

474
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:15,164
Then why would it happen that way ?

475
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:18,202
Unless there really is no god.

476
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:21,202
It's natural to be angry.

477
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:24,887
But maybe it's best
to view god as a light

478
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:28,629
Through this dark time, as opposed
to seeing him as the cause of it.

479
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:32,436
- God is an asshole !
- Yes, god is a huge asshole !

480
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:35,652
And I fucking hate him for this.

481
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,418
We're gonna get you through
this, honey, all right ?

482
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,784
You're not alone. You're not alone.

483
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:43,133
You could've dressed.

484
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,986
I couldn't.

485
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:49,615
The rest of us managed.

486
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:52,767
Well, the rest of you win.

487
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,012
I think we're all in shock.

488
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:18,971
Three years ago...

489
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:21,633
We prayed for Nate's life.

490
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,707
And we thought our
prayers were answered.

491
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,548
Now, we have to pray

492
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,984
For help making sense of this loss.

493
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,552
Because...

494
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:36,693
We've lost a lot-

495
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:39,811
A son...

496
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,674
A father...

497
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:43,538
A brother...

498
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,003
A husband...

499
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,703
A colleague...

500
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,313
To me an inspiration.

501
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:56,735
He had a natural sense...

502
00:32:58,468 --> 00:33:02,097
He had a natural sense of what to
say to people when they were grieving.

503
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:05,961
And, uh, I just think he'd
know what to say to help us...

504
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,679
If only he where here. Thank you.

505
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:45,238
I'm david fisher and
nate was my big brother.

506
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:49,566
When we were kids I used
to get picked on at school.

507
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,022
I had come home with my face

508
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,299
Or my pride bruise

509
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:57,280
And nate would make
me tell him who did it.

510
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:00,228
And he would go talk to
whoever was tormenting me.

511
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:02,266
And I'd be fine-

512
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,711
Until it happened again. So Nate
came up with another strategy.

513
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,171
He said...

514
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,256
"When they start in on you
just laugh, laugh at them.

515
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:20,575
Even if they hit you, laugh."

516
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:22,439
Well, I could never pull that off.

517
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:23,833
But that was Nate.

518
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,054
He could laugh at anything and
people were always drawn to him,

519
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:30,598
Because he could make the
best of the worst situation.

520
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,566
Even when life hit him,

521
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,655
It couldn't ki-

522
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,608
Ki-

523
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:19,486
My name is George Sibley.

524
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,179
I was Nate's stepfather.

525
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,601
This is a hard day.

526
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,582
And we're all very upset.

527
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:38,488
The loss of a young person
is always a terrible blow.

528
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:41,883
But in this case...

529
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,183
It-It's even more cruel,

530
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,399
Because nate was an idealist.

531
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,141
And...

532
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:51,765
He struggled...

533
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:55,103
All through his life...

534
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,272
To be a good man.

535
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,817
He wasn't perfect,

536
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,817
But then who among us is ?

537
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,836
And he never gave up on himself...

538
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:09,714
The people he loved...

539
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,437
Or even love itself,

540
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:16,972
In all its vexing, beautiful forms.

541
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:27,390
Oh, claire.

542
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,648
There's too much cold
cuts out there already.

543
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:32,690
Here, take this scary
fruit cake instead.

544
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:46,400
How're you feeling ?

545
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:49,756
Okay.

546
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,310
I should go back downstairs.

547
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:56,160
It's all right if you need to rest.

548
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,836
You can go down if you want.

549
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:03,267
I want to stay with you.

550
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,976
I'm sorry for what I said.

551
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:17,582
I'm sorry.

552
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:20,826
You lost him too.

553
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:28,587
You and I are really
the most alike, you know ?

554
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,723
And sometimes maybe...

555
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,000
It makes it hard.

556
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,343
Hey.

557
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,164
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,507
- How's it going ?
- Okay.

559
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,723
Many questions.

560
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,069
Hey, honey.

561
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:00,585
- Hey.
- Did you go ?

562
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:02,759
No.

563
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,961
Maya, why didn't you tell
somebody you needed to go potty ?

564
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:11,679
Do I have to get you a diaper ?

565
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,571
God, she's been doing this for months.

566
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,721
Sometimes they regress
when they're upset.

567
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,735
Oh God ! We're going to the
cemetery in like two minutes.

568
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:21,439
You know what ? I'll clean her
up. You just go. Don't worry.

569
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:23,547
- Thanks.
- Yup.

570
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:33,655
Just trying to keep things tidy.

571
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,707
Thank you.

572
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:39,167
We're leaving for the cemetery soon.

573
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,834
- It's just going to be family.
- I understand.

574
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:46,501
Would you care to join us ?

575
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,501
Yes. Very much.

576
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,033
I wouldn't want joy to come

577
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,300
If she happens to be here somewhere.

578
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,167
She's not here.

579
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:01,067
I have no idea where she is...

580
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,100
Ever...

581
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,934
Anymore.

582
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,834
Here you go. Hey, claire.

583
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,567
You can ride with david and keith.

584
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:16,901
George is driving
ruth, maggie and sarah.

585
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:18,968
Riding with your mom ?

586
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,667
Uh, no, she's not going.

587
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,767
Well, you can ride with me and nate.

588
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,334
No, I'll drive myself, thanks.

589
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,267
I don't think you should do
that. There's room with david.

590
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,934
- I'm fine, really.
- Okay.

591
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,534
Well, listen, here are the
directions and my cell phone

592
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,567
In case you get lost or something.

593
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,567
Thanks.

594
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:39,634
Don't forget this.

595
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,234
God damn it !

596
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,367
David, are you okay ?

597
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,868
David ?

598
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:31,601
I can't go out there right now.

599
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:34,567
- What do you mean ?
- You go.

600
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:36,334
Look, I'll be out there in a minute.

601
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,434
- I can stay with you.
- No, just give me a minute !

602
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:41,534
Okay.

603
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,100
There's no coffin ?

604
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,000
He didn't want one.

605
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:57,434
It's more natural this way.

606
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:03,434
Where's david ?

607
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:06,400
I think the three of us can handle this.

608
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:17,801
Oh, man.

609
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:32,701
Where do we put him ?

610
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:35,767
Uh, on the ground, I guess.

611
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:38,667
Won't he get dirty ?

612
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:42,601
Dust to dust.

613
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,534
- Wasn't there a poem he wanted read ?
- Where's david ?

614
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:58,267
I think he's just a
little too upset, ruth.

615
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:00,767
We're all upset.

616
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,033
That's right, sweetie.
We're all fucking upset.

617
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,601
Sometimes we can't be
everywhere we want to be.

618
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,534
Yes, well, sometimes we can.

619
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:22,300
Oh, god !

620
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,601
David ?

621
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:41,567
We're starting the ceremony now.

622
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:45,400
I can't.

623
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:51,200
If you don't get out of this car,
you will hate yourself forever.

624
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,334
- I know, but I can't.
- Yes, you can.

625
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,300
You have legs.

626
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:59,200
I am not doing this without you.

627
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:01,467
Mom, please, I'm so
dizzy I can't breathe.

628
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,801
Well, we'll wait until you can.

629
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,501
Could someone ?

630
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:31,734
From the "mystic odes" of rumi.

631
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:37,534
"Our death is our wedding with eternity.

632
00:44:37,601 --> 00:44:39,801
What is the secret ?

633
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:42,267
'God is one.'

634
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:46,100
The sunlight splits when
entering the windows of the house.

635
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:49,834
This multiplicity exists
in the cluster of grapes;

636
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:53,367
It is not in the juice
made from the grapes.

637
00:44:53,434 --> 00:44:56,067
For he who is living
in the light of god,

638
00:44:56,133 --> 00:45:00,534
The death of the carnal
soul is a blessing.

639
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,901
Regarding him say neither bad nor good

640
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:08,334
For he has gone beyond
the good and the bad.

641
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,601
Fix your eyes on god and do not
talk about what is invisible,

642
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:17,334
So that he may place
another look in your eyes.'"

643
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,634
* what else should I be ? *

644
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,133
* all apologies. *

645
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,834
Nate ?

646
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:33,100
Hey.

647
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,534
Kurt cobain died today.

648
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,400
Oh.

649
00:45:41,467 --> 00:45:43,367
He killed himself.

650
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:46,467
He was just too pure for this world.

651
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,701
Well, his music will live on.

652
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,534
Yeah.

653
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:55,868
Yeah, it will.

654
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:04,000
- You wanna try some ?
- Yeah.

655
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:10,434
"It is the eternal
light which is the light of god.

656
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,767
The ephemeral light is
an attribute of the body

657
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,634
And the flesh.

658
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:21,634
...oh god, who gives
the grace of vision.

659
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:24,767
The bird of vision is flying toward you

660
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:29,567
With the wings of desire."

661
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,000
One, two...

662
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:55,100
Oh, shit ! Sorry.

663
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,934
Thanks, claire.

664
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,467
One, two, three. Easy.

665
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:14,400
Easy.

666
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,567
Okay.

667
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:30,467
Did you like the poem I chose ?

668
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,067
No, I hated it. Mystical maudlin crap.

669
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:35,767
You just don't understand it.

670
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:38,701
I'm about 20 times smarter
than you. I understood it.

671
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,467
It's not about being smart, brenda.

672
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:43,167
It's about having spiritual
depth. Maggie understood it.

673
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,634
Maggie's a mealy-Mouthed little cunt.

674
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:47,667
She couldn't even admit she fucked you !

675
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,934
Maybe she doesn't wanna
pollute what she and I shared

676
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,934
By handing it over to
your filthy imagination-

677
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,734
What you shared ? Adultery
while your wife's pregnant

678
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:56,567
And raising your child
from another woman ?

679
00:49:56,634 --> 00:49:59,601
You will always think of
maya that way, won't you ?

680
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,734
Even when she's calling
you mommy you think,

681
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,634
"I'm stuck raising
some dead bitch's kid."

682
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,400
No, I'm a good mother to her.

683
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:08,367
You were a great mother when you
yelled at her for having an accident.

684
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,000
I didn't mean to yell at her.

685
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:12,267
You just wanted me to plug
you with your own baby,

686
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:13,634
And now you've got that.

687
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:15,534
So you can drop the
wronged-Little-Wife routine.

688
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:18,133
- Why are you saying this ?
- You could've married joe

689
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,400
If you wanted to be with somebody
who wanted to be with you.

690
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,467
But deep down, you know that
anybody who wants to be with you

691
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:25,400
- Is a fucking idiot.
- Shut up !

692
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:27,601
Because just like everybody
else in your psychotic family

693
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,701
You have to destroy everything
and everyone you love !

694
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,767
Please, leave me alone !

695
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:34,701
Okay, just leave me alone !

696
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:42,801
We brought you some alphabet soup.

697
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:45,234
It was all we had.

698
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,334
Oh, thank you.

699
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,100
I even loaded some smooth jazz
onto my ipod for you to listen to.

700
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,000
Wow, thanks.

701
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:58,334
I had no idea you guys
were such good nurses.

702
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,501
Yeah, well.

703
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:03,601
You learn something new every day.

704
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm gonna come over
there and destroy you !

705
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,834
Yeah, you do.

706
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:10,534
I don't care where they found
him, roger ! Okay, I quit !

707
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,534
Uh-Oh.

708
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:14,200
No ! You are one sick dude !

709
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:16,734
I don't want to be anywhere
near you ever again !

710
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:19,400
He's not gonna take
the ipods away, is he ?

711
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:22,467
- I'm serious, roger ! I've had it with you !
- I hope not.

712
00:51:22,534 --> 00:51:24,734
I need my smooth jazz.

713
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,167
You better eat that while it's hot.

714
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:33,667
I forget how anyone gets over anything.

715
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,067
You don't really.

716
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,734
Don't say that. You do.

717
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,167
It's just time.

718
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:44,033
And remembing love, really.

719
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,033
What the hell does that mean ?

720
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,133
Slowly you fall back in love

721
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,634
With whatever really mattered to you.

722
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:57,834
Yes, and maybe you find a way

723
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:00,868
To make sense of what you've lost.

724
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,901
That doesn't seem possible.

725
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,868
Honey...

726
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,934
I don't want to freak you out...

727
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,267
But last night...

728
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,133
Uh, nate appeared to me in a dream.

729
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,834
He did ?

730
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:24,667
- Mm.
- What did he say ?

731
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:28,834
He didn't really say anything.

732
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:33,033
But he had a very loving presence.

733
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,334
Was he with someone ?

734
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,434
He-He was with me, I guess.

735
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:41,801
Are you sure he didn't
say anything about death ?

736
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,868
Well, he didn't have to say it, sweetie.

737
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:47,133
I got the message.

738
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh.

739
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,100
Hello, dear.

740
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,868
Grandma !

741
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:14,634
Oh, thank you.

742
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:17,534
Come upstairs, dear.

743
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,701
I can't do this right now.

744
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:26,701
I need you to take her for
- I don't know how long.

745
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:29,033
- Of course.
- Plus, I don't want to make things

746
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,834
Worse for her if I can.

747
00:53:31,901 --> 00:53:34,067
I can't do-

748
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:44,434
Maya,

749
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:47,968
You stay with grandma, okay ?

750
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:50,634
You're gonna have so
much fun with grandma.

751
00:53:53,234 --> 00:53:55,434
I love you.

752
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:45,834
- It's just me.
- Fuck !

753
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:48,300
Oh, jesus, billy !

754
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,133
What are you doing ?

755
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:54,834
I tried to make it back
in time for the funeral.

756
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:57,000
Why didn't you call ?

757
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:02,267
I thought it was
better to just get here.

758
00:55:05,534 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh, god.

759
00:55:22,701 --> 00:56:46,434
* all in all is all we are *

760
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:51,868
* all and all is all we are. *
