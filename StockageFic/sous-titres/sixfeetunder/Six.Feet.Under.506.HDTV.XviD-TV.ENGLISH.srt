Saison 5 Episode 6
"The Rainbow of her reasons"

8
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:51,740
Boy, the air's thinner up
here than I would've thought.

9
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:53,730
Come on, fiona, you can do it !

10
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:57,301
I can't wait to show you
the view from the top !

11
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,103
You know, you were right.

12
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,756
It's good that I got out.

13
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,310
I think was getting a
little depressed inside.

14
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,765
Just me and the fumes from my kiln

15
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,267
And that morose N.P.R.

16
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:10,462
Here.

17
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,138
Take this. Come on !

18
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,598
All right.

19
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,167
Just through here you can
see all the way to the ocean.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,932
- Be careful up ahead.
- What ?

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,631
We're moments from the top,
mere moments.

22
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,340
I didn't think I was gonna-

23
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,034
Make it.

24
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,234
Fiona ?

25
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,934
Fiona ?

26
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,880
- This top doesn't fit.

27
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:06,439
It's the right top, it's the wrong
container. Put the broccoli in a ziploc.

28
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,016
They're didn't eat the
broccoli from yesterday.

29
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,026
- Where's the carrots ?
- Get off of me !

30
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,633
What is ?
What are you doing ?

31
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,073
Jesus.

32
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,317
All right, it's time to
go. Put your jacket on.

33
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,242
I'm not putting on
that busted old jacket.

34
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:22,800
- Yes, you are. We just got it !
- No, I'm not !

35
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,089
- I'm getting my other one.
- You're not the boss here, OK ?

36
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,352
- You want that one, go get it !
- I don't know where it is !

37
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,981
- Where did you put it ?
- I didn't put it anywhere !

38
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,702
- It's your jacket !
- I'll find the other jacket.

39
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,935
Just go brush your teeth, guys.

40
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,622
It's like he wants me to lose my temper.

41
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,867
No kid wants that. Just give him time.

42
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:41,500
You've been saying that for two weeks.

43
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,082
You have to remember
where he comes from,

44
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,716
What the social worker
said about his mother.

45
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:47,378
My sister's a drug addict.
Taylor never acted like this !

46
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:48,871
- Taylor's a girl.
- So ?

47
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:52,345
So she isn't hardwired to be
aggressive and territorial.

48
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,026
That's the reason she
doesn't have the same problem

49
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,073
With your father that you do.

50
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:59,608
So now everything that happened
between me and my father is my fault ?

51
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,533
No, I'm-

52
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:02,866
Is your brother ready ?

53
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,734
He wants to know where you put his hat.

54
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,468
I'll be in the car.

55
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:19,627
Why do you need mr. Sibley's name ?

56
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,101
No, Mr. Sibley is right here.

57
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,519
What are the last four
digits of your social ?

58
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,350
4281.

59
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,852
4281.

60
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:31,468
Correct.
Correct.

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,678
Correct.
I'll hold.

62
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:38,308
- Are you looking for something ?
- Yeah, the pots and pans.

63
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,772
Oh, I must have forgotten them.

64
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,523
We can just buy new ones.

65
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,434
I can go down to crate
& barrel right now.

66
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,368
We have practically a
brand-New set back at the house.

67
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,575
Well, I don't want to raid their supply.

68
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:52,730
But you loved that calphalon.

69
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,251
You raved about it when we got it.

70
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:57,842
That was because it was my first
experience with anodized aluminum.

71
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,260
We don't need those, we'll buy new ones.

72
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,185
It's an incredible waste of money.

73
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:03,636
I'm here.

74
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,880
Good.

75
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:08,143
And you do the gas as well ? Splendid.

76
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,312
No, thank you.

77
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,434
Did you talk to dean hikolos
about going back to work ?

78
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,241
No, I... I don't want to.

79
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,218
I'm not ready.

80
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,673
It'll be the summer session if at all.

81
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,700
I just thought you were
doing so much better.

82
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,058
Oh, I am.

83
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,969
And I wanna keep doing better,

84
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:35,288
Without all the stress and
strain of teaching school.

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,767
Will you look at that ?

86
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,700
Remember when we bought this ?

87
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,434
That's when you asked me to marry you.

88
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:55,279
Okay, I'll go get our pots and pans.

89
00:05:57,852 --> 00:05:59,626
I'll be back before you know it.

90
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll be waiting.

91
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:12,711
Okay, you did really well on
your typing test. Got a 95.

92
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,978
Thanks.

93
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,917
Don't worry, no one
ever has gotten 100.

94
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:18,950
One person did, but i
think she was psychic.

95
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,922
- Okay, we have one downtown- -
Oh, I should probably tell you,

96
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,725
I have applied for this
grant for emerging artists,

97
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,095
And if I get it which could be this month,

98
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:31,471
Or even this week, I'd have to
stop working, like, immediately.

99
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,945
Yeah well, "temp" is
short for temporary.

100
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,931
Okay, here we are.

101
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:38,217
"Quality control auditing
clerk, legal department,

102
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,931
Braeden chemical. Employee
verifies accuracy of figures,

103
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,842
Business transactions

104

As well as support the support
staff in general tasks."

105
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,922
- Sound good ?
- Okay.

106
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:51,260
Okay, let me call over there and
see if they've found anyone yet.

107
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:52,903
It's a very conservative company.

108
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:54,983
You do have corporate attire, right ?

109
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,232
Like a business suit ?

110
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,081
Or a nice blouse, a skirt, some hose.

111
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,213
I feel so lucky.

112
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:09,800
I am just so lucky to have been
with her in her final moments.

113
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,955
What a gift.

114
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:14,072
She was so alive.

115
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,804
And she was happy happy happy,

116
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,161
And excited to see the view.

117
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:23,631
You've never seen such a perfect
morning in topanga canyon.

118
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,434
Were either of you out this morning ?

119
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,598
No.

120
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,700
I can't believe Fiona's gone.

121
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,696
- You knew her too, huh ?
- Yeah, I did.

122
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,170
It's like the second
person you've known.

123
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,766
I know.

124
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,545
This just must be the
time when everyone's dying.

125
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:48,057
Nate, it was her time.

126
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,912
I was compelled to bring her.

127
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,437
I was driving through the
canyon to go on my hike

128
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,268
And my car just pulled
over into her driveway.

129
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:01,550
It's like something said,
"bring Fiona with you."

130
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:04,567
The spirit had to have her.

131
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,834
The spirit...

132
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,234
Works in mysterious ways.

133
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,184
Coroner's office.

134
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,480
She must be ready to go.

135
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:30,577
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:33,107
- We're gonna make it beautiful, right ?
- Yep.

137
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,549
Yay !

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,746
I love these flowers.

139
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,234
Ooh, they smell good. Smell them.

140
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,863
If y're upset, tell him.

141
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,046
If he loves you he should
be able to hear that.

142
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,734
I don't want to freak
him out unnecessarily.

143
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,003
I thought billy was back
on his medication.

144
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,098
Ah, that's what he says.
"I'm back on my meds"

145
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,531
like that's all that matters.
"Is he on or is he off ?"

146
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,822
He's completely oblivious to the
fact that we're all just exhausted.

147
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,038
They should call it
"bipolar asshole disorder."

148
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,785
Just tell him. Okay ? You need a break.

149
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,243
Yeah, that scares me too.

150
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,993
I feel like I have to keep him close

151
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:13,407
So that if he falls off
the edge someone will know.

152
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,745
People are starting
to notice I'm pregnant.

153
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:25,191
Brenda, you look beautiful.

154
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:28,191
- Okay, like a glowing mommy.
- Really.

155
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,313
Look, you've got one at
home and one in there,

156
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,745
You know, put your energy
where it deserves to be.

157
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,139
- Billy can take care of himself.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:41,698
Yeah, I know.

159
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,228
Okay.

160
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,322
You look hot.

161
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,754
I ought to look fucking hot. I've
been starving myself like a refugee.

162
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,284
Oh, you're funny.

163
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,543
I could've done that joke better.

164
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:01,374
I gotta to go to the airport
soon and pick up the babysitter.

165
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,631
Au pair.

166
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,389
Okay, that word is so "bougie." Please.

167
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,482
Okay, nanny, whatever.

168
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,210
This is l.A. Everybody
has live-In help.

169
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,013
I don't know.

170
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:11,176
Are you mad

171
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,867
I mean, that I can't help you
as much anymore ?

172
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,722
- Tell me.
- Don't.

173
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:18,309
Everything you ever
wanted is coming true.

174
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:21,543
It's just a stupid sitcom.
I'm sure it will get canceled.

175
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,187
I just... I don't want it to be weird
for you,

176
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:26,712
You know, having a stranger in the
house, especially from saskatchewan.

177
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,154
- Where the hell is saskatchewan ?
- Near calgary, I think.

178
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:32,755
To tell you the truth-

179
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:35,370
She can have horns and weigh
300 lbs. For all I care.

180
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,816
As long as she brings in the water bottles,
can be here when the cable guy comes

181
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,858
And starts putting away the
groceries that are melting

182
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:44,459
While I'm getting the rest out of
the car. I just need another adult.

183
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,374
Sarah ?

184
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:06,421
Oh, Ruthy, you never gonna
believe what happened.

185
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,229
Fiona's dead.

186
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,600
- Fiona ?
- Climbing.

187
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,769
I know you hated her
for what she did to Nate.

188
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,828
But we've lost her, Ruthy.

189
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,856
She's gone.

190
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:32,274
- I know, it's horrendous.
- Jesus, I can't imagine.

191
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:34,560
- There was nothing she could do ?
- No, nothing.

192
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,231
Fell hundreds of feet right
down to the bottom of the ravine,

193
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,532
And was dead when they pulled
her out. I'm just sick about it.

194
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,748
Fiona was a very close
friend of mine. Very close.

195
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:45,710
You sure you don't need
me to come over there ?

196
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,818
I think sarah's in shock.

197
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,978
It's not a pretty scene down here...

198
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,405
Only appropriate for family...
Of origin.

199
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:57,602
People, I need people. Who can we call ?

200
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,939
What did she say ?

201
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,091
She's just jabbering.
She's incoherent.

202
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,757
- Keep me posted.
- Okay. Bye.

203
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:08,893
Get me my phone book.
It's in my satchel.

204
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,518
I need to circle the wagons.

205
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:18,410
Do I need to come down there ?

206
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:21,738
Okay okay, I'll stop by the office
when I come to pick the boys up.

207
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,269
Bye.

208
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,372
Durrell pulled a fire alarm.

209
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,518
Now I have to make an
appointment with the principal.

210
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,521
I can't tell keith.

211
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,639
He's just looking for more proof
these kids are too messed up for us.

212
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,681
- The foster's just temporary, right ?
- No, not really.

213
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,747
They try to get them in the right
place, have it lead to actual adoption.

214
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,136
- That's the ideal.
- You want to keep them ?

215
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,114
I do.

216
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:51,743
Anthony's so cute I'd
keep him in a heartbeat.

217
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:54,302
Durrell, on the other hand, is a mess.

218
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,841
But what can you expect ? These
kids come from a broken home.

219
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,339
Their dad basically abandoned them.

220
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,743
Sorry.

221
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:05,156
It's okay.

222
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,100
Hey, did I tell you
i found my own place ?

223
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:10,391
A two bedroom. I'm waiting to hear.

224
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,917
Then my boys can stay over.

225
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,212
I can't wait to wake up with
them again. That's what I miss.

226
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,799
Pajamas, and messy hair
and their eyes all sleepy.

227
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,278
Well, I hope you get the place,

228
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:26,884
If that's what you want.

229
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,870
What I want...

230
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:31,743
Is to be back home.

231
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:35,339
But I have to take in the reality
That it's not going to happen.

232
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:42,995
I'm sorry about the mess.
I was rushing around this morning.

233
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,521
I didn't get a chance to pick up.

234
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,727
You certainly don't have to clean
for me. That's what I'm here for.

235
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,502
I'm so excited. I love california.

236
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:53,342
- I practically barfed on the plane.
- Well, don't do that.

237
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,117
- Can she come in my room ?
- Yeah, hold on, julio.

238
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,990
Uh, so I wrote up a list.

239
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:01,544
Some of it is common sense, like do
the dishes when they start piling up.

240
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,638
And if you could be here
tomorrow between 10:00 and 2:00,

241
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,140
The cable guy's coming
'cause our satellite's out.

242
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,971
Oh, do you have those giant
water bottles in canada ?

243
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,075
- Yeah.
- They're way too heavy for me.

244
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:14,314
So if you ever see that it's
empty, go ahead and bring one in.

245
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:15,962
Oh, okay.

246
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,150
Would it be okay if i got
a little settled in first ?

247
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,976
Oh my god. Of course.

248
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,887
I'm sorry. I'm...

249
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:28,734
- Just really happy you're here.
- Help is on the way.

250
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,058
Oh, here's the e-Mail that's
from fiona's artist week group.

251
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,776
Mm, I'll call them from my house.

252
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,161
Should we regroup in the morning ?

253
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,565
Sure. I'm going to stay here tonight.

254
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,837
George and I are in transition mode.

255
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,020
You sounded like you were
together wh you were on the phone.

256
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,536
You threw the bum out because he
couldn't get his shit together ?

257
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,518
No, I made a plan with my
new friends at knitting.

258
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:54,255
First, get set him up in his own place,

259
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,569
Sort of pad the landing,
as it were, and then-

260
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,790
Parachute out of there ?

261
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,959
When the time is right.

262
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,386
Cut to you 30 years from
now changing his diapers

263
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:07,137
And downing a gallon
of merlot every day.

264
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:13,161
Oh, claire, your aunt sarah's
dear friend fiona was killed today.

265
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,621
- Someone killed her ?
- No.

266
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,536
She fell of a cliff in topanga canyon.

267
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,029
Oh my god. I'm so sorry.

268
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:23,100
You met her at the
full moon celebration-

269
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,419
Fiona Kleinschmidt, the ceramicist.

270
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,245
Yeah, she wrote me a
recommendation for art school.

271
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:31,198
And she knew dad... and Nate ?

272
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:32,734
Uh, yes, that's the one.

273
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,748
So who gets to speak at the service

274
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,842
About fiona's penchant for
ushering young boys into manhood ?

275
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,216
Bettina, that was once.

276
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:42,410
Hey, that's the one thing
I really admired her for.

277
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:43,995
The old table's back.

278
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:48,290
Isn't it wonderful ? The other table
just didn't make any sense in here.

279
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:51,868
George has it. He moved out,
but I don't want to discuss it.

280
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,492
Your aunt sarah needs our help now.

281
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,718
How are you, claire ?

282
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:59,976
Well, I had to start temping.

283
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,455
But only until I hear from this emerging
artists' grant that I applied for.

284
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:08,887
But what really sucks is I had to waste
my money on these ridiculous clothes.

285
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,779
Oh my god.

286
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,548
"Yet these are all still chess moves.

287
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:16,835
Even being mad at you
today is still a chess move.

288
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,563
What I hate the most is
the game being played."

289
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,548
Okay, let me get her response.

290
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,586
Okay, Maya is down.

291
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,436
Okay, this is what she wrote back.

292
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,797
"Sadly, I never learned to play chess,

293
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,079
So be assured I'm not making a move."

294
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,347
Now why would she put "sadly" if
she didn't feel at least some...

295
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,915
Unconscious regret for
the way things ended ?

296
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,253
There is no way two people
could have gone through

297
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,173
What we went through together
and just let it- Unless-

298
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,877
Wait, let me read you the
transcripts from our i.M.S

299
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,041
No !

300
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,868
Well, nate, have you asked
her what she's thinking ?

301
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,309
Clearly she's moved on.

302
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,769
To be honest, the only
reason I'm dealing with you

303
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,417
Is because you're here and you're
not out here stalking my sister.

304
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,948
Nate ! Stop.

305
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,534
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

306
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,990
I'm on my medication.

307
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,910
It's just gonna take awhile.

308
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,595
The end of a relationship
is hard for anyone.

309
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:26,543
- I remember when you two
- Billy, please don't !

310
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:33,832
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:36,914
I'll just

312
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,463
Did you guys say you had
that scorsese thing tivo'd ?

313
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,100
I'll just eat some ice cream.

314
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:46,227
Then I'll watch it and then head out.

315
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,742
And I won't call her.

316
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,279
I killed her.

317
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,795
I killed my best friend.

318
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:05,760
- Honey, you didn't kill her.
- Of course you didn't.

319
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,346
You always tell me everything
happens for a reason.

320
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,769
Oh, fuck off !

321
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,519
Fuck that one to the ground !

322
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,570
"Everything happens for
a reason." What a crock !

323
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:19,360
You say there's a reason
grandma lost her legs,

324
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:21,351
And there's a reason there's a war.

325
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,890
And tsunamis ?

326
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:27,431
And there's a reason
george-Fucking-Bush got reelected !

327
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:31,565
Shit goes wrong because there's
evil in the world, like me !

328
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,743
- I'm evil.
- Sarah, no !

329
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,593
- Let her go.
- It was my idea to go get her

330
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:38,897
To go on the walk.

331
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:41,845
She didn't want to.

332
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:44,416
I... I dragged her.

333
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,197
She turned me down twice. I begged her.

334
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:51,263
- Twice ?
- Who am I, the antichrist ?

335
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,897
Some one should...

336
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,696
Just lock me up and keep me in a cage.

337
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,447
Someone should dig a
hole and throw me in it,

338
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:00,644
Not let me out !

339
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,323
Oh my god !

340
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,301
It's a playstation 2 !

341
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,832
- Cool.
- With turismo 4 !

342
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:24,156
- Can we- Can we hook it up ?
- Of course !

343
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:26,432
But we have to leave
for school in 10 minutes !

344
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,263
- All right !
- Okay !

345
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,191
What ? It's just a playstation.
All kids have them.

346
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,839
I just think buying this
without any rhyme or reason

347
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,514
Is like saying they deserve a
prize, when clearly they don't.

348
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:42,198
It's not a prize. It's just
something fun to have a good time.

349
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,335
Yeah, good times.

350
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,851
That's your answer to
everything, miss pollyanna.

351
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,842
- It's to give them an activity.
- It's going to rot their brains.

352
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,694
Who knows ?

353
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,459
I don't.

354
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,732
I don't either. I'm just
trying to make everyone happy.

355
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,568
Maybe that's your problem. You're always
trying to make everybody so damned happy.

356
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:06,878
- What you should be doing...
- Oh god, just shut the fuck up.

357
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,354
Are we having fun yet ?

358
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:24,986
Here's beverly's birthday card to sign.

359
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,625
- Oh, I haven't met beverly.
- Yeah.

360
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,007
She won't even read it. Last year i
signed it "hitler," she never said a word.

361
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:34,850
- Hey, johnny, have you met claire yet ?
- Yeah, baby.

362
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,274
- Oh, hi.
- "Wazzup" ?

363
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:40,176
Oh, just trying to sign this card.

364
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:43,993
He wasn't really asking. He has
tourette's, you have to say it back to him.

365
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,437
Oh. What's up ?

366
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:49,432
Beverly's coming. Give me back the card.

367
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,950
Hurry up !

368
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,125
You can sign it later.

369
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,903
So, I don't think I'll
get home for a few days.

370
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:03,198
Do you have enough to eat or
should I call koo koo roo for you ?

371
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,688
Okay. I'll check in soon.

372
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,768
Was I frothing like an idiot last night ?

373
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,277
Something in red wine
doesn't agree with me.

374
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,206
I don't even remember what I said.

375
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,784
- You were blaming yourself.
- I don't know why I do that.

376
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,774
It's so narcissistic, you know.

377
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:27,549
I am the asshole at the
center of the universe,

378
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:30,835
Forgetting how vast the universe is,

379
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:35,310
And how nothing...
Is in our control.

380
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:39,892
An idea both terrifying and beautiful

381
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:42,510
As spirit itself.

382
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,255
Hooty-Hoo, the gang's all here.

383
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:49,363
Aw, pookie, I'm so sorry.

384
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,167
You know fiona's dear friends.

385
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:55,716
- Lakshmi.
- Hi.

386
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:58,213
And this is susie bright,
feminist sex writer.

387
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:01,147
- Hi.
- You don't have to introduce me that way.

388
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,790
Oh, this is my sister ruth.

389
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:07,264
- Hi.
- I'll help you with those.

390
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:08,890
- Hey.
- Here.

391
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:10,317
- Hey.
- Hi.

392
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:13,068
Nate, come meet susie bright.

393
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,481
- Hello.
- Hi.

394
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:16,810
She's a sex writer.

395
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,767
Wow ! It's nice to meet you.

396
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,874
Bettina will be here soon.

397
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:23,605
She's at costco buying
hummus by the metric ton.

398
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:26,940
Tell the whole story.
Lakshmi heard fiona

399
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,507
Didn't even want to go on the
hike. Someone pushed her into it ?

400
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,559
Some woman named
susie bright. Heard of her ?

401
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:35,968
Yeah, feminist sex writer.

402
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:38,312
I've read a bunch of
her stuff. I love her.

403
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,194
Yeah, my aunt sarah's a friend of hers.

404
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:43,966
So there's a bunch of women
over here just whooping it up.

405
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,442
One of those our-Dead-Friend-
Would-Have-Wanted-Us- To-Be-Happy-

406
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,897
So-Let's-Make- A- Funeral-An-Excuse
for-A-Big-Sloppy-Party deals.

407
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,325
Would they mind if I joined them ?

408
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,980
You really want to meet ms. Bright, huh ?

409
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:00,335
Yeah, and get away from mr.
Chenowith who's here again.

410
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:03,020
All right. I'll see you soon then. Bye.

411
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:10,488
- Whoa.
- Yep.

412
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:14,371
First woman you ever slept with.

413
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:16,484
For real ?

414
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:19,178
For real.

415
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,502
I bet you never thought
you'd see her naked again.

416
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,333
Yeah.

417
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,568
Hey, how has she held up ?

418
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,983
What's the difference
on her 20 years later ?

419
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:33,850
In case you haven't noticed
she's all bruised and busted up,

420
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:35,231
You fucking idiot !

421
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,581
Hey, claire, did you come across
those requisition printouts ?

422
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,013
May I hug you ?

423
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,028
Okay.

424
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:09,572
Oh, claire.

425
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:12,670
Listen, I know this place
can be really intimidating.

426
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,165
18 years ago it was
my after-School job,

427
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,474
And I just fell in love with the place.

428
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,385
The monday after i
graduated from college

429
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,511
I came back and i
said, "put me to work."

430
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,222
It really is very special.

431
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:30,899
What's the matter, claire ? It
is kirsten, is she being a butt ?

432
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:34,257
Oh no, it's not that. It's just...

433
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:38,565
It's just these pantyhose.

434
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,369
Oh, do you have a run ? 'Cause
i have a little clear polish

435
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,877
- You can put on
- No no, it's not that !

436
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,552
It's they're like squeezing against
my torso and I can't even breathe !

437
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:49,003
I mean, none of this work
would even seem that hard

438
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,371
If I didn't feel like I was sitting here

439
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:52,644
In some kind of torture chamber all day.

440
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:56,639
Maybe you should try a different
brand. Mine energize me.

441
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:59,198
No, it's not the brand.
They're all the same.

442
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,630
- It's
- I mean...

443
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:04,013
I don't understand how having your legs

444
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,924
Sheathed in this smooth
plastic barbie leg,

445
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:08,821
Like, encased in a sausage casing

446
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:10,494
Would help you do your job better.

447
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:13,936
Doesn't seem sexist that it's
a regulation only for women ?

448
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,302
Men have to wear ties.

449
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,625
Right, but they don't suffate you.

450
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,935
And it's not on their penis.

451
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,651
I'm gonna go wash out some mugs.

452
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,908
* she's a brick, ba ba ba na *

453
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,199
* house, ba ba ba na *

454
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,925
* she's a mighty, mighty *

455
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,343
I'm gonna put the music underneath,
but I have to get the beat.

456
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,165
I'm okay. So zoom in, zoom in.

457
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:41,028
Are you zooming ? *
lettin' all hang out *

458
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:44,840
- * oh, she's a brick, a
ba ba na, house- * - Hey !

459
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,760
- Hi.
- Are you guys making a movie ?

460
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,693
We were playing online, and i
found the application to "survivor."

461
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:53,992
It said you had to make an audition
tape, so julio got the camera.

462
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:54,986
That's fun.

463
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,659
I have got the whole foreign thing
going for me,

464
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,555
Being from canada and all.

465
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:02,088
Oh, but we can do it later.
Julio, go get what we made.

466
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:04,592
So sit down, sit down.

467
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,192
- Put your feet up.
- Oh. Really ?

468
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,051
Yeah, really.

469
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,978
Mommy's worked so hard. That
is so nice of you, julio.

470
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:15,020
Thank you. Thank you, donna.
You didn't have to do this.

471
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,364
Oh, I love helping people.

472
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:21,461
And I know you do everything by
yourself. My mom was a single mom.

473
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:25,295
It's not only twice as hard without
a man, it's exponentially harder.

474
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:31,358
Was he good to you.
Did he take care of you ?

475
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:33,696
Yes, he was good to me.

476
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,431
And then he was really bad to me.

477
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:48,675
Durrell broke it.

478
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:52,374
I did not ! It wouldn't let me get
to level two so I had to fix it.

479
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,332
- You didn't have to open it.
- Crybaby crybaby.

480
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,952
- What the hell did you do, durrell ?
- It broke !

481
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,780
Okay, I broke it !

482
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,522
Why did you have to buy us a present
that you knew was gonna break ?

483
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,631
You opened the machine up. I'd have
gotten it fixed had you only waited.

484
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:10,004
- Why does everything always have to get ruined ?
- Everything was already ruined

485
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:12,709
From the time we had to move
into this stupid gay house !

486
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:15,200
- Durrell, you're going to your room !
- Get off of me !

487
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:17,501
Leave him alone. I hate you !

488
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:19,361
- Get off me !
- Leave him alone !

489
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,915
Stop it, you're
gonna break his arm !

490
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:23,511
- Keith !
- Stop ! You're hurting him !

491
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:25,934
I said, get off of me !

492
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,657
What the hell is going on ?

493
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,080
Durrell's getting a time-Out !

494
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:33,414
- You're locking them in a room ?

495
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:36,091
These kids will walk all
over you if you let them.

496
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:38,558
- I'll beat you, man !
- More violence, that's what you want to show them ?

497
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:40,774
Discipline and violence
are not the same thing.

498
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,758
- I'll kill you, you faggot !
- Let us out of here, you faggot !

499
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:46,219
This is a nightmare.
Keith, look at yourself !

500
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,028
U're completely insane right now.

501
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,385
Let go of the
door or I'll tell D.C.F.S. !

502
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:53,463
You think anybody over
there give a shit about you ?

503
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,179
You did that to yourselves !

504
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:23,906
* adrift on the water *

505
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:27,397
* could it be actually *

506
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:31,688
* wearing these clothes *

507
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,054
* I've never been *

508
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:40,237
* this fucking uncomfortable *

509
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:43,687
* never again *

510
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,767
* to wear pantyhose... *

511
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:55,025
* 'cause you ride up my thighs *

512
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:58,757
* you're tight on my ass *

513
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:02,410
* you climb up my crotch *

514
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:06,903
* you ruin my day *

515
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,302
* and fill my soul *

516
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:14,842
* you fill my soul with hate *

517
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:17,837
* it can't be right *

518
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:24,002
* when they feel so tight... *

519
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,006
* 'cause you and you and you *

520
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,654
- * all of you... *
- Claire ?

521
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:33,058
* ride up my thighs. *

522
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,147
Claire ?

523
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,269
Is my music too loud ? Do
you need me to turn it down ?

524
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:43,034
Oh, yeah, maybe a little. Thanks.

525
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:47,828
Coming !

526
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,633
- Hi, daddy.
- Sweetheart.

527
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:53,891
Oh, boy.

528
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,027
- Here. Happy housewarming.
- Ooh, beautiful.

529
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,515
Tea's ready !

530
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:04,074
Where does ruth keep her hand lotion ?

531
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,741
I don't know.

532
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,257
It's been so dry out this week,

533
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,375
And the only stuff in
the bathroom's yours.

534
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:13,041
Maybe she took it with her.

535
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,764
- Took it where ?
- Earl grey or green ?

536
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,760
- When did you move in ?
- Two days ago.

537
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:23,511
Stop being so nosy. Earl grey or green ?

538
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,581
Daddy, I'm not, I just-

539
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,351
Green.

540
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,642
So I guess...

541
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:34,553
You guys are just taking
your time unpacking ?

542
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:43,384
Look, I rely on ruth to
take care of you, daddy.

543
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:47,069
I just want to make
sure you have everything.

544
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:48,755
We're fine.

545
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:53,154
The only reason I'm alone is that ruth's
sister was involved in a fatal accident.

546
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,971
Oh, you're kidding.

547
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:57,013
Evidently, she's being blamed for it.

548
00:30:57,135 --> 00:31:01,065
And ruth, caretaker that
she is, is by her side.

549
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,816
Apparently she's quite distraught.

550
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,577
I think they've outlived
their usefulness.

551
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:11,600
- Men are obsolete.
- It's true.

552
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:14,788
I feel more of a connection to my
women friends than any of my husbands.

553
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:18,238
I've wanted to have an
all-Women weekend on my land.

554
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,783
Nice idea.

555
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,534
Let's make it an all-Woman year !

556
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:24,473
All women forever ! A land of no men !

557
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,332
Men can visit, but only for a weekend.

558
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,074
Just to satisfy our needs.

559
00:31:32,102 --> 00:31:34,271
But they have to bring money.

560
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:38,436
I've got the land, ladies. There's
20 acres up there I don't use at all.

561
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,464
We'll buy yurts off the internet.

562
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:42,267
Save me a yurt.

563
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,088
Brenda, we could midwife
your baby for you.

564
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,248
You can deliver her in a horse trough.

565
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,262
And we camp while you're in labor. Mmm.

566
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,192
I know how to grow vegetables !

567
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,300
We'll only eat what I can grow or kill.

568
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:56,900
We can start this weekend. But
we must enforce the no-Men part !

569
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:58,746
- No men !
- No men !

570
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,855
I'm just here to pick up my kid.

571
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:07,362
That's it ! We'll use
the men for child care,

572
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:10,230
Like they've done to us
for a gazillion years.

573
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,377
I'm moving in to an all-Girl
commune. Don't worry,

574
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,257
I'll sneak you in when they're asleep.

575
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,424
- Okay. Up up up.
- Yeah, do you mind if I stay ?

576
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,970
- This is kind of cool.
- Sure. No problem.

577
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:22,267
Bye-Bye !

578
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:23,723
- Bye !
- Bye.

579
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,474
Bye.

580
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,380
- Bye, beautiful.
- Have fun, everybody.

581
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,247
Okay, who's got weed ?

582
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:34,805
Not me.

583
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,552
Mine's all gone.

584
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,655
I think I know where I've got some.

585
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:52,927
I'm done.

586
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:56,021
- With your flossing or ?
- With the kids.

587
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,743
Keith, it's not like
they're slippers you can

588
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:03,185
Return to neiman marcus
because they don't fit.

589
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:05,180
That's the whole point of foster-

590
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,466
So you can see whether or not it works.

591
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:08,926
That's what the social worker said.

592
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:10,757
And this is definitely not working.

593
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,551
- We're just getting started.
- No.

594
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,720
It's been two weeks. That's
more than enough time to know.

595
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,720
We should stop before they bond to us.

596
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,504
But I've already bonded to them.

597
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,213
What you've bonded to is the
idea of becoming your mother-

598
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,438
Just running around
here blind to everything.

599
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,344
"Oh, everything's gonna be okay."

600
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:30,002
You turn into your father,
you solve everything with a beating.

601
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:32,105
- I haven't touched those kids !
- You were close.

602
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,782
Exactly. That's why when the
social worker comes tomorrow

603
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,838
I'll be explaining to her
that this is a bad match.

604
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:41,853
You should pack their
things in the morning.

605
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,418
How can you just abandon them

606
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:49,681
When their little lives have already
been filled with so much trauma ?

607
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:52,737
Good, so now you abandon me ?

608
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,117
That solves everything.

609
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,667
- Hello ?
- Hey, it's maggie.

610
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,569
Hey.

611
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:16,893
I was just putting maya to sleep.

612
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,794
Have you seen your mother ?

613
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:22,967
Um, why do you ask ?

614
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:26,095
Well, I was just over at my
dad's, and she wasn't there.

615
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:29,368
And then I tried to reach her
at the house and nobody answered.

616
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:32,116
Huh. Well, i, um...

617
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:35,197
Nate, we don't know
each other very well,

618
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:37,734
But do something for me, would you ?

619
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,600
And I'll make the same promise to you.

620
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,201
Never lie to me.

621
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:47,092
Okay ?

622
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,800
Okay.

623
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,531
She's at the house.

624
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:58,237
Um, it's just a bunch of women.
They're having a little party.

625
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,813
But she's fine.

626
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,692
If there's a problem with your
dad, she didn't tell me about it.

627
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,734
Okay.

628
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,441
And, uh...

629
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,449
You know, brenda's over there too.
It's just me and maya here.

630
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:22,234
Um, are you okay ?

631
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,734
I'm fine.

632
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,867
I'll see you soon I hope. Bye.

633
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,937
Oh, hello, honey.

634
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:44,045
Take off your business
clothes and come join us.

635
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:48,477
Sarah made dinner, and
bettina's in rare form.

636
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,101
And dominique brought susie bright.

637
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,679
Do you know who she is ?

638
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,900
No.

639
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:03,742
Oh, the women thought some marijuana
might ease the pain of the loss.

640
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,034
I guess you found it.

641
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:08,967
This seems very brown.

642
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:13,160
Is it the same strength as the
green stuff with the pungent aroma ?

643
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:30,042
Do you guys have papers ?

644
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,296
Uh, they were actually
hoping for a bong.

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,732
You know you have to
put water in that, right ?

646
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:45,167
Bettina knows.

647
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:50,267
Oh, honey.

648
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:52,167
What ?

649
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,434
I don't hate you.

650
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,249
I don't hate you either, mom.

651
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,775
You're just so much like me.

652
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:07,183
And I see you doing these things
and I feel like I'm seeing myself.

653
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,533
Well, I'm not that much like you.

654
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:13,333
If you give up your
dreams and it's my fault,

655
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:15,468
I'll never forgive myself.

656
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:17,718
No, you were right.

657
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:20,282
I mean, I have to be
able to support myself.

658
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,601
And soon as this grant
comes through I will.

659
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:24,986
I mean, this job is just for now.

660
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:27,334
Promise me...

661
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:30,376
Promise me you'll be who you wanna be.

662
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:45,070
Oh, I love you, sweetheart.

663
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,235
I love you too, mom.

664
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,441
You look so corporate.

665
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,019
You look so not corporate.

666
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:01,324
Won't you come down and join us ?

667
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:04,615
I can't. As soon as i
get this hot-Dog suit off

668
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:06,685
I am gonna take a bath and be naked.

669
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:10,380
If I put anything else on
with a waistband I'm gonna cry.

670
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:13,319
I'll keep my fingers crossed anyway.

671
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,817
Lederhosen are trousers.

672
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:26,324
But german for song is lieder.

673
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:29,925
Lieder. Yes, correct.

674
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,239
Hey.

675
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:44,197
Is there something you wanted ?

676
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,034
Maybe it's true that it
wasn't claire that I lod so much-

677
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:55,467
But I loved how it felt to see
the world with another person...

678
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,734
To be the two of us.

679
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:03,566
I felt like she was my first real love.

680
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:05,993
I know she's just a kid,

681
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,059
But we were kids together.

682
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,547
My first love just died.

683
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,078
Seriously ?

684
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:23,312
Yeah. I was 15 when I met her.

685
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:26,934
She was 32.

686
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,942
- Whoa.
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

687
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,829
Everyone afterwards got
all excited, you know-

688
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:35,500
"What did she do to you ?"

689
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,927
Everybody always thought
she did something to me.

690
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,261
You know, up until fiona

691
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:51,600
I had just been fooling
around with girls my own age-

692
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:56,800
Dark-Room-Trying-To-Get-
My-Hand-Down-Some-Girl's-Pants bullshit.

693
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,101
Fiona let me see all of her.

694
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,301
And I just loved her.

695
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:11,791
And that whole year
I was seeing other girls, but I'm just..

696
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:14,486
You know, I wrote her letters.

697
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:18,242
Some of them rhymed.

698
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:25,143
Now I know she probably laughed
when she read those letters.

699
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:28,003
I doubt she laughed.

700
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:31,895
Well, you know, love isn't something
you feel, it's something you do.

701
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:35,600
If the person you're with
doesn't want it, you know,

702
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,368
Do yourself a favor and
save it for someone who does.

703
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:48,251
Are you sure it's okay
for us to be down here, fisher ?

704
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,913
Of course I'm sure.

705
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:54,514
We've all been conditioned
not to touch the dead.

706
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,153
- But it's okay.
- Oh, fiona.

707
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,256
You look good, babe.

708
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,974
I love you.

709
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:21,167
I forgive you, fiona,
for deflowering my boy.

710
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,834
Oh, she's the one.

711
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,934
He was only 15.

712
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:27,958
I know, nate told me.

713
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,663
It's okay.

714
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,907
He was okay.

715
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,567
Oh, thank you.

716
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,967
* calling all angels *

717
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:18,752
* cling all angels *

718
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:22,189
* walk me through this one *

719
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:26,208
* don't leave me alone *

720

00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:34,649
* calling all angels *

722
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:38,496
* we're trying, we're hoping *

00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:42,388

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,256

00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:52,214

* calling all angels *

728
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:05,341
* walk me through this one *

729
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:08,726

* we're trying, we're hurting *

733
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:25,869
* but we're not sure why *

734
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:29,324
- * calling all angels *
- * calling all angels *

735
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:33,371
- * calling all angels *
- * calling all angels *

736
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:37,010
- * walk me through this one *
- * walk me through this one *

737
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:40,643
* don't leave me alone *

738
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,451
* calling all angels *

739
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,734
* calling all angels. *

740
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:06,395
Oh, thank god, the
california arts commission.

741
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:08,784
- Yes !
- You look nice.

742
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,484
You must be joking.

743
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:14,033
It's sexy, like a business lady.

744
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:23,521
What's the matter, honey ?

745
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,686
I just got rejected for my grant.

746
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,850
Those dicks. Let me see that.

747
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:34,103
Oh, well, there will be another one.

748
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,338
Shit !

749
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,305
Maybe you're not an artist.

750
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,267
Why would you say that ?

751
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:47,667
Did it hurt your
feelings when I said it ?

752
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:49,930
Well, yeah.

753
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,179
Maybe I'm right.

754
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:55,395
Maybe if you were an artist, you'd
have laughed when I said that.

755
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:57,277
Like, if you told me I was purple

756
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:00,611
I would laugh because
i know I'm not purple.

757
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,108
But when I said you weren't
an artist, you felt bad

758
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:08,034
Maybe because there's
a grain of truth in it.

759
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:13,301
You're the one who took me by my
shoulders and looked me in my eyes

760
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:16,122
And told me that I was an artist.

761
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:17,451
Maybe you were.

762
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:21,001
Maybe are. Maybe you
aren't. I don't know.

763
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,751
No one else can tell anyone what to do,

764
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:27,916
Least of all me.

765
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,867
That's the good news.

766
00:45:37,728 --> 00:45:39,767
Donna, are you-

767
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:42,540
Hello. How do you do ?

768
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:45,963
- Who are you ?
- That's Mr. Clarington.

769
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:50,804
Who is he ?

770
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:53,870
Oh, he's homeless. I was
coming out of the trader joe's

771
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:56,950
And he was hungry so I was just
going to make him some pancakes.

772
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:58,687
I know it's not a great meal, but-

773
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,217
- Where are the boys ?
- They're at school.

774
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,466
Donna...

775
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:06,771
You cannot bring strange
people home. This isn't canada !

776
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:09,973
I wasn't trying to cause any trouble.

777
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,560
But thank you both kindly
for your hospitality.

778
00:46:12,654 --> 00:46:15,673
- Never ever come back here !
- Oh my god, that's so mean.

779
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:18,823
- I'm so sorry, mr. Clarington.
- You're fired, donna.

780
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:22,668
I'm calling the agency and I'm telling
them you're out of your fucking mind !

781
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:24,316
I needed someone to help me,

782
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,433
Not shoot videos of themselves dancing

783
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:29,142
And invite the homeless
in for pancake breakfast.

784
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,569
Go pack your stuff. I
need you to leave now.

785
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:34,011
I have nowhere to go.

786
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:37,151
I don't care. Find somewhere to go !

787
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:39,267
Fine.

788
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:45,175
If I get something from "survivor,"
can you forward it to me ?

789
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:47,734
Yes.

790
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,522
Okay.

791
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:00,865
- Punk.
- Wait one second before you open that !

792
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:05,536
- Guys.
- The restraining order went out on friday.

793
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,217
- You're weaker.
- You're weakest !

794
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:09,546
I'm trained in handling
psychotic breaks.

795
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,306
Boys, we have company !

796
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:14,710
Well, it sounds like a shitstorm,

797
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,227
But I don't have a
clue how I can help you.

798
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:18,335
- Ow ! I hate you.
- Okay, later. Bye.

799
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:20,893
Sorry. Everything's falling apart.
Must be the moon.

800
00:47:20,893 --> 00:47:23,593
Yeah, exactly, we have
the same situation here.

801
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:25,155
The boys are not doing well.

802
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,849
Not at all.

803
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:29,206
I... Go ahead, I will let it ring.

804
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,380
- Tell me how it's been.
- We have a real problem here.

805
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:34,727
Or not ! We're not sure exactly.

806
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,549
What we need is your input,

807
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:40,183
Your feedback. Perhaps the
best way to handle this-

808
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:42,521
I am so sorry. I do have to take this.

809
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:46,192
- Girl !
- No. I'm almost out of here.

810
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:49,403
Hold on one second. Okay...
That'll be it then ?

811
00:47:49,404 --> 00:47:53,106
Listen, I don't think things
are working out for the kids.

812
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,890
I mean, I'm not sure
we're the right match.

813
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:04,012
You have no idea the hell i
have pulled children out of.

814
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,251
I mean, houses filled to the
brim with garbage, cat feces.

815
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:10,120
You are doing fine in my book.

816
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,294
I have never seen
these boys doing better.

817
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,392
- They're flourishing.
- "Flourishing" ?

818
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:17,054
Good. Yes, that's what
I thought. Thank you.

819
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,697
- We're thrilled to have them here.
- Okay. Great. Yeah-

820
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:21,847
Listen, could you just stay
five minutes ?

821
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:24,605
- No ! Wait. She needs to go.
- I've gotta go.

822
00:48:24,643 --> 00:48:26,389
Yeah, I'm on my way.

823
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:28,060
Well, I don't know with traffic...

824
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:33,952
I can't believe you just did that.

825
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,339
You know, david, just pretending
that something is working

826
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:39,672
- Doesn't mean it's actually working.

827
00:48:41,846 --> 00:48:45,320
Don't worry, guys.
Everything's gonna be okay.

828
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:47,466
Have you heard
from personnel yet ?

829
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:49,579
I started out as a temptoo.

830
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:52,560
If you have half a brain they'll
offer you something permanent.

831
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,475
Did you get my present ?

832
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:59,081
Oh, the e-Card with the
dancing puppies ? Yes.

833
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,771
It was very cute. Thank you.

834
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:01,992
Yeah, baby.

835
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:04,945
No, I meant my old bathroom pass.

836
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,109
If personnel calls, which
i heard could happen,

837
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:09,912
They'll give you your own, but in the
meantime you can use my old my one.

838
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,555
I'm telling operations.

839
00:49:12,668 --> 00:49:15,320
Really, you can have it, claire.

840
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:23,654
Thank you.

841
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:25,600
You're gonna love it here,
claire. You really are.

842
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:39,001
Hello ?

843
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:42,167
Yeah.

844
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:45,982
Yeah yeah, I can
definitely pick up the kids.

845
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:48,461
Oh, okay. Okay. Good good.

846
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,234
See you then. Bye-Bye.

847
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,973
I'm gonna take fiona to the crematorium.

848
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:05,067
How nice of you. I'm sure
she'll appreciate that.

849
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,123
Have you seen sarah ?

850
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:14,015
Oh, she already left. She was
canoodling in the back row,

851
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:16,555
- Found an old boyfriend I think.
- She left ?

852
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:18,757
- Are you going then ?
- Going where ?

853
00:50:18,785 --> 00:50:21,625
Up to topanga. Shall we meet there ?

854
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:25,771
Aren't we all going
out to the home and...

855
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,344
Commune...

856
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,818
Weekend ?

857
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:34,160
We were joking.

858
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,819
Hey, guys ! Go put your
books in your rooms

859
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:48,669
And get ready for your bath.

860
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:54,700
You wanna move back in ?

861
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,403
- Excuse me ?
- Yeah.

862
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,328
I've been thinking a lot
about it and I guess you were right.

863
00:51:01,403 --> 00:51:04,900
Um, it's not good for the
boys. They need you here.

864
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,434
Yeah.

865
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,469
- Thank you so much, vanessa.
-  Yeah.

866
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,760
So, I'm starting dinner.

867
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:20,769
Why don't you go do their baths
and we can eat in about 20 minutes ?

868
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,492
Let me, uh, take this
to the kitchen first.

869
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,034
Hello.

870
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,903
I brought the pots and pans.

871
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:57,386
That... That wasn't necessary.

872
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,475
On second thought, your
other idea was the better one.

873
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:04,574
I went down to crate & barrel
and bought myself another set.

874
00:52:04,696 --> 00:52:06,879
You did ?

875
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:10,114
I know what's going on, Ruth.

876
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,916
You do ?

877
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:15,141
Yes, I do. None of
your furniture is here.

878
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:16,572
You only brought one change of clothing.

879
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,305
- No toiletries.
- I brought my soap.

880
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:22,416
No, please, look-

881
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:25,613
Let's not waste any more
of each other's time, okay ?

882
00:52:25,637 --> 00:52:28,674
It's not respectful. I get it.

883
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,604
You want to leave me.

884
00:52:32,773 --> 00:52:35,200
But first you want to make sure
that I have everything that I need,

885
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:37,561
Which is...

886
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:40,308
Very kind and thoughtful
as you always are.

887
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:41,674
George, it's not because-

888
00:52:41,777 --> 00:52:45,148
It doesn't matter why. It's okay.

889
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:48,144
I called the dean.

890
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,496
I start back this semester.

891
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:53,838
And thanks to you I have my apartment...

892
00:52:54,064 --> 00:52:56,566
And my pots...

893
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,031
And my pans.

894
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,834
So thank you.

895
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:08,600
I loved you.

896
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:12,637
You loved me.

897
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,900
That was a good thing.

898
00:53:16,923 --> 00:53:20,134
Now it's changed.

899
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,637
So...

900
00:53:25,294 --> 00:53:28,144
Consider yourself free.

901
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:54,934
* on every day you
gaze upon the sunset *

902
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:59,034
* with such love and intensity *

903
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,967
* why... *

904
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:05,767
* it's, uh, it's almost *

905
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:08,967
* as if you could only crack the code *

906
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:11,934
* then you'd finally understand *

907
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:16,067
* what this all means *

908
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:22,001
* ah, but if you could,
do you think you would *

909
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:24,167
* trade it all ? *

910
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:27,834
* all the pain *

911
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,800
* and suffering *

912
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:35,134
* ah, but then you'd miss *

913
00:54:35,201 --> 00:54:39,401
* the beauty of the
light upon this earth *

914
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:46,234
* and, and the sweetness
of the leaving. *
