1
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,357
(Women singing)

2
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:57,400
! See, I've been through the desert
on a horse with no name

3
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:01,281
! It felt good to be out of the rain

4
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:05,684
! In the desert you can't remember your name

5
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:10,164
! Cos there ain't no one
for to give you no name

6
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,686
! La, la...!

7
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,844
I don't understand.
Why can't I go to arithmetic?

8
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:17,082
Mary Jane, that time's over.

9
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:20,358
- Turn, turn, turn.
- You're almost a woman now.

10
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:25,527
(Women)! La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la!

11
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,603
All right, last one.

12
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,639
Hannah Grace, bring your hand mop.

13
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,925
(Children boo)

14
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:39,443
I'm a busy, busy businessman.
All of you poor people, out of my way.

15
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:40,840
(Children booing)

16
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:44,960
Excuse me, young lady,
how much is that hand mop?

17
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:46,520
$3, sir.

18
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,765
I love my money so much, I wanna keep it all.

19
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,957
(Booing)

20
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,396
Golly, I do need a hand mop.

21
00:02:56,527 --> 00:03:00,076
This is a $111-bill.

22
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,156
Change, please.

23
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:06,360
111 take away three.

24
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:10,158
- 108!
- That's the number!

25
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:13,436
All right, gather round and close your eyes,

26
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:17,480
it's time for today's lesson
from the Book of Daddy.

27
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:24,565
Once upon a time, a wise person said,

28
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:28,122
"Every day we must dance.

29
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,923
"If only in our minds."

30
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,724
Why do we dance?

31
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,884
Because we're happy to be alive.

32
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,883
So every day we must dance

33
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:45,556
to say, "Thank you, God. Thank you.

34
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,598
"For life."

35
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,920
School's out! Everybody dance with your feet.

36
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,958
(Cheering)

37
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,518
Daddy.

38
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,360
Vanessa?

39
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,481
Vanessa.

40
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,563
Don't say it, I'm serious.

41
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,361
Your mom's been dead for four months.

42
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,398
I get a year.

43
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:02,085
We spend every Sunday in a graveyard,
it's not good for the boys.

44
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,158
Our sons.

45
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:09,756
What? They're happy,
they like to visit her, too.

46
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,879
- You know she's not here.
- Don't.

47
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,236
You know what?

48
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:18,597
Next Sunday, after church, let's have a party.

49
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,081
Come on, she loved parties.

50
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,685
I can't.

51
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:28,198
I miss her so much it feels like somebody
tore out my heart and fed it to dogs.

52
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:33,401
Fine. Take them to Knutsberry Farm.
Just come back before dark.

53
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:35,278
Listen to me.

54
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,763
You know, you don't smile or laugh any more.

55
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:43,039
You don't act like you,
you act like you're one of the Fishers.

56
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:47,723
Vanessa, I think you're depressed.

57
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,406
Why do you keep bugging me?

58
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,838
I'm never gonna see my mother again.
This is normal. I'm normal!

59
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,998
And your organisation is called The People?

60
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,561
Organisation?

61
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,962
- I wish.
- The family.

62
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,406
We were so happy.

63
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,325
- And you are his wife?
- Yes.

64
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

65
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,724
Yes.

66
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,644
Not in a stupid paper way.

67
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:23,236
Those whom God has joined,
no man can tear asunder.

68
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,243
- Amen.
- We make it so.

69
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,879
Let it be.

70
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,805
Would you like us to embalm... uh...

71
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,604
- Daddy?
- What's that?

72
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:36,322
We replace the blood with embalming fluid
in order to preserve the body.

73
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,881
Yes, I want it. I want it.

74
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:42,203
Abigail, it's just an old corpse. We don't care.

75
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:45,683
Embalming will allow you
to view the deceased one last time,

76
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,524
which helps most people.

77
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,764
The Book of Daddy says,
"The physical body is only...

78
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,321
"tears, bones and desire."

79
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,086
You transcend, you don't preserve.

80
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,436
Please, let's preserve his body.

81
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,796
We love that body. Please.

82
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,883
Oh, all right. All right.

83
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:05,885
Abigail's a new soul.

84
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:09,044
- This is my first life.
- Really?

85
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:15,242
One of us will stay with Daddy's flesh
till it goes in the ground. We'll take shifts.

86
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:19,326
That won't be necessary.
Daddy is perfectly safe here.

87
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,564
There are government agents.

88
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,041
Space forces are always following us.

89
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,563
No one's allowed in the embalming room
without legal permission.

90
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,040
Then get it.

91
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,560
Right.

92
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,158
Children.

93
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,042
Holy fuck.

94
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,642
- Hello there.
- Hello there.

95
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,718
Your washing.

96
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,158
Mm.

97
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,158
Mm.

98
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,921
Have you ever noticed your profile?
You look like an emperor.

99
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:12,324
I mean it. Your face has character.
It's not an everyday, bland face.

100
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,518
Stop! You'll give me megalomania.

101
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,558
Now, Ruth, pay attention.

102
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:21,246
For the last time,
you don't have to take care of me.

103
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:25,724
- I don't want you to do my laundry.
- I know. That's what makes it fun!

104
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,366
Oh.

105
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,797
- My goodness! If I'd known you intended...
- Shit.

106
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,678
Language.

107
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,642
They want to hang around the body?

108
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:43,078
- Not all at once.
- Eve, Abigail, Rachel, Rebecca.

109
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,399
Rachel and Rebecca are sisters.

110
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,438
- Sick!
- I don't get it.

111
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,844
You could do like a Warhol series,
with polygamous Mennonite concubines.

112
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:57,323
I'm just worried this place
will be crawling with kids.

113
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,880
Man. Why us?

114
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:02,078
They live three blocks away, we're neighbours.

115
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,595
We're neighbours with Children Of The Corn.

116
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,798
I don't want to be alone
with sharp things and a Manson chick.

117
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,557
Grow up! They simply subscribe
to different spiritual and cultural beliefs.

118
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:17,601
- If you're so mature, you deal with them.
- No way! Tomorrow's gay paintball day.

119
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,962
Um, Mom?

120
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,159
Shudder.

121
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:32,965
- Oh!
- Hi, do you have some cheese?

122
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,883
- 'Why didn't you invite us? '
- Because you have jobs.

123
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,918
'Hello! Sick days. '

124
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,078
It's Keith's thing.

125
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:46,483
He's renewing ties with old gay cop buddies,
I didn't think you'd want to.

126
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:51,442
What kind of a candyass do you think I am?
Everybody loves guns. What time?

127
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,879
- I'll let you know.
- 'OK. '

128
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:59,196
If we're showing skin,
I have to go to the gym first.

129
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,082
(! Pop on radio)

130
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,638
This is supposed to be sexy?

131
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:13,477
Only religious fanatics with frozen shit
up their asses could produce such horror.

132
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:15,245
i.e. Americans.

133
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,039
What is it now?

134
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,203
A teen fashion magazine.

135
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:23,365
This gauche repression,
this adolescent exhibitionism.

136
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:27,844
No wonder you can't tell the difference
between violence and passion.

137
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,197
- You wanna kill those martyrs.
- It's pop culture.

138
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:35,320
There isn't one person in this country
who knows how to fuck.

139
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,325
Cos real fucking would
overthrow your government,

140
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,155
it would send Americans
screaming into the streets.

141
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,243
You think you're different?

142
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:47,120
Look at this! Empty.

143
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,079
- It's supposed to be empty.
- It's about empty.

144
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,119
Bullshit. You're 18. What's wrong with you?

145
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,955
Where's sexuality? Huh?
You should be consumed with sex.

146
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,761
Everything that happens
should make you wanna fuck.

147
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,757
Your flesh should be on fire all the time.

148
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,201
It is.

149
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,964
Yeah.

150
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,078
Uh.

151
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:23,116
I have an interview tomorrow
so I'll meet you at paintball.

152
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:27,558
Look for the owner, Boo. He'll tell you the rules
and give you some practice.

153
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:29,598
I can't wait.

154
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,599
What?

155
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:35,923
Don't kill me but Terry and Patrick are coming.

156
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,799
They invited themselves.

157
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:42,806
I would have checked with you
but I didn't have a chance. Sorry.

158
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,203
It's fine.

159
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,885
- Really?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:53,083
I think it'll be a good opportunity
for our friends to meet each other.

161
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,286
OK, wait. I'm an asshole.

162
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:03,037
I lied. I could have checked with you
but I thought you'd rip my head off.

163
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,840
- David.
- I should trust you more.

164
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,558
You know what, it's OK.

165
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,598
It takes time.

166
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:19,036
We're getting better and better.

167
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:26,120
Why did you and Brenda break up?

168
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,556
- Why?
- It's part of you.

169
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,598
I should know about it.

170
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,397
We were selfish.

171
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:37,917
She went nuts, I went nuts,
we tried to keep it together

172
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,958
but it wasn't meant to be.

173
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,161
So you just walked away from each other?

174
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:47,678
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Nate, that's way too clean.

175
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:50,082
Break-ups are gory and humiliating.

176
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:53,324
- Not always.
- Yes, always.

177
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:57,918
I mean, you get dumped like you're nothing,
like you're fucking garbage,

178
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,640
then you crawl around
with your guts hanging out

179
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:03,724
- Crying all over total strangers on the bus...
- Lisa...

180
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,078
No, it wasn't me.

181
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,118
It was a friend.

182
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:16,236
- That's all you're gonna say about it?
- What do you want?

183
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,245
Tell me what happened so I can understand.

184
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,836
How can I? It's not like
I have it all figured out, I don't.

185
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,957
It was seriously fucked up.

186
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:27,396
Did it hurt? Yeah, it fucking hurt.

187
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,358
I know.

188
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,965
(Woman singing)

189
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:43,320
! Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

190
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:48,564
! Which never bore blossom
since Adam was born

191
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:54,039
! Once he was a true love of mine

192
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:59,000
! Will you buy me an acre of land?

193
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:04,444
! Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

194
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:10,078
! Between the sea foam and the sea sand

195
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:16,043
! Once he was a true love of mine!

196
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:32,678
- Can't we just observe?
- No. Keith was actually happy this morning.

197
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:37,357
I don't know about him. He's hot
but I see big footprints all over your back.

198
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,477
- Shut up.
- She's jealous.

199
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,165
Boo.

200
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:44,722
Hi, we'd like to play with the other gay children.

201
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,840
People, chose your comrades well.

202
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:53,677
They'll lead you to glory
or they'll bury your ass in shame.

203
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,476
Five on five, two reds switch over.

204
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,915
Keith, you put on the wrong colour.

205
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,164
- No, I didn't.
- You did. We're on different teams.

206
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:10,200
- It'll be more fun.
- Come on, they're newbies.

207
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:13,045
They're stupid and weak like kittens.

208
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,123
Hurry up, Reds.

209
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,362
- I'll go.
- Whoo!

210
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,882
- Keith.
- David.

211
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,964
- Do we need to talk?
- I'm tired of talking.

212
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:28,646
Don't you ever get tired of talking?

213
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:32,200
- Excuse us.
- Fuck.

214
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:43,238
- You're embarrassing me in front of...
- The leading ladies? I've been there.

215
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:46,597
- I survived.
- That was not my fault. I hinted.

216
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,639
How could you forget Waterworld?
It was three hours long.

217
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm not thinking about that.
All I want today is a good time.

218
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,038
It was only a party game.

219
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,238
Exactly. Welcome to my party...

220
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,039
baby.

221
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,157
Bitch, you set me up.

222
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,682
Any changes?

223
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:15,638
Nope.

224
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,917
- No.
- OK, then.

225
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:21,198
- You, you're out. See you next game.
- Fuck.

226
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,522
Sarge!

227
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,685
- Who the hell's Sarge?
- He'll even things up.

228
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:43,083
OK, you got a few minutes for recon.
Game commences on the Delta at 1400 hours.

229
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,800
- Keep it clean.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,486
- Is your hopper full?
- Oh, yeah.

231
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,245
Oh, yeah.

232
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:55,875
- Sorry Keith wouldn't play on our team.
- I'm not.

233
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,042
(Thud)

234
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,485
(Rapid splatting)

235
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,645
OK, hate this.

236
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,485
- Where do we go?
- To Magic Mountain, like normal fags.

237
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:36,123
- There's cover a few metres that way.
- I can't do metric conversion in combat.

238
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,998
Goggles down!

239
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,403
Suck it up, Louise.
Get out there and lay some paint.

240
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,438
Come on.

241
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,684
Here!

242
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:58,765
What do you want me to do?

243
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:01,275
(Olivier) Stop yelling like a fishwife.

244
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:10,679
Yikes!

245
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,718
Smell this.

246
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,565
Think this is old hummus or baba ghanouj?

247
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:21,202
I think when they're old,
they become the same thing.

248
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:26,922
Hm. You brought your shadow.

249
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:30,357
- He's not my shadow.
- You need to go to Azusa for me.

250
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:35,003
- Why?
- You know what the name is? Azusa.

251
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:40,079
It's everything from A to Z in the USA.

252
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,402
Azusa.

253
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:45,120
That's how you guys name your towns.

254
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,878
- What am I eating?
- I don't know.

255
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,438
Well, taste.

256
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,001
(Laughs)

257
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:55,958
I think it's clay!

258
00:18:56,007 --> 00:19:00,125
Look, I can't go to Azusa for you.
Russell and I are going downtown.

259
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:04,604
Find this person.
She's donating Visqueen for the alumni show.

260
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:08,037
She's a terrible sculptor.
It'll be interesting for you.

261
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:10,726
I'll call her and tell her you're on the way.

262
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,201
This is really unexpected.

263
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,886
Azusa's a really long drive.

264
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:20,000
Russell and I have plans.
It's like 115 degrees in the desert.

265
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,561
You're an assistant. Assist.

266
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:27,518
OK.

267
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,840
OK, let's go.

268
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:35,402
No, Russell.
You could organise my monographs.

269
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,679
What would you do in Azusa anyhow?

270
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:41,960
Fuck.

271
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,479
I love her, too.

272
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,325
Dude, move out!

273
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,959
(Pellets splattering)

274
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,680
Red at ten o'clock. Cover.

275
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,558
Plug him, dude!

276
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,925
(Gasps) Terry, 12 o'clock.

277
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,244
Ow!

278
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,844
Fuck!

279
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:34,639
- You idiot.
- Sorry! I'm so sorry. Sorry.

280
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,917
Oh, my God! Friendly fire.

281
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,798
I thought you were enemy ass.

282
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,042
- Wipe it off.
- That's cheating.

283
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,396
- You'll be known as a wipe forever.
- Oh, no.

284
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:49,520
You're dead. Put up your gun
and walk out of bounds. Those are the rules.

285
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,762
There are no rules in war.

286
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,286
(Yells)

287
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh, shit!

288
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:59,204
(Laughter)

289
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:15,443
Come on, you fa-la-la mimosa motherfuckers.

290
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,598
Give it up.

291
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,197
Fuck you, Ratso.

292
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:33,165
- You're out!
- Damn.

293
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,443
Dudes! You're still alive.

294
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:40,445
David cheated.
He's our captain, he should know.

295
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:42,398
- I'm a wiper.
- Cool.

296
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:47,237
You smart-talk the other girl, she's sensitive.
I got something for you to try.

297
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:48,845
We can win.

298
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,923
Yay.

299
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,527
No, I do not think that it's paranoid.

300
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:58,286
I researched Todd's ex-fiancee.
I spent $150 on the internet.

301
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,363
Did you find out why he loved her?

302
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:04,639
No. But I can tell you the serial numbers
on her breast implants.

303
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:09,158
It's because I'm curious, not because
I think Brenda's gonna take Nate away.

304
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:12,199
Nate adores Maya, he would never...

305
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,286
- He thinks about her.
- How can you tell?

306
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,682
He's twitchy and far away.

307
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,036
That's Todd with basketball.

308
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,317
And there's this Brenda vibe.

309
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:30,280
I know I'm being compared but
I don't know what to. That's what kills me.

310
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:33,238
Come on, Todd doesn't compare?

311
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:36,643
No, he's not deep. I love that.

312
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:41,600
I know where Brenda works.

313
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,841
Oh, wow.

314
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:49,237
OK, don't shoot.

315
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,881
I'm dead. See?

316
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,363
Dead newbie walking.

317
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,443
- Happy?
- Hell, yeah.

318
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,036
Damn it! You cheated, asshole.

319
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:05,123
Who's your daddy? Ha-ha!

320
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,123
(Firing)

321
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,358
Come on!

322
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,398
Is that all you got?

323
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:17,758
Get off the field, you flannel-shirt,
mullet-head dyke, or fight like a man!

324
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,843
(Yells)

325
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,876
You're a cock-sucking pansy.

326
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:28,557
I'd like to make an appointment
for a traditional massage with Brenda.

327
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,404
I hear she's so good.

328
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,961
'She's booked solid for this month. '

329
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,077
- Booked.
- They always say that.

330
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,244
They try and give you an intern.
Just do a Carol.

331
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:43,406
This is totally unacceptable.
Cherie Lansing told me you'd help me out.

332
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,723
Shall I call her right now
or shall I call your supervisor?

333
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,679
'You're in luck. There's been a cancellation. '

334
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,002
- 'Can you be here in an hour? '
- An hour?

335
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:53,844
- I got Maya.
- 'Your name? '

336
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:55,878
Dana... Todd.

337
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:08,764
So how long have
you and Keith been together?

338
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:13,085
Well, we were together for a few months,
then we split up

339
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,641
and he was with somebody else and I was...

340
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:21,006
Oh, never mind. We got back together
and it's been almost a year.

341
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,603
I've been talking with a couple of The People.

342
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,956
They have some interesting beliefs.

343
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:48,682
They certainly believe in dairy.
The little ones beg for cheese.

344
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:51,685
Yes. Cows are sacred to them.

345
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,637
Did you know they only recognise
the love of God?

346
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,996
They don't believe in romance.

347
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:02,720
Where did all those children come from?

348
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,085
We didn't get into it.

349
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,325
But romantic love wasn't even invented
until the 14th century.

350
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,119
I never heard that.

351
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:16,603
Petrarch. He was Italian.

352
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:24,239
- Arthur, the things you know.
- This morning...

353
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:26,357
- We don't have to talk about it.
- We do.

354
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,319
- We can pretend it never happened.
- That'd be a lie.

355
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:32,916
It was two seconds.
I didn't plan it, it was an accident.

356
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:36,198
Your friendship has so much value for me.

357
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,962
- Anything more would be unprofessional.
- I know.

358
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,965
Please, don't kiss me again.

359
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,884
I never will. Never.

360
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,799
- Friends?
- Friends.

361
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:07,403
You'll have to help yourselves.
I'm out of control.

362
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,077
What are you doing here? There's no action.

363
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:17,719
Shh!

364
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,122
Let's go bust a move on Sarge.

365
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,202
Hey!

366
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,045
Don't make me tell you twice.

367
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,757
I would have voted him off first.

368
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,196
- You didn't think he was cute?
- No.

369
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:33,603
Not forever cute, just for the island cute.

370
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,923
- What about that hot lawyer?
- He didn't fish.

371
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,923
- True.
- (Gasps)

372
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,800
Jeanne Tripplehorn.

373
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:47,561
(Chuckles)

374
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:04,036
(Phone)

375
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:10,482
Fisher & Diaz. Federico Diaz speaking.

376
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:13,678
'Mr Diaz, this is Nurse Raisky
from Julio's school.

377
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,560
'I've tried to call your home
but there's no answer

378
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,679
'and we have a public health situation here. '

379
00:27:19,727 --> 00:27:21,445
I-I-ls Julio sick?

380
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:24,479
'No, but someone
needs to pick him up right away.

381
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:26,757
'He has a raging case of head lice. '

382
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,685
- (Claire) Are you Carmen?
- Yeah.

383
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,444
I'm Claire.

384
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:39,717
- Olivier's assistant.
- Oh.

385
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,402
Didn't he call?

386
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:45,438
Him? Of course not.

387
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,918
Tequila?

388
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,401
No. Thanks.

389
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:53,439
I'll just get the Visqueen and go back.

390
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,682
The traffic will get better in a while.

391
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:58,366
Oh, I really should...

392
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:02,719
Look, you're a really white person,
the desert is dangerous to you.

393
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,361
It's like driving in a microwave. Come on.

394
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:12,238
(Pellets firing)

395
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,885
Are you hit? Let me check.

396
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,680
No, spray. A couple of bouncers.

397
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,597
I saw your man out there.

398
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:26,081
- Did you shoot him?
- Not yet.

399
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,645
- Damn it.
- I hear he killed one of his own.

400
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:34,005
- Sounds like him.
- (Firing)

401
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,482
We're all that's left.

402
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:41,837
- I think I can get him but...
- One of us will have to die?

403
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,442
Yeah.

404
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,404
Me.

405
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,837
- You think you can put an end to this?
- I know I can.

406
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:55,005
Even if I'm shot,
I guaran-damn-tee I'll take him with me to hell.

407
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:58,363
Let's do it.

408
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,886
I really like your studio.

409
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:09,842
- You work in so many different media.
- That's because I can't find the right one.

410
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,727
So, what do you do in Azusa?

411
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,361
I teach at a Christian Junior College.

412
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,398
(Laughs)

413
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:21,244
And I art.

414
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,397
- You're really good.
- Oh, fuck you.

415
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:31,606
You know, I was good for about five years
but right now I'm shit.

416
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:36,240
And I'll get good again,
I have to be patient but...

417
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:41,684
Oh, Jesus.

418
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,847
I want it so bad.

419
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:47,843
Yeah, me too.

420
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,680
So, what's the devil man working on?

421
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,718
Olivier?

422
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:57,438
Oh, now he's negotiating with
a couple of museums.

423
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,603
For work he did in his twenties?

424
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:04,243
Do you like being his assistant?

425
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:06,562
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

426
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:10,001
He's such a brilliant teacher.

427
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:13,676
- I want to be more involved with his work...
- I know!

428
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,718
I was his assistant, too.

429
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,440
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

430
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:22,683
That was a very creative time.

431
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,320
Oh, I'm not fucking him.

432
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,323
Oh.

433
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,358
Is he having a boy year?

434
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:42,318
(Firing)

435
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,760
- Dude, you're trapped!
- It's over, man!

436
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,275
Fuck that shit, I can take you both.

437
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,876
You know what,
sometimes I do get tired of talking.

438
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,481
(Yells)

439
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,962
Aw, shit.

440
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,676
OK, move it out.

441
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:33,002
Next game commences at 1600.

442
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,846
- (Knocking)
- Yes.

443
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,037
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were already on the table.

444
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:54,123
- What?
- The robe.

445
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,123
They should have given you a small.

446
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,683
I think it is a small.

447
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:03,525
Never mind. They size those things
for egos, not for people.

448
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:06,963
I'm not really a spa lady.

449
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,116
Neither am I.

450
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:14,078
OK.

451
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:20,997
- I can come back.
- No, I'm ready.

452
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,159
I'm Mary Jane.

453
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:50,437
I remember.

454
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:54,278
- Sorry you lost your daddy.
- He's not lost.

455
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,365
Well, right.

456
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,797
His body died in this place
but not in every place.

457
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:07,040
He's fine if you step a little this way
and squint. Know what I mean?

458
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah.

459
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,120
He was Daddy but he wasn't my daddy.

460
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,680
Excuse me?

461
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,524
If you meant human.

462
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:20,806
Yeah.

463
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,122
Do you like cheese?

464
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,045
- Um, yeah...
- What kind of cheese?

465
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,076
Um...

466
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:31,118
- Cheddar.
- Yeah! Me, too.

467
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,123
Um...

468
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,442
- Colby, muenster.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

469
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:39,918
Monterey Jack with jalapeno.

470
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,161
No.

471
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,246
- Brie.
- Brie?

472
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:47,838
What's brie? Does that taste like blue cheese?
Because I hate blue cheese.

473
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:58,320
- I know your name.
- Yeah?

474
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,844
I'm almost a woman now.

475
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,598
(Lisa gasps)

476
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:38,399
All right?

477
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,126
Yeah.

478
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,879
(Lisa moans)

479
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:49,036
Oh! No, I'm sorry.

480
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,399
(Sniffs)

481
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,717
I was working on your hara.

482
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,959
That's the seat of mind-body power.

483
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:14,158
You know, if you believe in that sort of thing.

484
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:16,004
I do.

485
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,517
There are places we store trauma, tension.

486
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:24,082
Our selves know what we go through.

487
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:27,118
Our bodies remember.

488
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:31,443
Sometimes just a little pressure...

489
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,282
then tears.

490
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,601
My life has never been so good.

491
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:44,842
I have a beautiful baby.

492
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:47,037
I'm happily married.

493
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:50,685
- You're lucky.
- I know.

494
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:58,037
Happy stuff, it's pretty new.

495
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,801
Maybe you just needed a good cry.

496
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:06,641
Yeah.

497
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,406
(Sighs)

498
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,442
Are you OK?

499
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:21,484
I'm fine.

500
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,837
You look sad.

501
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,036
I'm... not so lucky.

502
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:36,726
Not lately.

503
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:45,998
But I wouldn't change anything.

504
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,444
- No?
- No.

505
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:57,278
Well, if you change one thing,
that changes everything.

506
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:02,879
And some things are the way they should be.

507
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,604
Yeah.

508
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:24,082
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go find Mummy Abigail.

509
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:29,717
It's beautiful.

510
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,516
- May I?
- Certainly.

511
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:40,279
Ruth Fisher.

512
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,124
Eve.

513
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,482
It was my mother's pattern.
It would have been mine.

514
00:37:52,127 --> 00:37:53,958
Another name, another life.

515
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:58,636
The silver was a wedding present.

516
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,678
That was another life, too.

517
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:04,246
- You're a widow?
- Yes.

518
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:06,522
Yes.

519
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,076
May I ask you something?

520
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:16,563
- The other three?
- How on earth?

521
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,438
I was grateful.

522
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,079
Honestly?

523
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:24,757
You didn't know Daddy. Sometimes less
than one man is more than enough.

524
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:27,765
But when your husband
proposes to other women...

525
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,719
He never did. Never once.

526
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,759
They all came to him, the same way I did.

527
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:36,082
We all chose him.

528
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,960
Poor guy, he never had
anything to say about it.

529
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,680
Weren't you jealous?

530
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:45,606
Didn't it hurt your feelings
when he'd go upstairs...?

531
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:49,356
If the people around you were
dying of cold and you had a fire,

532
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,204
wouldn't you share?

533
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:04,966
I did worry at first because they were younger

534
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:07,965
and I thought I had nothing to offer
that could compare.

535
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,885
- But I feel young.
- Oh, so do I.

536
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:13,361
Because we are young, Mrs Fisher.

537
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,399
Time doesn't tell the truth about our souls.

538
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,917
Only love.
We're all children when we truly love.

539
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:23,521
- Even Daddy?
- Especially Daddy.

540
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,558
That man...

541
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,685
They don't know what they want,
that's why you have to choose.

542
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:56,960
Julio, I want you to find your brother,
go into the bathroom and close the door.

543
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,998
I'll be there in a minute, OK?

544
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:04,363
Uh... Poppy loves you.

545
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:06,841
Just go sit in the tub, OK?

546
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,918
Wha...? Julio?

547
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:20,366
Sleep all day, I don't give a shit,
but do not fuck around with my kids.

548
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:23,205
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything.

549
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,715
- Do you know why Julio's home?
- No.

550
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:29,840
Because he has lice, Vanessa,
like some dirty convict.

551
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:34,756
And we probably have it too
because you have stopped being his mother.

552
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,037
I had to hear it from the school nurse.

553
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:40,443
You don't even know
what's on the heads of your children.

554
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:46,566
If he has lice,
then we're just gonna have to move.

555
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:56,246
No, we don't have to move, OK?

556
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,280
I bought the shampoo
but you have got to change.

557
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:07,442
You're right, you're right.

558
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:12,959
I'm a shitty mother,
my own mother would have killed me.

559
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,567
What am I doing? I need help.

560
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,677
We'll get you the help.

561
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,524
OK? I love you.

562
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,484
Can you forgive me?

563
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,478
Of course I forgive you.

564
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:33,802
Our kids have bugs.

565
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,758
Hello?

566
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:43,999
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

567
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,924
Are you deaf?

568
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:50,722
I've been out there 20 minutes yelling for help.
I had to drag all that Visqueen in.

569
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,677
Oh, hello. Everything go smoothly?

570
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:57,125
Absolutely.

571
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:00,159
Can we leave now?
Your Visqueen is in the garage.

572
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:02,880
You were supposed to take it to school.

573
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:06,683
I'd help but I'm dining with a provost at Patina.

574
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:10,640
Well, I'd help but
I'm dining with my boyfriend at Taco Bell.

575
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:12,803
- Take it after.
- No.

576
00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:19,243
And I really don't wanna be
your assistant any more.

577
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:23,599
- Why is that?
- All I do is run personal errands for you

578
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:27,037
and it's taking too much time
away from my own work.

579
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:32,001
Fine.

580
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:36,281
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

581
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,479
Have a good night.

582
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:49,125
No, on that field you gotta get around back.

583
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,203
You cheated your ass off. I was robbed.

584
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,556
Jeez, totally illegal.

585
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,916
Totally!

586
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:58,003
Are you going out later?

587
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:01,481
You know, you look like...

588
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:03,961
a leprechaun.

589
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:05,998
Am I right?

590
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:09,558
Never mind.

591
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:15,157
They may be hell on the battlefield
but they have no party stamina.

592
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:19,439
- How did they make it through the '80s?
- And they call us choirboys.

593
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:23,685
My God! We were supposed to
meet James and Katie an hour ago.

594
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:26,195
They're married, he's not gay.

595
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:29,518
I'll walk you out.

596
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,998
Be right back.

597
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:34,718
- Love you all, soldiers.
- Whoo-hoo!

598
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:49,276
- That was fun today.
- Yep.

599
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,282
Ever been in real combat?

600
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:54,840
No.

601
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:57,685
- I wouldn't want to. You?
- Fuck, no.

602
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:59,718
(Laughs) Mm.

603
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:04,318
Let's get stoned.

604
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:12,877
Yeah, sure.

605
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,520
I like David.

606
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:26,518
Yeah, me too. A lot.

607
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:30,559
Careful, somebody might take him away.

608
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:35,002
Yeah, go ahead and try.

609
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:41,358
Dude... You and me, we're the same.

610
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,799
Maybe.

611
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,242
I live down La Habra.

612
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,156
Look, I didn't mean to,
but I'm too wasted to drive.

613
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,835
(Both laugh)

614
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,596
You could have pulled out the couch.

615
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:15,286
He was already asleep on the floor.

616
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:17,397
I'll get him another blanket.

617
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:20,920
Shut up and get over here.

618
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,401
No. You killed me today.

619
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,126
- You loved it.
- Not as much as you did.

620
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:30,238
You tried to kill me.

621
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:47,561
Can we help you?

622
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:49,598
It's cold out there.

623
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,444
Do you have room for me?

624
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,124
Yeah, yeah.

625
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:34,446
How do you like your eggs?

626
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:38,036
Um, I'll just have juice, thanks.

627
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,524
Morning.

628
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:45,484
Morning.

629
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:54,526
So, Sarge, will you be paintballing today?

630
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:57,687
No. I gotta get going soon.

631
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:00,681
- Working on my uncle's car.
- (David) Ah.

632
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:02,718
Scoot over.

633
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:12,038
I left my number next to the bed so
if you're ever in La Habra, you could find me.

634
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,879
Thanks.

635
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:23,918
Will you pass the funnies?

636
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,764
Daddy's Book is where he put
everything he found that was true.

637
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:40,726
This is why we live by the Book of Daddy,

638
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:45,283
which says there is no death,
there is only birth.

639
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:49,523
And birth and birth and birth.

640
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,643
The Book of Daddy says, "Consider the trees

641
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:56,962
"that allow the birds to perch

642
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,999
"and fly away without calling them back.

643
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:04,402
"If your heart can be like a tree,
you'll be close to the way."

644
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:07,166
The Book of Daddy says,

645
00:48:07,207 --> 00:48:10,995
"When the multitude laughs at you,
you are blessed."

646
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:14,880
And this is what Daddy wants us to know.

647
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:18,162
"I depart as air.

648
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:21,085
"I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,

649
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,877
"I bequeath myself to the dirt

650
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:26,122
"to grow from the grass I love.

651
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:29,443
"If you want me again,

652
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:31,682
"look for me under your boot soles.

653
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:36,155
"You will hardly know who I am or what I mean

654
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:39,119
"but I shall be good health to you nevertheless.

655
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:44,724
"Missing me one place? Search another.

656
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,282
"I stop somewhere.

657
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:51,523
"Waiting for you."

658
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,565
I hate to see The People go.

659
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:59,121
(David) Mm. I just hope the cheque clears.

660
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:02,842
Of course it will.
Daddy worked in hospitals, he was a clown.

661
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:04,684
Why am I not surprised?

662
00:49:04,727 --> 00:49:09,801
There's a big market for hand mops
and they're on welfare and social security.

663
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:13,283
Yeah, that's where I want my tax dollars to go.

664
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:16,285
I'd rather buy them cheese than build bombs.

665
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:19,080
At least they practise what they preach.

666
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:22,119
The People won't kill any living creature.

667
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,397
They've all had lice for years.

668
00:49:24,447 --> 00:49:27,484
I've had to boil everything but I don't mind.

669
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,518
Mom, that's disgusting.

670
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,319
Oh, God.

671
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:35,241
'What are you dressed like that for? '

672
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:37,596
'I'm going to a funeral. So are you. '

673
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:39,399
'Yeah? Who died? '

674
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,438
'Walker Stevenson. '

675
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,637
'Give me a break. '

676
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:46,962
'I think these are people we know... '

677
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:48,442
(TV off)

678
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:55,281
Did Olivier make a move on you?

679
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,806
Whoa, whoa.

680
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:58,246
What?

681
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:02,405
Since I got back from Azusa
you've been all quiet and weird

682
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:04,597
and he really likes you.

683
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,162
Did he make a move on you?
Cos he really likes you, too.

684
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,117
No, but he flirts.

685
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:14,318
Well, he flirts with everything.

686
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,000
- Well, did he?
- No. Jesus.

687
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:25,157
I mean, we... we smoked a joint
and we watched TV.

688
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,556
And even if he did make a move,
hello, I'm not gay.

689
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:33,198
I'm your fucking boyfriend.

690
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,358
Come here.

691
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:45,518
Come here.

692
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:59,081
Look, if he ever does anything,
you have to tell me.

693
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:00,924
Yeah.

694
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:04,438
Ugh.

695
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:15,160
So, we're gonna have to boil everything.
If Maya gets lice...

696
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,675
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

697
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:21,923
You're looking good.

698
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:23,764
Thanks.

699
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,365
Feel like I haven't seen you lately.

700
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:32,443
What's been going on?

701
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,523
Wouldn't you like to know?

702
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:39,005
Right now, I could fuck you where you stand.

703
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:45,924
What's different? Is it hair? Perfume?

704
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:49,325
Maybe nothing's different. Maybe it's just me.

705
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:52,080
Maybe.

706
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,681
You're lucky I love you.

707
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,198
You're lucky I do.

708
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:31,398
I care for you, Arthur.

709
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:35,316
I care for your music.

710
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,597
I care for your hankies.

711
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:40,638
I won't pretend I don't.

712
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,318
That would be a lie.

713
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,719
If you want me to leave you alone, I will.

714
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:51,043
But that's your choice because I choose you.

715
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:05,043
There's something
I didn't tell you about Petrarch.

716
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:07,078
Oh?

717
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:15,278
He started the Renaissance.
