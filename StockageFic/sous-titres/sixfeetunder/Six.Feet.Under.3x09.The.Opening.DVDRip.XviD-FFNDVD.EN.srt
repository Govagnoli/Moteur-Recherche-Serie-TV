1
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,002
Claire, you're drooping.

2
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,932
- Higher.
- Really?

3
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:42,649
I wanna make them feel like
the crow's gonna peck their eyes out.

4
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,524
Good.

5
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,723
- $75? That's so low.
- I've never sold a piece in my life.

6
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:09,129
- I want someone to buy it.
- But it's not just a print.

7
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,603
- You got a good spot.
- Do you think?

8
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,690
- Have you seen mine?
- Where?

9
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,724
Exactly.

10
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,648
- Follow me into the annex.
- Cool pyramid.

11
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:35,691
This is weird. Does Olivier know
they put you here?

12
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:40,011
He said there are only four first years in
the show and some people would be grateful.

13
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,122
Nice.

14
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:46,329
- 500?
- Is that disgusting?

15
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:51,606
The copper spray was so expensive, I had
to take a loan out to pay for the fucking thing.

16
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:55,043
It sucks. I'll buy dinner.

17
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,847
Hey, you people. I'm needing workers here.

18
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:04,331
Can you untangle this mobile? It's by
some big alumni idiot and I got it all fucked up.

19
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:11,445
Olivier, do you think I should have priced
my photograph higher?

20
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,132
The price tag and the placement.
It's disgusting.

21
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,529
20 years old, you should wanna
give your work away.

22
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:22,169
Nobody in this country is born with a soul.
It has to be beaten into you.

23
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,929
There's another part that I ruined.
Lord knows where it goes.

24
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,884
Have you seen this?

25
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,252
I don't like that guy. He's too veiny.

26
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:41,284
Sarge was veiny.

27
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,082
Let's get the new Matt Summers.

28
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:52,168
- I don't know why we wouldn't tell Frank.
- There's nothing to say.

29
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:57,082
- It was just a fun thing we did.
- A fun thing we never did before.

30
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,125
So was the gospel brunch.
We didn't talk about that.

31
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:04,007
- Do you wanna talk about that?
- No. Do you wanna talk about Sarge?

32
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:08,092
Not really. I just thought
it seemed like a therapy topic.

33
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,126
- I'd rather talk about the dishes thing.
- You're still angry about that.

34
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,164
David.

35
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,125
- Father Jack.
- Please call me Jack.

36
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:20,131
- How are you?
- Great. You?

37
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,971
- Just fine.
- This is due on Wednesday.

38
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,527
- What'd you rent?
- Something Keith picked.

39
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:32,847
- Sister Act. OK.
- Jack, have you met my boyfriend Keith?

40
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:38,206
- I don't think so.
- This is Father Jack from St Bartholomew.

41
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,448
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

42
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,451
You still have Back To The Crack:
Butt Munch 2.

43
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,484
It was due last Friday.

44
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,244
Thank you.

45
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:58,567
Sorry, I can't. I cannot have
this conversation one more time.

46
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,642
- I can't give you what you want.
- Love?

47
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:07,811
I give you love, Lisa.
I fucking give you love every day.

48
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,048
There's just always some fucking thing.

49
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,642
Introducing Maya to some friend
before I introduced you. Who cares?

50
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:18,483
It happens all the time.
It's like I'm an afterthought. People notice.

51
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,411
I can't do any better than this.

52
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:26,322
Some women might be happy with a faithful,
committed, devoted father and husband.

53
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:30,571
- Father and husband.
- I just don't have anything else for you.

54
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:34,970
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Nothing. I don't know.

55
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,164
This isn't right.

56
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,124
What isn't right?

57
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,283
This. Us.

58
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,291
- But I thought you loved me.
- I do.

59
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,642
- But not enough.
- It's enough for me.

60
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,526
- It's not, though.
- It's not enough for you.

61
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:10,451
I'm totally fucking fine with what we have.

62
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,166
You're not happy
but you have to make it about me.

63
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:15,408
That's what I can't live with any more.

64
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,331
- So what are you saying? You wanna leave?
- Leave?

65
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,286
I would have to leave because I moved
my whole life to this shithole city!

66
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,528
Not for me, you didn't!

67
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:28,929
So you wanna split up?

68
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,203
Maybe, yeah.

69
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:34,131
I don't know. Maybe.

70
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:08,084
Just a moment.

71
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:18,011
- Why, hello.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

72
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:20,442
Not at all. Please come in.

73
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:28,923
That last song was so beautiful.
Did you write it yourself?

74
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:33,683
- I did.
- It was just wonderful.

75
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,122
I'm so pleased that you liked it.

76
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:43,527
I thought I would call it Semiprecious.

77
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:48,601
- For your Aunt Pearl?
- In part, yes.

78
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:54,928
I don't know how you can get
such a beautiful sound from a computer.

79
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,725
It's unexpected.

80
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:02,244
As a child, I played the violin,
but when I went to college, I...

81
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:08,243
I had a very cruel roommate who threw
the violin from our dormitory window.

82
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:13,686
It was hand-carved by my Uncle Gunther
before he died of polio.

83
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:22,172
I gave up playing the violin altogether
and left college to go to mortuary school.

84
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:28,765
It was there in the computer room that
I discovered another way to make music.

85
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,804
Oh, my.

86
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:41,210
I wonder if you're available tomorrow night
to come with me to this art opening.

87
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:46,125
It's a benefit show for Claire's school.

88
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:50,803
Apparently, some of these alumni
are quite well-known artists.

89
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,242
I'm afraid I don't know any of their names.

90
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:57,809
Claire's very excited. She's one of the few
students whose work has been selected.

91
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:01,243
I think it's important for her that we all be there.

92
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,972
I would be honoured to go.

93
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:08,289
If you feel it would be appropriate.

94
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,485
Well, of course.
You're a member of our little family here.

95
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,922
Thank you.

96
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,612
That means so much to me.

97
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:22,249
The secret is the new three-in-one invention
called the fanny lifter.

98
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:26,172
Part one is a six-inch segment
used in the cardio sculpting.

99
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,204
Part two, an eight-inch section...

100
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,244
What are you doing?

101
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,725
- What's going on with dinner?
- Couldn't decide.

102
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:37,731
Why not? Who cares? Meatloaf is fine.

103
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,845
Then I have to go out for meat.

104
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,566
So we'll make some rice and beans.

105
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:48,243
- Kids had rice already for lunch.
- That's OK. It's one day.

106
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,682
I couldn't remember what we had last night.

107
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,122
We had burgers last night.

108
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:00,006
That's where the meat went.

109
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,212
- Are you taking the medication?
- Yes.

110
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:13,007
It's only been two weeks.
He said it takes up to a month sometimes.

111
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,044
For anything to happen at all?

112
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:18,881
I gained five pounds already,
so something's happening.

113
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:49,406
Her mom's pretty much crazy.
She couldn't deal with arranging the funeral.

114
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,881
I don't think Melinda
even told her we broke up.

115
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:58,212
Did Melinda leave any instructions
for what she wanted in terms of a service?

116
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:03,611
No. She did leave me a note.

117
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,842
But it wasn't about her funeral.

118
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,411
I tried to end the relationship before,

119
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:17,047
but she always said she was going...

120
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,525
I never thought she was really going to do it.

121
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:28,572
But maybe, in some way, I did,

122
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:33,932
because I stayed for years
after I wanted to leave.

123
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,965
I finally moved out about two weeks ago.

124
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,924
And I thought she was OK.

125
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,164
She seemed really...

126
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,044
calm about it.

127
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:54,372
And then... it's like I keep waiting
to find out it's all this mistake.

128
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,722
It's not your fault.

129
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:58,764
This note.

130
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,964
It's so horrible.

131
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,049
You had to live your own life.

132
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,563
- Was she depressed?
- For years, yeah.

133
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,410
- What was she like?
- Rico.

134
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:12,172
It was like those tribes or whatever,

135
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:16,570
they think if you take their picture,
they'll lose their spirit.

136
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:22,364
It was like her spirit got stolen,

137
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:26,452
and all that was left was this body
that she didn't even want any more.

138
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:30,645
- Was she on medication at all?
- Everything, all of them.

139
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,924
Mostly it just made things worse.

140
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,330
Then she was on something
that was really working. I thought.

141
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:42,412
- What was it? Paxil?
- Paxil made her really jittery.

142
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:46,969
This was a combination of Zoloft
and something else.

143
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,724
She did seem better.

144
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:57,168
I'd have never left
if I didn't think she'd be all right.

145
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,964
It's OK.

146
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,484
Mommy's OK.

147
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:16,808
I hear that when I rewash the dishes
after you've washed them,

148
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:23,372
it makes you feel like
I don't think you're good enough.

149
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:27,888
- Did David hear you correctly?
- Yes.

150
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:34,647
So I'm sorry and I'll try not to do it any more.

151
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:38,004
Thank you.

152
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,408
Has anything else come up
since our last session?

153
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:48,763
- Not really.
- David?

154
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,283
We did have three-way sex with a stranger.

155
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,531
I just wanna make sure Frank thinks
that's a healthy couple activity.

156
00:15:56,573 --> 00:16:00,043
How did it feel to you?

157
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:04,291
Fine. It was a lot more enjoyable
than the paintball.

158
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:09,007
- What do you think, though?
- Were you safe?

159
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,372
Of course.

160
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:15,612
There are certainly a variety of ways
that couples can enjoy their sexuality.

161
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:19,009
Then it's totally OK
to just have sex with whoever?

162
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:23,569
Generally, it's best when there's
an open negotiation between partners

163
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:26,810
as to what the rules are in these situations,

164
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,208
so that both people are comfortable.

165
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:35,085
Were you both comfortable
with what happened?

166
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:39,411
- Yes.
- We didn't exactly negotiate the rules.

167
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,286
It just sort of happened.

168
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,767
Is it something you might wanna do again?

169
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,805
It was very liberating

170
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:51,209
to be spontaneous and kind of wild together

171
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:55,849
instead of always being so careful
about everything.

172
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:03,046
It was fun to be wild.

173
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:08,770
If this is something that you think
you might like to do again,

174
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:13,364
then I suggest you take some time
to lay down some ground rules.

175
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,484
OK.

176
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,488
Do you need to borrow some blush? Those
peach tones you're wearing just don't pop.

177
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:37,571
That's OK. I don't need to pop tonight.

178
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:42,323
- Want some of these for your bag?
- I quit, remember?

179
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:47,367
- I didn't know you were still in that mode.
- That's the goal, to stay in the mode.

180
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,967
I'm just curious. What makes you think
that was such a problem for you?

181
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:56,528
- Being stoned all day and night?
- It was never like that.

182
00:17:56,573 --> 00:18:00,771
- How would you know?
- I work with addicts. You're not an addict.

183
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:07,082
You went through a difficult break-up
and needed to act out, but that was just stress.

184
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,284
I'm not interested in discussing this with you.

185
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,052
You seemed very defensive
when I offered you a joint.

186
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,927
I would appreciate it
if you respected my choices.

187
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,168
If I thought that they were your choices

188
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:23,570
and not some 12-step Christian dogma,
I'd feel much better about it.

189
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:27,845
Whenever in my whole life have I ever wanted
to take on someone else's dogma?

190
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:34,332
- That is not a big problem of mine.
- But you do tend to overdramatise yourself.

191
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:38,605
I'm sorry, but I've known you for a long time.

192
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,611
Thanks for your support, Mom.

193
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,009
But I am sorry if you feel I've been insensitive.

194
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,884
Thank you.

195
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:56,289
- You guys ready? The car's double-parked.
- I just have to do one final coat.

196
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,724
- How you doing?
- OK.

197
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,369
I'm sick of being
so fucking conscious all the time.

198
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:16,806
It's like I'm this incredibly boring,
watered-down version of myself.

199
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,844
I know what you mean.

200
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:26,123
- What piece have you got in this thing tonight?
- It's a new one. Might suck.

201
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:30,849
- That's all right, sweetie. It's for charity.
- I'm sure it doesn't suck.

202
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:34,727
That blouse might actually work
if you got rid of the bra.

203
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,766
That skirt might actually work
if you got rid of that ass.

204
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:45,207
- It's 7:15. Where's the baby-sitter?
- I'm sure she just hit traffic.

205
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,604
Oh, God.

206
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:11,212
- You don't have to come if you don't want to.
- I'm not going for you. I'm going for Claire.

207
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,245
- I have a relationship with her.
- I know.

208
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,523
I thought maybe we should talk some more.

209
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,564
Obviously.

210
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,689
That's Kayla.

211
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,882
Fuck it. I'll just be cold.

212
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,644
Come here, baby.

213
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,884
I'm pretty sure that's Jan Vanhoosen.

214
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:42,130
- Look, he's going straight to his own piece.
- Narcissist.

215
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,646
- Who'd ever buy that?
- MoMA.

216
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:53,324
- Let's go see if anyone's looking at my piece.
- Narcissist.

217
00:20:57,813 --> 00:21:00,373
I just feel bad for it back here all by itself,

218
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,404
no one coming to see it.

219
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:07,130
Oh, my God. Someone bought it already?

220
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:11,006
Do you think it's a mistake?

221
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,329
Russell, it's a really beautiful piece.

222
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,491
Maybe that's why I got such a good spot.

223
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,452
Do you think somebody
actually thought I was somebody?

224
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:29,484
You are somebody.

225
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,442
It's pretty good, don't you think,
for a 19-year-old?

226
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:40,769
Yeah, I guess. Looks like art.

227
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,645
- It's dark.
- Really? I think it's kind of funny.

228
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:48,365
Funny?

229
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,933
It's so, "What's the point?"

230
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,692
Come on. It's like, "Life goes on."

231
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:58,726
I so totally don't get that,
and I know Claire a lot better than you do.

232
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:02,322
- She has no sense of humour?
- She has a very dark vision.

233
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:06,412
I think you just have this one really old idea
about who she is.

234
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,762
Maybe, but it happens to be accurate.

235
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,168
- It's magnificent.
- It's great.

236
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:14,204
Thanks.

237
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:18,046
- It's so incredible.
- Awesome.

238
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:22,325
- God, you guys didn't all have to come.
- Why not? It's a big deal.

239
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,648
- It's so not.
- Is that Vigo Mortensen?

240
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,002
- How did you get the plastered-out look?
- Who?

241
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:30,807
- It's infrared film.
- No, it says duratrans.

242
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:35,210
It's like this process they use
for ads in airports. It's really boring.

243
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,689
- No, it's not.
- I love that movie. I wept.

244
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,611
- I remember.
- Fiona Kleinschmidt.

245
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,486
She's got some pots in the next room.

246
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,969
Nate was deflowered
by a mildly famous ceramicist.

247
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:54,641
I don't think she's coming, though.
I heard she was in Japan.

248
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:58,442
Where'd you guys get the drinks?

249
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:03,769
I pumped so I could drink tonight,
because I wanna drink tonight.

250
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,281
- The bar's over there.
- Need anything?

251
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:16,372
So what happened to you? You were showing
everywhere and then nothing.

252
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,643
Did you get married or something?

253
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:23,289
- I went crazy.
- What a drag. Where'd they put you?

254
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,325
- Clarendon.
- That place isn't too bad.

255
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:29,649
I had another student who used to go there.
Micky Herschel.

256
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:34,005
I think they had some of his feeling art
hanging in the cafeteria.

257
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,452
- How was it?
- Not bad.

258
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:38,087
- He had a breakthrough with me.
- Who doesn't?

259
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,931
- The repressed people.
- Right. Them.

260
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,404
Billy.

261
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:48,089
- How are you?
- Great. How are you?

262
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,124
I'm good.

263
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,723
You guys know each other?

264
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:57,368
- Olivier visited for a term while I was here.
- He was my best student.

265
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:02,441
After I cracked him open.
Before it was all too pretentious, right?

266
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:06,088
- The first class I ever taught.
- You said you taught in Argentina.

267
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:10,843
I lied. There's Jani. I have to go pretend
I like his piece of shit.

268
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:15,762
Jani, it's so good to see you.

269
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,884
His best student?

270
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:25,242
I don't know about that. I'm pretty sure
I was the only one sleeping with him.

271
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,363
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:30,564
It was a pretty amazing experience for me.

273
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:34,049
I had a lot of static around my sexuality.

274
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:37,130
It was totally suffocating my work.

275
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:42,084
It was a sex thing, not a gay thing.

276
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:47,565
Wasn't that sort of a fucked-up
power dynamic, though?

277
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:51,128
There's always a fucked-up
power dynamic in sex, isn't there?

278
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:54,523
Not always.

279
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,324
How you doing?

280
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,364
Fine.

281
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:10,007
This dip tastes like vomit.

282
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,044
Cheese is OK. Here.

283
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:16,764
It's all right, thanks.

284
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,286
I don't want that, thanks.

285
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,528
- You eat it.
- I just had some.

286
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,962
So throw it out.

287
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:31,164
You don't want that.

288
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,412
- I don't?
- I'm told it tastes like vomit.

289
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:43,363
Brenda, this is my wife Lisa. Lisa, Brenda.

290
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:46,409
Nice to meet you.

291
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:51,931
You too.

292
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,965
So what can I eat here?

293
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:32,086
Disturbing work always takes longer to sell.
Most people want something that's pretty.

294
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:37,526
- Like the cleaning supply installation?
- He was on the cover of Art Forum.

295
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:42,806
Olivier's right.
You can't give a fuck about what sells.

296
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:47,688
- It's easy for you to say.
- Yeah, but that was just a fluke.

297
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:51,487
My mom probably called from Florida
to put a hold on it.

298
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,524
That's sweet.

299
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:58,883
If my mother buys mine, I'll kill myself.

300
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,128
Any asshole can take a camera to a cemetery.

301
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:04,449
It's better than my lame self-portraits
from my first year.

302
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,484
That's true.

303
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,281
Baby, it's so nice in here.

304
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:40,769
Angie and her boyfriend
took the boys to Shaky's

305
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,202
and then to play Goofy Golf.

306
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:49,207
Baby, I can't drink on these pills.

307
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:52,684
I forgot.

308
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:56,885
- Even if they're not working yet?
- You're not supposed to.

309
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,924
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

310
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:39,732
You know, if this medication isn't working,
you can try a different one.

311
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:42,651
I know. I'm a nurse.

312
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:47,926
I'm just saying, sometimes it takes a while
for you to find the right one.

313
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:50,931
Baby, I know. I'm a nurse.

314
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:15,204
Billy's?

315
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:21,085
- It's really different for him, isn't it?
- Yeah.

316
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,124
I like it. I think.

317
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:27,806
It's very...

318
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,889
cool.

319
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:33,209
- And sort of painless.
- You haven't seen it before?

320
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,369
No.

321
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:38,052
He doesn't use me that way any more.

322
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:40,482
That sounds like an improvement.

323
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,204
It's my new thing.

324
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:53,132
I won't take care of anyone else
so I'll be forced to take care of myself.

325
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,209
Theoretically.

326
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:59,246
- How's that going for you?
- I'm still living with my mother.

327
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:02,683
- Who isn't?
- God, that's right. You too.

328
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,724
Temporarily.

329
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,964
We've really evolved.

330
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:22,642
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Come on in.

331
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:26,402
We're smoking some of my husband's
cancer pot.

332
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,967
It's incredible, and I got a ton of it.

333
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,042
Went a lot faster than anybody expected.

334
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,447
Jani was just talking about that pyramid.

335
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:40,929
- You been in it yet?
- Too much of a line.

336
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,692
It's fantastic. Sensual.

337
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:47,248
- It's plastic.
- I thought I heard your voice.

338
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,843
I looked for you.

339
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:57,724
Are you ready to go out and get that drink?

340
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,764
In a minute.

341
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,126
You're smoking pot.

342
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,052
- You want some?
- It's California pharmaceutical grade.

343
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,921
- No, thanks.
- Oh, God, Bern.

344
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,007
- It's lovely, Claire.
- Lovely?

345
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:22,932
The way it looks.

346
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:26,568
- Did you make the frame as well?
- No, I bought the frame.

347
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,526
- It was the perfect choice.
- Well done.

348
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:35,046
This must be your mother.

349
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:39,245
Mom, this is Olivier Castro-Staal,
my form-and-space teacher.

350
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:42,365
- It's so nice to meet you.
- And you.

351
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:48,442
- This is my friend Arthur Martin.
- It is a pleasure and an honour.

352
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:52,362
I know you've had quite an effect on Claire.

353
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:55,052
Not as much as you have.

354
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:57,084
Thank you.

355
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,522
What do you think of her piece?

356
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,128
I think it's very sweet, really.

357
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,324
- It's supposed to be disturbing.
- It is.

358
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:12,046
Great art often provokes controversy.

359
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:16,962
And, if I may, I also feel
the image is quite tender.

360
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:20,767
It suggests the quiet dignity of eternal love.

361
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:29,085
Would anyone care for
a refreshment or an hors d'oeuvre?

362
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,931
No, thanks.

363
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:33,964
I'll come with you.

364
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:43,005
- You think they're fucking?
- No.

365
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,847
I'm sorry if that was weird before.

366
00:32:59,013 --> 00:33:01,447
It was a little confusing.

367
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:07,202
- I didn't tell Nate we'd met.
- But you did know who I was at the spa.

368
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:11,371
- No. I just figured it out.
- Just now?

369
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:17,604
Then why were you pretending
we'd never met?

370
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:21,771
I don't know, I just didn't wanna
get into it with him.

371
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:26,722
I think you did know
who I was when you came in.

372
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:34,889
I'm sorry. I just wanted to know
what you were like.

373
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:40,284
That's weird and dishonest
and kind of stalkerish.

374
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:49,329
Getting a massage isn't the best way of finding
out what happened between Nate and me.

375
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:52,968
- He hasn't been very clear about it.
- Why does it matter?

376
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,204
I don't know.

377
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:02,332
I'm such a wreck right now.

378
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:12,522
He's pretty good at making people feel crazy.
Not that I wasn't.

379
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:17,442
I am too, I think.
I feel like I've totally lost my mind.

380
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:22,521
What was I doing sneaking around like that?
It's so desperate.

381
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:26,328
It's not desperate.

382
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:30,889
It's just trying to get something you don't have.

383
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,686
- You mean Nate?
- You have Nate.

384
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,691
I think you'll have him for ever if you want him.

385
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,246
He doesn't love me the way he loved you.

386
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,052
He didn't love me.

387
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,084
Not really.

388
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:54,129
He was just trying to get
something he didn't have.

389
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,772
He's such a fucking idiot.

390
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:23,407
He's living life.

391
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,323
It doesn't feel like plastic.

392
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:50,649
It feels like those shells, abalone.

393
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:53,924
I know.

394
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:58,728
Kind of makes you wanna build
a pyramid to live in.

395
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:06,891
- I understand why you wanna leave.
- I don't wanna leave.

396
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:11,609
I'm not happy either.
I wanna blame you, but it's not your fault.

397
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:17,926
I've known you for so long, I don't know why
I thought getting married would transform you.

398
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:22,205
- It has transformed me.
- I know. I didn't mean it to sound like that.

399
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:28,488
I know how committed you are. I just mean
it didn't change the way you feel about me.

400
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:33,243
- God, it did, though.
- Not the way I wanted it to.

401
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:41,523
It's not fair to you and I guess
it's not fair to me either, really.

402
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:52,567
It's good we tried. I think we had to try.

403
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:04,930
Don't you think we could maybe now just...

404
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,884
start from a different place?

405
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:13,683
Neither one of us is ever gonna be
what the other person wants.

406
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:18,761
This is bullshit, this idea of what we want.
Maybe it's enough now to just stop pretending.

407
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:23,728
- And be like friends, you mean?
- Yeah, but not just that.

408
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:27,048
- And you wanna be lovers still?
- Yeah.

409
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:30,210
Without all the pressure
to be something we're not.

410
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:33,962
But what if it's never any good?

411
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:36,573
Then we'll know we really tried.

412
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:40,004
Really tried.

413
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:53,691
- I feel really relieved.
- You do? I do too.

414
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,883
You see? These fucking pyramids
really do work.

415
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,844
Sorry.

416
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,687
It's OK. Come in.

417
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:25,682
It's really nice in here.

418
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:32,372
It's supposed to have the same proportions
as the pyramids in Egypt.

419
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:36,804
I thought it was supposed to be
this horrible plastic version of a sacred space.

420
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:39,811
That's kind of a reverse message.

421
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:42,651
Like modern life isn't always so bad?

422
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,284
I don't know, like...

423
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:52,207
even though we feel like we've lost touch
with this more authentic history,

424
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:56,212
there's a continuity that we don't even realise.

425
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:04,321
That's really comforting.

426
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,762
I wish we never had to leave.

427
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,931
Excuse me. Do you know who bought it?

428
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:26,964
Fifi Rochedale.

429
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:33,244
- Is that you?
- No.

430
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:36,244
It isn't.

431
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:42,132
Your old cat's name was Fifi
and I don't know where you got Rochedale.

432
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:46,963
- It's the street. It's your porn name. Nice.
- God, you're fast.

433
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:51,211
- It doesn't make it OK that no one wanted it.
- I wanted it.

434
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:54,290
- I love it.
- You're in debt.

435
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,767
It's a good investment.

436
00:39:56,813 --> 00:40:00,692
The thing's gonna be worth
so much more in five years.

437
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:18,044
- Weird.
- Checked all the stalls?

438
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:20,084
Yeah, and upstairs.

439
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,244
What shall we do?

440
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:26,729
Fuck it. She's got a cellphone.
She can call a cab.

441
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,203
Might I remove my glasses?

442
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,448
- Please do.
- Thank you.

443
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,607
How weird was it
that Brenda was there tonight?

444
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,167
I don't know. How weird was it?

445
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:54,842
She dropped off the face of the planet
as far as I knew.

446
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:57,123
What do you think about him?

447
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,006
- He's pretty sexy.
- So?

448
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,243
- So what?
- Do you wanna go for it?

449
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,406
- Really?
- Unless you like someone better.

450
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:16,889
I just thought we were supposed to be
negotiating if we did it again.

451
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,289
We are negotiating.
You can pick somebody else.

452
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:23,450
Frank made it sound like
there are rules or something.

453
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:26,326
- Like what?
- I don't know.

454
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:28,967
Maybe certain things
we only do with each other.

455
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,004
Like what?

456
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:35,243
- I don't know, like kissing, maybe?
- That sounds OK.

457
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:37,329
Would that be rude to the other person?

458
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:39,443
I'm sure he won't care.

459
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:42,882
OK, let's start with that.

460
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,604
That's Patrick.

461
00:42:50,373 --> 00:42:52,364
What about him?

462
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:54,768
For us? No way.

463
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,327
Why not? He's so nice.

464
00:42:57,373 --> 00:43:00,683
We're not doing it with somebody we know.
It's just creepy.

465
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:03,201
I'm gonna talk to the tall guy.

466
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:09,842
I thought you were at your sister's art thing.

467
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:11,884
We just came from there.

468
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,522
How is this place?

469
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:19,566
I don't know. It seems
pretty much like a free-for-all.

470
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:23,322
I think I'm not so much a gay-bar person.
Is that really sad for me?

471
00:43:23,373 --> 00:43:25,762
I think that's really happy for you.

472
00:43:38,293 --> 00:43:40,488
Mom?

473
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:43,411
Darling, you're home.

474
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,841
I'm sorry. It was too late to stop.

475
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:53,923
Honey, I bought a painting.

476
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:07,204
All right, then.

477
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:13,687
Thank you for a lovely evening.

478
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,644
I should be getting back now.

479
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,572
You can stay if you'd like.

480
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:22,604
No, I couldn't.

481
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,332
I really should be getting back.

482
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,924
All right.

483
00:44:38,973 --> 00:44:40,964
Thank you so very much.

484
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,363
Thank you.

485
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:54,644
Thank you.

486
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:57,685
Let us know if there's anything else we can do.

487
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,728
That's hard to live with.

488
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:16,851
- Someone kills herself over you.
- She was depressed.

489
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:20,363
But he said she was doing fine.
She was on the right medication.

490
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:23,086
She did it because he left her.

491
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:28,331
It's depressing how deluded
people are about what love is.

492
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:33,731
Wait. What do you mean?

493
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,368
Like it's gonna make their lives better.

494
00:46:37,413 --> 00:46:40,689
It does a little, right?

495
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,248
It's just not like someone else
can change who you are.

496
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:47,488
Like this woman Melinda.

497
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,286
That guy was the only good thing in her life?

498
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,722
He didn't seem that great to me.

499
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:56,642
I wouldn't wanna be him right now.

500
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,244
Me neither.

501
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,689
It takes all my heart to keep
from giving that asshole in five

502
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:08,883
a triple dose of this stool softener.

503
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:12,130
It would hurt us more than it would hurt him.

504
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:14,926
- How are you doing on the Paxil?
- Not great.

505
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:19,888
- All I can feel are the side effects.
- So when are you gonna go see Rogers?

506
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:25,291
I should try and stop in this week,
but I always feel like he has no idea who I am.

507
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:29,008
I go in there for five minutes
and he goes down some list.

508
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:33,410
They don't give a fuck. They just give you
whatever samples came with the best gifts.

509
00:47:33,453 --> 00:47:38,447
When I was depressed, the only thing
that worked was Celexa with Ativan.

510
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:46,643
I should probably ask Rogers.

511
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,888
Just try it and see if it works for you.

512
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:53,370
You can tell Rogers that you saw
another doctor while you were on vacation.

513
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,404
Here.

514
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,204
Gave you generic.

515
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,289
Still the machine.

516
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:12,126
I already left a message
saying I was coming over,

517
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:15,643
so if she wants me to walk in on more fucking,
that's her choice.

518
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,891
I can do it for you if you feel like you've seen
enough of Mom's pussy for a few days.

519
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,447
Who could ever see too much
of Mom's pussy?

520
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:24,848
It's like a trip down memory lane.

521
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,486
- Really, though.
- I know. Thanks.

522
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:32,969
- I don't even know where everything is.
- I can come with you.

523
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,444
That would help.

524
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:49,292
Good.

525
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,769
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- I have the space.

526
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:55,725
It's just until I get my client list back together.

527
00:48:55,773 --> 00:48:58,333
Stay as long as you can stand my friends.

528
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:01,729
Is Kenny still over here all the time?

529
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,492
You know what? He's not that bad.

530
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:07,206
He used to come into my room
and fart on my pillow.

531
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:09,244
He was ten.

532
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:12,684
Get up.

533
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:26,731
I can't believe how much money
I've spent fucking up my life.

534
00:49:29,973 --> 00:49:32,726
- Did you ever find out who bought your piece?
- Yep.

535
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:34,809
- Was it your mom?
- I wish.

536
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:37,651
You wish? Who could be worse
than your mom?

537
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:41,729
- It wasn't my mom, was it?
- No.

538
00:49:44,053 --> 00:49:46,283
It was Olivier.

539
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:56,247
- That's flattering.
- I'm sure it's just some kind of head trip.

540
00:49:57,013 --> 00:49:58,731
Why?

541
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:03,168
To teach me some kind of
weird lesson or something.

542
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:09,092
- What kind of lesson?
- Like he owns me.

543
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,084
His whole power thing.

544
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:19,686
Maybe he just really liked your piece.

545
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,724
Kind of doubt it.

546
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,724
Tickles.

547
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:12,291
- I fell asleep.
- It's OK.

548
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,528
- Is it late?
- It's not even five.

549
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:17,371
- Is Maya...
- She's fine. She's sleeping.

550
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:25,170
- How long have you been here?
- I just got here.

551
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,572
What?

552
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:33,964
Nothing.

553
00:51:34,813 --> 00:51:37,008
I'm just happy to see you.

554
00:51:39,653 --> 00:51:41,644
- You are?
- Yeah.

555
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:46,368
I'm happy to see you too.
