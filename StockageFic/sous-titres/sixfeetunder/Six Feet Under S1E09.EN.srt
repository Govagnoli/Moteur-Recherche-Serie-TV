1
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,756
Yo, what's up? You get it?

2
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,795
No, I didn't get anything. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

3
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,878
- Anthony, go play in Mom's room.
- Why?

4
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,510
Because I said so,
you little shit. Go!

5
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:39,231
Get up, come on.

6
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:42,195
You suck!

7
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,636
Kid's got so much major attitude.

8
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:49,521
Six years old and he's
already a hard-ass.

9
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,961
You can get more of this stuff?
How much?

10
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:32,314
- How much money do you have?
- Oh, like I'm a fucking loaded.

11
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,917
Hey, Bennett and I are going to
that record release party tonight.

12
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,961
And then there's an
after-hours in Hollywood.

13
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,835
No, dude, I fucking hate that shit.

14
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:48,631
It's always a bunch of
whacked-out faggot tweakers...

15
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:51,311
...shoving glow sticks in your eyes.
- It's at Sin Sin.

16
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,038
Great, whacked-out Asian tweakers.

17
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,194
That club's weak, dude.

18
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:04,161
Anthony? An...

19
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,674
Oh, fuck!

20
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,274
Oh, shit.

21
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,840
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck!

22
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,637
I gotta get out of here.

23
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,597
- What?
- I gotta get that shit out of here.

24
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:24,797
Oh, fuck. Anthony?

25
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,596
Morning.

26
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:45,756
Okay. What are you mad
at me about now?

27
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:49,081
I'm busy, all right? My workload
has doubled since Federico's gone.

28
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:54,153
You can't expect me to engage you
in small talk just to make you feel better.

29
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,440
You flunked the licensing test.

30
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:03,519
- Did you think I didn't know?
- I didn't.

31
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,676
You didn't apply yourself.

32
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,558
You think this is something people do as
a last resort...

33
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,764
...and therefore it can't be that difficult.
- I feel bad. You wanna make it worse?

34
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,921
- I don't care what you feel...
- Bullshit.

35
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,236
You like it when I feel bad
because misery loves company.

36
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,959
- How'd he die?
- Heart attack.

37
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:31,157
Fell down a flight of stairs,
dead when he hit the bottom.

38
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,516
- His nose supposed to look like that?
- Of course not.

39
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,843
I have to finish embalming him before
I can start on anything cosmetic.

40
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:45,158
- I can deal with whoever it is.
- Unless it's a walk-in.

41
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,402
You are choosing
to be the victim here.

42
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,955
I could handle an intake
and you know it.

43
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,439
Ladies, teacup chain.

44
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:56,645
Good.

45
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:06,482
And walk to the middle and back.

46
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:10,080
All right, very good.
Very good, ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,677
So we'll see you all at the same time
next week, okay? Be safe getting home.

48
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:16,114
Morning, folks.

49
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,079
- Hi.
- Hi.

50
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,521
Goddamn it, why hasn't anyone
answered the door? Where is Mom?

51
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:27,325
Okay, if you haven't slept with
that guy yet, would you start?

52
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,677
Because I think it would
do you a world of good.

53
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,126
Don't do that.

54
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,285
- Do what?
- Watch me like that.

55
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,159
I can't help it.
You're beautiful.

56
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,922
Oh, for heaven's sake.

57
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:55,164
- I want to go camping again.
- Then go camping.

58
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:59,116
- With you.
- I've got a job now, Hiram.

59
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,080
I can't just up and leave
whenever I feel like it.

60
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,165
Spring is a very busy
time of the year.

61
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,477
It's our anniversary tomorrow.

62
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:13,999
The first time we went camping
was two years ago tomorrow.

63
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,245
We don't have anniversaries.

64
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,884
- I never agreed to anniversaries.
- Just you and me alone in the woods.

65
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:25,087
Naked under the stars.
Just like it was at the beginning.

66
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:29,446
Tomorrow is such short notice.

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,684
I can't promise anything.
But I'll try.

68
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,368
My mom wants to know
how quickly we can do this.

69
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:51,086
Well, I'd suggest a viewing in
two days to allow proper restoration.

70
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,162
Viewing?

71
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,397
For friends, family. You can make it
as small or as large as you wish.

72
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:03,319
No, I can't see him in a box.
I can't.

73
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,887
All right.

74
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:16,125
Ms. Dimas, seeing your son before
you bury him might help you to let go.

75
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,241
No, I don't want to see him!

76
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,082
Of course. We'll arrange
for a closed-casket ceremony.

77
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,642
Will three days
give you enough time?

78
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,927
Yeah, that's gonna be fine.

79
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,761
- Nate will show you to the door.
- Thanks.

80
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,643
What happened?

81
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,286
A 6-year-old found a gun
and was playing with it.

82
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,685
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

83
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,361
They gave me this at the hospital.

84
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,609
It's some sort of receipt. I don't know...
I don't know if you need it, but...

85
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,443
What was he doing here?

86
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:36,003
- Gabe.
- It's okay.

87
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,764
Hey.

88
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:46,001
My brother just told me.
I'm so sorry.

89
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:50,524
I didn't know where else to go.
My grandmother's funeral was here.

90
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,727
Yeah, of course.

91
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,250
My mom's waiting
for me to unlock the car.

92
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:16,927
I thought we were supposed
to encourage people to have a viewing.

93
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:20,001
Well, sometimes
people don't want that.

94
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:22,931
Well, sometimes you don't
want to work any harder.

95
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,002
When faced with the option of
not having to restore a child's head...

96
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:30,448
...that's been blown to bits, yeah,
I don't want to do that. Do you?

97
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,763
We can't force someone to do
something they're not ready to do...

98
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:38,687
...because we think it's the right thing.
Because it will make us feel better.

99
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,441
- Can I help you?
- Roses are if you love somebody, right?

100
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:54,248
Roses are the classic choice, but other
flowers could achieve the same effect.

101
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,682
What if you were gonna
ask her to marry you?

102
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,042
Oh, how lovely.

103
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,288
Well, roses would be
the perfect choice.

104
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:04,527
But she turned out
to be a cheating coward...

105
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,964
...and ran off with some shithead
that she met at traffic school.

106
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:10,531
What color would
you give a coward?

107
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:14,529
- Yellow. Yellow.
- Great.

108
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,885
Twelve dozen yellow roses
sent to this address, please.

109
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:23,971
- What would you like the card to say?
- "Fuck you, cunt. "

110
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:31,005
I think it would be more
personal if you write that.

111
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,163
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:42,046
I have to take the day off
tomorrow and Saturday.

113
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,481
Why?

114
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:46,287
I was supposed to have plans
with a friend and I forgot.

115
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,491
Is it with that man?

116
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,492
The one with the funny little car
that picks you up?

117
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:55,492
It's an electric car and it's
very good for the environment.

118
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:02,524
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you are not.

119
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,202
- You like this man?
- Can I have the days off or not?

120
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:10,329
Take! Go, I don't care.
We will miss you.

121
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,609
Beep, beep.

122
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,607
Beep, beep.

123
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:26,330
- Brenda?
- Hey there.

124
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:29,844
I'll be right out. I just
got out of the shower.

125
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:35,010
- How was work?
- It sucked.

126
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:43,010
Like I figured, I failed
that funeral director's test.

127
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:47,049
There was this intake meeting
this morning I totally fucked up.

128
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,004
And I just picked up a dead
6-year-old at the morgue.

129
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,608
All in all, it's been
a pretty bad day.

130
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,135
Goddamn it!

131
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:05,684
Sometimes I feel like I don't have
any fucking idea what I'm doing.

132
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,652
It's like I made this bullshit decision
to go into this business...

133
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:12,170
...for all the wrong reasons
and now it's too late.

134
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:20,374
- It's never too late.
- Jesus, Billy.

135
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,885
What, do you live here now?

136
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,890
No, Brenda just gave me a shiatsu.
I've been kind of tense lately.

137
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:29,166
So...

138
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,531
- Bad day?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:36,691
- Well, I've had my share of those.
- Well, I don't doubt that.

140
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:41,287
I don't really feel like cooking, so you
guys decide what we're having delivered.

141
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:48,449
That shit was all over the news.
Six years old, right?

142
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:53,093
Fuck! Some people should just
not be allowed to have kids.

143
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,536
She just sat there like a ghost.

144
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,131
Just like she'd been erased.

145
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:06,535
- I felt so fucking helpless.
- Oh, God.

146
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,975
That poor woman.

147
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:18,050
There's a tribe in Nigeria that
throws a dead baby's body...

148
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:20,447
...into the bush because they believe
if buried...

149
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:25,293
...the dead infant would offend the
earth gods which bring fertility and food.

150
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,574
The Chinese consider the death
of a child a bad death.

151
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,814
The parents and grandparents
aren't expected to go to the funeral.

152
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:35,532
Or the Balinese mother who's counseled
to be cheerful after her infant's death...

153
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:41,966
...because grief makes one vulnerable
to illness and malevolent demons.

154
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,287
Well, that was informative.

155
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:52,014
Yeah, I thought it'd be good to read
up on your boyfriend's line of work.

156
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:56,931
What a man does is...
Well, it's who he is.

157
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,850
Right, Nate?

158
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,567
Yeah.

159
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,338
A man should know the history
of his chosen profession...

160
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,614
...if he expects to be
anything but an amateur.

161
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:11,647
- So I'm an amateur.
- I prefer the term dilettante.

162
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,172
And what are you, Billy?

163
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:16,455
Running around with your camera,
taking pictures of people's lives?

164
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:17,733
Boys.

165
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:21,573
You think knowing a bunch of arcane
National Geographic shit is gonna...

166
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:25,208
...help me cope with a 6-year-old
who shot himself in the head?

167
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,652
There are plenty of places in the world
where a kid dying is pretty common.

168
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,532
But we can't deal with it,
because a dead child...

169
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:40,812
...is the greatest failure of a culture that
believes it's reversed the order of nature.

170
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,135
This was an accident.
This wasn't nature.

171
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,974
You know what
I find interesting?

172
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:52,175
If you lose a spouse,
you're called a widow or a widower.

173
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,055
If you're a child and you lose
your parents, then you're an orphan.

174
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,733
But what's the word to describe
a parent who loses a child?

175
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,451
I guess that's just too fucking
awful to even have a name.

176
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,932
- I was worried you weren't gonna show.
- I just got tied up at work.

177
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,131
Believe me, I need this
after the day I had.

178
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,455
This ought to help.

179
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,537
- Oh, what is it?
- X. Ecstasy.

180
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,129
- You ever done it?
- No, can't say that I have.

181
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,092
You're gonna love it.

182
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,737
- Are you gonna take one too?
- I'm already there. Let's dance.

183
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,250
- I'm not a very good dancer.
- You will be.

184
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,258
David.

185
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,493
David. Here,
you gotta keep drinking this.

186
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,691
She was only 63.

187
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,620
That's so young.

188
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,494
Isn't that young?

189
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,172
Have you thought about what kind
of funeral you'd like for your mother?

190
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:59,850
It has to be beautiful.
It has to be beautiful.

191
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:06,411
Well, we can offer you a wide
variety of services ranging from...

192
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:11,457
...simple to more formal to...
To anything you might need.

193
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,611
Yes, anything at all.

194
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:28,059
It's a good thing
I was there, you know?

195
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:31,572
I mean, Gabe was so wrecked
I was the one who had to trash his weed.

196
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:35,297
Seriously, if the police found that shit,
it'd be way worse, you know?

197
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,021
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey.

198
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:40,181
- How's Gabe?
- He's okay, I guess.

199
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:44,702
- Well, have you talked to him?
- Not really.

200
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,135
Well, are you gonna see him later?

201
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,498
I don't know. It's real weird over there.

202
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:56,094
- The mother's, like, all freaked.
- Yeah, but what about Gabe?

203
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:01,053
Look, Morticia, I'm not interfering.
It's too much to get into, you know?

204
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:05,180
- I thought you were his friend.
- Why don't you fuck off, bitch?

205
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:10,222
If you're so worried, why don't you go
fuck him again? That'll cheer him up.

206
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:13,415
Nice, that's nice.

207
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:15,576
Yeah.

208
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:19,220
By the way, Parker told me
how one of your testicles is, like...

209
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,938
...freakishly small, like a peanut.

210
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:29,537
- Is that true?
- That's not true.

211
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,137
For later.

212
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:07,496
- You have a headache, dear?
- Yeah, I thought I did.

213
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:11,538
I'm throwing in a load of laundry
if you need some done.

214
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,743
By the way, I'm going camping
with Hiram this weekend.

215
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,664
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Great.

216
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,497
I'm doing whites first.

217
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:30,615
- Fuck. David, David.
- David. David?

218
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:34,534
David! David?

219
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,213
Are you all right? You look pale.

220
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:41,703
No, I'm fine.
It's just a headache, that's all.

221
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:52,144
Okay, you're in this, like, total
danger zone. Gabe Dimas is a dick.

222
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:56,225
I'm sorry his brother's dead, but
don't think that means he's not a dick.

223
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:59,458
I just haven't seen him around,
so I was worried.

224
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,818
If you hook up with him now,
it's gonna be like total emotional rape.

225
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:08,537
Whatever he feels for you is gonna be
wrapped up in some guilt-grief fuckfest.

226
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:13,183
You better stay away from that shit.
I'm not kidding.

227
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:23,820
So you failed a test.
Big whoop.

228
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,337
You want to be helpful to the people
that walk in through your door...

229
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:30,697
...so you have to be
one of those people.

230
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,100
Okay.

231
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:37,221
I chose three funeral homes
from the yellow pages at random.

232
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:41,386
I've always felt an uncontrolled sample
group provides more reliable data.

233
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:45,057
What, you want us to pretend
to be purchasing a funeral?

234
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:48,418
Look up the first address.
I think it's in Sherman Oaks.

235
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:51,778
Come on, it'll be fun.

236
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:05,222
Hello? Gabe?

237
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,138
Is anybody home?

238
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:17,465
Oh, Mrs. Dimas, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

239
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,143
Is Gabe around?

240
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,905
- We can still leave.
- Why? What are you afraid of?

241
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,542
Humiliating myself,
wasting someone's valuable time.

242
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:08,262
Don't be so left-brained.

243
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:20,661
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

244
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:24,339
Now, how can I help?

245
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,698
It's my parents.

246
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:34,747
They were killed this morning
in an accident.

247
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:38,028
I'm terribly sorry.

248
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:42,620
It was a...
A helicopter...

249
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,299
...went down
and there was an explosion.

250
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,546
Oh, God.
I can't do this.

251
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:55,429
It's not right.
They were in the prime of their lives.

252
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,548
Everybody dies.
We all die.

253
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,820
Everything we ever care
about will disappear.

254
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,181
So, what's the fucking
point of living?

255
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,188
Can I suggest matching caskets?

256
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,459
That's it?

257
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,662
That's what you have to offer me
in my time of grief? Merchandise?

258
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,906
We have nothing
to learn here.

259
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,668
Water purifier.
Rope.

260
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,665
Bear bell.
Flashlight.

261
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,339
Toilet paper.
And, yes, it's biodegradable.

262
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,303
Bird caller.
Binoculars.

263
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:46,823
I'm sure you have everything. I know
you have everything. You always do.

264
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:51,582
It wouldn't be fun to get up there and
realize we forgot the matches, would it?

265
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:55,340
Or the champagne.

266
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:58,019
Hiram, that's just decadent.

267
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,870
Was it expensive?
We shouldn't waste it.

268
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,504
Waste it?
It's our anniversary.

269
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:10,789
Claire, you're home early.
You remember Hiram.

270
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:12,984
Hi.

271
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,788
- How was school?
- I have a headache.

272
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:30,866
Hiram and I are going camping.

273
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,548
Your dinner's in the refrigerator
and I'll be back tomorrow.

274
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:40,630
It's a very beautiful
time of the year.

275
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,583
Okay.
Well, you two have fun.

276
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:56,101
We should probably leave
if we want to beat the rush-hour traffic.

277
00:25:57,152 --> 00:26:00,701
Ruth?
Honey, what's wrong?

278
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:03,710
My children don't
need me anymore.

279
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:12,424
Let's think of this as a celebration...

280
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,385
...of your uncle's life.

281
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:18,743
Now, the Titan is an excellent choice
for a distinguished gentleman.

282
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:24,471
It's solid mahogany. It's hand-finished.
Burlwood and nickel accents.

283
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:26,868
And Grace Field...

284
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:30,145
Grace Field
is a lovely place for interment.

285
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,742
It's serene.
It's pastoral.

286
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:34,862
How much?

287
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:38,145
Well, after you sign the contract,
we take care of everything.

288
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:41,143
There's no worry.
There's no pain.

289
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:45,024
How much?

290
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,747
It comes to just
under $20,000.

291
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,473
You're charging $ 12,000
for the Titan?

292
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:01,949
What is that,
like a 300 percent markup?

293
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,428
I could come down to 10.

294
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:09,586
And Grace Field is in between
a power station and a freeway.

295
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,866
There are nicer cemeteries.

296
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,668
But they're just a little
bit more expensive.

297
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,102
No, thanks.

298
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,464
We'll try and find somewhere that
doesn't just want to swindle us.

299
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:29,431
Nice tie.

300
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,703
- This business is a total racket.
- What business isn't?

301
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:42,225
You know, sometimes
I wish I could be this...

302
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:45,626
...completely selfish asshole
that didn't give a shit about anything...

303
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:49,510
...and I could just work at some mindless
job that paid me a fuckload of money.

304
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,872
- No, you don't.
- It would make my life a lot easier.

305
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:55,748
You don't want
your life to be easy.

306
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,514
Gabe?

307
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:11,114
Hi.

308
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:15,346
I didn't know if
anybody was home.

309
00:28:16,715 --> 00:28:19,024
Did you ring the bell?

310
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:24,431
I just... I came by
to drop off this stuff.

311
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,673
Okay.

312
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:31,393
It's my brother's soccer clothes.

313
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:34,110
I thought that he might
like to get buried in them.

314
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,593
You think that's okay?

315
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,954
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's really nice.

316
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:47,033
I went to your house.

317
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:50,512
You see my mom?

318
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,393
Yeah.

319
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:59,708
Just like a zombie.
Just sits there.

320
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:05,148
I don't know why she blames herself.
It's my fault. I killed him.

321
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:07,955
Gabe, no.
It was an accident.

322
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:12,032
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been watching him.

323
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:17,906
My mom can't even find Anthony's dad
to tell him what happened.

324
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:21,029
Probably moved.
We haven't seen him in, like, two years.

325
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,512
Oh, that sucks.

326
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:28,666
He's a fucking drunken dipshit. He used
to kick my ass just to prove he could.

327
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:35,797
You know when people would call you
those things like...

328
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:37,993
..."cemetery girl" and "Vampira"?

329
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:40,035
Yeah.

330
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:42,587
I never thought that was funny.

331
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:52,757
I should go. Would you just
make sure your brother gets these?

332
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:54,555
Of course.

333
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:59,673
Hey, look. If you need
anything, like to talk...

334
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:03,831
...or something,
you can call me.

335
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,471
All right.

336
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:20,115
- Where do you want to hang the food?
- Can't it wait till after dinner?

337
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,867
I've already taken out what we're
going to eat. I'd rather not risk it.

338
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,677
I'm sorry it's inconvenient...

339
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:29,756
...but would you prefer we were mauled
in our sleep by bears?

340
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:33,109
Ruth?
You need to relax.

341
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,390
Hello, I'm Rosemary.
How can I help you?

342
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,796
Hi. I need to make
arrangements for a funeral.

343
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,432
All right.

344
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,549
My wife's in the restroom.
She'll be out in a minute.

345
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,157
- Can I ask who the funeral is for?
- It's for me.

346
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,590
Bet you don't get too many people
shopping for their own funeral.

347
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,111
It happens. Most people who know
they're going to die want to have a say.

348
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,199
Planning it with your husband could be
a meaningful process for you both.

349
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:26,588
- Is it cancer?
- Yeah.

350
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,031
It's everywhere.
Liver now.

351
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,070
- Brenda.
- My husband hates me doing this.

352
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,829
He wants me to spend this time
doing things I always dreamed of...

353
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,396
...but never gave
myself permission to...

354
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,511
Pardon me.

355
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,713
The coughing blood and pissing needles
thing kind of gets in the way.

356
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,957
- He just wants you to be happy.
- He just doesn't want me to die.

357
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,276
Okay, it's just too fucked up, Brenda.
I can't do it. I can't.

358
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,510
- He's not ready.
- It's hard for him.

359
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,639
Probably harder
than it is for you.

360
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,560
That was the most fucked up
thing you've ever done to me.

361
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,240
- Sorry.
- That was like the shit...

362
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:21,074
...you pulled on those doctors
to get a rise out of them.

363
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,357
- Are you gonna start barking at me?
- I might.

364
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:28,271
- What you did just now was not funny!
- Well, it wasn't meant to be.

365
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:32,993
You counsel people about
death every day, Nate...

366
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,197
...when death is what
you're most afraid of.

367
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,393
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Of course I'm afraid of it.

368
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,950
- What sane person isn't?
- I'm not.

369
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,994
Yeah, well, I said, what sane person.

370
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,198
- Hello.
- Hey.

371
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:20,838
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing, I just...

372
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:24,200
I just wanted to
talk to somebody.

373
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:30,037
- What are you doing tonight?
- I don't know. What are you doing?

374
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:31,681
You.

375
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:48,559
Shit. Fuck! Shit.

376
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:55,596
- What are you looking for?
- Aspirin.

377
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:58,476
I know there was a bottle
of aspirin in here.

378
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,395
Yeah, I took some earlier.

379
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:02,599
You did? Are you okay?

380
00:34:02,763 --> 00:34:05,402
Yeah, why?

381
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,352
You found it, didn't you?
You found it and kept it for yourself.

382
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:13,115
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

383
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,361
You're wearing my shirt.

384
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:18,961
- Fuck!
- What is this, like a date?

385
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:21,194
Sort of.

386
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:24,759
No way, you're dating
the square-dancing guy?

387
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,599
- Weird.
- Weird why?

388
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:34,001
No, I get it. He's hot in a kind of
generic, Banana Republic kind of way.

389
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:38,880
- Claire, I really need that aspirin bottle.
- David, I really don't have it.

390
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:43,953
- What was in there?
- He gave me some pills.

391
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:47,520
Now I'll have to say, "Sorry, I lost
them because I'm this old-guy geek...

392
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:51,120
...and I'm completely uncool in this world
in which you seem to thrive...

393
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:54,361
...you perfect distillation
of human evolution. "

394
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:58,275
Okay, is this split
personality thing...

395
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:01,874
...like, something that happens
when Mom goes out of town?

396
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:04,803
Because I like you
like this way better.

397
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:13,878
- Dinner was delicious.
- Food just tastes better outdoors.

398
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,394
Remember what we ate
the first time we went camping?

399
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,163
No.

400
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:22,199
- Pork chops with fire-roasted vegetables.
- Oh, yes.

401
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:26,921
The sky was so clear that night.
Just like tonight.

402
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,401
Did you know you're not supposed
to go camping if you're menstruating?

403
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,960
- What?
- It's true.

404
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:35,475
My husband buried
a young woman once.

405
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,399
She went on a camping trip.
She was menstruating.

406
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:41,278
A bear smelled the blood and
killed her in her sleeping bag.

407
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:43,880
Killed one of her friends too.

408
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:48,397
But we only buried her.
Not the friend.

409
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,764
I'm glad we're seeing
each other again.

410
00:35:57,845 --> 00:36:00,075
Me too. It's nice.

411
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:06,006
- What's wrong?
- I've got a little bit of a headache.

412
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:20,915
I'm sorry I forgot those pills.

413
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:24,482
That's no big deal.
You can be my drug tonight.

414
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:31,481
So, what's with the guy who's been
staring at you since we got here?

415
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:40,839
Shit! That's Keith.
We dated.

416
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:44,522
- He's pretty hot. You guys still friends?
- Not really.

417
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:48,561
- Why not? I'm friends with my exes.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

418
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:52,325
He's coming over.
Is he into three-ways?

419
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,035
He's a cop, so don't mention
the drugs or anything.

420
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:58,361
- Sure, Dad.
- David.

421
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,837
- Keith, hi. How's it going?
- Good. It's going good.

422
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,441
This is the last place
I'd ever expect to see you.

423
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,002
Yeah. Well, it was Kurt's idea.
Kurt, this is Keith.

424
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,357
- Hey.
- Hi.

425
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:15,206
Kurt teaches square dancing.

426
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,205
Tried to get David to go dancing
when we were together.

427
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,603
Told me he didn't
even like to dance.

428
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,076
Thanks.

429
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:28,516
- Eddie, this is David and...
- Kurt. Hi.

430
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:30,126
Hi.

431
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,240
Hi.

432
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,805
- So how'd you guys meet?
- Eddie's an EMT.

433
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:42,003
Met on the job.
Newlyweds in a car crash.

434
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:44,478
He saved the bride
right in front of me.

435
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:49,927
- What about the groom?
- Didn't make it.

436
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,683
The bride had eternity with the man
she loved right in front of her...

437
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:57,602
...then you go save her and
she ends up left behind, alone.

438
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:01,486
That's one way
of looking at it.

439
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:07,476
Well, it's good to see you.

440
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:11,767
- Yeah, nice meeting you.
- You too.

441
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,728
Well, of course he's dating
Mr. Fucking Super Guy ER.

442
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:25,002
I bet they have great sex,
I mean, with the uniforms and all.

443
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,759
I dated a cop once. Total control freak.
Now, firemen on the other hand...

444
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:32,803
Is dating an excuse for you to figure out
who you wanna be when you grow up?

445
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,761
I don't know.
Is dating like an excuse...

446
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:38,279
...for you to see who you wished
you'd been when you were my age?

447
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,482
- Let's get out of here.
- Why?

448
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,924
Come on.

449
00:41:12,412 --> 00:41:16,121
David. Wait, David.
Look...

450
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,849
- Who was that?
- Just a guy I know.

451
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:21,327
He wants to go home with us.

452
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,283
- I don't think so.
- Come on, you'll love him.

453
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:27,167
- I promise, he's a total fuck machine.
- I said, no.

454
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:31,007
Why not? Why are you
taking this so seriously?

455
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:34,404
Because I'm a serious guy.
I bury people for a living.

456
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,764
Well, that shit's in your head.

457
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:39,846
Yeah, you're right.
That shit is in my head.

458
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:47,891
Look, go. Have fun. I'm just too...

459
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:50,130
I'm sorry that I can't...

460
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,522
I'm sorry. Bye.

461
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:09,564
You really spooked me, Bren.

462
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:16,253
What?
The idea of me dying?

463
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:18,892
Well, yeah.

464
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:22,163
I will die someday.

465
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:31,204
We die, Nate.

466
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,365
We all die.

467
00:43:06,935 --> 00:43:08,527
Hello?

468
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,445
You certainly took
your sweet time getting here.

469
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:03,730
- You'll ruin that shirt.
- Who cares?

470
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:15,655
What, you're hitting on me now?
Two guys aren't enough, you slut?

471
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:19,485
Oh, dear.
I suppose I owe you an apology.

472
00:44:19,696 --> 00:44:22,848
- Why? I'm dead.
- Yes, but I was seeing Hiram before you...

473
00:44:23,057 --> 00:44:26,686
I was gone long before I died.

474
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,331
You'd like Hiram. He's kind.
He makes me laugh.

475
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:34,208
- I got my money on the florist.
- Oh, heavens no, Nathaniel.

476
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,215
The man is a complete savage.

477
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:45,175
Oh, God. This is the hearse
that was always stalling, isn't it?

478
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:48,574
Remember after that funeral in Malibu
for that jazz musician?

479
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:52,850
We broke down on the side of the PCH
and we made love in the back.

480
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:55,406
If this baby could talk.

481
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:02,010
Nathaniel, what happened to us?
We were so in love once.

482
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:04,367
Life happened to us.

483
00:45:05,177 --> 00:45:09,535
I buried hundreds of people
and we watched each other grow old.

484
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:12,687
- But we're not old.
- Well, technically speaking...

485
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:15,287
...I'm as old as
I'm ever gonna get.

486
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:18,930
We were such children
when we met.

487
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:22,050
Then we watched
those children disappear.

488
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:33,098
Damn it! Stalled again.
Won't go forward. Won't go back.

489
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,971
Well, these can't be helping.

490
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:58,658
No tears.

491
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:04,816
- I miss what we had.
- So find it again.

492
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,933
What a beautiful day.
You should have woken me up.

493
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,813
I thought you could use the sleep
after the night we had.

494
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,296
You've never been that
passionate with me before.

495
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,412
Thank you for a wonderful night.

496
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,898
- Last night?
- You were spectacular.

497
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,973
What?

498
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:36,453
- Do I just sit anywhere?
- Wherever you'd like.

499
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:49,695
- Nice suit.
- Thank you. Bought it last week.

500
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,335
You need more than one suit
to be a funeral director.

501
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,771
No, you need
to pass a test first.

502
00:47:54,981 --> 00:47:57,575
You just can't let
go of that, can you?

503
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:01,779
- I failed the first time I took it.
- You did not.

504
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:07,978
Yes, I did. I fuck up a lot more
than you might think. I fuck up a lot.

505
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:30,461
- Hey.
- Hi.

506
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:36,852
- How are you holding up?
- Okay, I guess.

507
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:39,417
It's just weird.

508
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:45,535
Why are you being
so nice to me?

509
00:48:46,902 --> 00:48:50,451
- You little bastard!
- Sam, we didn't think you'd show.

510
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:56,693
- Stop it!
- Stop! Leave him alone!

511
00:48:56,903 --> 00:48:59,576
I'm gonna kill you,
you useless fuck!

512
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,341
Okay, everybody calm down.

513
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:03,853
Probably wasted out of your mind,
whacking off!

514
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:06,174
Let my kid shoot himself!

515
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:07,372
You're gonna blame him?

516
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:09,693
Where the fuck were you
for the past two years?

517
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,298
All right, just take it easy.

518
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:24,896
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

519
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:28,334
- Don't worry about it, I'll deal with it.
- Thank you.

520
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:38,020
Who the fuck
was that little bitch out there?

521
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,220
That's my sister.

522
00:49:40,384 --> 00:49:44,696
You should warn her. Gabriel has
been a fuckup his whole life.

523
00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:47,782
When I lived there, he used
to drive his mother nuts...

524
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:50,742
...with all the shit that he'd do.
Staying out all night.

525
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:53,653
No fucking responsibility.

526
00:49:54,504 --> 00:49:58,099
- That's my kid who's dead.
- I know.

527
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:07,703
It was my gun.
I bought it for Vickie.

528
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:12,935
Because I was gonna leave for a while,
you know? Go up north for a job.

529
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,214
Make some extra money.

530
00:50:16,904 --> 00:50:19,372
How could he let
something like this happen?

531
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,382
It's not right.
It's just not fucking right!

532
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:25,219
Jesus, he was 6!

533
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:28,776
Everybody dies.

534
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:33,376
Some of us live to be 100, some never
make it through the first day.

535
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:35,422
That's just a fucking
fact of nature, pal.

536
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,257
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

537
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,256
You can punch as many
people as you want.

538
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:41,979
It's not gonna change
the fact that boy is dead.

539
00:50:42,185 --> 00:50:45,302
And your chance to be
in his life is over.

540
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:50,462
Did you use that time well
or did you just piss it away?

541
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:55,022
And your own fucking life
is a ticking clock too.

542
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,735
Everybody's is.

543
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:33,661
- Mom, you're home. I was worried.
- Worried, why?

544
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,821
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, David, you must go camping.

545
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:41,586
It's so spectacular
up there right now.

546
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:46,621
Spring is such a full time.
So much color, so much detail.

547
00:51:46,826 --> 00:51:49,943
And the smells.
It's like nothing else.

548
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:53,218
And you're okay?
No sickness, no headaches?

549
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:56,180
Oh, no.
I had one on the trip...

550
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:59,663
...but I took some aspirin
and it just disappeared.

551
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:03,583
Yes, well, aspirin is
damn good stuff.

552
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,698
How was the service?

553
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:09,183
There was a fight that broke out,
but I let Nate take care of it.

554
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:12,823
I'm glad you boys are working
so well together now.

555
00:52:14,147 --> 00:52:18,345
Claire, you look terrible.
Are you not feeling well?

556
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:23,698
I'm just a little wrecked.
We buried my friend's brother today.

557
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,700
He's your friend?
I had no idea.

558
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:29,740
Yeah.

559
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,858
He's the foot guy.

560
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,097
Oh, my God.

561
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,261
Good night.

562
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:52,622
There's so much you wish you could
protect your children from.

563
00:53:00,068 --> 00:53:01,660
Night, Mom.

564
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,340
Night, dear.

565
00:53:56,791 --> 00:54:47,946
