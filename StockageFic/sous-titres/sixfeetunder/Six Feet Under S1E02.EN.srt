1
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:52,028
You can have anything you want.

2
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,432
It's yours for the taking.

3
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:59,029
But we've been conditioned to think
that this isn't fair somehow.

4
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:02,230
That that's taking something away
from someone else, right?

5
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:03,393
- Right.
- Right.

6
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,317
Wrong.

7
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,235
The bounty of the universe
is without limits.

8
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,159
What exactly is Beauty Vision anyway?

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,751
Oh, it's a personalized
life-management system.

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,076
It sounds kind of culty.

11
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:21,199
Everybody wants a better life.

12
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,916
Shit, two years ago,
I was living out of my fucking car.

13
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:27,837
He told me the first time we went out
he was going to marry me.

14
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:33,242
It was unbelievably romantic,
and now I have this beautiful baby.

15
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,035
And that's what Beauty Vision is.

16
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:40,319
It's a way of seeing the world
without fear.

17
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:46,282
Now, these new territories are gonna
go so fast. The franchise fee is $45,000.

18
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,954
Sign me up.

19
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,800
Are you really ready for this?

20
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,600
Fuck, yeah.

21
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,963
Well, welcome to Beauty Vision.

22
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,440
- Your husband is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,521
He spends an hour on
the StairMaster every day.

24
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,008
Jesus.

25
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,724
Is that blood? Shit!

26
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:28,163
He must've hit his head
on the bottom of the pool.

27
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:30,368
Chandler!

28
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:33,087
Oh, my God.

29
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,448
Wake your tired ass up, sleepyhead.

30
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:46,614
- What's for breakfast?
- Me, stupid.

31
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:02,332
Now, which one of you is the wife?

32
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:07,737
No, no, keep going. Keep going.
I'm kind of curious as to how this works.

33
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,419
No breakfast?

34
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,659
- Why'd you let me sleep late?
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.

35
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,695
You looked so relaxed,
which I don't see that often.

36
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:36,379
Today's the reading of Dad's will.
You know about that.

37
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,620
It'll all be over real soon.

38
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:44,421
- Thank you for sleeping over.
- You snore.

39
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:47,180
Don't forget about the meeting
tomorrow night.

40
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:50,821
You think I'd miss a meeting
of gay police and firemen?

41
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,175
You'll like these guys. They're cool.

42
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,946
I'll pick you up around 7.
We'll grab a bite to eat.

43
00:04:56,146 --> 00:05:00,345
- Call me before you head over.
- So you can weasel your way out of it?

44
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,506
I never know when I'm gonna have to
work, Keith. This is a busy time for us.

45
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:09,782
A lot of people hold on
for one last Christmas, and then bye-bye.

46
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,098
I always thought shiatsu
was more intense than this.

47
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:17,107
Oh, it'll get there.

48
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:20,188
I'm just trying to find out
where you're wounded.

49
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,108
Wounded?

50
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,219
I got stabbed in the thigh
with a BIC pen once.

51
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:29,504
I wasn't speaking literally.

52
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:35,142
Oh, here's a good one.

53
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:40,063
Old, but recently reopened.

54
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,788
- You're so full of shit.
- Well, we're all wounded.

55
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,062
We carry our wounds
around with us throughout life...

56
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:50,072
...and eventually, they kill us.

57
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:55,713
Things happen that leave
a mark in space, in time, in us.

58
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,706
I'm sure this is all
very deep and profound...

59
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:06,193
...but you know,
I get enough depth at home.

60
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:11,068
You're supposed to be
my haven away from all that.

61
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,628
I'm not supposed to be anything.

62
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,956
Morning, Dave.

63
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:43,153
Aren't those the same clothes
you had on yesterday?

64
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:44,637
Everything I own looks alike.

65
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:47,557
I sense you're not being completely
honest with me, Dave.

66
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:51,080
Have you changed any
since you were 14?

67
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,834
Hey, I'm all for you
getting laid, believe me.

68
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,359
Morning.

69
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:12,239
You gotta try these. They're hydroponic.
Grown in water.

70
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:15,360
I know the guy who grows them.
He's a big supplier to the co-op.

71
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,720
- So my peaches are no good?
- What?

72
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,363
No, they're fine.

73
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,368
Mr. Hickey wants us there on time
for the reading of the will.

74
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,368
We should all go in the same car.

75
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,451
Great, I have to miss
another day of school?

76
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,042
What am I, some poor Victorian waif,
who has to stay hidden from view?

77
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,368
Fine, go to school...

78
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:47,243
...stay out all night,
live in the streets. See if I care.

79
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,208
Was she like this growing up?

80
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:58,654
No, not really,
but she was well on her way.

81
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,166
Morning.

82
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,687
You're looking spiffy
in that suit, Dave.

83
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,814
That's so clever. You're talking
like the computer in the movie.

84
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,689
Wow, you're funny.

85
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,730
Have a hydroponic raspberry
grown by a guy named Gunther...

86
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,896
...who once slept with Stevie Nicks.

87
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:19,373
So, Dave, are you gonna
tell us about her?

88
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,376
- Who?
- Oh, he's got a friend.

89
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,412
- Are you and Jennifer back together?
- No.

90
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,408
- Have you met someone else, Dave?
- Leave him alone.

91
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,969
- Someone from outside your pod?
- Shut up, asshole.

92
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,935
Thank you, Claire.

93
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,179
Why are you still here anyway?
Why don't you go back to Seattle?

94
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:46,171
Because I would miss
the joyful sense of belonging I get here.

95
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:01,256
I have no idea what kind
of service he'd want.

96
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:05,300
Well, at this scale,
it depends on who he was...

97
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:11,139
...and how he saw himself.
The statement that he made with his life.

98
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,665
He was, like, so dynamic.

99
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,697
He had his own business. Beauty Vision?

100
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:24,379
- From the infomercial?
- Chandler invented it.

101
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,545
Large scale.

102
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,138
I'll arrange viewings
for tomorrow and the next day...

103
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,706
...interment at Cedar Hill,
service for 200.

104
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,586
Now, we should choose
an appropriate resting vessel...

105
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:41,224
...one that befits a man of his stature.

106
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:56,946
May I ask what kind of car
your husband preferred?

107
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:59,390
He drives a BMW.

108
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,870
Do you know which model?

109
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,464
The biggest, fastest one.

110
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:07,907
I recommend the Titan Series.

111
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,949
Solid mahogany, pan-finished
with burwood accents...

112
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:13,916
...the same wood used in luxury
automobile interiors.

113
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:17,905
- It looks expensive.
- Nine thousand.

114
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:22,351
It's more than just a casket. It's a...

115
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:25,197
...tribute, really.

116
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,435
Okay.

117
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,516
- Are we finished?
- A major credit card to get us started.

118
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,075
Hi.

119
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:42,554
"I, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, a resident
of Los Angeles County, California...

120
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:46,550
...declare this to be my last will
and revoke all former wills and codicils.

121
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,601
First, to my wife, Ruth...

122
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,840
...I leave all bank accounts,
stocks and bonds that are in my name.

123
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,120
That's in addition to the life insurance.

124
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,077
Second, I bequeath the company,
Fisher & Sons Funeral Home...

125
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,799
...and all real property and business
interest attached as follows:

126
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,959
Fifty percent to my son
David James Fisher...

127
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,124
...and fifty percent to my son
Nathaniel Samuel Fisher Jr. "

128
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,123
What?

129
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:15,156
What, was he high?
Why would he do that?

130
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,241
David.

131
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:27,046
- Wow, I guess I don't even rate.
- No, he set up a trust for you.

132
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:28,847
David.

133
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,528
Hey, wait, David.

134
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:33,163
David, David, David, I don't want it.

135
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,727
Well, excuse me while I go contemplate
the irony of that.

136
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,083
- What's my recourse here?
- Recourse?

137
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,441
Your entire college education
is provided for.

138
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:48,207
- So I don't get anything.
- You get education, Claire.

139
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,801
A privilege that not everyone gets.

140
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,480
- What if I don't wanna go?
- You need it these days...

141
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,645
...not just to succeed,
but to survive.

142
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:02,247
Okay, spare me the tough-love
rationalization, just bottom-line it, please.

143
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,605
Should you decide not to go, the money
will become available to you...

144
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,851
...when you're 25.

145
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:12,003
So this is like blackmail
from beyond the grave.

146
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,570
What in the hell was Dad thinking?
Is this some sick joke?

147
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,251
It's Fisher and Sons.
You're the sons.

148
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,448
Mom gets half a million
in life insurance...

149
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,693
...which is fair, but I
have strings attached?

150
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,253
- Let's not talk about what's fair.
- Have my half.

151
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:28,568
No, your father knew exactly
what he was doing.

152
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,087
He wanted everybody happy,
and we will be happy.

153
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,608
I guess what I want is totally irrelevant.

154
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,449
Dave, listen, this is all wrong.
It should be yours, or yours and Mom's.

155
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,299
I really don't wanna discuss it now.

156
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,694
Maybe I'll move to Florida.

157
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,296
That's ridiculous, Mom,
and it's not helping.

158
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,856
You're adults, and Claire
will be leaving next year.

159
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,814
Yeah, to join the Marines.
I wanna learn to kill, kill, kill.

160
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:01,694
- Is that Mr. Swanson? How does he look?
- Easy.

161
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,372
Head split open, some scalp work.

162
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,337
Hair extensions to cover
the stitches, maybe.

163
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,823
You guys are in my way.

164
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,780
Mrs. F.

165
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,181
Vanessa called.
We got a fresh one at Bay Breeze.

166
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:20,935
- Pick it up. I'll get Swanson.
- No, I still gotta finish Mrs. Huffington.

167
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:24,463
- Federico, her viewing is at 3:00.
- Yeah, well, she's majorly jaundiced.

168
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:28,786
- Crank up the pink spots over her casket.
- David, the woman looks like a banana.

169
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,024
I don't airbrush her,
the family will freak.

170
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:35,586
You wanna put her out like that,
then take my name off the certificate.

171
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:43,018
Nate, I need you to pick up a body
at Bay Breeze Nursing Home.

172
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,826
- I don't know how.
- Put him on a gurney...

173
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,464
...put the gurney in the car...

174
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:49,707
...take the elevator,
put him in the freezer.

175
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,867
You think you can handle that?

176
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,741
You own half the business now.
Start pulling your weight.

177
00:13:56,272 --> 00:14:00,391
News flash, other people exist!

178
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,708
Hey, give me 20 minutes.
I'll go with you.

179
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,993
Thanks.

180
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,555
So did Dad ever say anything to you
that might explain why he would do this?

181
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:25,831
Like, "By the way, Federico,
I've lost my fucking mind. "

182
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:30,316
It's a good business. Steady.

183
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,233
He was still pissed at me
for not going into it...

184
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,192
...but what does he think,
he can force me?

185
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,156
Maybe he was pissed at Dave.

186
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:06,721
Hey.

187
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:13,917
You wanna go to a thing tonight?

188
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,236
I'm not in the mood
for a thing, Gabriel.

189
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,077
Come on,
don't go through this alone.

190
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,436
Fat chance, it's like I got
a sign on my head...

191
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,319
...that says, "Freak with the dead dad. "

192
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:26,280
And like all these people,
who are so tragic, even knew him.

193
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:27,966
I met your dad once.

194
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,040
Remember, he buried
my grandmother Alice.

195
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,808
Why are you talking to me?

196
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,727
- What, you think I'm a jerk?
- Yes.

197
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,758
You know you're different now.

198
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,288
I can see through walls.

199
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,606
Don't your skanks need to be walked?

200
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,165
I wanna see you.

201
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,809
Mrs. Fisher?

202
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm Matthew Gilardi.
Do you have a moment?

203
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:23,530
- Did David mention me, by any chance?
- I don't think he did.

204
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,806
Well, I thought I'd drop off the details...

205
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,610
...of our buyout offer
so you could look it over.

206
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,967
The terms are quite generous.

207
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,371
Especially the stock options.

208
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:39,334
Who are you to buy us out?

209
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:41,814
I never saw you before in my life.

210
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,975
I represent Kroehner
Service International.

211
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,055
A chain?

212
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,935
Kroehner is a family of quality
death-care facilities, Mrs. Fisher.

213
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,131
We have a 157 units
in Southern California...

214
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,895
...and we're inviting you to be 158.

215
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,661
You should discuss
the situation with your son David.

216
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:03,540
- I have two sons.
- Really? I was only aware of one.

217
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:06,741
I know how many sons
I have, Mr. Gilardi.

218
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,893
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:15,262
Just look at the numbers.
I'll let myself out.

220
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,137
Morning.

221
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,420
How are you folks today?

222
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,022
Don't expect to be popular.

223
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:34,220
- Hey, baby. Nate, look at you.
- Look at you.

224
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,702
Four-and-a-half months,
this one wants out already.

225
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:40,105
- Mr. Suarez all ready to go?
- Yeah, but, honey, we got a problem.

226
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,185
My sister can't pick up
Julio from school.

227
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,903
She got another callback
from that cat-food commercial.

228
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,543
- What about my career, huh?
- Come on.

229
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:50,217
I can't do it, not today.
David's head would explode.

230
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,945
Nate, you ought to remind your brother
how many clients I have referred...

231
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,342
...to you guys from here
and tell him to cut Rico some slack.

232
00:17:57,551 --> 00:18:00,111
No, no, no.

233
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,267
You won't.

234
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,142
Rico, go.

235
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,628
I'm the new boss, right?

236
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,950
Okay, but I'm telling Dave
you said I could.

237
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,903
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:22,673
I can do this. I just need some help
getting him onto the gurney.

239
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:36,146
You can touch him if you wear
one of these. Believe me, he won't mind.

240
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:42,033
All right, pull the bed back.
Line it up with the gurney.

241
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,149
All right.

242
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,318
- Okay.
- That good?

243
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,558
Yeah, take this off for a second. Okay.

244
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:58,232
All right, grab his shoulders.
On three. Ready?

245
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,320
One, two, three.

246
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,476
Angel lust.

247
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,436
- Does that happen a lot?
- A fair amount.

248
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:16,602
You can be dead,
but you're never really dead.

249
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,637
- Hello.
- So I've been thinking.

250
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:34,599
We skipped way too many steps.
We need to have a first date.

251
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:35,881
Okay.

252
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:38,396
I'm at Pinot Hollywood,
Know where that is?

253
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:41,326
- You mean right now?
- Yeah,

254
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,167
I'd love to, but I've got
a dead body in the car with me.

255
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:47,758
I can certainly understand why you
wouldn't want to get away from that.

256
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:52,847
Come on, just a glass of wine,
15 minutes. The dead guy won't mind.

257
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,321
- Do me a favor, keep it out of the sun.
- Yeah, sure.

258
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,885
I had forgotten. They make these noises.

259
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,089
The air comes out. It's like:

260
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,409
No.

261
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:11,241
Dad knew that I hated
this whole fucked-up business.

262
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,726
He should respect that.

263
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:15,125
Well, poor Dave, I'd be pissed too.

264
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:19,412
Although, he does seem to take it
to this extra, Old Testament level.

265
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,686
So does this mean you're not
going back to Seattle on Sunday?

266
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,293
Fuck.

267
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:28,613
Okay, don't think about it.
Tell me about yourself.

268
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,684
Like this is our first date and we never
had sex before you knew my name.

269
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,690
You mean the recap
of major life events...

270
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,091
...told in a humorous
and self-deprecating way...

271
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,731
...which almost always
gets me laid?

272
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:44,407
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,816
- I'm not that guy with you.
- Who are you?

274
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,615
I don't know, somebody new.

275
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,818
It's because of your father.

276
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,215
You're with me
at your most vulnerable.

277
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,459
You felt comfortable.
You felt really accepted.

278
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,338
You always analyze guys
on the first date?

279
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:11,460
- Only if they're interesting.
- Oh, so you think I'm interesting.

280
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:14,415
Yeah. I don't meet that many
men with dead guys...

281
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:17,615
...with hard-ons in their car.

282
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:33,097
When Mrs. Swanson's credit card
didn't go through, I ran a check...

283
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,341
...and they were in debt
up to their ears.

284
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,618
We have a $3200 Titan casket
being delivered tomorrow.

285
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:42,182
Why didn't you tell me
there's an offer to buy us out?

286
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:45,379
I knew what you and Dad thought
of Kroehner Service International.

287
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,306
You don't know what I think.

288
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:51,421
Not that it matters to you.

289
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,857
And Nate is not your enemy.
He'll do whatever you want.

290
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:59,819
Why do you say that? He spent
his entire life doing what he wants.

291
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,269
- Dad must've really hated me.
- Hush.

292
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:14,545
It's Fisher & Sons. That's gotta continue,
and you're never gonna have kids.

293
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,262
Well, it's about time.
What took you so long?

294
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:26,989
- I stopped to eat.
- I wish you'd called.

295
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:30,584
I think Mr. Suarez kind of shit himself.
Is that normal?

296
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,429
Stopped to eat? Do you have
any respect for human life?

297
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,945
I have a huge respect for human life.
I didn't know they can take a dump!

298
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,829
- Well, they can. Make a note.
- I don't like this bickering.

299
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:43,512
Yeah, well, I don't like you
sleeping with hairdressers.

300
00:22:56,758 --> 00:23:01,275
Look, don't take this out on Mom.
What is it you wanna say to me?

301
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,633
Well, there's a body that spent
over two hours in a van...

302
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,719
...unrefridgerated, decomposing at a rate
much faster than you could ever imagine.

303
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,515
Thanks for making my life
just that much more difficult.

304
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,360
Thanks for undermining
my authority with our employees...

305
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:18,113
...and thanks for making it clear
that my choice to dedicate myself...

306
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:21,234
...to this business and to this family
was really stupid.

307
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,753
Apparently, I would have been rewarded
just the same for wasting my life.

308
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,917
Oh, my life is a waste? Fuck you!
At least I enjoy it.

309
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,443
Yeah, well, lucky you.

310
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:36,837
- Dave, at least let me help.
- You've helped enough!

311
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,325
It's just not fair that my life
is being decided by other people.

312
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,038
Hey, college is paid for.

313
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:59,682
They have great parties.
No student loans to pay off.

314
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm not exactly a party person.

315
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,807
By the way,
that shit you gave me...

316
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,365
...the night my dad died,
it really fucked me up.

317
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,925
I'm sorry about that.

318
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,246
You should be.

319
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:19,885
Just, why is college the only option?
I don't even know what I wanna do.

320
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:23,642
I just feel like there's
something inside me.

321
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:27,368
I'd just like to figure out what it is
before I get completely reprogrammed.

322
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:30,246
Hey, nobody could reprogram you.

323
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:33,327
You're the most original girl
in the school.

324
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:36,048
Come on, look at this car
that you drive.

325
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:40,173
This face that you drive.

326
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:44,771
- Thanks a lot. Liar.
- I'm serious.

327
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,565
You know how much guts it takes
to be somebody like you?

328
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:03,935
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

329
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:07,654
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

330
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,458
Who do you got there, David?

331
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:20,096
Who is that? It's him?
That's Mr. Bloomberg?

332
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,221
Put him right down next to him there.

333
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,935
Oh, my goodness.

334
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:28,694
Yeah, you're okay, David.

335
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:45,299
Mom wants to see us.

336
00:25:56,627 --> 00:25:59,301
I'm going on a hike with someone.

337
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,260
Okay.

338
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,221
- Okay?
- I am not asking your permission, David.

339
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:07,501
I am your mother, how dare you!

340
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:14,267
You both have private lives,
and I know it.

341
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,508
- Why shouldn't I?
- You should.

342
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:21,426
Go.

343
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:25,227
Excuse me, I need her to meet
with Mrs. Swanson.

344
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:28,544
It's Fisher & Sons.

345
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:31,872
Well, this sucks.

346
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:34,871
I have to fight for a hole in the ground
at Rosemont Cemetery...

347
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,905
...or the Suarezes
won't be buried together.

348
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:42,182
They'll be on opposite sides
of the goddamn freeway.

349
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:46,987
Dave...

350
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:49,114
...listen.

351
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:53,869
Can I do anything to help?

352
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,827
Can you tell Adele Swanson we know
she's broke and can't afford the funeral?

353
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:04,030
- Can you do that?
- I guess.

354
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,712
Yes.

355
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:11,195
The Swansons are con artists.
They ran a franchise pyramid scheme.

356
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,754
They have no money,
and they're not gonna con us too.

357
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:18,397
I made some notes, in case
you're not familiar with credit reports.

358
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,673
You know, I work with vendors,
big ones, national ones.

359
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,475
I'm not a idiot. I can do this.

360
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,913
Thank you.

361
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,554
Shit.

362
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,035
What?

363
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:55,397
Do you have to be anywhere tonight?

364
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:59,636
Not really.

365
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:12,641
The other Mr. Fisher recommended
the $9000 coffin. I didn't ask for it.

366
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,488
I think cremation is much more dignified.

367
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:18,887
And it's within range,
given the financial situation.

368
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,405
Chandler created Beauty Vision.

369
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,206
We have franchises in 13 states
and the nation of Uruguay.

370
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:27,568
How much did you know
about your husband?

371
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,720
Because he's been running up
bad debts for some time.

372
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:32,809
We were always moving.
I thought it was...

373
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,923
...because he was making
so much money.

374
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,921
Each place was nicer than the last.

375
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:43,128
Former partners are suing him.

376
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,973
He had several credit cards maxed out...

377
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:49,485
...run-ins with the IRS,
dating to 1996...

378
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:54,007
...and Yale University would like him
to quit telling people he went there.

379
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:56,935
This can't be happening.

380
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:01,335
I have a baby.
I can't go back to waitressing.

381
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,734
And now you're telling me
that we can't even afford a coffin?

382
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:08,010
What will people think?

383
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:12,897
Mrs. Swanson, I'm sitting here thinking,
"Why don't you rent it?"

384
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:15,897
- How much would that be?
- How much do you have?

385
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,290
I don't know. My ATM card's
not working.

386
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,058
We'll work something out.

387
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,609
And afterwards, we'll give you
his ashes in an urn.

388
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:47,263
- You really loved him, didn't you?
- Yes.

389
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,744
Okay, it's okay.

390
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,219
It's all right. Let it out.

391
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:06,985
I think it's good
you told your boys about me.

392
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:10,464
Are you kidding? It was insane.

393
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:13,705
I certainly didn't choose to do it.
It just happened.

394
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,466
It was brave.

395
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:18,263
It was guilt.

396
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:23,469
I loved my husband.

397
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,225
I know you did.

398
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:34,625
Hiram, when I think of us now...

399
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:40,589
...I feel like I'm watching the whole thing
on some sex channel on cable TV.

400
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:44,992
- Is that right?
- Yes.

401
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,668
And that my husband
might be watching it too.

402
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,068
I want some changes made,
I'll tell you that.

403
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:56,705
I'm not answering dead calls
all night long anymore.

404
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:59,634
Let them hire somebody...

405
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:02,396
...or sell the business or whatever.

406
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,391
I wanna take you somewhere,
away from all this.

407
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:09,508
- No.
- They're adults.

408
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:13,114
They can take care of themselves.

409
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:16,990
I have two plane tickets to Costa Rica
a week from Monday.

410
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,833
Separate rooms.

411
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,074
I was 19 when I got married.

412
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,315
I've never been on my own.

413
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,511
I wouldn't even know how.

414
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:36,794
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:42,999
You're a very kind person,
and you've been good to me.

416
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:47,717
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:53,393
Goodbye.

418
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,403
Good choice of music.

419
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:22,002
It's from his car.
It's the last CD he ever heard.

420
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:29,607
Adele Swanson, your husband
owes me $45,000.

421
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,163
He kept it all from her.

422
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,686
She's broke with a baby.
You'll leave her alone.

423
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:35,887
- Who the fuck are you?!
- I own this place.

424
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:40,085
- Get out before I call the cops.
- You people suck.

425
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,608
- What was that?
- Some freak Swanson owed money to.

426
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:53,969
Nate, I notice Mr. Swanson
is in the Titan casket.

427
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,972
Yeah, but she's giving it back.
I made the deal for cremation.

428
00:32:57,174 --> 00:33:00,008
They can't give it back.
By law, it has to be burned with him.

429
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:02,854
You just cost us $9000,
you fucking moron.

430
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,647
What?

431
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,528
How was I supposed to know that?

432
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:17,449
- I'm so sorry about your father.
- Jennifer.

433
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:24,569
I was in Boca Raton.
My mom had to have her hip replaced.

434
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,607
- Oh, dear, how is she?
- She's better, thanks.

435
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:32,574
So I didn't find out
about Mr. Fisher till yesterday.

436
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,852
I'm just heartbroken about it.
I'll miss him.

437
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,939
Well, he adored you.

438
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:47,376
Oh, David, I won't be answering
the phones anymore.

439
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,494
Okay.

440
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:05,944
Now every part of your body
has a new meaning to me.

441
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:11,055
- We should go.
- Like your nose.

442
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:15,055
- Come on.
- And your little hands.

443
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,178
Hands I get.

444
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:22,178
- And your toes.
- It's ticklish.

445
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:26,381
Here, try these.
You can play with mine.

446
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,218
- You're right. Now I don't feel anything.
- See, it's perfect.

447
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,779
Would you...?

448
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,381
- No, I'm embarrassed.
- What?

449
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:49,066
Would you rub it?

450
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,471
Okay.

451
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:57,351
You're making my toe hard.

452
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,672
- Do you want to kiss it?
- Your toe? No.

453
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:07,952
Come on, I'll do something for you.
Anything.

454
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:16,232
Aren't you forgetting something?

455
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,346
Please.

456
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:35,348
You filthy, dead fuck.

457
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:45,760
Hey, Nate. Keith.
I met you at your dad's viewing.

458
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,396
Oh, yeah, David's racquetball partner.

459
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:51,682
Is David inside?

460
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:54,602
No, he went out for dinner
with his ex-fianc'ee.

461
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:58,591
She missed Dad's funeral,
and they were pretty close, so...

462
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:02,274
- That's cool, I understand completely.
- I have his number if you wanna call.

463
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:05,476
I already gave it a shot.
He didn't answer.

464
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:08,324
Hey, is David any good...

465
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:10,880
...at racquetball?
We used to play in high school...

466
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,156
...and he was pathetic,
running into walls...

467
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:16,722
Yeah, I think you'd be pretty surprised
just how good he's gotten.

468
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:21,079
- Well, I'll tell him you came by.
- Thanks.

469
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,803
Dear God.

470
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,800
I need to get his watch.
I need to sell it for the money.

471
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:53,846
- My life is over.
- This is a hard time, the hardest.

472
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:59,889
It was all a lie! He left us with nothing,
because there never was anything.

473
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:05,444
Bastard.

474
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:28,409
I almost died when I saw our
engagement pictures still on your mantle.

475
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:34,255
Why? My family loved you,
my father especially.

476
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,654
He loved you.

477
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:39,419
Yeah, he had a funny way of showing it.

478
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,728
I'm drunk.

479
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,296
Then I can ask.

480
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,816
Are you happy?

481
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:55,136
I'm still me.

482
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,542
Your father knew.

483
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:02,781
We had coffee once, and he told me...

484
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:05,862
...he understood why we
couldn't be together.

485
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:09,377
He said you spent so much time
trying to make people happy...

486
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:12,224
...you never thought about yourself.

487
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,893
He worried about that.

488
00:38:17,905 --> 00:38:22,582
So do you have anyone now?

489
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,337
Can you tell me about him?

490
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:32,382
You're wrong about my father.
You didn't know him at all, nobody did.

491
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:42,947
Let's get a room at the Haverford Inn
and fuck our brains out. How about it?

492
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:45,380
Jesus, David.

493
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:58,588
Hi. I got your message.
Sorry I didn't call you back.

494
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:01,590
I had to go out to County Hospital.

495
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:05,263
The body's still in Long Beach.
The autopsy's not even finished yet.

496
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,828
It's unbelievable.

497
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:10,502
How was the meeting?

498
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,830
Everyone asked about you.

499
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,424
- They wanna meet you.
- I wanna meet them.

500
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:22,905
I'm a little drunk. You might have
to undress me.

501
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:24,674
Okay.

502
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,194
Right after you stop lying to me.

503
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:36,044
- Brenda?
- Yes, Nate.

504
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:41,561
- Why is my name tattooed on your ass?
- It's not your name.

505
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,002
Yes, it is.

506
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,759
You're not the only
person named that.

507
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:00,840
Nate, it's a coincidence.
It's not you or anyone you know.

508
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:06,566
Come on. What, you think
I'm so enamored with you...

509
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:08,729
...I had your name
burned into my flesh?

510
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,693
Then how come I never saw it before?

511
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,727
We've had sex twice.

512
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:17,846
Once with our clothes on
and once in the dark...

513
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:19,607
...after three martinis apiece.

514
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:24,252
You obviously liked some guy enough
to have his name burned into your flesh.

515
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,010
I would have done
a lot more than that for him.

516
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,178
It's about time, you fucking moron.

517
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:19,660
- What are you doing in there?
- Help me out, you fucking moron.

518
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,973
- Why can't you just climb out?
- I think we both know...

519
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:25,619
...the answer to that, you fucking moron.

520
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:40,462
You really should do
something about this.

521
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:43,262
It's really deep.

522
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,261
It might as well be bleeding.

523
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:53,706
- Could you be a little more dramatic?
- Oh, I could be a lot more dramatic.

524
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,504
What are you doing today?

525
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:03,427
Dave and I have to go get the registration
out of the wrecked hearse.

526
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:06,140
Insurance won't replace without it.

527
00:43:06,352 --> 00:43:08,343
What time?

528
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:13,389
- 2:30, I think.
- Take your cell phone.

529
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:16,949
- Okay.
- Promise me you will.

530
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:20,265
All right.

531
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:31,826
Oh, I don't feel like carbs this morning.

532
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:34,432
Do we have any more
Stevie Nicks raspberries?

533
00:43:34,636 --> 00:43:36,274
Claire.

534
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:42,915
- Do you have an eating disorder?
- What? No, Mom. I wish, but...

535
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:59,789
- Are you being helped?
- Yeah, my pop's here. Suarez.

536
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,592
Of course.

537
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,556
That's the Titan Series.
It's quite beautiful.

538
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:08,869
- Give me a number.
- Nine thousand.

539
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:11,199
You guys ought to get your act together.

540
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:13,791
Your brother said
that this was on special, 4500.

541
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:17,075
And then he came down to 4000,
so why don't we start there?

542
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:24,638
That's not legal, reselling a coffin.
There are fluids that seep.

543
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:28,804
- Okay? And Mr. Swanson, he seeped.
- What did you tell Mr. Suarez?

544
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,240
He wants a quality coffin.
We happen to have one.

545
00:44:31,445 --> 00:44:34,165
I don't agree with this at all.
It's against my beliefs.

546
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:36,243
- Thank you, Federico.
- And it's unsanitary.

547
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:39,281
They're dead. What disease
can they possibly catch?

548
00:44:39,486 --> 00:44:42,285
It's too late, Nate.
It's a $9000 retail item...

549
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:45,718
...our cost is 3200. We eat that,
and plus we lose the profit.

550
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:49,477
Wait, there's a $6000 markup?

551
00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:57,283
Mr. Suarez, we cannot
let you have that casket.

552
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,924
- Sorry to hear that.
- We can't legally sell it...

553
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,849
...because very briefly,
it was occupied by another person.

554
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,484
- 3500.
- Sold!

555
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,763
- Absolutely not.
- David, don't be a fucking moron.

556
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:12,284
Fellas, let's split the difference because
I gotta get a haircut before the service.

557
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:16,844
- My brother has no authorization...
- Mr. Suarez, it's a $9000 product.

558
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:19,123
It's used one night.
You're getting it at cost.

559
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:22,405
Would you stipulate that you
understand the condition of the coffin?

560
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,965
Sure, whatever.
May I make a suggestion?

561
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:30,566
You've closed, okay? Don't overclose.
It kills the word of mouth.

562
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:01,649
Is that the best they could come up with?
"Father, husband, caregiver"?

563
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,012
How would you prefer?
"Introvert, sadist, mind-fucker"?

564
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:11,500
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher. Matt Gilardi
of Kroehner Service International.

565
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,377
I understand you're now
part-owner of the business.

566
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:20,739
You are aware we've made a very rich
buyout offer for your unit.

567
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:22,456
Okay.

568
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,543
- This a one-time offer.
- I don't know about that.

569
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,775
You think you can hold out?

570
00:46:28,504 --> 00:46:31,940
We control suppliers now. Where are
you gonna get your chemicals?

571
00:46:32,144 --> 00:46:34,943
How about your caskets and liners?
What about this Diaz kid?

572
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:38,740
I mean, this guy is a topnotch
restorative artist.

573
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:40,823
You threatening to put us
out of business?

574
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:42,744
We look at it as a partnership.

575
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:47,065
In the death-care industry now,
it's consolidate or die.

576
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:50,145
Decide which, Nate, and give me a ring...

577
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:53,897
...because we will put things in motion
either way.

578
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,788
"We'll put things in motion either way"?
Tough guy.

579
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:03,298
Shut up.

580
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,301
Right in here.

581
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,785
Sign this right here.

582
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:28,425
Well, it's totaled. The insurance company
was right about that.

583
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,751
Fuck.

584
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:45,390
There's still blood on the wheel.

585
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:02,036
- Okay, let's go.
- Jesus, don't you feel anything?

586
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:04,912
Yeah, I feel betrayed.

587
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,394
Hello.

588
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,073
Meet me at the corner of Sunset
and Gordon, Now, It's important,

589
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:20,079
- What?
- Bring your brother,

590
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:23,479
Trust me, you need to do this,

591
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:32,480
I spoke to Gilardi.

592
00:48:32,684 --> 00:48:33,958
And?

593
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,679
He says we sell
or they put us out of business.

594
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:39,637
Fuck.

595
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,522
I think we should sell.

596
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:48,321
And erase everything this family
has meant for 50 years?

597
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:51,599
That might not be a bad thing.

598
00:49:00,968 --> 00:49:04,166
- Hey.
- Brenda.

599
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,362
- This is my brother, Dave.
- Come on.

600
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:12,402
Come on. Let's do this.

601
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:24,808
This is the bus.

602
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:27,082
What bus?

603
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,523
The bus.

604
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:35,292
Brenda, this isn't funny.

605
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:39,612
This is fucked up. What gives you
the right to do something like this?

606
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:53,495
He's...

607
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:58,727
I never...

608
00:50:55,715 --> 00:51:08,670
