1
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:47,271
OK, sweetheart, time to say goodbye.

2
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,866
- I don't want to.
- We have to. God has other plans for her.

3
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:55,146
- I'll miss you, birdie.
- I know, sweetheart.

4
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:59,586
But by rescuing her, nursing her back to health
and now setting her free,

5
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,626
we are doing a good deed.

6
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:03,472
Good deed.

7
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,791
When we do something kind,
even for a little lost bird,

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,271
we give a gift that resonates
throughout all humanity.

9
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,704
- Humanity.
- Say bye-bye.

10
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:16,350
- Bye-bye.
- Be free, little lost bird. Be free.

11
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,750
Fuck you, motherfucker.

12
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,906
Fuck you.

13
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,946
You motherfucker.

14
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:31,874
Fuck me!

15
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,343
It's broken.

16
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,432
A bird crapped on my hat. I need to wash it.

17
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,990
All right. Just use the sink. Toilet broken.

18
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,674
And hurry up. I'm going to close.

19
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,745
Fuck you, motherfucker.

20
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,031
Fuck you, motherfucker.

21
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,585
Fuck you, motherfucker.

22
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,148
Fuck you, motherfucker.

23
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:10,585
- I told you it's broken.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

24
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:16,347
- Excellent.
- Fuck off, you!

25
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,343
- What are you saying? You wanna leave?
- Leave?

26
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,671
I'd have to leave
because I moved my life to this shithole city.

27
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,070
- Not for me, you didn't.
- You wanna split up?

28
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,106
Maybe, yeah.

29
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:51,984
Who would leave a child alone like that?

30
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:55,630
Don't be too hard on him.
He's not himself right now.

31
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:59,554
Besides, Maya's far from alone.
Aren't you, little lady?

32
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:03,747
- You wanna go to Grandma?
- There you go.

33
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,951
So is Nate a total alkie now?
Shall we do something?

34
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:27,226
He's just numbing the pain. He has to.

35
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,507
Sometimes he goes outside to smoke
and he paces underneath my window.

36
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,671
- He talks to himself.
- I know.

37
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:36,752
Seriously, like whole conversations.

38
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:46,705
Why is everyone in my house?

39
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,985
Maya was crying her little heart out.

40
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,107
- Where would you go at 4.30am?
- I was having a cigarette.

41
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:57,468
- In Pomona?
- We heard her crying all the way in the house.

42
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,985
Poor little baby, you thought no one loved you.

43
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:03,310
Mom, I can take her.

44
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,714
- Where's her blankie?
- I have it.

45
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:16,713
- Are you living here now?
- Nate.

46
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:24,630
Tell you what,
I'm gonna make a big pot of coffee

47
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,950
and then we'd like to talk to you guys.

48
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:30,112
In the kitchen in, say, about ten minutes?

49
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:43,627
You're getting married? When?

50
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:46,985
The day after tomorrow. A small ceremony.

51
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:51,028
Just me and George and all of you.

52
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:54,829
- You guys met last week.
- Six and a half weeks ago, actually.

53
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,389
- Mom.
- When were you planning on telling us?

54
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,030
- We booked the wedding chapel last night.
- I can't believe this.

55
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:05,068
Nate, I love your mother and she loves me.

56
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:08,790
Yeah, it's so fucking moving
I can hardly stand it.

57
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:13,910
Fine. Do whatever you want. What do I care?

58
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:22,154
- Mom, maybe with Lisa and everything...
- Life doesn't stop, all right?

59
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:23,992
We didn't die.

60
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,987
We have this precious gift of life
and it's so terribly fleeting

61
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:33,426
and that is why it's important to keep on living,
to not give up hope.

62
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,506
Fine, don't come.

63
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:45,230
If no one's going to celebrate this with us,
I don't want any of you there.

64
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,266
Let's go back to bed.

65
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:58,710
It's upsetting to you
that your kids don't approve, isn't it?

66
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,474
Do your children approve?

67
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,665
They're supportive.

68
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,991
Maggie says to just send pictures.

69
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:10,186
Brian said six and he's done.

70
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,749
I don't need their approval.

71
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:16,344
Not one of them has ever had
a relationship I'd want.

72
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,025
George, I don't wanna wait.

73
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:24,512
I feel like I've spent my entire life waiting.

74
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:27,513
Then let's not wait.

75
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:31,309
The day after tomorrow?
They don't even know each other.

76
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:33,949
Maybe that's the best time to marry someone,

77
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:37,146
otherwise you'd never do it.

78
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:50,434
How are you holding up through all this?

79
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,506
Not that good.

80
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,744
You wanna talk about it?

81
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:03,870
How can I? With Lisa just gone
and Nate's like totally losing it.

82
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:08,273
I feel I don't have a right
to have my own problems.

83
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,670
Of course you have a right.

84
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,750
- Is it Russell?
- God, it's so much more than that.

85
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:31,624
A year ago I was like,
if I can just get into art school,

86
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:35,588
then maybe finally my life
will start to be about something.

87
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:41,710
And then I do
and it's just so sickly political and dumb

88
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:45,828
and full of evil, hateful freaks.

89
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,947
Now I just despise the one thing
that was my only hope.

90
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,073
Your whole relationship fell apart too, huh?

91
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,106
No, I wouldn't say...

92
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,145
Yeah.

93
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,113
Sorry.

94
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,908
Thanks.

95
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:20,986
Don't forget to bring back your coffee cup.

96
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:25,511
We're running out of coffee cups
in this kitchen.

97
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,110
People keep leaving with them.

98
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:47,025
A plane. A plane going to Burbank airport.

99
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:50,465
Just before landing...
They call it blue ice.

100
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,791
A ball of chemicals for toilet of aeroplane.

101
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,269
It come off.

102
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,705
Right down to Anahid. In our own yard.

103
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,872
One minute I am talking to her on telephone,
next minute...

104
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:09,234
You believe this?
And now I find out it happens all the time.

105
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,311
Big companies are keeping it quiet

106
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,791
so people like me and you don't realise
that blue ice is a killer.

107
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:25,025
Are you not listening to me?
You are here just to take my money?

108
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:28,192
You take it from people
when they are vulnerable.

109
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:31,068
What is this, some kind of fucking business?

110
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:34,994
Goddamn right, it's a business.
You think I'm here for the love of humanity?

111
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:38,994
You think I wanna be with people
on the worst day of their lives?

112
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:43,551
- I want to talk to your boss, please.
- I am the boss and I want you out now.

113
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,873
- Come on.
- Go on, get the fuck out.

114
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:51,952
I'll have your wife brought
to wherever you end up.

115
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,792
Free of fucking charge.

116
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:57,714
Out of the goodness of my heart.
I'm in this business because I love people.

117
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,223
And I love helping people!

118
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,229
I felt so free for a week,

119
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:07,233
but then within days
I went from, "Yay, I'm independent,"

120
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,914
to, "Holy fuck, I'm gonna die alone."

121
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,664
I keep switching between,
"We're meant to be together

122
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:16,548
"and we can grow together into who we fully
are together..."

123
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,233
- Know what I mean?
- Not really.

124
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,187
And then I completely flip over to,

125
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:25,069
"We're poison for each other.
This is abuse."

126
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:29,905
You always go through tough patches, David.
You just have to work through them.

127
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,946
Have you and Vanessa gone through a time

128
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:37,115
where you felt that by staying with her
your sense of self would be obliterated?

129
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:41,188
- No.
- I didn't think so.

130
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:44,352
Vanessa and I have our issues.

131
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:48,354
Mainly because other people
try to come between us.

132
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,670
Would that be Angelica?

133
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:56,393
I swear, David,
I wish I could just kick her sorry ass out.

134
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,144
Vanessa always takes her side.
It's like I have a two-headed wife.

135
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:04,074
- As opposed to a no-headed wife?
- That's good. That's really...

136
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:05,707
- Unhook her.
- Excuse me?

137
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:09,384
- Just fucking unhook her.
- What's wrong with you?

138
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:11,824
The husband changed his mind.

139
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,153
Wait until I get the cannula out of her.
I should aspirate before we move her.

140
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,789
Did we get outbid again?

141
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:23,192
Yeah, the priest or pastor from their church
wanted to use a different place.

142
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,032
Armenian place. It's no big deal.

143
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,908
Make sure we charge them extra
for embalming.

144
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,227
- It's gonna be free.
- Why did you do that?

145
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:37,274
- You just lost us $500, Nate.
- I made a mistake, all right?

146
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:41,627
I made a fucking mistake. You wanna
take it out of my fucking pay cheque?

147
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,870
Fuck you guys.

148
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,791
- I'm so alone.
- You're not alone.

149
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:52,788
You have me.

150
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:56,430
But do I, Philip? Do I really?

151
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:01,991
- How can I ever trust you after Budapest?
- I had amnesia.

152
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:06,028
Hey. I need you to watch Maya for me.
I'll be right back.

153
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:10,785
Nate, I wanna help you.
I can't imagine what you're dealing with.

154
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:15,465
But I am as out of it as you are. I don't think
my energy would be good for Maya.

155
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,631
No, you're better than me.

156
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:22,191
Maybe it's just too much to ever forgive.

157
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:26,751
Or maybe when it comes to forgiving,
you need to start with yourself.

158
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:53,713
- One more?
- Yeah.

159
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:56,588
Do you guys sell any food here?

160
00:15:56,635 --> 00:16:01,914
Peanuts. Some eggs over there.
I could order you a pizza.

161
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,628
No, I can't eat a whole pizza.

162
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:13,865
I'll have a slice with you.

163
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,466
Hawaiian?

164
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:20,506
Ham and pineapple?

165
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:26,667
Sorry, I'm not a pineapple-on-pizza kind of guy.

166
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,706
Oh, yeah?

167
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,064
What kind of guy are you?

168
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:36,425
The kind of guy
who wants to fuck you senseless.

169
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:11,353
- Am I too loud?
- No, I was just curious what the sound was.

170
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:14,387
French horn. Nobody ever knows what it is.

171
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:18,110
- It's beautiful.
- Don't lie. There's no need.

172
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:22,034
It's not one of those instruments
that's meant to be heard alone.

173
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,428
I'm Brenda.

174
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,268
Joe.

175
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:29,875
I just moved in a month and a half ago.

176
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:35,151
Welcome. I've been here for about eight years.

177
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:39,347
- It seems like a nice enough place.
- Yeah, I like it.

178
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,704
It's cheap, so I don't have to work a lot.

179
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,871
I do session work mostly.

180
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:49,114
These days people prefer the synthesised
pseudo-horn to that of an actual human.

181
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,393
- Do I sound angry? I'm not angry.
- No.

182
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:56,393
It's fine. It's nice to talk to someone.

183
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,551
You just get out of prison?

184
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:01,631
Something like that.

185
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:05,668
Have you checked out the neighbourhood,
figured out where stuff is?

186
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,673
- No.
- No?

187
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:11,707
No, I just mostly stay at home.

188
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:17,824
If you want, I'll walk you down. I know the area
looks dicey, but there are some great places.

189
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:22,187
There's a great Cuban bakery
that makes a really good cafe con leche.

190
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:27,706
- I'm not gonna have sex with you.
- OK.

191
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:33,073
- Just to get that out in the open.
- I didn't realise that was an option.

192
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:35,754
- It's not an option.
- I got it.

193
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,111
Sorry to be so blunt.

194
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:48,074
It's just I've been celibate
kind of a long time and...

195
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:51,073
it's been kind of a good thing for me.

196
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:56,384
You're really attractive.
But you know that, right?

197
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:04,272
So yeah, I'll have coffee with you
but I don't drink or smoke pot.

198
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:06,749
I'm pretty boring, actually.

199
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:09,992
Somehow I find that hard to believe.

200
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,307
Well, then, it's nice meeting you.

201
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,630
And your horn.

202
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,666
Yeah.

203
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:39,388
...taking some punishing blows.
- What is keeping these guys up?

204
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,750
I can't figure.

205
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:46,992
Oh, and that hurts very bad. That hurts.

206
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,503
- He's wobbling now.
- He's certainly wobbling.

207
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,034
Hey.

208
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,549
Travis, clear out. Momma's got company.

209
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,626
I'm ready.

210
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:28,866
I don't know if this kid's gonna have his title
before this night is over...

211
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,709
It's two in the morning.

212
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,792
- You left at dinner time.
- Just go back to sleep.

213
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,069
God, you're so fucking sad.

214
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,914
I know.

215
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:07,708
- What?
- Nothing.

216
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,747
I'm just happy to see you.

217
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,104
- You are?
- Yeah.

218
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:18,074
I'm happy to see you too.

219
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:33,227
Call him. You know you want to.

220
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,266
Yeah, but should I?

221
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:38,306
Why not? You miss him.

222
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:41,870
I miss a lot of people. I miss you.

223
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,906
Yeah. But you really miss him.

224
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:48,426
- I miss having sex with him.
- You can have sex with anybody.

225
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,194
- Yeah, I did that.
- I saw.

226
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,032
Slut.

227
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:59,667
So what if I shut the door on Keith
like he's dead to me?

228
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:05,028
I'll end up replacing him with someone else
like Mom is replacing you with George.

229
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,863
- Is that all life is, replacing people?
- Pretty much.

230
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:11,748
Some people do it faster
and more often than others.

231
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,786
Don't touch those.

232
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,151
George reminds me of you, you know.

233
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:24,028
Huh. I don't really see that.

234
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,464
Just enough to make me sad.

235
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:31,190
Enough to make me wish
I could see you and Mom together again.

236
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:33,954
That man is alive and I'm dead.

237
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,668
I think that means he wins.

238
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,226
Hey, it's me.

239
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,266
Listen, I...

240
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:03,184
Would you like to come to church
with me this morning?

241
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:08,114
You have to be real quiet
so we can sneak up on him.

242
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,943
- I don't think he's gonna like that.
- Me neither.

243
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:14,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:23,113
- Got another beer?
- Fridge.

245
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:32,750
You gotta stay real close and keep quiet.

246
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:36,315
Really quiet.

247
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:39,984
- What you doing?
- Watching the baby.

248
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,185
Literally.

249
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:47,029
The little ones.
There's a reason to hold it together.

250
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:50,504
We forget our own reasons.

251
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:55,913
You're not gonna try and lay some
instant bonding horseshit on me, are you?

252
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:59,349
Cos that'd be seriously obnoxious.

253
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,228
- We're all very worried about you.
- We who?

254
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,984
Your mother, your family, which,
like it or not, I'm gonna be part of.

255
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:09,664
- Fuck you.
- You need your family now, more than ever.

256
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,793
George, you can sit in our TV room
and rent movies,

257
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,826
you can bone my mother day and night,

258
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,390
but don't you dare come in here
and act like you're my fucking father,

259
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,665
cos you're not, you never will be.

260
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,472
It's time for Maya's nap.

261
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:37,785
- I only wanted to...
- Just leave me the fuck alone, all right?

262
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:53,786
Sorry, babe.

263
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:12,748
I remember the first time I saw you,
out there in the parking lot.

264
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:17,225
Really? I thought we met downstairs
at that buffet thing.

265
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:20,950
Yeah, that's where we met,
but I'd already seen you a couple of times,

266
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,429
getting out of your car, all studly.

267
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:30,108
You looked so intense, the way you pointed
your alarm thingy at your car.

268
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,385
"Fuck you, car. Now you're locked."

269
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:36,906
- Please.
- Somebody told me you were a cop.

270
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:42,427
And for the next couple of Sundays
I timed it so I'd pull in next to you.

271
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:45,273
You were watching me?

272
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:47,670
Stalker.

273
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:50,149
I loved that you were a cop.

274
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:54,388
The thought of being with you
made me feel safe.

275
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:58,394
I can't imagine what I thought
I needed protection from.

276
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:02,314
I just liked knowing
you were strapped to a gun all day.

277
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:07,433
- I saw you before we talked too.
- Really?

278
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,831
- You were checking me out?
- Yeah.

279
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,470
I saw you and I thought,
"Who is that beautiful new white boy?"

280
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:20,825
- Stop.
- I did. I couldn't stop looking at you.

281
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:26,231
- It's funny.
- Why is that funny?

282
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:28,584
Don't you know I think you're beautiful?

283
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,066
No.

284
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,913
And kind and smart and loving.

285
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:39,230
You didn't know that?

286
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:41,266
No.

287
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:48,825
Well, I do.

288
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:52,665
- You looking for me?
- Yeah. Where the fuck is your grave?

289
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:54,512
You're not even close.

290
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,746
It's way over there.

291
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,591
Come on, I'll take you to it.

292
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:07,064
So how's life?

293
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:09,709
- How's death?
- It's good.

294
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,747
Made some new friends,
joined the chess team.

295
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:16,626
Glad you came today.

296
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:21,385
- Is it some kind of special occasion?
- No, it's like this every day.

297
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:30,992
Hello, precious girl.

298
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:42,391
Mom, I've got to tell you I think you're making
a big mistake marrying George.

299
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,474
You don't know him.

300
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,713
I know he's a presumptuous fool
and a know-it-all, OK?

301
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:54,909
- Plus, he's selfish. It's so obvious.
- How is he selfish?

302
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:59,824
Mom, he wants you to take care of him. He's
not thinking of how much Maya will need you.

303
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,912
Maya's going to need
strong, happy people in her life,

304
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:05,833
and I love George
and I feel strong and happy with him.

305
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,069
That helps Maya.

306
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:12,314
It's a help to go off with some stranger
and leave Maya with no family at all?

307
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:14,664
Jesus Christ, her mother is fucking missing.

308
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:18,833
Maya still has one parent.
A lot of kids don't even have that.

309
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:23,744
- You didn't come home until 2.30 last night.
- I had a sitter.

310
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:28,311
You had Claire. You can't expect us to be there
every time you wanna check out.

311
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:31,028
Why the fuck not?
I stuck around after Dad died.

312
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,068
I had a life. I was ready to go back to Seattle.

313
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:39,154
- I never asked you...
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

314
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,471
You asked me to stick around.
"Just for a few fucking days."

315
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:46,508
But that's only because nobody in this family
can say what they really mean.

316
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:49,513
You know you wanted me to stay for good.

317
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,864
Don't you dare fucking act like you didn't.

318
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:57,472
Goddammit! I've changed everything
in my fucking life because of you.

319
00:29:57,515 --> 00:30:00,632
Maybe if I hadn't, none of this shit
would have happened.

320
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:01,869
Please!

321
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:05,191
And now, when I need you,
you refuse to fucking help me.

322
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,271
How can I help you?

323
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:11,513
I'm trying to pull you out of the water
and you're strapping on lead boots.

324
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:13,432
I don't know what to do.

325
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:17,866
Watch you self-destruct?
I can't do that. I won't do that.

326
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,748
Thanks, Mom. Thanks for fucking everything.

327
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:01,874
So those are all your cats?

328
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:03,951
No, they're the building's.

329
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:08,910
But if I don't feed them they're gonna eat
dead diseased birds or something.

330
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:13,783
- So you're a giver?
- Yeah, I'm so fucking noble.

331
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:19,032
Not enough to catch them,
get them spayed, find them homes.

332
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:22,988
- Why don't you take them in yourself?
- I'm allergic.

333
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:34,427
Sorry if I unloaded too much personal stuff
on you yesterday.

334
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:40,152
- No problem.
- So is the coffee thing still an option?

335
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:42,504
Sure, if you want it to be.

336
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:45,592
- Yeah, I do.
- OK.

337
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:50,703
- Now?
- Yeah, I could.

338
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:53,349
No, they're closed Sunday.

339
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:56,228
And I have to do laundry today.

340
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,266
Sure. OK, it's fine.

341
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:03,343
Well, we could do dinner later tonight.

342
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:06,387
- There's a Korean barbecue nearby.
- I don't think...

343
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:09,745
Think of it as lunch
in another time zone.

344
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,425
I already know sex is not an option.

345
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:17,833
- Sure. Why not?
- Good.

346
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:37,033
- Monkeys?
- You think monkeys don't die?

347
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:45,145
Yeah, Anthony, good catch, man. Over here.

348
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:58,312
- He's dead?
- Don't ask me. This is your thing.

349
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:04,987
Man, I was just so constantly aggro.

350
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:09,784
Know what my problem was? I couldn't relax.

351
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:17,112
- I wish I could have helped you more.
- Claire, there was nothing anybody could do.

352
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:22,024
Life just wasn't the right environment for me.

353
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,989
But don't you miss it?

354
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:33,273
No, not really. Actually, I like it better here.

355
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:38,991
I'm taking care of Anthony
and I'm doing the whole home-school thing.

356
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:43,228
I feel like I have a purpose for the first time.

357
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:47,951
I never could have done that when I was alive.
I was just so fucking selfish.

358
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:50,946
Yeah.

359
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:54,824
When I hang out with my niece sometimes

360
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,070
it's like just by spending time with her

361
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,473
I get to re-experience
the sort of eternal youngness of things.

362
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,392
But then I think about it
and it just goes away.

363
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:17,669
So, you seeing anybody?

364
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:19,706
No.

365
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,703
I gotta go to the bathroom.

366
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:29,111
All right, let's go to the bathroom. Come on.

367
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:34,634
Well, I've got to run.

368
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:37,314
Yeah. OK.

369
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,346
Come here.

370
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:50,987
I love you.

371
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,634
I love you too.

372
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,230
OK. Come on.

373
00:35:08,635 --> 00:35:11,945
It was always more like I had no choice.
My belief was all fear.

374
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:15,305
The whole Catholic thing,
even though I'm Episcopalian.

375
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:17,630
"You have to do right or you'll be punished."

376
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:20,951
I got that too,
only not from my religion, from my dad.

377
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:25,944
I believe we should do the right thing
but not because we'll be rewarded in heaven.

378
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:29,783
No, we should do the right thing
because we can and we choose to,

379
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:34,192
even if it's gonna make life harder,
which it often does.

380
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,873
Yeah.

381
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:45,471
I just don't know
if it's right for us to be together.

382
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,989
I don't know if it's wrong, either.

383
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:55,825
I've just been so unhappy for such a long time.

384
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:10,384
I slept with Patrick.

385
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,866
OK.

386
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:26,544
OK, look. Listen to me.

387
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,392
I love you with all my heart

388
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:31,393
and I'll do anything to work through this

389
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:33,471
because I don't wanna lose you.

390
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:46,428
I can't promise you anything.

391
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:50,787
Just don't give up. Not yet.

392
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:04,389
Where are you going?

393
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:08,394
I don't want to sit around like a pig
in my own filth for one Sunday,

394
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,154
if nobody minds.

395
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:15,393
Sweetie, why don't we go to church?
Why don't we do something?

396
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:18,871
Baby, Angie just rented the kids
a bunch of movies.

397
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:24,263
Whoa, Angie, that's not for kids.
Put on something else.

398
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:27,944
What they get they get.
What they don't get goes over their heads.

399
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,668
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It does.

400
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:34,991
I have to go to the potty.
Will you put it on pause?

401
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:40,224
- That's my shirt.
- Sorry. I just slept in it.

402
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,226
I'll wash it.

403
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:51,107
That's it. That's it.
Your sister has got to go for good.

404
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:54,192
She's been looking.
She needs to find a roommate first.

405
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:58,308
She hasn't been looking.
She's in hog heaven over here.

406
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:01,188
- Rico, that is my sister.
- And I am your husband.

407
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:04,033
We wouldn't be in this house
if it weren't for her.

408
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:09,113
- We paid her that money back.
- We needed help. Now she needs help.

409
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:12,954
Rico.

410
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,310
You better not slam that door.

411
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:29,027
I'll wait for you out here.
You're not allowed to smoke in there.

412
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,145
Claire.

413
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,186
Oh, my God.

414
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:01,426
- Please tell me you're just visiting.
- Yeah.

415
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:07,185
- So you're...
- Couldn't be better.

416
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:09,544
OK, I'm so not getting this.

417
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,711
There's nothing to get.

418
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:17,188
Lisa, if I'd known you were gonna die
I'd have hung out with you more.

419
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:19,430
You're so sweet.

420
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,630
Isn't he beautiful?

421
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:35,633
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

422
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:41,425
And you take care of Maya for me, OK?

423
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:56,311
You know, I miss you
and I think about you all the time.

424
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,865
Right back at you.

425
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,514
It's so weird that Mom's getting married.

426
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:08,833
It's like you're being erased or something.
Aren't you pissed off?

427
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,866
No. That's you.

428
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,787
I think this is what you're looking for.

429
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:47,193
- Yeah?
- Mr Fisher?

430
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:51,831
- Yeah?
- This is Deputy Wheeler.

431
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,754
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, sir.

432
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,945
You might want to sit down.

433
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,872
OK.

434
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,906
We found a body, sir,

435
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:14,110
and it matches
with your wife's dental records.

436
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:16,874
I'm so sorry.

437
00:41:18,235 --> 00:41:20,226
Three basics.

438
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:23,946
And turn.

439
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,946
Merengue.

440
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:36,071
You read all these articles, how Austin's
supposed to be this hot enclave of artists,

441
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,675
but it was more than just hot.

442
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:41,832
A million degrees at all times.

443
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,991
I'd be laying around my apartment going,

444
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:49,155
"I know to I need to experience that edgy
local songwriter at the fabulous new club,

445
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:51,868
"but I'm just so damn hot."

446
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:54,793
- Is that why you came back to LA?
- My dad got sick.

447
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:57,190
I'm sorry.

448
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:01,983
- He died, actually.
- I'm really sorry.

449
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:05,027
Thank you. It's OK.

450
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:08,465
The oddest part is that I actually returned

451
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:12,349
with the intention
of reconnecting with my family,

452
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:16,786
and then within a matter of months
I'm in this place where,

453
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:20,150
without saying too much
and scaring you...

454
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:22,345
Say whatever you want.

455
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:28,233
I actually have no one.

456
00:42:29,555 --> 00:42:33,707
I don't think I've ever been so by myself.

457
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:42,469
But, believe it or not, I'm not lonely.

458
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:50,547
I know that one day I need to start...
well, I want to start dating again...

459
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:53,189
Fuck dating. Dating is stupid.

460
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:00,429
But this is a date, isn't it, kind of?

461
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:06,072
Well, it is if we want it to be.
Do you want it to be?

462
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:12,549
- Can I get back to you on that?
- Take your time.

463
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:19,305
- See you next time.
- Bye-bye.

464
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:26,793
I know the woman that teaches salsa
on Tuesdays. She's delightful.

465
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:30,987
- Cool, I'll check it out.
- I'm taking off.

466
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:33,868
I think they're having a private party
here tonight.

467
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:37,225
- We probably should clear out.
- OK.

468
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:43,825
Would you like to get a drink?
You look like you have some time.

469
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:47,151
I've got nothing but time. Thank you.

470
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:48,992
- Where's your car?
- In the lot.

471
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:51,788
- Why don't you follow me?
- OK.

472
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:11,871
So what'll it be?

473
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:15,230
A shot of tequila.

474
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:19,553
- You wanna get to your sister's before dark.
- You wanna get rid of me.

475
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,186
Keep it coming.

476
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:53,225
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, dear.

477
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:59,227
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

478
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:02,465
How long before we leave?

479
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:06,906
- A couple of hours.
- Good.

480
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,310
I was afraid I was gonna be late.

481
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:15,664
- Want me to bag up the video camera?
- No, they provide that at the chapel.

482
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:18,752
Maybe you could take care of Maya
tonight at the wedding.

483
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,825
George has her right now.

484
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:26,033
- Where's Nate?
- I have no idea.

485
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:32,871
I've tried calling his cellphone all afternoon
but there's no answer.

486
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:39,431
I have something for you.

487
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:50,868
They're antique, so they're old,

488
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,588
but I just bought them, so they're also new.

489
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:57,344
Technically I'm giving them to you
rather than letting you borrow them

490
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:59,511
but they're blue, right?

491
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:06,705
I love you, Mom. I'm so happy
that you've found your soul mate.

492
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:11,152
Thank you, my sweet darling Claire.

493
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:15,865
You don't know how much
this means to me from you.

494
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:28,753
- Do you like them?
- They're beautiful.

495
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:48,863
Nothing to worry about, kid.
Just a place to get a drink.

496
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:52,544
I know. I just normally don't do this.

497
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:56,114
These ladies, they're very nice.

498
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,784
That wasn't a kiss.

499
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:40,429
No. But it was close.

500
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:53,033
- Good night.
- Good night.

501
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,665
- Hi.
- Hey.

502
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,906
- I'm Infinity.
- I'm Rico. Hi.

503
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:24,984
- This is a great song.
- Yeah.

504
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,744
When are you gonna dance again?
I thought you were a great dancer.

505
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:30,194
Soon, don't worry.

506
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,595
My real name is Sophia.

507
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:36,751
But you gotta call me Infinity.

508
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:40,071
- How come?
- I don't know. It's the rules.

509
00:48:42,195 --> 00:48:45,267
I'm sorry, I've never been
to a place like this before.

510
00:48:55,995 --> 00:48:58,350
When are you gonna dance again?

511
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:20,026
Would you please stop doing that?

512
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:25,191
If you can give me a good reason to.

513
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:28,386
Because it's driving me fucking crazy.

514
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,995
Not a good enough reason.

515
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:48,793
- What the fuck is your problem, asshole?
- You're my problem, you dumb piece of shit.

516
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:52,710
How's your problem now, asshole?

517
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:57,950
Don't you call me a fucking piece of shit.

518
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,986
Asshole.

519
00:50:13,355 --> 00:50:15,949
Come on. Come on, do it.

520
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,986
Do it.

521
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,385
Come on, you fucking dipshit.
I can still fucking stand up.

522
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,426
Come on!

523
00:50:24,475 --> 00:50:27,547
Come on and finish what you started!

524
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:31,031
Come on! Fight, you fucking pussy! Come on!

525
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:35,227
I stand before you
with only myself and my time to give.

526
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:38,870
I wanna be with you
for the rest of my life.

527
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,588
To see joy through your eyes.

528
00:50:41,635 --> 00:50:44,354
To feel sorrow through your heart.

529
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:47,671
To share all the wonders of existence with you.

530
00:50:49,035 --> 00:50:51,674
Dearest Ruth.

531
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:57,790
My constant companion, lover, friend.

532
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:05,947
George, I have fun with you.

533
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,706
I wanna belong to you, my darling.

534
00:51:08,755 --> 00:51:12,225
I wanna be yours. And so...

535
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:27,065
Today I promise myself to you for ever.

536
00:51:28,115 --> 00:51:31,994
- I'm sorry.
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

537
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,065
Oh, my God.

538
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:06,110
Jeez.

539
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:09,705
Oh, my God.

540
00:52:14,075 --> 00:52:16,270
Man!

541
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:18,624
How much do I owe you?

542
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:22,991
What, are you crazy? I'm not a prostitute.

543
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:27,271
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I thought...

544
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:32,314
Shit. I didn't mean it about you,
I meant it about me.

545
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:34,630
I don't know how people...

546
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:38,071
Cutie, don't you know?

547
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,710
I wanna be your friend.
I like you, dum-dum.

548
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:55,872
So is there anyplace
that you want me to take you?

549
00:52:57,115 --> 00:53:00,664
Because I'm done, if that's OK.

550
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:34,953
- Hello, David. Keith.
- Hi.

551
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:39,510
Congratulations on the joyous event.

552
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:43,065
That's a gift that I bought.

553
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:46,146
For them.

554
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:50,434
That's so nice. Here, have some cake.

555
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:55,468
- I didn't want to help myself.
- Please. Here.

556
00:53:57,355 --> 00:53:59,346
Thanks.

557
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:17,311
If no one minds,
I think I'll enjoy this in my room.

558
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,747
Of course.

559
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:22,832
- Good night.
- Good night.

560
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:32,146
Sad guy, huh?

561
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:40,468
I mean, you were born in this business.
He actually chose it.

562
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:46,152
- See, you're picking on me again.
- No, I was picking on him.

563
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:48,948
- And me, adjacently.
- Adjacently is not a word.

564
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:52,465
- See, that's picking.
- I was not picking, I was teasing.

565
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:55,552
It's my style. You're picking on my style.

566
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:09,195
This cake is pretty good.

567
00:55:09,235 --> 00:55:11,226
Not really.

568
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,672
Take a right up ahead.

569
00:55:30,715 --> 00:55:33,354
Go straight up to 5 North.

570
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:36,068
There's a path that goes over the canyon

571
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:38,868
and you can hurl yourself
and the car right off.

572
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:41,554
- Fuck you.
- What are you waiting for?

573
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:45,508
- Quit grandstanding. Do it.
- Shut the fuck up.

574
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:47,989
Look at you. You're such a mess.

575
00:55:48,035 --> 00:55:50,708
You'll take anyone
if they'll fuck you or fight you.

576
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:55,828
Let me tell you, buddy boy,
those are just wisps of nothing

577
00:55:55,875 --> 00:56:00,790
compared to the nut you'll bust when this car
rips through you, tears your ass in half.

578
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:03,269
You'll shit a million stars.

579
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:06,067
I don't wanna die.

580
00:56:06,715 --> 00:56:09,388
Go ahead, honey.
It's the least you can do for me.

581
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:13,269
You fantasised about me being gone.
You've got what you wanted.

582
00:56:13,315 --> 00:56:15,670
Oh, my God.

583
00:56:15,715 --> 00:56:18,627
There's a very simple way
you can make it up to me.

584
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,906
- I don't wanna die.
- Coming up on the right.

585
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:24,469
Then we can be together for ever.

586
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:29,912
I don't wanna die.

587
00:56:30,915 --> 00:56:34,874
I don't wanna die.
