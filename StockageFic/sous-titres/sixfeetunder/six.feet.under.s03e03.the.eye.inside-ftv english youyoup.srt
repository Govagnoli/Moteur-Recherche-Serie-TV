00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,500
Hey, baby! Where you goin’ with that ass!

5
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,670
Come here, we’re talkin’ to you!

6
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,370
Slow down, bitch!

7
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,270
Hey, we just want to have a good time.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,970
You know you want some of this!

9
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,750
Bitch, you know it’s gonna happen!

10
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,970
Hey, Callie. It’s just us!

11
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,270
Goddammit, Zach!

12
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,590
Oh, shit! Callie! Callie! Callie!

13
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,150
“It’s only a paper moon

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,950
Sailing over a cardboard sea

15
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,350
But it wouldn’t be make believe

16
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,850
If you believed in me

17
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes, it’s only a canvas sky

18
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,650
Hanging over a muslin tree

19
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,150
But it wouldn’t be make believe

20
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,150
If you believed in me. ”

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,910
Perfect! That’s exactly how I want it to sound in Pasadena.

22
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,510
Uch! That’s just horrible!

23
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,230
Baritones, someone among you was singing a “B- flat, ” of all inappropriate notes.

24
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,830
And, um, well, there was a certain tenor who’s sharp on the “G”…a lot.

25
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,630
I can only pray to Jesus you know who you are,...Evan!

26
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,230
Lose the emotion, Dennis! That’s touching, but no one cares!

27
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,460
Okay. Sadly for our audiences who have paid $25 to hear,

28
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,060
we do not have time to work on that tonight.

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,430
But please, and I am begging you from a place of raw desperation,

30
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,430
learn your parts this weekend.
For them, if not for me.

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,850
Dismissed.

32
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,980
Hey, are you going to Evan’s open house tomorrow?

33
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,980
No. I’d love to, but I can’t.

34
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,880
I promise, it won’t be one of those sloppy scenes where everybody ends up naked in the pool,

35
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,580
and you have to deal with image of their soggy pubic hair in your mind for the rest of your life.

36
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,590
Well, that’s good.

37
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,990
Yeah, it’s just, I’m going away.

38
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,690
Oh. Well, I’m sure he’ll have another.

39
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,990
I hope so, because I’d really love to go.

40
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,590
Okay. Well, see you next week.

41
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,940
Shhh!!!

42
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,740
Shut up. My mom is a really light sleeper.

43
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,240
Sorry. That was—It was a really great one.

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
It was?

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,940
Mmm. How were yours?

46
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,670
Good.

47
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,270
Just good? Both?

48
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,170
It was just one…but it was good.

49
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,060
It was very good.

50
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,110
I think we can do better.

51
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,120
- Are you tired?
- It’s really late.

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
I was thinking I’d sleep over.

53
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,170
I don’t know…I guess.

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
Is that cool?

55
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,690
Yeah, fuck it.

56
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,290
Don’t go to the bathroom, though, ‘cause my mom gets up to pee like 500 times a night!

57
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,760
Now I have to pee.

58
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,710
Just go out the window. That’s what Nate used to do when this was his room.

59
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,440
Just try to avoid the avocado tree ‘cause we eat those.

60
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,890
Just do it.

61
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,250
Almost there.

62
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,250
My ass is killing me!

63
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,150
Sciatica?

64
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,950
No! It’s used to being nestled in a nice soft car seat for this trip!

65
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,390
I just love the fresh air!

66
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,490
It smells a lot like dog crap.

67
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,590
We had a little dog years ago,

68
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,290
a terrier we got for Nate when I was pregnant for David so he wouldn’t be jealous of the baby, y’know?

69
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,290
Yippie, he called him.

70
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,590
But he had some kind of a rare heart defect,

71
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,090
so, the day we came home with David,

72
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,590
Yippie crawled under Nate’s old bed and died!

73
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,840
That’s how my last husband went. Heart defect.

74
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,580
Jogged 5 miles every morning, then one day…poof!

75
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,770
46 years old.

76
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,470
Oh, that’s awful!

77
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,470
That’s better than with my first husband.

78
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,470
Melanoma at 25.

79
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,780
Then it was in and out of the hospital for 10 years.

80
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,780
Chemo 3 times.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
That was hard. I really loved him.

82
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,470
I really loved him.

83
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,270
I’m so sorry!

84
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,520
When did you remarry?

85
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,320
Well…there was one in between the two that died.

86
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,020
He was just a dog.

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,020
He tried to sleep with every single one of my girlfriends.

88
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,720
He probably live to be a hundred! And screwing other people’s wives the whole time!

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Son of a bitch!

90
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,890
Oh, I’m so sorry.

91
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,890
No, it’s okay. It is funny.

92
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,880
I just never thought of myself as lucky having only buried one husband before.

93
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Lucky, unlucky. I don’t know.

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I’m unlucky I ran through 3 husbands. I’m lucky I got to retire early off the insurance.

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
I’m unlucky my son set fire to the house.

96
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,480
I’m lucky I never had a urinary tract infection.

97
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,380
I don’t even care if it works out fair in the end. I’m sure it doesn’t.

98
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,180
I still have to haul my own ass out of bed in the morning.

99
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
I went to this…

100
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,910
I took a kind of seminar that was about that…

101
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,710
Oh, EST? Lifespring? The Plan?

102
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,610
The Plan.

103
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,810
My daughter was into that for years.

104
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,510
She was a group leader.

105
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,610
She inspired thousands of people to change their lives.

106
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,130
Now, she’s hoarding firearms in a compound in Montana.

107
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,730
No!

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,130
She’s always been very susceptible to group mentality.

109
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,730
Maybe I could’ve given her a stronger sense of self, but, you know,

110
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,990
I did my best. Some things are just genetic.

111
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,890
Well, what are you going to do?

112
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,090
Can’t you get some kind of a de- programmer to go in and rescue her?

113
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,090
You know what? She’s an adult.

114
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,090
I mean, it’s her life now.

115
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,370
Maybe I screwed her up, maybe I didn’t.

116
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,070
My son turned out fine.

117
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,370
How are your kids?

118
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,070
Fine…I think.

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,390
I have to go. I have a job interview in two hours, and I have to shower.

120
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,790
What kind of job?

121
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,590
As an accountant for a chain of dry cleaners. I’ve always been good with books.

122
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,890
Oooh, sounds fun!

123
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,490
Oh, I know. But I need the extra income, and it’s good for me to get out of the house.

124
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,490
You’re out of the house right now!

125
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,390
- That’s true.
- I think it’d be better to go to breakfast.

126
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,990
The French Marketplace has a 3. 99 special.

127
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,330
She was running from a group of boys who were whistling,

128
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,750
and she got scared that they were…

129
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,040
following her into a parking structure. So…

130
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,530
she ran into the street.

131
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,660
The car was speeding, it was dark…

132
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,610
I’m so sorry.

133
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,610
Did they catch the boys?

134
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,690
They were the ones who called the ambulance.

135
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,230
They were her friends.

136
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,600
I’m sorry. I don’t quite understand.

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
They were just playing around.

138
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
They were all in a state of shock

139
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,920
that a woman could be terrified by a group of men chasing her at night.

140
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,230
Of course you don’t think it’s your friends!

141
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
When they saw her running, they tried calling her name.

142
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,720
But it was too late.

143
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,890
It was an accident.

144
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,030
I’m here with your cake.

145
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,130
Thanks. Just pass it in here.

146
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,110
In…where?

147
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,560
Are you okay?

148
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,130
I just need to have my cake in a safe, white place today.

149
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,730
Did something happen?

150
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,370
I had a very upsetting conference call with Kate Hudson’s people.

151
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,130
It’s unbelievably demeaning to have these little girls in their $800 shoes

152
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,930
who grew up watching music videos telling me what a movie is.

153
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,430
I’ve been in this business for 20 years.

154
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,730
I’ve worked with Stallone, Ellen Barkin, Melanie fucking Griffith!

155
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,380
My work is everything to me! I haven’t even had a life!

156
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,530
No, I’m on the fuckin’ set, dealing with everyone else’s crisis!

157
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,680
Roping in the director, firing the writer, wrangling the star!

158
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
And who takes care of me?

159
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,800
Who even wants to take care of me?

160
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,880
That sounds really hard.

161
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,850
Uch, it’s so bright out here!

162
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,270
Careful, Lisa! These sheets are new from Pratesi!

163
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,270
Do you have your cake towel?

164
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,830
It’s in here.

165
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,200
Okay, I’ll come back later for the cake plate.

166
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
I still need my poopy shake at two.

167
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,070
Right.

168
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,160
Lisa, honey? Your husband’s car was parked again in the driveway last night.

169
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,760
I don’t think he understands how much of a problem this is.

170
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,360
He came home so late, I’m sure he just thought you wouldn’t need to get out.

171
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
What if I did, though?

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
You would’ve called us.

173
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,460
No, I don’t want to bother you in your private time at home! No!

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,260
- I’ll tell him.
- It’s not that challenging to find street parking!

175
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,040
Is it a snake? Or some kind of tropical vine?

176
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,330
It’s kind of a combination of Maori Ta Moko

177
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,030
and also Japanese Kanji for, like, inner wisdom, I think.

178
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,030
This, right here.

179
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,830
Oh, my!

180
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,750
I thought you were going to an interview.

181
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,550
I decided that job wasn’t really me.

182
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,020
Well, there’s eggs and bacon in the fridge, and I think there are still some frozen waffles.

183
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,270
Yeah, they’ve been there since like 1992.

184
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,280
That’s not true! They’re perfectly fresh.

185
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,980
I’ll take a waffle.

186
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,280
Let’s say…you’ve just met someone,

187
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,530
a month or so ago, and after a few weeks of exchanging messages,

188
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,650
you finally get together for a nice activity, like a hike, for example,

189
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,150
and you have a delightful time, and you think the other person did too.

190
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,050
How long would you wait to call the person to set up another date?

191
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,870
Who called who first?

192
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,360
Is this another boyfriend?

193
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,460
No, it is not! And I don’t appreciate that tone.

194
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,590
I did originally.

195
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,690
Wait. It’s his turn.

196
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,580
It’s really bad to be, like, begging for it.

197
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,340
The waffles are in the toaster. Nice to meet you, dear.

198
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,730
You don’t want to eat those. I can make you some toast.

199
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,830
That’s okay. I’ll grab something on the way to work.

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,230
Oh, do you want to see “A Clockwork Orange” tomorrow night?

201
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,630
I’ve never seen it, and Russell says it’s like mandatory viewing for all humans.

202
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,220
I can’t. We’re playing at The Snell.

203
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,450
Really? What time do you guys go on?

204
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,050
We probably won’t start till, like, 11…

205
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,940
But it may not be that fun for you.

206
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,340
I have these other friends coming who you don’t know…

207
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,040
So, can’t I meet them?

208
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,090
I don’t…think you really want to.

209
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,650
But Friday’s awesome, if you want to see the movie then.

210
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,450
No, it’s only tomorrow. Friday’s “Eyes Wide Shut. ”

211
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,950
Do you want to see that?

212
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,140
I did.

213
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,970
Okay, so…we’ll do something else.

214
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,290
“Private balconies, invigorating pool and Jacuzzis, gourmet cuisine,

215
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,960
and an array of activities are just some of the pleasures

216
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,220
awaiting our guests at the romantic refuge that is Los Lomos. ”

217
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
I hope there’s shuffleboard.

218
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,220
I’m serious!

219
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,830
They had it at this place in Santa Barbara my parents used to take us when we were kids.

220
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,130
I really had a knack for it.

221
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,230
It’s the only thing I could ever beat Nate at.

222
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,170
“The picturesque village nearby offers visitors sophisticated restaurants,

223
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,370
art galleries, antique and specialty shops. ”

224
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,470
I just want to sit by the pool and drink Pina Coladas all day.

225
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,210
“If you like Pina Coladas,

226
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,230
and getting caught in the… Whoops!

227
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,420
Does that count?

228
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,820
- Yes, it does.
- But I stopped!

229
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,220
- You owe me a dollar!
- I stopped!

230
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,820
All right, 50 cents.

231
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,470
I should get a dollar every time you say the word “calorie” or “carb. ”

232
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,870
How often do I say those?

233
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,670
A lot! More than I sing.

234
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,070
I don’t think so.

235
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,030
- Whatcha doin’?
- Pumping.

236
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,990
Thanks for helping me feel even sexier than I already do at this moment.

237
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,640
You’re crazy.

238
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,340
You couldn’t be more beautiful. You’re like a fountain of life.

239
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,150
Is she still sleeping?

240
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,400
What, Carol slip in here and give her some cognac?

241
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Hardly. She missed her early nap because I had to use the blender all morning.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,400
- Where did you park?
- In the street.

243
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,680
And she could’ve totally gotten out this morning.

244
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,380
Of course. The reality is,

245
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,080
she has trouble driving in reverse, so it makes her nervous having cars in the driveway.

246
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,380
she just doesn’t want people to think she drives an American car.

247
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,980
Whatever. Let’s do our part for peace.

248
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,910
“Hi, homos! ”

249
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,110
“That’s my son! You can’t have him! ”

250
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,610
“Fudgepackers! ”

251
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,710
“Pillow biters! ”

252
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,710
“God, I thought this was a family place! ”

253
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,810
“Butt pirates! ”

254
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,110
“Twinkle toes! ”

255
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,710
“Faggoty- ass faggots! ”

256
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,930
Here’s some shade for you right here, honey.

257
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,840
Oh, don’t worry about him! He can sleep through a dirty bomb!

258
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,430
- You don’t have to get up.
- Please, I need the exercise.

259
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,930
All we’ve done since we’ve gotten here is eat, and the food’s not even that good.

260
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh, that’s too bad.

261
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,750
But I heard the girl who does the aqua hip- hop class is terrific!

262
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,950
If you can get yourself into the pool at 7:30 in the morning.

263
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,550
- Thanks for the tip.
- I’m Sheila, by the way.

264
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,180
Hi.

265
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,930
Hey, smile!

266
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,310
So you ready for your Pina Colada?

267
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,510
God, no. Then they’ll really know we’re gay!

268
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,910
We can’t have that.

269
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,410
I just think people here are a little uncomfortable with it.

270
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,510
Oh, yeah? Like who? Wasn’t that lady over there nice to you?

271
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,210
Yes, we have an aerobics date tomorrow morning, and then afterwards

272
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,960
we’re all going to the beauty parlor.

273
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,260
I’ll just take a beer. Not Lite.

274
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,170
- Hey, would you mind taking a picture of us?
- No problem.

275
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,810
Smile!

276
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,940
Oh, no, I’m glad you called. I was on the verge of getting an impulse haircut!

277
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,640
Those never work out.

278
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,240
Who do you use? I have to find someone new.

279
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,840
I just go to Supercuts.

280
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,840
You can’t do that! Bettina!

281
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,900
A woman’s hair is the gateway to her sensuality.

282
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,410
Not the hair on her head, honey!

283
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,220
What do you think?

284
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,370
- I think you should try it on.
- No, no, it’s for you.

285
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,960
that’s not exactly my style.

286
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:30,040
Sweetie, I say this with a heart full of love, but your style could use a tiny shot of adrenaline.

287
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I like a classic look.

288
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,440
Try it. Just for fun.

289
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,370
Niiiice!

290
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,070
I don’t know. Isn’t it a little trendy?

291
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,370
Are you kidding me? It’s perfect!

292
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,680
And 30% off!

293
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,090
Okay, now try the gold silk number.

294
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,830
I’m so psyched for Valerie Doane. Her sculpture is amazing.

295
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,430
You didn’t hear? She’s not coming this semester.

296
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,730
What do you mean? That’s the whole reason I took this course!

297
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah, I know. You and everybody. But she got some kind of travel grant,

298
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,000
so she’s in Israel and now we have some other guy coming.

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,100
That sucks! This place is fucking lame!

300
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,720
It’s just one class.

301
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,920
I know, but nothing’s turning out to be as good as it looked in the catalog.

302
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
Who’s this other guy?

303
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,740
Oliver Something Something.

304
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
It’s Olivier Castro- Staal.

305
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,740
He’s supposed to be awesome.

306
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,940
Really? ‘Cause I heard he was kind of on his own trip.

307
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,640
Well, Valerie Doane is incoherent.

308
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,740
I took a seminar with her at BAMF. It was garbage.

309
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,690
Was that him?

310
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,180
This is the wrong room!
Are you here for “Form in Space”?

311
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,280
This is the right room.

312
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,780
It’s supposed to be a studio class.

313
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,480
The catalog said “lecture. ”

314
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Well, that’s bullshit.

315
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I don’t do lectures, so this is going to be a studio class.

316
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,670
If anyone needs a lecture for whatever reason people have for these things, then go now.

317
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,270
I won’t be offended.

318
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,470
Oh, you can just talk.

319
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,870
Um…I need a lecture to balance out my course load.

320
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,170
Okay.

321
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,690
We’re going to make art in this class.

322
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,710
And in the end, I’ll put “lecture” on the forms for people who need lecture

323
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,710
and “studio” on the forms for people who need studio. And that’s it.

324
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,230
If this upsets your sense of order, then you can go now. I won’t be offended.

325
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,750
But go now, so we don’t have to deal with ambivalence in this room.

326
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,750
Ambivalence is poison for art.

327
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,550
If I ever see anyone tormented over some decision, this way or that way,

328
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,250
I will be offended and I will throw you out, for the sake of the class.

329
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,350
Good. That was a bad vibe.

330
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,690
Okay, there are no easels in this stupid room, so everyone get on the floor!

331
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
Get on the floor!

332
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,550
Do you have your drawing pads?

333
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,050
We thought this was a lecture class.

334
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,330
Take one and pass it.

335
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,700
If you have a pencil, you’re lucky. If you only have a pen, you’re luckier.

336
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,790
All right, you have five minutes to draw a picture of the day in your life

337
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,440
that was the most horrible.

338
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,440
Go!

339
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,740
Wait, what do you mean, “ a picture of the day”?

340
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,240
Go, I said!

341
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,640
She juiced yet?

342
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah, just about. Hey, you file that certificate?

343
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,340
Claire’s gonna do it tomorrow.

344
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Stupid kids.

345
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,160
Doesn’t it seem like she really sort of panicked, though?

346
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,490
Maybe something happened to her before…

347
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,350
I don’t know.

348
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,510
You know, Vanessa gets scared all the time.

349
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Even when she’s out with the kids, she gets it.

350
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,220
Ask Lisa.

351
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,620
I’m not sure Lisa gets it that much.

352
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,170
I mean, she doesn’t wear high heels or tight skirts or anything.

353
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,570
Vanessa says she gets it even when she’s wearing her big fat sweatpants.

354
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,770
But, you know, she’s pretty hot.

355
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,770
Lisa’s hot.

356
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,170
Yeah, L- Lisa’s hot. I just

357
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,270
I don’t want to talk about your wife like that.

358
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,670
When does it stop sounding weird that someone’s your wife?

359
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,170
Vanessa felt like my wife already when we were 16 years old.

360
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,030
Hey, listen, Nate,

361
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,230
the first year of marriage, for most people, is the hardest,

362
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,430
especially with a baby on top, too.

363
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,330
That can be tough for anyone.

364
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,840
It’s great.

365
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,910
It is! I’m totally into it!

366
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,210
Alright, I’m just saying…y’know, even if sometimes you’re not.

367
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,450
that’s normal.

368
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,950
I’m into it.

369
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,320
Come in.

370
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,630
Are you feeling better?

371
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,790
You’re a little late with this.

372
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,090
I had to go and get more Psyllium.

373
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,050
Oh, God! The baby’s here.

374
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,450
I’m sorry. We haven’t quite figured out the childcare thing.

375
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,250
I tried to call Nate’s mom, but I guess she was hurt when

376
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,650
I got so angry about the peanut butter,

377
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,650
but it really could have made Maya sick—

378
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,450
Sweetie, I’m sorry. You know I love your little girl, and Nate’s fine.

379
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,050
But I just, I can’t get into all this.

380
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,550
Okay. Let’s talk about dinner.

381
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,480
Marlo’s assistant said she is only eating raw foods at the moment.

382
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,580
I really feel...that you are not being sensitive...to me at all.

383
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,620
I’m sorry. I thought you wanted to talk about dinner.

384
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,820
God, Lisa! I mean,

385
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,620
I’ve obviously had a very difficult morning, and you’re all about your own agenda.

386
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,520
I didn’t mean…

387
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,320
You’re rushing me through the menu so you can go deal with your baby.

388
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,720
She’s fine. I don’t have to deal with her at all right now.

389
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,420
Well, I really felt it earlier when I was in a lot of pain,

390
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,050
but the baby was crying, and that was clearly your priority.

391
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,450
No one was watching her.

392
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,750
That is not my problem!

393
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,670
When I hired you for this job, you were totally unencumbered.

394
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,970
And now, now there’s Nate and his dirty car and the...her! And her needs, and...

395
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,530
Nate and the baby have not affected my cooking at all.

396
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,330
They have affected your ability to support me emotionally!

397
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,230
And you live in my house!!

398
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,830
What do you suggest I do? Put Maya up for adoption?

399
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,490
Oh, I’ve discussed this with my therapist,

400
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,790
and she’s very concerned by the way that I allow you to treat me, because—

401
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,790
Oh my God!

402
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,990
…I require, and I fucking deserve, a lot more attention, and you know what?

403
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,190
I will not feel ashamed about that!

404
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,790
If I had known you were hiring me to be your fucking wet nurse,

405
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,890
I would’ve asked for health insurance!

406
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,690
Where are you going? Lisa? Lisa?

407
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,490
Lisa, goddammit!!!

408
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,420
The moment was of when my friend ODed.

409
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,590
Write down on a piece of paper your favorite artist.

410
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,440
In fact, everyone do this.

411
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Is it Kandinsky?

412
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,370
Let’s see.

413
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,230
Because you’re using Kandinsky’s language here. It’s the same with most of these drawings.

414
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,480
We despise ourselves so much that we consider our own point of view as trivial,

415
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,580
but that’s bullshit! That’s your father talking,

416
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,180
or whatever bad teachers you had before me.

417
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,620
You, with the red hair, who did you write? Hopper?

418
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,210
No. I wrote Modigliani.

419
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,410
Were you lying?

420
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,310
No, but I also wrote Nan Goldin, because I’m really more into photography—

421
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,210
When did you see the Hopper show at MOCA?

422
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,850
- Last week.
- Okay, that’s exactly what I’m saying.

423
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,150
She sees 50 paintings by Hopper, she starts to draw like him,

424
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,150
because it’s easier than drawing from the eye inside.

425
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,140
Yeah, but artists get influenced by art. That’s part of the process.

426
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,140
Until you locate the inside eye, it’s all bullshit.

427
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,640
It’s like a coloring book.

428
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,440
Every work you make has to be a surprise to the Earth,

429
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
a seeing that never happened before.

430
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,940
Because it’s what happens when exactly what is inside of you

431
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,840
confronts exactly what is outside of you.

432
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,070
Okay, next.

433
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,190
Definitely! And the black suit, and the cocktail dress.

434
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,990
Oh, I’m not buying anything.

435
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,290
- Why not?
- Nothing was perfect.

436
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,970
Nothing in life is perfect.

437
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,370
Well, that makes it easy to stay within a budget.

438
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,900
If you don’t buy this black suit, I’m gonna buy it for you!

439
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,850
That is the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard! But I’d just return it and give you the money.

440
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,980
Fine! I’m gonna go back for the sandals.

441
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,470
Where did you find this?

442
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,170
Oh, just leave that there. They’ll take care of it for you.

443
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,870
I know, but it seems so rude.

444
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,040
Wonderful color for you!

445
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,340
How much?

446
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,680
Too much.

447
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,440
What are you doing?

448
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,240
It’s one of my little pleasures.

449
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,160
It’s only fair. If they’re gonna charge $350 for a piece of fabric that costs $20 to make,

450
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,860
they should lose a few! Do you want one?

451
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I certainly do not!

452
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,260
It would be a great help to me if you tried to look a little less suspicious.

453
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,450
Fortunately, women our age are invisible, so we can really get away with murder.

454
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,040
What?

455
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,430
I don’t want to go to this stupid fiesta barbecue.

456
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,460
Oh, come on, it’ll be fun.

457
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,060
What’s fun about standing around a pool with a bunch of straight people shaking maracas?

458
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,740
There’s gonna be a mariachi band.

459
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,840
Why can’t there be just one other gay couple?

460
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,140
Some lesbians from the Bay Area?

461
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,320
Hey, that kid in the pool was gay.

462
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,330
The 11- year- old?

463
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,670
Oh, David, relax! You’re letting this matter too much.

464
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,870
Well, I’m sorry, but sometimes I just get exhausted by the running commentary

465
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,070
in my head all day long about how to be.

466
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,050
“Is this shirt too tight? ”
“Is that gesture too flamboyant? ”

467
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,350
“Who am I offending just by being here? ”

468
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,750
Maybe you’re beyond all that, but I would’ve thought you’d at least understand.

469
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,070
It would just be nice on vacation to not have to deal with that.

470
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,270
So don’t. Offend people! Who cares? We paid for our room, right?

471
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,070
I can’t just turn it on and off.

472
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,870
Well, maybe you should try.

473
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,970
No one gets a break from their reality, ya know?

474
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,540
Mexican food gives me the runs.

475
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,140
And what about what Frank said?

476
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,660
It makes me feel like I have the runs.

477
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,660
No, about us being less isolated.

478
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,290
I’m not doing a limbo contest.

479
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,550
- That’s Hawaiian.
- Well, good.

480
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,550
But if there is one, you’d be a fool not to enter it. You know you’d win that thing.

481
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,550
It makes you look 20. Get it.

482
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,950
Do I want to look 20?

483
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,150
Okay, it makes you look 30!

484
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,600
For $15, I could buy a bag of groceries.

485
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Oh, yeah? But a bag of groceries doesn’t make you want to look at yourself!

486
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,570
Excuse me? Excuse me? I’d like to get this.

487
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,640
“Flirtation. ” Let me see if we have any left. It’s very popular.

488
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,350
We may be out.

489
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,430
Oh, she found it!

490
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,230
No, no, sorry, wrong one. Keep looking.

491
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
We’re all sold out.

492
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh, all right then. Thank you so much.

493
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,700
Bye.

494
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,590
David! Salsa! Come on!

495
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,190
Well, what do we want to do for dinner? Go to that cheesy town?

496
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,690
It’s just a bunch of outlet malls and chain restaurants.

497
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,690
The room service menu looked like heaven.

498
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,930
Good, let’s go.

499
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,830
And if we don’t have to drive, we can get really drunk!

500
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,200
What’s going on?

501
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,300
I quit. We have to move.

502
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa…what?

503
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,570
I would rather live on the street and beg for rice with a bowl

504
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,770
than spend one more night under this roof!

505
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,230
All right, what, what happened?

506
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,640
She just unleashed so much insanity at us.

507
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,680
It’s not good for Maya to be around that kind of hostile dementia.

508
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,560
If that’s what I’d wanted for her, I’d be living with my mother!

509
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,670
I’m not sure Maya’s really that in touch with—

510
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,670
She’s very absorbent!

511
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,070
Okay.

512
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,430
I kind of wish we could have talked this through before you quit.

513
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Did you actually quit?

514
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,080
Yes, I actually quit! We have to leave tomorrow morning!

515
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,120
So, what were you thinking, that we’d go stay at my mom’s, I guess?

516
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,130
Well, yeah, for now.

517
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,730
It’s not the worst thing that could ever happen, is it?

518
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,730
No.

519
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
It’s not the best thing that ever happened either.

520
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I’m sorry. I snapped. My humanity just rose up.

521
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,020
Come here.

522
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,120
It’s alright.

523
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,470
OH MY GOD!!!

524
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,270
These walls are like paper.

525
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,950
So fucking what? We’re on vacation, dammit!

526
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,250
YEAH, WE’RE GAY IN HERE!!!

527
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,100
COME ON, COWBOY!! BRING IT ON HOME!!! WA- HOO!!

528
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,100
WE’RE HAVING SOME HOT MAN- ON- MAN LOVE ACTION!!

529
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,350
HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH!!!

530
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,710
Hold it, hold it, hold it. You sing, I sing.

531
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:22,810
BABY, EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT/UPTIGHT, OUT OF SIGHT

532
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,940
I’M A POOR MAN’S SON FROM ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS

533
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,240
THE ONLY SHIRT I HAVE IS HANGING ON MY BACK

534
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,840
BUT I’M THE ENVY OF EV’RY SINGLE GUY

535
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,140
’CAUSE I’M THE APPLE OF MY MAN’S EYE

536
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,140
HE SAYS BABY, EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT…

537
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,810
Oh, you’re losing your pillow.

538
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,840
Oh, dammit!

539
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Would you be careful?

540
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,240
Sorry.

541
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,640
Lisa, you’re carrying too much.

542
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,540
It’s fine. I just didn’t realize how tall it was.

543
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,310
I don’t know how much of David’s furniture you need,

544
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,010
but he has some lovely pieces stored in the garage.

545
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,010
We don’t really have anything, just that rocking chair…

546
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,090
It’s a much better space than Carol’s. It’s bigger.

547
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,140
Yeah. There’s no kitchen.

548
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,140
I told Lisa, you’re welcome to cook in the house whenever you’d like.

549
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,440
Thanks.

550
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,940
It won’t be for too long, Ruth.

551
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,640
I’m happy to have you.

552
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,670
Ruth, you can pick her up.

553
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,450
That’s nice lipstick, Mom.

554
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,650
Why, thank you, dear. It’s new.

555
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,360
When you’re done, put down your charcoal.

556
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,330
Okay. This is it.

557
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,300
Can you see why this is good?

558
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,910
Because it’s in her own language.

559
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,410
Yes, but the way I tell if something is good is…

560
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,900
does it make me want to throw up?

561
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,500
This drawing instantly makes me feel nauseous.

562
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,700
You can tell if something is truthful, even if you don’t understand it, if it affects your body.

563
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,270
Your liver and your bowels are more important as an artist than your eyes,

564
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,770
because they are so far away from your brain.

565
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,450
I don’t know. I think it seems kind of obvious.

566
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,250
Because you’re embarrassed by yourself.

567
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,970
In the beginning, if you hate something, it’s good,

568
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,900
because you don’t recognize the beauty of your own truth.

569
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,500
You’re used to being a normal, pathetic human who does only what other people want.

570
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,970
But what the other people really want is to fuck you

571
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,730
and to make money off of you and to hang you in the living room with the fancy security system.

572
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:34,070
Like this! Who did you make this to please? Me? Your mother, your boyfriend?

573
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,110
Does anyone feel sick from this?

574
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,880
No! So who the fuck cares?

575
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,850
I’m a friend of Callie’s.

576
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,770
And I was there, the night…she died.

577
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,250
I wanted to speak, because I really loved her,

578
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,750
and I wanted to talk about who she was to me…and to us.

579
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,060
Which is this brave, brazen, totally heroic person.

580
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,610
This rock climbing, body surfing, back talking, truth- or- dare champion.

581
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:36,210
I never even once saw her scared…before.

582
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,300
I guess what I really want to say to her is…

583
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,700
we were just pretending to be this thing that we’re not,

584
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,000
I don’t think, and then she was this thing that she’s not…

585
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,690
I’m sorry.

586
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,240
But when she saw that it was us, she had this look like,

587
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
“How could this be you? ”

588
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,700
Mrs. Mortimer?

589
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,930
I’m sorry, but…I just didn’t know what to say.

590
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,590
What?

591
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,690
The mother, Mrs. Mortimer, y’know? I just—I don’t—I didn’t know what to say to her.

592
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,490
You didn’t really have to say anything. I didn’t.

593
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,190
Yeah, but, like…hug her? Don’t hug her, y’know? I freeze up.

594
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,990
You can’t think about it. You just have to really be there with them. Just…be present.

595
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,740
I don’t think I can.

596
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,680
Sure you can.

597
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,220
No. Downstairs, y’know, it’s just a body.

598
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,600
But up here, like this young girl, y’know, she’s someone’s sister and someone’s daughter,

599
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,500
and I can’t help but to think, “Well, what if it was Julio?

600
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,100
Or Vanessa, even? ”

601
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,200
Y’know, and I just can’t…

602
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,260
You don’t ever think, “What if it was Maya? What if it was Lisa? ”

603
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,560
I don’t, actually.

604
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,410
Not them.

605
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,510
I can’t bring them in here with me, ya know?

606
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,410
I just want them to be what’s good about life. That way I can come here and deal with what isn’t.

607
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,600
That way I can come here and deal with what isn’t.

608
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,300
Well, you’re lucky, then.

609
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,810
So how’d it go last night?

610
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,710
Awesome. I mean, we screwed up a lot, but no one noticed.

611
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,620
It was fucking loud.

612
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,920
Everyone was walking around with, like, cocktail napkins in their ears.

613
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,770
So, listen,

614
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,670
I kind of want to talk about this whole “seeing other people” thing.

615
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,790
I’m not that into it.

616
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,980
I mean…it makes me feel weird, you know, it’s like…

617
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,660
if people are into each other, then that should be pretty much enough, y’know?

618
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,660
At some point, yeah.

619
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,570
What do you mean?

620
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,570
Like when it gets really serious or whatever.

621
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,070
Well, when does that usually happen for you?

622
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,370
It depends.

623
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,470
Okay. Well, how about, like, after a couple of months?

624
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,090
You mean like us, now?

625
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,710
Yeah.

626
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,310
I don’t know.

627
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,640
I mean, do you?

628
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,920
Well, yeah, that’s what I’m saying.

629
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,250
It’s just not really my thing to like sleep around.

630
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,250
I’m not sleeping around.

631
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:46,800
I just mean, I’m kind of a like one- at- a- time sexual person, I think.

632
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:55,490
So…what do you think?

633
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,350
I don’t think I’m there.

634
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,850
Just not at this exact point in time.

635
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,550
Well, why not? Is it ‘cause you like someone else better?

636
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,050
No! So totally not!

637
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,190
It’s just…it kind of has to be more organic for me,

638
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,090
like not some kind of contract or whatever.

639
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,090
It has to evolve.

640
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,140
But I’m not saying it won’t.

641
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,750
It so totally could.

642
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,650
Well, not for me. Not when it’s like

643
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,850
“You can’t come hear me play because there’s some other girl that’s gonna be there. ”

644
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,500
Yeah.

645
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,100
So…that’s like it for you?

646
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,680
I guess.

647
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,930
Well, can I have a hug or something?

648
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,010
No. I’m just gonna go.

649
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,030
Hey, what are you doing?

650
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Nothing. Just watching this.

651
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,980
Okay, but you can watch with us.

652
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,480
Isn’t Maya sleeping?

653
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,580
Yeah, but she doesn’t mind the TV, if it’s low, and I have a million things I need to ask you.

654
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,100
Like what?

655
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,700
Like, when do you want to do the child- proofing?

656
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,100
And how should we deal with Maya while I look for a job?

657
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,000
Because I don’t even know how to start thinking about—

658
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Then don’t. Not yet, just take a break. We’re not paying rent.

659
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,800
Yeah, but we can’t stay here forever.

660
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Not forever, but we can relax for a few days, can’t we?

661
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,750
Oh, also I need to talk to you about vaccinating.

662
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:39,850
I’ve downloaded a ton of information from the Internet, and I’m still really against it, but..

663
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,950
you haven’t really weighed in. God knows your mother wants it.

664
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,900
Okay, print it out. I’ll take a look at it later tonight.

665
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,590
Are you coming?

666
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,180
Uh, okay, yeah.

667
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,530
I do, I want to hear it!

668
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,350
Elton John’s “Rocket Man. ”

669
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,950
“I miss the Earth so much,
I miss my life. ”

670
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,250
“Miss my life. ”

671
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,150
“It’s lonely out in space. ”

672
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,950
That’s me!

673
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,650
You sound good.

674
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,250
Yes, I happen to have a very nice voice.

675
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,450
Well, did I ever say you didn’t?

676
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,750
Well, practically.

677
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,150
I just don’t like it when you sing at me.

678
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,710
“And I think it’s gonna be a long, long time

679
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,110
Till touchdown brings me round again to find.

680
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,710
“I’m not the man they think I am at home

681
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,490
Oh, I’m a rocket man

682
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,920
Rocket man, burning out a fuse up here alone. ”

683
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, shit! We’re supposed to be going against traffic.

684
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,410
There might be an accident.

685
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,470
It looks like it might be picking up.

686
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,470
Not much.

687
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,210
Who knows when we’re gonna get home now?

688
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,910
I knew we shouldn’t have stopped for food.

689
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,010
It’s lucky we did. We’re going to get home too late to make anything now.

690
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,050
It’s not my fault!

691
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,850
You had to spend an hour at the Mikasa outlet store.

692
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,860
And I gotta do laundry tonight. My uniform stinks.

693
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,410
I really have to learn this.

694
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,410
These are cold.

695
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:49,290
“And I think it’s gonna be a long, long time

696
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,690
Till touchdown brings me round again to find

697
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,190
I’m not the man they think I am at home

698
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,510
Oh, no, I’m a rocket man…”

699
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,470
