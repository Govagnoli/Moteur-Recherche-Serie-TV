1
00:01:57,173 --> 00:02:01,610
Vance, I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got no fucking appetite lately.

2
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:05,092
-That's a sign of depression.
-Really?

3
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,845
Oh, yeah. I've been reading up on it.

4
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,767
Ever since my wife's hysterectomy,
she's been real down in the dumps.

5
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:14,085
Loss of appetite, loss of sex drive...

6
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:18,451
feelings of hopelessness and despair,
no energy. All of which she has.

7
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:21,202
I only got the loss of appetite thing.

8
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,643
You know what is depressing?

9
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,568
My wife's cooking. Here.

10
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,805
What the fuck is that? It looks like cat shit.

11
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,770
I think it is cat shit.

12
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,569
She's fucking useless in the kitchen.
She always has been.

13
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:47,929
-At least your wife still fucks you.
-Thank God.

14
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:51,287
If she didn't do that, I'd have to kill her.

15
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,408
Shit!

16
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,492
Oh, fuck!

17
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:58,641
Fuck me.

18
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,645
This is fucked!

19
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,692
Fucking fuck!

20
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:24,522
-It's kind of beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's way beautiful.

21
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,811
You add the sunset factor, it'll be perfect.

22
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,607
There's horseshit everywhere.

23
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:31,922
So?

24
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,168
So isn't it gonna mess up your white dress?

25
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,972
Yeah, like I'm gonna wear a white dress.

26
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:43,283
Besides, if we exchange vows
surrounded by horseshit...

27
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,364
it'd be kind of fitting.

28
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,567
Meaning you think us getting married
is a shitty idea?

29
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:52,123
Meaning we're going into this open-eyed,
shit and all.

30
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,801
And hopefully,
my mother will step in some of it.

31
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:59,569
Or even better, fall face first into it, and then
it really will be the happiest day of my life.

32
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:03,444
Are you sure you want to marry me?
We can still call it off.

33
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,489
Of course I want to marry you.

34
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,404
But I could die, Bren.

35
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,362
I mean, I could die any day.
I could die any moment.

36
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,250
Yeah, and I couldn't?

37
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:14,690
Yeah, we're all gonna die, I know...

38
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:18,243
but the chances of it actually happening
are significantly higher for me.

39
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,893
That's just a fucking fact.
And the last thing I want...

40
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,407
is for you to marry me
because you feel sorry for me.

41
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:25,688
You really think I'd do that?

42
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,441
You've made enough sacrifices in your life
without having to go through some...

43
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,364
I'm marrying you because I love you.

44
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:39,208
You're the first man I thought I could
stand to spend the rest of my life with.

45
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:43,047
Or the rest of your life,
if it's tragically cut short or whatever.

46
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:47,046
You're not some car I want to trade in
because it has faulty transmission.

47
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:50,045
Jesus, do you really think I'm that shallow?

48
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:51,688
Of course not.

49
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,968
All we have is this moment...

50
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,123
right here, right now.

51
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,726
The future is just a fucking concept
that we use...

52
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:03,611
to avoid being alive today.

53
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,402
So...

54
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,609
be here...

55
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,722
now.

56
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,286
So why do we need
to get married at all then?

57
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:26,003
So we can rack up all that free shit from
all my mother's wealthy friends, that's why.

58
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:31,732
Hey, I know this really cool rabbi
who can possibly do our wedding.

59
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:33,371
-A rabbi?
-Yeah.

60
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,572
-Why would you even go there?
-You are half-Jewish.

61
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:40,328
Yeah, I'm also half-Catholic.
So you wanna invite the Pope?

62
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:43,366
It's a marriage. It's a sacred occasion.

63
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,088
You'd rather have
just some civil servant there?

64
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,927
Personally, I think the two of us
should be enough to make it sacred.

65
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,804
Hey, did you sleep okay?

66
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:02,762
No.

67
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:07,608
I finally dozed off around 5:00.

68
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,410
Keith, go back to bed.

69
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:15,212
I'm not gonna sleep anymore, believe me.

70
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,401
Maybe you should talk to your doctor
about medication.

71
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,563
Yeah, drugs, that's the answer.

72
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:27,441
You're right. Suffering when you don't
have to, that's much more constructive.

73
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,171
-Idiot.
-Fuck you.

74
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:32,604
Is there any more coffee?

75
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:37,290
I really don't think you should be drinking
caffeine when your sleep is so erratic.

76
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,446
Suit yourself.

77
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,407
Bitch.

78
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,124
Taylor left her gummy vitamins.

79
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,408
Big surprise. She hated those.

80
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,330
I should run these over to Karla.

81
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:13,328
Okay, no. Karla can get her more vitamins.
You could probably use a little space now.

82
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:16,929
Yeah, well, I need to make sure
Karla's staying clean.

83
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:20,210
You need to take care of yourself
right now, okay?

84
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,964
That's what you're for.

85
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:29,290
I see. So, basically, I just exist to serve you.

86
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,491
Well, yeah.

87
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:37,361
-You're gonna make me late for work.
-That's your problem.

88
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:53,087
There are two chicken-salad sandwiches
in here. They're for your lunch.

89
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,845
And don't eat them before noon...

90
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,608
because you'll have to wait
until I get home from work to eat again.

91
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,492
What are these things supposed to be?

92
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,091
Have a nice day.

93
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:12,761
Are we really supposed to believe
Britney Spears is a virgin?

94
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,088
Why exactly are we supposed to care?

95
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:19,442
I'd like for you to do me a favor
and check on Nikolai when you get home.

96
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,603
I won't be home until late.

97
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:25,049
-Parker and I have plans.
-I thought you and Parker had a falling-out.

98
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,486
We made up.

99
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:30,771
I figured it was better to have a loser
for a friend than to have no friends at all.

100
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,162
Well, what are you doing with her?

101
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,684
We're going to the Getty.

102
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,849
Do you think I'm an idiot?

103
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,925
No, of course not.

104
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:45,808
It's not like I'm lying
to cover up my drug habit.

105
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,852
I'm lying to get out of having to empty
the bedpan of the man you're sleeping with.

106
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,605
I don't feel I should have to do that.

107
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,412
For God's sake,
that's not what I'm asking you to do.

108
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,608
Good.

109
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,684
You have absolutely no idea
how easy you have it.

110
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:04,125
Please tell me you're not gonna start talking
about your legless grandmother again.

111
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:05,965
I pity you, Claire.

112
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:09,848
You are under the mistaken impression
that life owes you something.

113
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,925
Well, you're in for
some very harsh surprises.

114
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:24,847
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was unbelievable.
Are they here yet?

115
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,844
Yeah, they're waiting in the Wisteria Room.

116
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,209
-Dave, I've got something I need to ask you.
-What?

117
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,324
What's with the red face?

118
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:39,731
Keith and I were fooling around,
and, well, he hadn't shaved.

119
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,692
You big whore.

120
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,650
-Is it really bad?
-No.

121
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:47,123
Actually, it's bright red.
It's red as a baboon's ass.

122
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:49,807
Oh, my God! I look like a burn victim.

123
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:57,127
What I wanted to ask was
if you'd be best man at my wedding.

124
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,002
-Of course I will.
-Excellent.

125
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,851
-All right, you ready to roll?
-Yeah.

126
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,492
Good Lord.

127
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,848
So, Dad already took care of everything?

128
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:21,251
It's all specified in the pre-need contract.

129
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,887
For the viewing,
he's chosen a Parliament casket...

130
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,726
followed by a cremation and internment
at Cedar Grove...

131
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:30,044
in the remaining chamber
of a prayer-level double crypt.

132
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,727
-With Mom?
-Harriet Mitchell Garrison?

133
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,366
That's her.

134
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,326
So there's nothing for us to do.

135
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,683
All you have to do is show up.

136
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,288
Okay.

137
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,932
Oh, my God!

138
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,889
I feel so awful.

139
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,288
I can't remember
the last time that I saw him.

140
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:00,611
Honey, it's okay.

141
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,610
He knew we loved him.

142
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:08,765
I can give you the number
of a great dermatologist.

143
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,962
-What up, Uncle Keith?
-Hey, you forgot these at my house.

144
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,283
I hate these nasty old things.

145
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,565
-They're good for you.
-I like the Flintstones.

146
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,211
Shouldn't you be in school?

147
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,046
Mama's sick. I'm staying home today
to take care of her.

148
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,647
Hey. Don't come too close to me.
I got the flu.

149
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,043
You got the flu.
Have you been to see the doctor?

150
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:45,764
I ain't paying nobody's doctor $100
just to tell me to stay in bed. Fuck that shit.

151
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:52,131
-You don't have a temperature.
-Are you sure?

152
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,926
Maybe you should stick a thermometer
up my ass.

153
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,201
Go play in your room.

154
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:01,091
No, honey, Taylor. You stay here.
Mama needs you.

155
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,202
Go.

156
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,244
You've got a choice to make.

157
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,642
You can either let me
check you into a drug rehab...

158
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,612
I already told you. I went to rehab
in Oakland. I am clean. What the fuck?

159
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:20,163
I'll call the station, we'll search this house,
and if we find anything...

160
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,721
you'll face charges. You got that?
It's your choice.

161
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,771
You sound just like Daddy, you know that?
You know that?

162
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:29,482
You done gone and turned into Daddy!
What are you gonna do next?

163
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:33,122
Slap me so hard I can't hear out of one ear
for the next day-and-a-half?

164
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,851
You remember that?

165
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,964
It's your choice, Karla.

166
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:44,646
God damn it.

167
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,692
You need help. I can get you help.

168
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:53,281
I'll find you the best help there is.
I swear to you I will.

169
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,972
I said okay.

170
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:10,169
Okay, but it has to be outpatient.
I'm not leaving Taylor again. So....

171
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,292
No major facial damage. That's a plus.

172
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:30,331
I'm gonna have to do some major plug-ins
on the top of the head here, though.

173
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,404
It's a good thing he's not bald.

174
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,612
Why's that?

175
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,049
It'd be a little hard to wig him...

176
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:43,604
since everybody remembered him
with his head all nice and shiny, you know?

177
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,127
Hello?

178
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,284
Oh, for Christ's sake!

179
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:54,768
I gotta swing by Appleby
and pick up the Parliament.

180
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:57,686
-You probably need some help with that.
-Not really.

181
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,172
Yes, really.

182
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:24,003
Hello? Anyone!

183
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,890
Please, I'm so bored.

184
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,323
That's not my problem, pal.

185
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,325
-He's gotta be driving you crazy.
-Not at all.

186
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,122
Actually, our relationship
has reached a whole new level.

187
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,441
How so?

188
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:44,045
Well, it's not just about the sex anymore.

189
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:48,568
There's more intimacy.
He's letting his guard down.

190
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,609
He's allowing me to see him
at his most vulnerable.

191
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,923
Well, that's great, cupcake.

192
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:00,048
Clarify one thing for me.
He is bedridden, right?

193
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:16,127
Hello? Who is there?

194
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,525
Can you help me?

195
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,085
That depends on what you want.

196
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:35,086
I ate already my lunch, and I am starving.
I cannot walk.

197
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:45,567
She is my favorite, this one. Such a bitch.

198
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,006
She would be a wildcat in love I think.

199
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:55,322
She's the kind that leaves scratch marks
all over your body.

200
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,652
Yeah, but she's, like, 60.

201
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:04,322
Doesn't matter. Besides, I think she's Latin.

202
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,729
They're always hot-blooded.

203
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:12,371
-What kind of sandwich this is?
-Pork.

204
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,290
It is not so good. Needs salt.

205
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:20,207
-If you don't like it, I'll eat it.
-No, I will eat.

206
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,527
It was supposed to be mine anyway.

207
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:30,652
-What happened to your face?
-It's none of your fucking business, pal.

208
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,408
Okay.

209
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,527
Sorry.

210
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,487
I don't understand. I'm his wife.

211
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,412
He should be buried with me.

212
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:49,042
Well, unfortunately,
he stipulated in his pre-need contract...

213
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,203
that he was to be buried
with his former wife.

214
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:55,605
That's gotta be a mistake. He must've made
those arrangements before he married me.

215
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,843
This is dated October of '98.

216
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,567
I never even knew he had done this.

217
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,371
Neither did his daughters.

218
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,731
God, I'm sure they just love it, though.

219
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,364
They've always hated me.

220
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,731
They thought their daddy
was too good for me.

221
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,209
And apparently, so did he.

222
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,684
I'm sure that's not true.

223
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:36,084
So this thing's all signed, sealed,
and paid for?

224
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,849
There's no recourse for me.

225
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,570
Well, actually, it hasn't been paid in full.

226
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:48,767
Really?

227
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,406
You know, he did leave everything to me...

228
00:17:56,093 --> 00:18:00,325
and I hope you don't think I'm gonna
be paying for such a blatant slap in my face.

229
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,883
What the hell is Mom doing in Belize?

230
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:13,888
She's on some sort of cruise
for the recently separated.

231
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,601
Maybe it's for people
who want to quit smoking.

232
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,172
What a freak.

233
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,570
I'm fine with water.

234
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,610
Have you spoken to Dad?

235
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,606
Yeah, right.

236
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:36,723
So what's with you living with her?

237
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,883
Well, it sure beats the hospital.

238
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:47,722
You know, Bren, I still go in
three times a week to see Dr. Hanover.

239
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:48,848
She's great.

240
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,367
-Yeah?
-Yeah, she's a total genius.

241
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,567
She's helped me look at a lot of my shit.

242
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,932
That's good.

243
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,488
Yeah.

244
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:07,966
So, how's Nate?

245
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:12,885
He's not so great.

246
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,370
He was recently diagnosed
with this brain condition...

247
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:23,131
and he's had a couple of seizures, actually.

248
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,129
He could have a stroke.

249
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:29,962
Shit!

250
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33,085
-That sucks.
-Yeah.

251
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,328
Well, now I know why you're marrying him.

252
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:37,687
Fuck you!

253
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,643
Wow, that hit a nerve. Must be true.

254
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,885
No, I'm just a little surprised
at how randomly cruel you can be.

255
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,726
I guess I'd forgotten
what a kick you get out of that.

256
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,882
See, this is what you do.

257
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:52,602
You invalidate anything I say
that might challenge your authority.

258
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:53,968
You learned it from Mom.

259
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,806
The same way that you learned
to explain everything to me...

260
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,726
-like I'm an idiot from Dad.
-No, I learned that from you.

261
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:03,328
Apparently you're still angry at me
for committing you.

262
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:07,688
No. That was the best thing
that could have happened to me.

263
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,288
Then why wouldn't you see me...

264
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,169
or take my calls or e-mail?

265
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:16,811
Because Dr. Hanover suggested...

266
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:19,282
that I might be able
to do more constructive work...

267
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:22,092
if I cut things off with you for a while.

268
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:30,362
Because you have contributed a lot
to my pathology.

269
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:33,729
-You have a medical condition.
-It's not just about pharmaceuticals.

270
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:37,601
I never developed any functional way
to deal with the world...

271
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,009
because you kept me from it.

272
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,125
I've done a real number on you.

273
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,001
You were always there, looking out for me,
protecting me, being strong for me.

274
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,049
I never learned how to take care of myself.

275
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:56,125
I mean, shit, Brenda,
I've never even had a real girlfriend.

276
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,331
I never let you have a girlfriend?
That's really....

277
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:01,732
You fucking asshole!

278
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,769
I thought we could have
a rational discussion.

279
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:05,844
How dare you blame me for that, Billy?

280
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,811
I'm not saying that you did it on purpose.

281
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,613
But I do think we need
to disengage from each other...

282
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:14,526
because our relationship is really toxic.

283
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,408
Okay.

284
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,093
And I don't know how long it needs to last.

285
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,209
Probably a very long time.

286
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:38,607
Maybe.

287
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,172
Anyway...

288
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:49,282
I have somewhere I have to be,
but thank you for the grub.

289
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:13,171
-Hey, you look nice.
-Thanks.

290
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,085
Where you going?

291
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,481
-To meet a friend.
-Billy Chenowith?

292
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:21,922
Yeah.

293
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:25,490
I don't think you should be seeing him.

294
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:28,246
I'll just file that under
"couldn't possibly matter less. "

295
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,130
He can be dangerous.

296
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,922
I can take care of myself, Nate.

297
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:37,252
Okay. Are you armed,
in case he pulls a knife on you?

298
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,087
-How much time have you spent with him?
-How much time have you spent with him?

299
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:45,325
Enough to know he isn't
a drooling psychopath. He's got a disease.

300
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:48,166
He went through a period
where he went off his medication...

301
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:50,892
because he was fucked up
and in denial about it.

302
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:54,010
It's under control now. Sound familiar?

303
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,329
It was very slow at work today.

304
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:06,723
It is because I wasn't there.

305
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,930
-You and Robbie are lazy.
-That is not true.

306
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:16,210
Why, just today I reorganized the ribbons,
I cleaned the inside of the cash register...

307
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:19,524
and I spent a couple of hours
looking at the books.

308
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,527
-That is not your job.
-No, and it's apparently not yours, either.

309
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,844
I've never seen a messier,
more incoherent bookkeeping system.

310
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,286
I thought my husband was bad.

311
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,682
I don't want you messing with my books.

312
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:33,128
This is my personal finances.
None of your business.

313
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,852
May I remind you
that I've been paying your medical bills?

314
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,161
I will pay back.

315
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,562
You're gonna be in big trouble
if you get audited.

316
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:41,689
-That bullshit.
-Language.

317
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:53,642
So, listen, I really wanted to thank you.

318
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,212
For what?

319
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,521
For being the only person
who kept in touch with me...

320
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,207
while I was in
the home for the tragically inappropriate.

321
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:04,045
Are you kidding me?

322
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:08,322
Your e-mails were totally brilliant.
I saved them all.

323
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,166
It was the only thing that kept me going.

324
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:15,051
I know I would never have given me
a second chance...

325
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,045
after the way I treated you
the first time we met.

326
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:23,087
-So, no word from Gabe at all?
-Nada.

327
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:27,368
Which is fine.
Like, seriously, good riddance.

328
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:33,285
It was so obvious he was never gonna
take charge of his life, you know?

329
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,728
Well, it's hard. Few people ever do.

330
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:40,170
Yeah, but most people are able
to avoid becoming drug-addict criminals.

331
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,445
Yeah, most people.

332
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,322
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

333
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:51,931
I'm not sure. Why?

334
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:55,685
Well, I need some help with this project...

335
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:00,011
and there's not really anybody else
I can ask.

336
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:03,683
-Okay.
-Yeah?

337
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:06,082
Cool.

338
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,725
We're back with our exclusive visit...

339
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:36,523
with one of the year's happiest and sexiest
couples, David and Keith Fisher-Charles.

340
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,649
So guys, tell me, how do you do it?

341
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,930
-Well, Leeza, it takes a lot of work.
-It's not that much work.

342
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:43,571
He's right. We've done all the work.

343
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,121
I think people don't appreciate
how important that is.

344
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,168
No, they really don't.

345
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,687
-Now, you've got kids. How many?
-Two.

346
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:54,403
-And we're talking about a third.
-Yeah, we're talking about a third.

347
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:57,166
I think the key is to do everything together...

348
00:25:57,253 --> 00:26:00,802
from PTA meetings
to the White Party in Palm Springs.

349
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:04,488
Togetherness is the key.
We're a partnership. We're a team.

350
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:12,332
-How long have I been asleep?
-About an hour I think.

351
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,048
Shit.

352
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,892
I'm never gonna get back to sleep tonight.

353
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:18,452
Why didn't you wake me up?

354
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,970
Because you're totally sleep-deprived.
You should take it where you can get it.

355
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:29,204
-Are you staying here tonight?
-I was planning on it.

356
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,721
-Would you rather I didn't?
-Maybe.... I don't know.

357
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:36,407
Maybe we're moving a little too fast.

358
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:39,890
Okay. I can go home.

359
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:44,332
I mean, it's just that
we've spent the last six nights together.

360
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:46,449
Yeah, sure, no problem.

361
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,405
Call me tomorrow.

362
00:26:58,173 --> 00:26:59,242
What?

363
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,762
-It's what our father wanted.
-No, it's what you want.

364
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:16,686
-Because you've never liked me.
-Well, you got that right.

365
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,128
You couldn't control your father
when he was alive...

366
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,249
and now you're trying to do it
when he's dead.

367
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,971
It was his decision.

368
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:25,886
There is a significant unpaid balance
on the account.

369
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:26,962
We'll pay for it!

370
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:29,283
Take money from them,
you'll hear from my attorney.

371
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:30,965
I really don't think that's necessary.

372
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:33,886
No? I gave the last six years of my life
to that man...

373
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:36,248
and contrary
to what these stupid bitches think...

374
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,564
I really did love him,
and I will not be humiliated like this!

375
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:43,123
Well, if you do not follow
our father's instructions exactly...

376
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,566
you'll hear from our attorney.

377
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,406
-Who used to work for Disney.
-Bring it on, ferret face!

378
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,848
-Fuck you, you gold-digging slut!
-How dare you!

379
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:53,403
There are naked pictures of you
on the Internet. My son showed them to me.

380
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:56,803
Shut up, all of you! Shut the fuck up!

381
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,689
Jesus Christ, a man died.

382
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,413
Your husband. Your father.

383
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,807
He lived a life, and now he's dead.

384
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:11,605
Show some respect.

385
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,970
And if you really loved him,
and I believe you did...

386
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:18,930
you'll give him what he wanted.

387
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:22,767
If you don't, then you never
really loved him. It's as simple as that.

388
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,292
Thank you.

389
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:31,683
And if I so much as get a phone call
from anybody's lawyer...

390
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,411
we'll give the body back...

391
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:38,089
and the three of you can tear him to pieces
like fucking jackals if you want to.

392
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:40,483
It's not your decision.

393
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:56,442
God!

394
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,528
Oh, my God.

395
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:03,604
Hey, I'm right here, okay?

396
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,082
It's okay.

397
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,963
What happened to me, Keith?

398
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,205
I used to be okay.

399
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:31,008
I used to be able to live
without all this sadness...

400
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,565
without all this...

401
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:39,250
-never having any hope.
-You're here, aren't you?

402
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,892
And my baby...

403
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:45,650
she's so precious.

404
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,611
I am such a bad mother.

405
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:51,730
Hey, look at me. No, you're not.

406
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:53,804
I've seen worse. Believe me, I have.

407
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:57,970
None of it's her fault.

408
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:01,050
She doesn't deserve this.

409
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,973
Look, let's just put it all behind you, okay?

410
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:14,409
I wish we could just start over.

411
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:23,890
-Nate, hi.
-What are you doing here?

412
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,726
I'm just....

413
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,966
Remember when I told you about that movie
producer who was looking for a vegan chef?

414
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,408
I finally caved in and took the job.

415
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,928
-Cool.
-Yeah, finally sold out.

416
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:41,244
-So, you live here now?
-Well, the Palisades.

417
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,248
Since when?

418
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,052
Since right after Christmas.

419
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:52,802
I didn't want to bother you.
You have a whole new life and all.

420
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:54,884
Lisa, come on, we're friends.

421
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:01,170
There's a great juice bar here.
Let's get caught up, okay?

422
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,208
Okay.

423
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:10,322
"Of all the lies we're fed, on which we gorge
in our comfort-addicted world...

424
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:15,406
"none is more insidious
than the lie of romance.

425
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,567
"The seductive but infantile notion...

426
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:23,408
"that somewhere there exists someone
to complement us in every way.

427
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,488
"Someone who will make us complete.

428
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,169
"Of course, this illusion...

429
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:33,611
"keeps us from ever being complete
in and of ourselves...

430
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,724
"and eventually encourages us...

431
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:40,725
"to despise our shortcomings, our flaws...

432
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,090
"everything in which our humanity lies.

433
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:49,683
"Our humanity, without which, of course...

434
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:51,932
"we are nothing. "

435
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:01,046
It's strange. I mean, she's a strict vegan...

436
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,931
but she drinks like a fish
and she does a lot of blow.

437
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:08,165
But she's nice to me, and I needed to make
some real money for a change.

438
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,729
So, what's new with you?

439
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:14,327
Well, not much.
Same old same old, you know.

440
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:18,204
-How's Brenda?
-She's great. We're....

441
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:23,726
We're engaged.

442
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,242
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, I know, it's....

443
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:32,804
-What about you? You seeing anybody?
-No, not really.

444
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,323
By the way, I'm pregnant.

445
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:40,170
-Wow, that's great!
-Yeah. Five months.

446
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:43,925
She's a kicker.

447
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:48,132
Don't worry.
I don't expect anything from you.

448
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:51,250
-I don't expect anything at all.
-Lisa, I don't....

449
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,848
Don't you remember when you came
to Seattle last August and you fucked me?

450
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,845
Then you left the next day
like it didn't mean a goddamn thing?

451
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,925
It did mean something to you
'cause you were crying like a baby.

452
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,526
That's not the reason I was crying.

453
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,844
You were crying 'cause you knew
you were home. Because you missed me.

454
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:10,006
Because you knew that you and I
should be together. Then you fucked me.

455
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,848
Then you chickened out the next day
and I saw you for exactly who you are:

456
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:17,403
A coward who was never going to own up
to the way he really felt about me.

457
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,484
How could you not tell me about this?

458
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:22,133
Because we already went through this
once before.

459
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,125
But this time, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna have it without you.

460
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,202
I don't know...

461
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:29,683
Congratulations, you know,
on the whole getting married thing.

462
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,367
-She must be out of her fucking mind.
-Just give me...

463
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,568
Don't.

464
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,447
Come on in.

465
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:27,249
All right, let me show you.

466
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,721
You can put your purse down if you like.

467
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:34,692
Here it is.

468
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:38,288
This is your focus, and this is your zoom.

469
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:41,645
That's pretty much it.

470
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,486
So here you go.

471
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,685
You'll get a feel for it.

472
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:50,212
Okay, what do you want me to do?

473
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:54,730
Just, you know, follow your instincts.
Relax. Don't think about yourself at all.

474
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:58,844
-I know that's impossible for a 17-year-old.
-Eighteen.

475
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:05,165
What you don't know is you're
going to be 18 for the rest of your life.

476
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,203
I've tried to do self-portraits before...

477
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:23,411
but they always turn out so contrived,
like I'm trying to be some version of myself.

478
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,845
So fucking juvenile.

479
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,606
And I really want to see it, you know?

480
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,412
I want to.

481
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,650
I need to see what I've done.

482
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:40,722
And I think it really is impossible
for somebody to see themselves.

483
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,930
You need someone else's eyes.

484
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,964
I need somebody else to see me.

485
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,051
Somebody who isn't Brenda.

486
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,202
She sees things a little too darkly.

487
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,686
I mean, I don't need any help going there.

488
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:02,532
Besides, I've looked through her eyes
enough for one lifetime, you know.

489
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:08,486
What are you seeing?

490
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,043
I'm on your scar, really close up.

491
00:37:12,853 --> 00:37:14,445
What does it look like?

492
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,770
Like the surface of the moon.

493
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:21,652
That's good.

494
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:28,243
That's the thing about Narcissus.

495
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:35,363
It's not that he's so fucking in love
with himself, because he isn't at all.

496
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:37,245
Fucking hates himself.

497
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:43,444
It's that without that reflection
looking back at him...

498
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,771
he doesn't exist.

499
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:58,886
Billy, are you okay?

500
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:10,012
Yeah. Don't be freaked out. This is good.
This is exactly what I needed to happen.

501
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:12,771
I'm fucking crying.

502
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:16,810
Oh, God, I'm sorry, this is intense.
You can go.

503
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,362
It's okay, I'll be all right, I swear.

504
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,963
-Nikolai?
-I told you, he's not here.

505
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:15,806
Where is Nikolai?

506
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:19,006
-He's not in today. Can I help you?
-Where is he?

507
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:20,807
He's at home.

508
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:23,930
No. There is no one at his house.

509
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,802
-Who are you?
-I'm a friend of his.

510
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:32,004
I have something for him.

511
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,484
-I need to know where he is.
-He's in the hospital.

512
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:41,761
He was robbed and beaten up
and the police are investigating.

513
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,566
You tell....

514
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:55,605
You tell Nikolai...

515
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:58,248
that Yuri says he is sorry...

516
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,281
and hopes he will be better very soon.

517
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,730
I take this for my mother.

518
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,530
Way to go, buddy boy.

519
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:28,130
Nice to know
you're not shooting blanks, right?

520
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,648
Oh, God, what the fuck am I going to do?

521
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:33,486
You don't have to do anything.
That's the beauty part.

522
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:35,370
No, I have to tell Brenda.

523
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:36,932
No, you don't.

524
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:41,965
I can't keep something like this from her.
We're getting married.

525
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,044
Not if you tell her, you're not.

526
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,408
You really think she'd stay with you?

527
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,166
My guess is
she's just looking for a way out anyway.

528
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:52,165
You know, ever since she found about the....

529
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:54,242
What?

530
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:58,090
You think she meant everything
she said about sticking with you?

531
00:40:58,173 --> 00:40:59,765
Oh, yeah.

532
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:04,330
Nothing turns the women on
more than a potentially fatal brain condition.

533
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:08,242
Try coughing up blood.
I bet you'll be getting laid left and right.

534
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,723
You know, buddy boy,
sometimes you can be a fucking moron.

535
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:17,411
-I can't.
-Sure you can.

536
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:20,883
You can get away with anything.
There's shit on me you still don't know.

537
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:24,443
Things you'll never know.
And let me tell you, you're better off for it.

538
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,888
No, I should tell her. She deserves that.

539
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:29,533
You want to die alone? Go right ahead.

540
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:40,490
Oh, my God, it was hallucinatory,
and I'm sorry but it was so....

541
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:44,566
You know, I could just....
I could feel every inch of my skin.

542
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:48,362
I could just feel
that I was so goddamn alive.

543
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,533
You know how guys who've been to war
talk about it?

544
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:55,572
Yeah, like that.
Like I was right in the fucking center of life!

545
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:58,293
Wow. For a random fuck,
sounds pretty great.

546
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:01,331
But it wasn't him.
I don't even remember him.

547
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:02,641
God, what was it?

548
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,930
I've had spontaneous,
anonymous sex before.

549
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:08,766
Maybe it's just the thrill
of breaking the rules.

550
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:11,171
You are engaged.

551
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:14,652
You keep harping on about that. It's not it.

552
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,611
It's not about me and Nate. It's not it at all.

553
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:23,132
It's about me
not being outside myself for once.

554
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:27,092
Not watching, not analyzing
every goddamn moment as it happens.

555
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,687
Not holding back. Just becoming...

556
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:32,803
pure sensation.

557
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:37,045
Becoming energy. Just becoming nature.

558
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:40,452
-Sounds pretty great.
-Yeah. Oh, my God!

559
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,367
It was such a fucking rush.

560
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:50,009
And then I came home and I wrote
a whole 12 pages without stopping.

561
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:58,164
What if I'm losing my shit?

562
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:03,251
What if this is the beginning
of some serious mental illness, you know?

563
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,131
Chances are I am genetically predisposed.

564
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,923
Fuck it. That's just me being paranoid.

565
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:13,608
That's just me being afraid
to be out of control.

566
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,888
As if anybody's ever in control.

567
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:19,886
I can give you the name of my therapist
if you want to talk to somebody.

568
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:21,572
No, thanks.

569
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:25,602
I will never talk to a therapist.

570
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:30,492
Therapists fucked up my life.
I don't need a fucking therapist.

571
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:34,444
-Want another beer?
-Sure.

572
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:41,128
I come to this country with nothing.

573
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:45,726
My wife was already dead for many years.

574
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:52,210
My son is dead, too.

575
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:56,963
And so I come to America. Why not?

576
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:03,888
I working, cleaning toilets at the studio...

577
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:07,531
riding bus...

578
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:16,363
growing potato in the box in the roof.

579
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:25,369
Bank, they don't want to give me money
to start my business.

580
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:29,570
So I have to go somewhere else.
What choice do I have?

581
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:31,644
How much money do you owe them?

582
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:40,446
I don't know. It keeps changing.

583
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:42,847
Interest.

584
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:46,768
-Nikolai, you should call the police.
-Yeah, police.

585
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,843
This is no different than Moscow.

586
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:58,050
No difference at all.

587
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:13,966
Keith, are you okay?

588
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,162
No.

589
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:22,012
What's wrong?

590
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:27,892
Is it because of the shooting?

591
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:30,487
No, it is not because of the shooting.

592
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,572
Damn, you're like
a fucking broken record about that.

593
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:36,406
-What is it then?
-What difference does it make?

594
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:39,851
Am I not allowed
to feel shitty every now and then?

595
00:45:40,093 --> 00:45:41,890
I just want to help.

596
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:52,363
Is it because Taylor
isn't living here anymore?

597
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:55,286
No. You know what?
I'm glad Taylor's not living here anymore.

598
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:59,161
I didn't ask for the responsibility
of taking care of a child. I don't want it.

599
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:01,130
I'm glad. I have my life back!

600
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:05,402
I'm sick and tired of taking care
of everybody else's fucking problems!

601
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:06,848
Okay.

602
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:14,050
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

603
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,683
I don't mean to take it out on you.

604
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:20,007
You can.

605
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:24,530
I mean, we all need to vent.
That's just part of it, right?

606
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:29,568
You can tell me to shut the fuck up.

607
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:33,010
I don't mind, really.

608
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:40,286
I do miss her.

609
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:43,082
Me, too.

610
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:50,971
-You want to have sex?
-Sure.

611
00:46:52,453 --> 00:46:54,409
I want to do it on the floor.

612
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:57,207
Okay. Let me just put these groceries away.

613
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:15,565
How was your day?

614
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,966
It was okay. Long.

615
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:23,410
-You?
-Okay. I got a lot of writing done.

616
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,612
That's good.

617
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:29,086
Did you eat?

618
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:34,452
No, I didn't.

619
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:38,688
Do you want me to fix you something?

620
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:41,611
No, I'm not hungry.

621
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:54,212
What's this?

622
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,643
Some book everyone's raving about.

623
00:47:59,093 --> 00:48:01,846
-You met him?
-No, it belongs to my mom.

624
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:08,291
Oh, God.

625
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:19,968
Dear friends, it was our Lord Jesus Himself
who said:

626
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:23,011
"Come to me,
all you who labor and are burdened...

627
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:24,845
"and I will give you rest. "

628
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:27,847
Let us pray then,
for our brother Dwight Garrison...

629
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,288
that he may rest from his labors and enter....

630
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:32,967
Nate, are you okay? You don't look well.

631
00:48:33,053 --> 00:48:34,771
Yeah, I just...

632
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:38,809
didn't sleep a lot last night.

633
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:44,168
You're taking care of yourself, right?

634
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:49,170
You're taking your medication,
not letting yourself get too stressed out?

635
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,566
I'm doing my best.

636
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:57,126
Mrs. Garrison, is there anything we can do?

637
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:58,965
I just wanted to thank you.

638
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:02,924
The service is lovely.

639
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:05,045
I'm pleased you approve.

640
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:09,411
And I also want to apologize
for the way I behaved yesterday.

641
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,446
I was just....

642
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:21,084
I'm just so fucking angry.

643
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:23,571
He shouldn't have died.

644
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:25,764
He was still young.

645
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:29,647
We only had six years together.

646
00:49:31,453 --> 00:49:33,171
Only six years.

647
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:39,204
It's more than some people have.

648
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:43,085
-It's not enough.
-I know.

649
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:46,804
I know, it's never enough.

650
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,808
I went to Cedar Grove.

651
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,249
The crypt next to Dwight and his wife's
was empty, so I bought it.

652
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:04,130
-Really?
-Yeah. I still want to be buried with him.

653
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:08,452
Or next to him, if that's all I can get.

654
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:11,046
That's lovely.

655
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:17,609
I don't want those bitches anywhere near
him, so I bought the one on the other side.

656
00:50:17,693 --> 00:50:21,208
I'd like to come in on Monday
and make all the arrangements in advance...

657
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:23,045
you know, like he did.

658
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,363
Of course. Any time after 9:00.

659
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,288
Thank you.

660
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:35,688
Yes, I do have telemarketing experience.

661
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:38,082
Can you tell me where you're located?

662
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:41,732
I can't come this morning.
I have a previous appointment.

663
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:44,088
How about if I come around 2:30?

664
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:47,526
Okay. Thank you so much.
What's your name?

665
00:50:48,053 --> 00:50:49,452
Thank you, Martha.

666
00:50:51,693 --> 00:50:54,446
Hey, honey. You done? Thanks, baby.

667
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:55,682
You did real good.

668
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:58,845
I'll take this to the doctor's office
on my way to my interview...

669
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:01,493
and we'll need to do this
about twice a week, okay?

670
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:03,291
Okay. Am I sick?

671
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:07,247
No, of course not. You're not sick.

672
00:51:07,613 --> 00:51:10,844
I just want to make sure
you don't get sick. Okay?

673
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:12,882
Okay.

674
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:16,726
You're such a good girl, you know that?

675
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,168
And Mama loves you very much.

676
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,444
I love you, too, Mama.

677
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,089
I thought you were working till midnight.

678
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:33,846
They switched my schedule around again.

679
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:36,603
What have you got in the bag?

680
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:41,445
These are just some things
I thought I'd keep over here, if that's okay.

681
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,487
Prevacid. I have acid reflux.
I have to take it every night...

682
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:50,248
so I got an extra prescription filled
so I don't miss it when I stay over.

683
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,528
That's my Night Guard...

684
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:55,484
so I don't grind my teeth.

685
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,252
Buckwheat pillow. It's hypoallergenic.

686
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,529
Earplugs for when you snore.

687
00:52:06,813 --> 00:52:09,281
-Are you moving in?
-Of course not.

688
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,042
Because I don't remember
discussing you moving in.

689
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,852
I'm not moving in.
Jesus, are you paranoid or what?

690
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:18,005
'Cause living together,
I'm not sure we're ready for that.

691
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:22,132
Okay, it's just stuff, Keith.
I still have my own place.

692
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:29,212
-Would you like me to go there now?
-No, I made dinner.

693
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:31,847
Oz is on.

694
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:35,771
Does the term "mixed messages"
mean anything to you?

695
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:36,968
Come on.

696
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:41,129
I'm just fucking with you, fool.
I think you should move in.

697
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,486
-Really?
-Yeah. What are we waiting for?

698
00:52:46,693 --> 00:52:50,606
As long as you don't think you're bringing
any of that ugly-ass furniture with you.

699
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:12,121
What are you doing?

700
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:15,091
Just making a list
of things I have to do on Monday.

701
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,370
You were right about Billy.

702
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:23,684
-What happened?
-Nothing. Nothing happened. It's just....

703
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:27,809
He's just on this
completely different wavelength...

704
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:31,203
and it's not a wavelength
I want to be anywhere near.

705
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,524
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

706
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,286
Good night.

707
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:42,566
Good night.

708
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:58,292
You've got mail.

709
00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:11,081
English
