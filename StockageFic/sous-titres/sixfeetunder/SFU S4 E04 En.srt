1
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,233
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

2
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,510
Nothing is anybody's fault.

3
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,236
Well, good night.

4
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,879
You're beautiful.

5
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,071
<i>My God, David, is that you?</i>

6
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,588
I'm sorry, can you
hold on just a second?

7
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,312
Hello?

8
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,476
- Yeah?
- <i>It's Jennifer</i>.

9
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,876
- Hi.
- <i>My father's been killedl</i>

10
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,469
My God, I'm so sorry.
How did it happen?

11
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,511
<i>He was struck by lightning</i>.

12
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,915
<i>Do you think you can handle it?</i>

13
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,076
Yeah, of course we'll take care of it.

14
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,112
- <i>David, are you OK?</i>
- No, that's just...

15
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,435
- <i>You sound</i>...
- Hold on, it's just...

16
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,355
It's my mouth guard,
so I don't grind my teeth when I sleep.

17
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,392
- What the fuck?
- Jennifer's father died.

18
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,668
<i>I can't believe it</i>.

19
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,597
I hope she's married.

20
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,792
That way I won't have to feel so guilty
for wasting two years of her life.

21
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,593
Every woman needs
to fall in love with a gay man.

22
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,189
It's a female rite of passage.
What about Claire and whatshisface?

23
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,277
Don't tell her I told you about that.
I'm serious.

24
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,029
Just like every gay man
needs a period where he tries to be straight.

25
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,232
I don't think that's a requirement now.
We were the last generation that did that.

26
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,794
What about Claire and whatshisface?

27
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,557
- So I'm back on Celeste duty today.
- Another talk show?

28
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,275
Some rehearsal for some charity tomorrow.

29
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,197
What should I wear?

30
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,828
Helmut Lang jeans,

31
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,998
a black T-shirt, the faded
Banana Republic one with the stretch,

32
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,349
and black lace-up boots.

33
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,552
David, this is a profession, OK?
There's an image to project.

34
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,831
And that image isn't
fucking Keith of Finland.

35
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,996
Are you not out on the job?

36
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,032
- No one's ever asked.
- You big whore.

37
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,469
What? I'm not only defined by being gay.

38
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,274
I'm defined by being a lot of things.
Being black, American...

39
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,118
Busted? You broke up with me
because I was not out!

40
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,718
Yeah, to your family.

41
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,991
I don't expect you to come out
to every person you meet.

42
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,508
Nor do I expect you to come out
to every client,

43
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,075
whether it's Celeste or Cameron Diaz
or lan fucking McKellen.

44
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,192
- But the people you work with...
- Calm down.

45
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,277
I'm not the enemy. I'm your lover.

46
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,431
<i>Thanks, Barb, she's never been before</i>.

47
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,472
Seriously, you've never
taken Maya to Legoland?

48
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,192
No.

49
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,959
She was too young for it
until, basically, now.

50
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,117
I used to love to play with
those blocks when I was a kid.

51
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,628
Didn't you? Does Maya love them?

52
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,791
Too young, small parts, choking?

53
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,718
Oh, dear, she's still that orally fixated.

54
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,514
Well, no wonder, she was still
breast-feeding when...

55
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,073
Yeah.

56
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,271
She keeps getting bigger every day.

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,231
Yeah, kids kinda do that.

58
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,558
You got me.

59
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,229
Thanks.

60
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,998
- Uncle Nate?
- Yeah?

61
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,793
Could you be sure
and give this to David?

62
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,310
Yeah, sure. OK.

63
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,238
- Tell him that it's from Michaela.
- Right.

64
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,836
OK, so we'll drop her off
on Sunday around six or so.

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,314
Listen, you guys, thanks so much for this.

66
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,271
If there's anything you ever need...

67
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,995
Well, yeah, we do need...
I guess, what, Hoyt?

68
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,554
100 bucks, maybe 120.

69
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,955
For, you know, Maya's share of the hotel,

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,797
the parking, and the restaurants...

71
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,310
- Stroller rental.
- Of course, yeah.

72
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,954
Look, could you just take her?

73
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,837
- Does Maya like to swim?
- Yeah, she loves it.

74
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,116
She loves it.

75
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,033
- Here you go.
- Say goodbye to Daddy, honey.

76
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,871
Bye, baby girl. I love you.

77
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,157
Have a good time.

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,557
Nate, are you doing OK?

79
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,556
Yeah, you know...

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,911
it comes and goes.

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,031
I can appreciate the attempt, but...

82
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,119
I think it looks like something
you'd see on a calendar,

83
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,391
like in some bargain bin somewhere,

84
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,592
- three months after the new year.
- Can you be a little more harsh?

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,553
No, it's obviously a stylish calendar,
in an upscale store...

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,989
OK, so this piece is no good. Let's move on.

87
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,828
I think the question is not
so much is this piece good?

88
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,793
I would rather we ask
is this piece successful?

89
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,912
Well, this is America,
successful equals good.

90
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,912
Successful in achieving its intention.

91
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,272
Anita, what was your intent with this piece?

92
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,799
I don't know.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,310
I liked the way the light
was hitting her head.

94
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,920
Do we have to know
exactly what every piece means?

95
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,076
No, but surely it means something to you,

96
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,111
or you wouldn't have brought it in.

97
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,950
I can't believe this!

98
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,599
I thought Arthur was merely eccentric,
not seriously disturbed.

99
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,111
Kinda brings new meaning
to the term "dump truck," huh?

100
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,757
Stop marking it, Sammy!

101
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,839
Sloppy. You guys blow!

102
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,233
Hey, over there.

103
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,748
How many of those guys
you think she fucked?

104
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,473
Them faggots are too busy
fucking each other

105
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,988
- to ever work her in.
- Right?

106
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,158
Yo, K, what's up? You coming
on the road with us next month?

107
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,872
I'm still waiting to hear.

108
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,717
Johnny, you suck!

109
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,310
Jennifer, I'm so terribly sorry.

110
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,192
David, this is my fiancê Greg Sutton.

111
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,912
Hi, Greg. I'm glad to meet you.

112
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,758
- Yeah, me too.
- Shall we?

113
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,190
He'd been depressed for years,
ever since my mom divorced him.

114
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,236
- Well, you remember.
- Yes.

115
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,829
Will your mother be coming to the funeral?

116
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,677
No, she's...

117
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,070
in a nursing home.

118
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,999
- You're kidding. She's so young.
- Honey, I don't mean to rush you,

119
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,555
but I've gotta be back on the site
by noon at the latest.

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,556
So what's going on tour like?

121
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,148
All right, the thing about Celeste...

122
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,873
every concert's
packed with teenage girls

123
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,956
fucking horny out of their minds.

124
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,831
You know what I'm saying?

125
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,633
You better check IDs
or you'll find your ass in jail.

126
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,958
Nah, you just got to make sure
you don't videotape nothing.

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,355
What, you married?

128
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,994
No, not married, but we live together.

129
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,758
Don't do it.

130
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,679
I'm on number three,
and I can't seem to fucking learn.

131
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,917
I don't want to play myself,
I wanna play someone ugly or fat,

132
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,758
to show I can be a serious actress.

133
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,997
Hey, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

134
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,951
If I do, I won't answer it.

135
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,351
How many times a week
do you get your pole wet?

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,236
What? I'm curious.

137
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,028
It averages out, I guess,
to about five or six times a week.

138
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,832
Damn.

139
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,916
You don't need to go on tour.

140
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,229
What about you?

141
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,793
Once.

142
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,752
Twice if I'm lucky or if I buy her something.

143
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,429
- That's not good.
- That is so motherfuckin' not good.

144
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,870
See if you can at least get
some free clothes out of it.

145
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,038
<i>These two great black balls</i>
<i>of male erotic fury</i>

146
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,640
<i>go to explode on one another</i>.

147
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,114
That's when everything started.

148
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,232
From those cave paintings,
the creation of the idea of "image,"

149
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,840
of the representation of ourselves.

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,519
And that's when we stopped
living inside nature,

151
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,869
and started living inside our heads.

152
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,480
Yeah, which is why we can
just sit back and watch

153
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,751
while greedy corporate
Bush-suckers destroy nature,

154
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,634
- since we're no longer a part of it.
- If you take humans out of nature,

155
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,274
then all they're left with is human nature.

156
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,711
OK, that sounds good
but what the fuck does that mean?

157
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,872
That's no doubt his new assistant.

158
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,911
I heard you fucked him.

159
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,554
No! I did not fuck him.

160
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,798
So why were you so mean
during my crit, you bitch?

161
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,149
Or is that just the new Claire Fisher?

162
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,918
There's a new Claire Fisher?

163
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,996
What was wrong with the old one?

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,515
She just waited around
for the world to happen to her.

165
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,755
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What the fuck?

166
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,518
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

167
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
I thought that was going
to be a charming moment,

168
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,313
- but now you want to kill me.
- No way.

169
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,555
What good would my life be without you?

170
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,239
Shut up.

171
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,555
So, Claire Fisher.

172
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,353
Yes, Jimmy.

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,392
I'm not exactly sure
I know what your last name is.

174
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,555
I would love to hang out with you.

175
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,470
Say when.

176
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,274
OK, you are verging dangerously
close on being smarmy.

177
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,673
You still haven't answered my question.

178
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,390
I could come over tomorrow afternoon,

179
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,318
but I have to be home by seven at the latest.

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,670
No! That's hardly any time with you at all!

181
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,551
And Nicole misses you.

182
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,354
Well, I miss Nicole too
but I have kids of my own, Sophia.

183
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,359
Federico, did Arthur leave
some sort of forwarding address?

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,391
No, I don't think so.

185
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,477
Vanessa, I'm gonna have
to call you back, OK, sweetie?

186
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,478
Vanessa? Oh, no, he didn't.

187
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,273
He's engaged in a campaign
of harassment against us!

188
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,390
Ruth, I wish you'd let this go.

189
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,955
No. I have a good mind
to get the authorities involved.

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,151
That's never a good idea.

191
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,755
What have you got here?

192
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,678
Male, 60s, struck by lightning.

193
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,193
What happens to a person
when they get struck by lightning?

194
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,231
Cardiac arrest is what kills 'em,

195
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,669
but their insides get fried
wherever the current goes.

196
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,271
In this case, his right arm and left leg,
hence the separate embalming.

197
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,199
So he becomes sort of
a human fulgurite, as it were.

198
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,234
Federico, I need to contact Arthur!
Surely there's some way of tracing him?

199
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,714
Calm down!

200
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,159
Fine.

201
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,557
I'll just resign myself
to receiving excrement in the mail forever.

202
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,956
You little shit!

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,595
I'm losing patience
with all your "sensitive man" bullshit.

204
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,756
You're not sensitive.

205
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,110
You're a fucking eunuch. A castrato.

206
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,755
- Castrato, I like that.
- You little shit, you don't make jokes!

207
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,631
You take this seriously.

208
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,309
I'd flip you over and spank
your candy ass till it bled

209
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,669
if I didn't think you'd like it so much.

210
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,995
I won't, I promise I won't like it.

211
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,156
Nice try.

212
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,671
I wonder who that is.

213
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,078
Hey, shut the door.

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,438
What, you don't want somebody
to see you all tied up like this?

215
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,869
Too bad, because I want
the whole world to see

216
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,115
what a twisted sister you are.

217
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,479
Freak.

218
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,995
Hi.

219
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,033
I thought you might be up for
grabbing a movie or a bite or something?

220
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,472
Maya's with her Aunt Barb.
They went to Legoland.

221
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,594
I'm going kinda stir-crazy.
I just need to be with somebody, I think.

222
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,189
I just...ordered out for pizza.

223
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
That's who I thought you were,
the pizza guy.

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,637
I like pizza.

225
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,352
Bad timing.

226
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,953
- I guess I should have called.
- No, Nate...

227
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,437
stay.

228
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,152
You can meet him.

229
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,829
- OK.
- Just give me a few minutes.

230
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,630
<i>I don't know if he's the right guy for her</i>.

231
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,875
At least he has sex with her.

232
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,876
I had sex with her.

233
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,397
Right, you're the stud because
you've had sex with more women.

234
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,318
You're like, almost heterosexual.

235
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,836
What's up with you?

236
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,875
I don't know. It's weird at work.

237
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,390
I feel like Sarah Jane
from lmitation Of Life.

238
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,955
That makes me Troy Donahue.
OK, this fits.

239
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,518
But there's this side of me
that feels all puffed up

240
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,438
because everybody thinks I'm straight.

241
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,439
It's like I feel like I'm 15 years old again.
How fucked up is that?

242
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,790
In a culture that puffs up men
for being straight? Not very.

243
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,195
But, Keith, you have to come out.

244
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,992
David, that's my decision.

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,634
You are the last person I ever expected

246
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,750
to turn into a self-loathing homo.

247
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,716
Wait, I'll get that.

248
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,151
Duane, what up?

249
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,993
11am? I know.

250
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,190
Two venti soy lattes.

251
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,592
Yeah, later.

252
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,269
Bitch. Just because I'm the new guy,
I'm their fucking waitress?

253
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,392
- I can't answer my own phone?
- No, don't be silly.

254
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,159
I'll just make sure
they call me on my cell.

255
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,439
David, if they take me on tour
I can make 100 bucks an hour, OK?

256
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,471
And that's for us!

257
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,433
Hi, this is David and Keith. We can't come
to the phone because we're too gay.

258
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,069
So after watching this thing 100 times

259
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,156
I decide to do the Scarecrow for her.

260
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,192
So I'm dancing around, doing the thing

261
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,949
and throwing myself around like a rag doll and
she's laughing.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,515
And then she starts doing it.
She's throwing herself around

263
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,949
and I can just see her
cracking her head open

264
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,877
on the edge of a coffee table.

265
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,993
You go from feeling like Super Dad
to the village fucking idiot.

266
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,192
Parenthood is
such a huge fucking responsibility.

267
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,310
Aren't you ever, you know, terrified?

268
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,559
Yeah, but I just remind myself
that some things in my life

269
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,672
I just don't have any power over,
and I never will.

270
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,869
You know, because fear is no good.

271
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,036
Fear can take over your life.

272
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,633
I still feel like Lisa's around...

273
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,391
pushing me to move on.

274
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,557
Wants me to...

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,150
But you can't. You can't rush it.

276
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,154
I should go.

277
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,677
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
- Yeah, you too. Take care.

278
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,518
- Are you all right to drive?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,235
I can't believe I was the only one drinking.
I feel like a lowlife.

280
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,992
Well, be good to yourself.

281
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,712
Yeah, OK, I will.

282
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,515
That guy is seriously wounded.

283
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,472
I want to put one of those
lampshades around his head,

284
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,149
like they put on dogs
so they don't chew their stitches.

285
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,159
I know. I felt like
I couldn't turn him away. Sorry.

286
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,512
No, I love having your ex-boyfriend invited in

287
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,075
when I'm trussed up in the other room
like a Christmas ham.

288
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,793
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That's hot.

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,796
- Really?
- That's very hot.

290
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,711
Hey, buddy.

291
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,352
Well, hello.

292
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,638
Whatcha doin'?

293
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,913
So long.

294
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,191
What is it?

295
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,598
Hey, buddy boy.
What's up, huh? How ya doin', huh?

296
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,551
What are you doing, huh?

297
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,754
Incoming.

298
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,950
- Is Celeste in there?
- Who wants to know?

299
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,958
Nancy Freymire.
I'm chairwoman of this event.

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,877
Please, stand back from the door.

301
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,873
- Hi, Celeste, I'm...
- We have a problem.

302
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,798
- That's why I'm here...
- I do my own hair and make-up.

303
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,353
It's in my contract.

304
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,676
Yes, but we were unaware that
there would be a $3,000 fee...

305
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,393
These people work hard.

306
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,431
We're actually trying to raise money

307
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,153
for people with anticoagulative
blood disorders.

308
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,829
Right, that's why I'm here for free.
I'm totally committed to this.

309
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,110
Lucien and Phyllis are not as rich as I am

310
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,948
- and cannot afford to work for free.
- Perhaps a more reasonable...

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,629
This problem needs to be resolved
before I go on stage, all right?

312
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,875
Otherwise, I don't.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,754
Fine, but might I just say...

314
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,791
I think you're a gigantic bitch,

315
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,230
and I will no longer allow my daughters
to listen to your music.

316
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,955
I'm sorry. You're either trying
to weasel out of what you agreed to,

317
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,436
or were too stupid to even read it,
and I'm the bitch?

318
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,033
Trollop.

319
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,550
Jesus, some people are tense.

320
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,715
Keith?

321
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,355
- That's right.
- You peed in my john.

322
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,789
I did, and I apologise.

323
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,149
I used to be a cop.
I'm kinda new to this.

324
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,794
I'm a little weird about my bathroom.

325
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,191
What the hell is so funny?

326
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,071
Sorry, I can't hear you...

327
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,112
you got your head so far up Celeste's ass.

328
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,832
It is not!

329
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,198
Good boy.

330
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,991
I've been expecting you.

331
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,837
I have many messages for you.

332
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,470
Yeah. Yeah? What's my name?

333
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,195
They don't tell me your name,
just that you've lost a lot,

334
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,310
and that your heart has been broken.

335
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,156
Yeah, who's they?

336
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,231
An older man who watches over you.

337
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,875
Your father? Your grandfather?
He was very unhappy in life.

338
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,436
The other one is a woman, I think.
I can't be sure.

339
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,879
Sit!

340
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,720
You have a lot to work out in this life.

341
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,477
Too much for one life.

342
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,239
- You will have many lives.
- Right.

343
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,834
Listen, I think I oughta go, no offence.

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,429
- I just think this is a ball of crap, so...
- She's not gone.

345
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,870
She's trying to get to you.
She just doesn't know how.

346
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,512
She's...

347
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,714
Who is?

348
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,911
I see...a woman. I see water.

349
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,997
She thinks you stopped loving her.

350
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,190
But I only started loving her...

351
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,636
I wanted to love her...

352
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,959
the way she deserved to be loved.

353
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,117
- You still can.
- She's dead.

354
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,631
She isn't dead.

355
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,989
She's trying to get back to you.

356
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,758
She loves you.

357
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,479
- What can I do?
- You're embarrassing me.

358
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,988
Try to understand what I'm going through...

359
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,077
I am trying, but it's never enough!

360
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,789
My older brother dies when I'm ten,

361
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,237
my mother develops Alzheimer's
really early,

362
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,519
the love of my life turns out to be gay,

363
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,434
and my dad gets struck by lightning.

364
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,475
Why did all this happen to me?

365
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,752
I don't know.

366
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,718
But I do know that you...

367
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,830
Don't you fucking take my hand.

368
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,031
Are you serious?

369
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,390
You fucking broke my heart
and stomped on it.

370
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,317
And I was such a fucking idiot,

371
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,238
I went out of my way
to make it easier for you?

372
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,636
Because you wanted to suck cock!

373
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,835
I was so fucking in love with you,
you fucking sadist!

374
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,155
You make me sick!

375
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,116
I hate that you're gay.

376
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,310
I fucking hate it.

377
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,277
You don't hate that I'm gay.
You hate that I lied to you.

378
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,436
You should hate that.

379
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,475
I lied to myself too.

380
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,277
Are you sure you like it?

381
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,393
How could I not like the first piece
of furniture we purchased as a couple?

382
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,671
It'll be nice to have a place
to display my rock collection.

383
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,035
I spoke to a lawyer today
about pressing charges against Arthur.

384
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,438
Oh, shit.

385
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,716
Look, Ruth,
Arthur never sent us any excrement.

386
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,198
Then who did?

387
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,277
My son. That toy truck
was something I bought him.

388
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,313
The only thing I ever bought him actually,
before he was even born.

389
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,920
- Brian?
- Kyle.

390
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,951
I thought your son's name was Brian.

391
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,190
I have another son.

392
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,476
Why have you never told me this?

393
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,795
Because he's never been part of my life.

394
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,389
If he's sending us shit in the mail
he's a part of your life.

395
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,911
No, he isn't. I was very young.
His mother and I never even married.

396
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,076
Her family didn't think I was suitable.

397
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,271
- So you just left?
- He wasn't born yet.

398
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,629
I was very young.

399
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,194
Nobody wanted me to be part of his life.

400
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,152
Are there other wives
you've neglected to tell me about?

401
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,192
No! Of course not.

402
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,393
Art is just a sentimental construct
to alleviate our fear of death.

403
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,956
No, there's no way
to even determine what makes art art,

404
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,195
much less to teach it.

405
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,152
It's an illusion that anyone
can be taught anything.

406
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,078
I mean, yes, we can all be
conditioned up the wazoo,

407
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,476
but to really learn something,
something important,

408
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,511
that always comes from within.

409
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,551
The cunt has spoken.

410
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,909
Now the world sits in silence.

411
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,990
So, why do you teach art then?

412
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,678
Why?

413
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,277
Because I need the goddamn paycheck.

414
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,710
No, you don't, baby.
Bern left me very well taken care of.

415
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,274
All you have to do
is keep making paintings

416
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
and I'll keep buying them.

417
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,990
Did you know Olivier taught my son?

418
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,634
- No.
- I'm hot for teachers.

419
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,197
Drink more, Mom.

420
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,800
Darling, try the Shiraz, it's delicious.

421
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,035
No, I'm good.

422
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,548
I read in the paper
about a student who allowed

423
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,036
some corporation to tattoo
its logo on his forehead,

424
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,469
and in exchange
they paid for his education.

425
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,272
What the hell is that?

426
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,235
I imagine it's an education for someone
who wouldn't be able to pay for it himself.

427
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,838
It's way more than that.

428
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,475
My students are all in such a mad rush
to become commodities.

429
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,398
But that's always been true of artists.

430
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,476
Where is your bathroom?

431
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,512
Straight through there, to the left.

432
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,433
It's him!

433
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,029
He's the one. I can feel it. He's the one!

434
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,832
You're drunk.

435
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,839
Now, isn't it nice to have someone
who's not only great in bed,

436
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,348
but who's also your intellectual equal?

437
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,999
Don't fuck it up this time,
like you always do.

438
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,996
What if she's really not dead?

439
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,952
- Nate, they identified her teeth.
- Yeah, I know.

440
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,036
But what if, by some amazing coincidence,

441
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,755
somebody had
the exact same work done as Lisa?

442
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,916
I suppose that could be possible,

443
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,317
- but I think the chances are remote.
- But it could be possible, right?

444
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,352
- Are you high?
- No, I'm not, not any more.

445
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,474
Maybe you should just,
like, stay in tonight and try to chill out. OK?

446
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,635
I've got to go.

447
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,638
I've got a date with the Matthew Barney
of LAC Arts.

448
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,478
Even though I'm so not
the Björk of LAC Arts.

449
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,793
<i>All the chicks are hatched and fluffy now</i>.

450
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,308
<i>Listen to them</i>... <i>cheep cheep cheep</i>.

451
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,551
<i>Make the chick sound</i>.

452
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,516
Hi, baby, I made some Asopao.
Are you hungry?

453
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,278
Damn. I had a sandwich at work.

454
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,071
Where are the kids?

455
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,033
Gusto's in bed, Julio's spending
the night at Charlie's house.

456
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,996
I love you, Vanessa.

457
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,757
I know that.

458
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,030
Tell me what you'd like.

459
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,798
I like you.

460
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,352
No, tell me what you like me to do.

461
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,236
Just do whatever you want,

462
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,794
and I'll let you know
how it works out for me.

463
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,277
Why won't you tell me?

464
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,308
Look,

465
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,591
I don't have, like, a checklist
I need to go through.

466
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,437
- Like to have your nipples played with?
- Not if we have to talk about it!

467
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,875
How else am I supposed
to know what to do?

468
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,911
Are you telling me you don't?

469
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,349
OK, maybe we should
just go to the movie.

470
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,036
Maybe I should just go home.

471
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,672
All right.

472
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,599
You're never gonna learn anything, sweetie,
not in that programme.

473
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,996
How could you learn about counselling
in 18 months?

474
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,715
Well, after a lifetime of learning
how not to do things,

475
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,035
maybe I'm a little ahead of the game.

476
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,595
I just still can't believe you're
planning on becoming a shrink.

477
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,471
The irony.

478
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,078
It's superb.

479
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,237
The real irony is that shrinks
are who we hire

480
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,157
to straighten out our lives,

481
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,476
but invariably, they're the ones
who are the most fucked up.

482
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,795
I mean, twisted. Demonic.

483
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,508
Then it makes absolute sense
that Brenda would become one.

484
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,719
Honey, come on now.
A good shrink needs a sense of humour.

485
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,639
- Are you a good shrink?
- I think I'm a very good shrink.

486
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,036
- Does that mean you're fucked up?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

487
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,275
You have no idea.

488
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,911
Darling, do you ever hear from Nate?

489
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,474
Yeah, actually, we saw him last night.

490
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,557
He's still grieving.

491
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,354
He showed us pictures of his daughter.
My God, she's so beautiful.

492
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,756
Those eyes, so open and trusting.

493
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,315
It's mind-boggling to think
that we were all like that once.

494
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,672
I get it!

495
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,392
Now this makes sense.

496
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,317
You want a baby!

497
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,070
Where did that come from?

498
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,317
You are getting a little long
in the tooth, you know.

499
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,592
This would be the time.
Brenda's feeling eggy.

500
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,837
OK, well, it's time for us to go.

501
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,434
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, Jim.

502
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,313
I hope you're up for the challenge
of my daughter.

503
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,316
I am. I am.

504
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,549
- It's Joe, not Jim.
- Bye, see you in a few years.

505
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,112
Terrible evening.

506
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,793
What?

507
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,199
What time is it?

508
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,993
Time for you
to stop keeping things from me!

509
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,153
It sounds absurd when you talk like that.

510
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,317
OK.

511
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,156
I was just a grad student,

512
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,911
and I...

513
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,357
accidentally knocked up a young woman
from a very wealthy family.

514
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,675
I offered to marry her.

515
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,154
Her family was dead set against it,

516
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,237
so... I signed something,

517
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,714
and we both went on with our lives.

518
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,271
What was I supposed to do?

519
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,515
You've never even seen this child?

520
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,029
Yeah, I've seen him.

521
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,073
He tracked me down a couple of years ago.

522
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,918
He was living in some
motel over in Burbank.

523
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,552
And?

524
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,790
I didn't particularly care for him.

525
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,116
As a matter of fact,
I found him very unpleasant.

526
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,755
And I assumed he never
wanted to see me again.

527
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,075
Why?

528
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,749
Because he said,
"I don't ever want to see you again."

529
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,950
Where are you going?

530
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,796
I'm going to the bathroom.

531
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,031
George, how can you...?
I just don't see how...

532
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,755
- I feel like I don't know you at all.
- Ruth, please.

533
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,109
Don't blow this all out of proportion.

534
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,155
It's not good for either one of us.

535
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,709
- Hello?
- <i>Nate?</i>

536
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,320
- Barb?
- <i>It's Lisa</i>.

537
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,992
- Where are you?
- <i>I don't know. They won't tell me</i>.

538
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,473
Who won't tell you?

539
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,114
<i>Nate, the number three is not important</i>.

540
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,472
Wait, what?

541
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,193
<i>You buried me. How could you bury me?</i>

542
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,112
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- <i>But I'm not dead</i>.

543
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,389
It's not healthy, being so
disconnected from your own son.

544
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,274
That's why I called him,
and told him to expect us shortly past noon.

545
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,356
His number was in your address book...

546
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,631
- You looked without asking me?
- ..some shred of paternal feeling in you.

547
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,229
This is important to me.
I do not ask you for many things.

548
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,993
All right.

549
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,472
- You look terrible.
- I feel terrible.

550
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,069
I'm worried about you.
You're not taking care of yourself.

551
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,031
I'm doing the best I can, Mom.

552
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,231
You pointing out the ways
I'm failing doesn't help.

553
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,390
I'll be waiting for you in the car.

554
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,510
Nate, can I ask you something?

555
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,199
Now may not be the best time, George.

556
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,430
Has your mother always been so...

557
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,755
anxious about everything?

558
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,434
Pretty much.

559
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,313
She's gotten a lot better
since you two got married.

560
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,794
How'd you deal with her?

561
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,831
I moved away when I was 17.

562
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,831
For none of us liveth to himself,

563
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,836
and no man dieth to himself.

564
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,433
For if we live, we live unto the Lord.

565
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,631
And if we die, we die unto the Lord.

566
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,159
Whether we live, therefore, or die,

567
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,191
we are the Lord's.

568
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,277
Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord.

569
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,394
Even so sayeth the spirit,
for they rest from their labours.

570
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,158
- The Lord be with you.
- What?

571
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,270
<i>That's not a very nice way</i>
<i>to answer the phone</i>.

572
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,437
This is starting to get weird, OK?
You are not my wife.

573
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,149
I know that.

574
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,509
I do not want you calling me all the time.

575
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,869
Of course, I'm sorry.

576
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,631
I didn't think that I...

577
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,870
I don't ever wanna be a problem for you.

578
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,073
George, I have a question for you,

579
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,714
and I want you to answer me honestly.

580
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,431
Ruth, I get the feeling you think
I haven't been honest with you,

581
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,550
but I always have.

582
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,354
I just don't want to burden you
with things that don't matter.

583
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,516
That's what I would want from you.

584
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,435
What did you want to ask me?

585
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,471
I have no idea.

586
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,592
- We just wanted to thank you.
- Of course.

587
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,835
Seriously, man, thanks.

588
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,189
Jen told me how she unleashed on you.

589
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,390
I think she really needed to do that.

590
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,192
She's been doing it to me, mostly.

591
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,993
Which was making it harder
for him to be there for me.

592
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,276
Yes, that's a scenario I'm familiar with.

593
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,353
The funeral was awesome.
The old guy would have really liked it.

594
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,353
- OK, I'll go get the car.
- OK, thanks, hon.

595
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,633
I'm sorry.

596
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,150
I said some terrible things about you.

597
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,272
- Most of which were true.
- No, David.

598
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,437
I know it was hard for you,
probably harder than it was for me.

599
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,359
You're doing it again. Making it easy for me.

600
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,356
- Some things never change.
- Yeah, well, some things need to.

601
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,117
So why didn't you just
tell him what you wanted?

602
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,948
Cos there was absolutely no way.

603
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,991
I mean, it would just be too...

604
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,598
Seriously, you would do that?

605
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,835
- Of course.
- Yeah.

606
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,836
They'll never figure it out for themselves,

607
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,474
no matter how much
porn star screaming I do.

608
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,278
I just wish they knew how to do it
on their own.

609
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,359
- It's so embarrassing.
- Well, that's why girls are better.

610
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,311
They know.

611
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,920
No, thanks. I love you
but I'm not into eating pussy, OK?

612
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,350
I tried it once. It was...not for me.

613
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,119
I'll just have to keep
telling stupid guys point blank,

614
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,833
- "Lick my clit while you finger me."
- My God!

615
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,190
But, OK,

616
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,756
last year, I went out with this guy, Phil.

617
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,076
He was so hot, and he was, like,
so totally into sex,

618
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,830
I mean, we were always...fucking,
I mean, like, always.

619
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,839
But every time he would,
you know, go down on me,

620
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,792
it was like there was
this unspoken time limit.

621
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,308
I knew that just when it was
starting to get good for me,

622
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,920
he was gonna look up at me
with these lobster eyes,

623
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,030
like, "Can I come up now?"

624
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,033
So what makes you come?

625
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,072
I don't know. The usual stuff.

626
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,872
Why are we talking about this?

627
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,391
Maybe you've never had an orgasm.

628
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,113
Of course I've had an orgasm.

629
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,674
Because if you had,
you wouldn't be embarrassed

630
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,598
about asking for more tongue time.

631
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,075
Could I have really never had an orgasm?

632
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,429
Well, I've definitely felt a surge of desire.

633
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,439
And then, you know,
a sort of relief of that desire.

634
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,556
My God, Claire.
Have you never even rubbed one out?

635
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,875
- You don't masturbate?
- I don't find it that interesting!

636
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,632
You know, Claire,

637
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,990
we could show you
how to give yourself an orgasm

638
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,837
right now if you want.

639
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,557
Hello, not lesbians.

640
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,236
I don't think it's possible
that I've never had an orgasm.

641
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,872
Well, if you haven't,

642
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,956
you're seriously missing out.

643
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,239
I'd like to say George
has told me a lot about you,

644
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,635
but he really hasn't told me anything.

645
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,353
That's because he doesn't
know anything about me.

646
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,951
I know you blame me for everything
you don't like about your life.

647
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,116
Why is he here?

648
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,716
- This was your idea.
- Well...

649
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,478
Of course it was her idea.

650
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,273
You made it clear
you never wanted to see me again.

651
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,629
I didn't! Thanks.

652
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,559
Kyle, look, we can't change the past.

653
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,956
But maybe we can start fresh,
if you're willing...

654
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,437
You can't walk in here and start saying
this is this, and that is that, like you're God!

655
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,677
Because you know what? You're not God.
You're not even close.

656
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,553
I want all deliveries of excrement
to our house to cease!

657
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,591
Yeah, well, I want world peace,

658
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,676
but I don't see that happening either.

659
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,199
Why are you so angry at me?

660
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,755
It's your mother you should be angry at
and your grandparents.

661
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,598
What is it, you find my shit offensive?

662
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,757
No. I find it childish and hostile.

663
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,156
And I'm completely baffled at the timing.

664
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,510
- I mean, why now?
- Because my therapist says

665
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,790
I need to express my true feelings to you.

666
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,717
This is a goddamn waste of time.

667
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,389
George, please. Are you all right, Kyle?

668
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,635
- Do you need anything?
- Like what?

669
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,797
I don't know. Clothing, underwear, socks?

670
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,478
No.

671
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,195
Would you like a cappuccino
from my $7,500 espresso machine,

672
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,435
which I bought
so I never have to leave this room,

673
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,792
because I'm so fucking twisted
thanks to you know who?

674
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,229
Thank you, yes, I'd love a cappuccino.

675
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,719
I was kidding.
I don't know how to work it yet.

676
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,110
Well, we could all go to Starbucks.

677
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,031
I feel so Sharon Stone.

678
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,758
Do people still do these things
when they've had kids?

679
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,911
Yeah, some people do,

680
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,597
and some people don't.

681
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,470
I once walked in on my parents.

682
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,877
My father was rubbing a rolling pin
over my mother's breasts.

683
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,472
Is that something you'd
like for me to do for you?

684
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,192
No, thank you.

685
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,518
But I mean, that fucked me up more

686
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,838
than if they'd just been
fucking in front of us.

687
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,630
Which they also did, by the way.

688
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,997
I'm sorry.

689
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,753
- That was fun.
- No, it wasn't.

690
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,476
Kyle deliberately spilled
his frappuccino over me.

691
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,069
No, it was just that he was so nervous
being out in the world.

692
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,957
My heart goes out to him.
He lives in a motel!

693
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,834
Only because he's too damn lazy
to change his own sheets.

694
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,432
Ruth, his mother's family
comes from major money, old, old money.

695
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,799
He doesn't need us.

696
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,719
Children need more from
their parents than money!

697
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,433
It's unfortunate that I was cut out of his life,

698
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,597
but the fact remains,
I was cut out of his life.

699
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,471
And that's not gonna change.

700
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,997
He seemed so lonely.

701
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,270
Maybe we should invite him to dinner.

702
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,669
Yeah, sure. Why not?

703
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,670
Hey. How was the funeral?

704
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,755
It was...

705
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,439
"Awesome.
The old guy would have liked it."

706
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,031
What's this?

707
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,390
That? That's The Rock.

708
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,910
I would definitely tap that ass.

709
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,635
I'm still not out at work.

710
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,511
Yeah, so?

711
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,515
You were kinda pushing me to come out.

712
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,718
I don't care about that any more.
It's boring.

713
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,589
And I'd rather not fight.

714
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,351
OK.

715
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,116
Did you have fun? Huh, did you have fun?

716
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,276
She had a blast.

717
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,709
I can really see Lisa in her, Nate.

718
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,277
Yeah.

719
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,915
Listen, Barb, I need to tell you something. I...

720
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,952
I went to a psychic.

721
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,111
Was that helpful?

722
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,195
She said Lisa's still alive.

723
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,553
Jesus Christ.

724
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,110
I don't believe this.
What's wrong with you, Nate?

725
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,118
Do you need help?
Because if you do, you should get it

726
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,037
and not from a fucking psychic.

727
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,913
I want to have kids too.

728
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,469
Or just one or... or several.

729
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,036
And I want to have them...

730
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,275
it...

731
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,598
with you.

732
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,553
I mean, I never really

733
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,309
saw myself as, or...

734
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,591
I never really thought it was possible,

735
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,915
but somehow, ever since we've met...

736
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,230
everything seems...

737
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,509
English
