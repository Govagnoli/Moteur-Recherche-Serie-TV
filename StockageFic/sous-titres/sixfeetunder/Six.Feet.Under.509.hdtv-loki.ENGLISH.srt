Saison 5 Episode 9
"Ecotone"

8
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,918
- Sorry.
- I'm going with

9
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,326
- Only family rides along.
- I won't get in the way.

10
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,313
- I can't let him go alone.
- I'll be with him the whole time.

11
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:37,311
Ma'am, all you can do is follow.

12
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:40,273
- Nate
- Don't try to keep up.

13
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:43,067
We'll be running the red lights.

14
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,708
No ! Way I am family !
He's my stepbrother !

15
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:32,729
<i>You have 45 minutes and $300.</i>

16
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:35,522
<i>- Go for it.
- You really have to think...</i>

17
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,000
- Just five more minutes. Okay ?
- Okay.

18
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,465
<i> But you have to meet
the needs of the client.</i>

19
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,545
<i>For me, it set off just
a total panic attack.</i>

20
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,044
<i>I am glad this
final challenge is...</i>

21
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,831
<i> an evening gown because I think</i>

22
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,350
<i>That is probably
my true speciality.</i>

23
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,108
- Hey, what's up ?
- David, it's maggie.

24
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,234
- Hi, Maggie.

25
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:59,448
Nate collapsed at my house.

26
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:02,510
Nate what ? He what ? Why ?

27
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,639
- I don't know.
- Is he okay ?

28
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,389
I don't know.
He was still passed out.

29
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:13,107
The paramedics took him. Can
you meet me at the hospital ?

30
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,567
- Which hospital ?
- Saint bridget's.

31
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,726
- David
- I'm on my way.

32
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,172
David, could you call Brenda ?

33
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,300
Yeah.

34
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,109
Tell them AVM.

35
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,938
- Maggie ?
- What happened to Nate ?

36
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,687
Get me the number for Saint
Bridget's

37
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,594
And Dr. Dipaolo.

38
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,098
D-I-P-A-O-L-O.

39
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,040
Everything's going
to be okay, all right ?

40
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,744
- Where the fuck are you ?
- Brenda, it's david.

41
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:51,434
David, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,855
- Is nate with you ?
- He's at Saint Bridget's.

43
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:56,975
- Something happened to him
- What do you mean ? What happened ?

44
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:00,264
I don't really know any of
the details. I just got a call.

45
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,734
Who called you ?
Why didn't they call me ?

46
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:06,104
- Can you come ?
- Yeah, I don't understand

47
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,896
Brenda, I'm sorry. I
have to call my mom.

48
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,500
I'll take care of everything
until you get there.

49
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,754
David.

50
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:23,007
<i>Are you ready yet ?</i>

51
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,184
You're quiet.

52
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,119
am I ? Sorry.

53
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,339
No, it's okay. It's nice

54
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,843
To be quiet with somebody.

55
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,357
Do you like this place ?

56
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,327
Yeah. It's lovely.

57
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:43,666
But ?

58
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:47,873
You can tell me.

59
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,223
You're not going
to hurt my feelings.

60
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,677
I just kind of feel like
Nancy Reagan might walk in

61
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,969
And sit at the next table.

62
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,629
Yeah, I think we've stumbled
upon a republican nest.

63
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:02,626
I believe it's called an enclave.

64
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,128
No no,

65
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,988
Like vampires, a nest.

66
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,121
Here they are, safe in

67
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,376
their fancy restaurant bubble while
that stupid,evil war goes on and on.

68
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,769
- Stupid, Evil, I don't think so.
- Right.

69
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:19,110
We eliminated a murdering
asshole dictator.

70
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:22,437
And now we're establishing democracy
which, of course, takes time.

71
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:26,053
But we have to stabilize the
middle east. The war was inevitable.

72
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,296
- You're not serious.
- Of course I'm serious.

73
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,694
Ma'am.

74
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:42,254
Ma'am ?

75
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:44,334
Will you complete this, please ?

76
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:50,245
<i>Physicaltherapy to five west.</i>

77
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,364
<i>Physical therapy to five west.</i>

78
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,016
I don't know if he had a colonoscopy

79
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:58,019
Or what his paternal
grandmother died of.

80
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:01,178
I don't. I don't know
the answers to anything.

81
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,619
How about his
insurance provider ?

82
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,584
I don't know.

83
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,621
Do you have his wallet ?

84
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,922
I don't know.

85
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:12,522
Maybe it's in his jacket.
Is that his jacket ?

86
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:15,141
Yeah.

87
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,647
Okay.

88
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,721
You don't think they
wanted a free eltion ?

89
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,624
Did you see those pictures ?
They were dancing in the streets,

90
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,668
- Literally.
- That doesn't mean they wanted to be

91
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,724
invaded and slaughtered.

92
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,155
I saw the pictures from Abu Ghraib, too,
and nobody was fucking dancing there.

93
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,397
That was an isolated group
of disturbed individuals.

94
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,373
Don't give me that.
Those orders came down from the top.

95
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,068
The top ! There's memos to prove it.

96
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,358
Wow !

97
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:44,074
The world is corrupt. How can that be ?

98
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,684
Freedom isn't free.

99
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:50,146
Oh, god ! What are you ?
Some redneck blogger pig ?

100
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:52,496
Come on. Name one
right, one civil liberty,

101
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:55,418
That doesn't have blood all over it,
that people haven't fought and died for.

102
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,635
We didn't go to war to
protect iraqi civil liberties.

103
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:01,360
- That's just a lame justification.
- I didn't say it was just.

104
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,749
But that's the way human
beings make progress.

105
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:05,752
We're violent. It's our nature.

106
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,747
It's a little naive to
expect anything different.

107
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,574
So you just rationalized
away all moral responsibility.

108
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,823
I guess you learned
that in law school.

109
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,898
What ?

110
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,916
oh, no.

111
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,959
- He's stable for the moment.
- Is he conscious ?

112
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,637
- Not yet.
- I called his specialist, Dr. Dipaolo,

113
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,635
- But he's out of town.
- That's all right.

114
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,152
His records are coming over
and we're going

115
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,982
to get him in for a cat scan right away.

116
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,730
- Okay, that's good. that's good

117
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,061
He's been completely
asymptomatic for two yeaars

118
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,465
- For two years, since the embolization ?
- As far as I know.

119
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,983
And immediately prior,
any nausea or pain ?

120
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:52,062
He said something about his arm.

121
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:55,524
Has there been any recent
physical or mental stress ?

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,852
Yeah, actually, I think he's
been under a lot of stress.

123
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,059
But nothing physical ?

124
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:07,758
Except...

125
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,404
Before he fell, there was...

126
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:13,004
Physical activity.

127
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,211
All right. Well, would
you characterize it

128
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,426
As extreme exertion ?

129
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,112
No.

130
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,558
No, but...

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,861
There was a climax.

132
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,564
Okay. That's helpful.

133
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,070
When there's new information,
we'll let you know.

134
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:38,208
Please. Thank you.

135
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,473
Dr. Klein, call pain management.

136
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,688
Dr. Klein, call pain management.

137
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:46,895
My mother's not answering her phone.

138
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,165
I tried her at your
father's. She's not there,

139
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,707
Not that she would be, but...

140
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,028
You want me to call George again ?

141
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,993
- Maybe he could come
- No. God, no.

142
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:02,486
I'm looking for my husband.

143
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,125
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

144
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,590
David !

145
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,955
- Is he okay ?
- We're not sure.

146
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,324
What happened ?

147
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,899
I called 9-1-1.

148
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,960
He was at my house
when he collapsed.

149
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:21,920
He came to pick me up for church.

150
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:24,354
That was like two hours ago.

151
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,170
<i>Dr. Duvall, 1421.
Dr. Duvall, 1421.</i>

152
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,751
Right.

153
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,786
I want to see him.

154
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,962
They're doing a cat scan.

155
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,134
Okay, so...

156
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,765
- What, we wait ?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,396
This wasn't planned, you know.

158
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,804
I know.

159
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,881
What ?

160
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,399
My arm's numb.

161
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,135
- Are you all right ?
- Yeah, yeah.

162
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,303
Whole thing went to sleep
Sleep there for a second.

163
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,401
Maggie.

164
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,849
What are we going to do ?

165
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,642
Nothing.

166
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,473
I don't want to hurt anyone.

167
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,199
I don't, either.

168
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,801
I want to do it.

169
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,438
Cardio tech to room 322.

170
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,788
Cardio tech to 322.

171
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,417
There they are.

172
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,231
What's going on ? Is he okay ?

173
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,715
He's in radiology. We
don't know what it is yet.

174
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,173
where's mom ?

175
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,537
- I haven't reached her.
- What ?

176
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,942
- That sucks. She should be here.
- I know.

177
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,231
When can we see him ?

178
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,176
Probably after the cat scan.

179
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:30,656
Last we heard, he was still unconscious.

180
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,962
Okay.

181
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,447
This is my friend ted.

182
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,530
- This is my brother david.
- Hi.

183
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,351
I'm so sorry.

184
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,600
And my
sister-in-law Brenda.

185
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,243
- Hi.
- And Maggie.

186
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,023
Stepsister,

187
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,159
Former, so of.

188
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,093
Hi.

189
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,064
Hi.

190
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,848
Why is she here ?

191
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,824
later.

192
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,627
Whenever I see a fire, I think of you.

193
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,937
It reminds me of the color of your hair.

194
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,857
Sometimes I feel like
all I have going for me

195
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,176
Is the color of my hair.

196
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,148
It reminds me of your spirit...

197
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,618
Your sexual spirit.

198
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:33,679
- What ?
- Nothing.

199
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,740
Let's talk a little.

200
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,383
We're talking.

201
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,782
You know what I'd like ?

202
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:43,425
What ?

203
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,585
I'd like to see life clearly,

204
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:51,998
But that's the first thing to fly out
the window when I get romantic.

205
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:56,087
I wonder if there's a way to
do it where that doesn't happen.

206
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,397
You're overthinking.

207
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,571
You need to just...

208
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,233
Let things flow.

209
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:07,280
You came back to me for a reason.

210
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,914
I did ? What reason ?

211
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:14,378
This.

212
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,820
This is dr. Fraker.
She's nate's neurosurgeon.

213
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:24,688
- Neurosurgeon ? Oh, god.
- What did you find ?

214
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,791
- There was a hemorrhage in his brain.
- How bad ?

215
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,829
Well, obviously, any hemorrhage
is bad, but I've seen worse.

216
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,826
We need to get him into the
O.R. as soon as possible.

217
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:36,478
Was it another avm ? Or did the
other surgery not work, or what ?

218
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:39,371
We're not going to know until we get
in there. We may not even know then.

219
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,098
Are there any other
options ? Sometimes there are.

220
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:45,826
Not this time. We have to stop the
bleeding before there's more damage.

221
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,389
- There's damage ?
- What kind of damage ?

222
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,028
We don't know yet. Maybe none,

223
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:52,262
But you should prepare yourselves
for possible... changes.

224
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:55,497
- "Changes. "
- We really need to see him.

225
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:58,309
I'm sorry. We need to move
on this right now.

226
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,877
I'll talk to you as soon as we finish.

227
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:04,002
It's going to be at least a few more
hours. Show them to the waiting room.

228
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,838
Mrs. Fisher, could you go with
Derrick and sign the papers ?

229
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,673
I'm Nate's wife.

230
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,628
Oh. Uh... I beg your pardon.

231
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,685
If everyone could follow me.

232
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:44,062
Fuck.

233
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,120
What are you doing up ? It's
the middle of the night.

234
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,652
You hurt ?

235
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,502
Fine. I give up.

236
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:17,496
How could you say I don't love
you ? How could you think that ?

237
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:22,754
What am I supposed to think ?
You treat me like shit.

238
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:26,543
We already argued about this. I
don't want to go through it again.

239
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,031
You're not supposed to love someone
who cheats on you. It's stupid.

240
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,059
It's weak. I know, because
i work with these women.

241
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,752
They get their hearts broken
every saturday night,

242
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:38,218
and I won't be like them.

243
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,900
I fuckin' refuse.

244
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:43,440
It will never happen again.

245
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:49,740
But then here I am in the same
house with you, and I'm so scared

246
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:52,247
Because you're closer
to me than my skin.

247
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:55,163
That's how much you're
a part of me, Rico.

248
00:16:56,646 --> 00:17:01,280
I can't ever stop loving you.
That's why I treat u like shit.

249
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,034
Don't you get it ?

250
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,420
Got it.

251
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,341
Okay, rico. Bye.

252
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:26,028
I'm running out of battery.
Can I use your phone ?

253
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,266
Here. Take mine.

254
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,487
Thank you.

255
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,778
Where could she be ?

256
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,186
- She's not answering her cell ?
- She doesn't have one.

257
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,055
David,

258
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,896
I can't remember when they took him in.

259
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,670
How long has it been ?

260
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,295
I don't know.

261
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,643
I have to go outside to call keith.

262
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,497
Oh, god, what if something
happened to my mother ?

263
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,323
That's extremely unlikely.

264
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,417
I'm sure she'll call back soon.

265
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:13,704
I'm kind of flipping.

266
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,159
I don't blame you.

267
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:29,272
I think I'm going to leave. So would
someone give me a call and let me know-

268
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,619
I think you should stay.

269
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:35,769
You were with him. You might
know something that none of us do.

270
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:48,558
Did he just pass out ?

271
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,370
What were you guys doing ?

272
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,553
Nothing.

273
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,309
Talking.

274
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:59,506
Did he say something ?
Was he not feeling well ?

275
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,154
Could you tell something was wrong ?

276
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,774
No, he was fine till he...

277
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:08,534
Did he have his phone on ?
'Cause I called like 20 times.

278
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,394
- How long were you guys talking ?
- I don't know.

279
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,657
Well, it must have been
a great conversation.

280
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,220
What were you guys talking about ?

281
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,614
His daughter and his pregnant wife ?

282
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,910
You don't have to stay.

283
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:36,502
- I know.
- I mean it.

284
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,445
I've got people here for support.

285
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,567
Right.

286
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:54,182
- Oh, god, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

287
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,666
Oh, wait. Ow !

288
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:57,957
I've fantasized about another
night with you in the woods,

289
00:19:57,985 --> 00:20:00,783
Kissing you everywhere,
your soft, white skin.

290
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,708
There's a rock right under me.

291
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:06,089
- Did you think about me ever ?
- If you could just shift this way.

292
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,384
Tell me you missed me. Oh,
god, you feel wonderful.

293
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,934
- You're too heavy. Please.
- Would you hold me ?

294
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:14,417
- I can't breathe. Move.
- I want you naked. Say my name.

295
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,680
- Hiram !
- Yes, yes.

296
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:20,577
- Get off me !
- What ?

297
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,051
I can't do this.

298
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,483
Hey, would you like me to
go down to the cafeteria

299
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,938
And get you some tea or real food ?

300
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:00,657
No, I'm good with these. Thanks.

301
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,765
How are you feeling ?

302
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:08,577
- With the pregnancy ?
- Oh. Good, good.

303
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,793
No morning sickness.
She's kicking like a horse.

304
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:13,610
She ?

305
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,920
Yeah. Yeah, it's a girl.

306
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,887
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

307
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,300
Have you picked a name ?

308
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:24,328
Well, the only one that nate
and I could agree on is willa.

309
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,070
Willa ? That's pretty.

310
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,610
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,535
- A little sister for Maya.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:37,173
Anthony and Durrell have
such a bond. It's beautiful.

313
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,422
I really admire your choice.

314
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:41,802
You didn't go for the
perfect little infant.

315
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:45,037
Well, we went for it.
We just didn't get it.

316
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,126
And I'm totally glad we didn't

317
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:50,136
Because these kids need us

318
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,859
And I love them to death.

319
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:55,746
I didn't know I'd feel like
this, like a lioness with my cubs.

320
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,558
<i>Dr. Hoffman 308.</i>

321
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:59,601
<i>Dr. Hoffman, call 308.</i>

322
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,131
Then there are days I want to kill them.

323
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,042
Well, that's part of the fun.

324
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,673
- Is he okay ?
- Was it the avm ?

325
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,241
Let me tell you
everything I know up front,

326
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,546
And then I'll try to
answer your questions.

327
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:51,669
He developed a new avm.
That's what ruptured and...

328
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:54,417
caused some herniation
and swelling in the brain.

329
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:58,150
We did manage to stop the bleeding
and to relieve the cranial pressure...

330
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,854
But there were some problems

331
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:03,272
With his heart rate and his breathing.

332
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:06,361
- What does that mean ?
- He's in a coma.

333
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:09,342
There may be some long-term effects
from everything that's happened.

334
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,046
We won't know for certain
until he wakes up,

335
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,662
and we don't know when he will.

336
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:14,583
Jesus.

337
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,911
- So he could be in a coma for... ?
- Days, weeks.

338
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,254
What kind of long-term effects ?

339
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,151
Loss of vision, memory,

340
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:25,409
Impairment of speech, movement.

341
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,770
But you can learn how
to speak and walk again.

342
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,747
My grandfather had a stroke, and he did.

343
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,005
That's right. That can happen.

344
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,869
But, like I said, we are not going
to know anything until he's conscious.

345
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:37,296
We really need to see
him as soon as possible.

346
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,949
Once he's out of
recovery. If all goes well,

347
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:42,864
We'll transfer him to the neuro
step-down unit in the morning, but...

348
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,752
let's just get him
through the night first, okay ?

349
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,858
- Hold good thoughts.
- Thank you, dr. Fraker.

350
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,943
Thank you for the worst
fucking news I ever heard.

351
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,985
He's alive.

352
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:08,098
That's something.

353
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,595
- Did you sleep with her ?
- Yes.

354
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:22,112
You're so fucking predictable.

355
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,304
- It wasn't about the sex.
- Oh, right, you fucked her because

356
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,675
- of silence and meaning and god.
- Yeah.

357
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,109
Not because we're having a hard time

358
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,149
and you need an illusion
to stick your dick in.

359
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,156
We're always having a hard time.

360
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:37,024
There's all this pain and
anger and struggle here.

361
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,339
I used to think it was
passion, but it's just drama.

362
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,611
You came to me. I had
my own fucking life

363
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:44,254
Before you turned up on the
doorstep, bleeding and crazy.

364
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:47,386
- Remember ?
- I remember. We have to face the truth.

365
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,264
We don't fit.

366
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:53,339
We never have. We weren't meant to be.

367
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,503
"Meant to be" ?

368
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:58,409
What quaker bullshit.

369
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,912
You think you and Maggie are meant to be

370
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,555
After you slept with her, what, once ?

371
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:06,099
- What are you, 15 ?
- No, I'm 40 years old.

372
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:10,193
And I see that there can be
peace between a man and a woman,

373
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:13,043
- And that's what I want.
- Fine.

374
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,498
Go for it.

375
00:25:15,602 --> 00:25:18,043
I'm certainly not going
to beg you to stay.

376
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,466
But you might want to ask yourself,

377
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,794
"What kind of person am I ?"

378
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:26,264
What kind of man betrays his
pregnant wife and leaves her ?

379
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:29,677
It's better this way. You know it is.

380
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,728
Nate.

381
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,916
Nurse, he's awake.

382
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,771
Nate.

383
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:01,973
- I'll go get the doctor.
- Nate.

384
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,259
Nate.

385
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:10,822
Do you know who I am ?

386
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,123
Brenda.

387
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,991
You had a cerebral hemorrhage.

388
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,841
We thought you might be in
a coma for months, but...

389
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:26,771
...here you are.

390
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:31,982
What's wrong with my arm and my leg ?

391
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,658
Well, they said you might
have problems just for awhile.

392
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:42,250
- Maya ?
- She's with my mother.

393
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,588
It was an emergency.

394
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:56,714
You were with Maggie.
Do you remember that ?

395
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,479
Yeah.

396
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,301
You're going to have
to step out, Mrs. Fisher.

397
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,447
We're going to run some tests.

398
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,193
- How long will that take ?
- A little while.

399
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:10,048
Here. Let me help you.

400
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,433
I'm going to go
tell everybody you're awake.

401
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:18,240
Chuck, get back in that bed.

402
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,982
Brenda ?

403
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:23,705
I think it's very childish that
you're not speaking to me, Hiram.

404
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:25,474
But suit yourself.

405
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:27,597
I don't want to say
something I'll regret.

406
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,761
Go ahead. What's one more
regret ? I'm full of them.

407
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:33,836
All right. I think it was
rude and selfish of you

408
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,757
To leave the tent last night.

409
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,583
You're not mad at me
for leaving the tent.

410
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,879
- You're mad at me for not having sex.
- Well, yes.

411
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,189
You were the one that
came into the salon.

412
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:45,836
Then you seduced me with
the promise of aperitifs.

413
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,494
Then it was your idea to go camping.

414
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,531
You led me on, then pushed me away.

415
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:51,405
I feel rejected and humiliated.

416
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,212
I didn't mean to lead you on.

417
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,564
I wanted to want to
have sex in the tent,

418
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:57,645
But when it came down to it, I couldn't.

419
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,381
Couldn't or wouldn't ?

420
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:02,250
What do you want me to do ? Just
lie there while you do whatever ?

421
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:04,287
I am not a receptacle.

422
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:07,437
There are other things you could
have done, but you didn't even offer.

423
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:11,067
- Do you mean oral ?
- Yes, or a hand job.

424
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:13,081
Hiram, a woman has to be in the mood

425
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:15,085
To do that stuff, or it's just no good.

426
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:18,048
I'm a sensitive man, but,
you know, I have needs.

427
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:20,794
Your needs are not my responsibility !

428
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:26,869
Where are you going ? You can't
survive out here on your own.

429
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,264
You have no wilderness skills.

430
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:31,728
Oh, go give yourself a hand job !

431
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:36,057
- Where's dr. Fraker ?
- She went home.

432
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,592
I'm her associate. I'm
following Nate at the moment.

433
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:42,193
- We can talk, or you could wait to talk
- No, no more waiting.

434
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:45,949
Okay, what nate had was called
an arterial venous malformation.

435
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,785
We know.

436
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:50,409
He had one before.

437
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:53,592
Oh, right. Here it is.

438
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,386
What happened this time
is this avm ruptured,

439
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:57,733
Causing herniation and bleeding.

440
00:28:57,775 --> 00:28:59,484
We know. We've been here all night.

441
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,109
So you know the operation went
well and he was in a coma briefly ?

442
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,696
- Yes, we know.
- How is he now ?

443
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,522
His vitals are stable,
and everything looks good,

444
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,273
Except for a weakness
on your right side, Nate.

445
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,282
Yeah.

446
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:14,390
What about physical therapy ?

447
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,315
We'll start as soon as he's up to it.

448
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,700
When do you think he might
be able to leave the hospital ?

449
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:21,405
A week or two, if he
continues to improve.

450
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,724
- That's not long.
- Yes.

451
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,236
Are you okay ?

452
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:30,597
I am now.

453
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:34,010
Really ?

454
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:37,498
You put up a great
fight. We're all proud of you.

455
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:40,233
I've got a lot to live for.

456
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,200
We'll be right back.

457
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,001
<i>Dr. Klein,
call pain management.</i>

458
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,454
<i>Dr. Klein, call pain management.</i>

459
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:11,548
I know you want to see
Maya. I'll go pick her up.

460
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:14,400
Thanks.

461
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:41,078
Ruth, you came to me for a reason.

462
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,970
Yeah, this.

463
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,684
Ruthie, bring me my lunch.

464
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,200
I care for you. Let's rub heads.

465
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,068
It's perfectly normal to
live in a bomb shelter.

466
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,101
I'm your first love, Ruth,

467
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,240
The father of your children.

468
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:14,968
I'm where it all began.

469
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:17,467
Oh, Nathaniel.

470
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:34,101
Go on, durrell, it's your play.

471
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:36,386
Hey hey hey ! Quiet, all right ?

472
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,804
So we don't get busted by having
too many visitors in the room.

473
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:42,151
- Okay.
- Be careful, Durrell. Chuck's a shark.

474
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,100
There you go.

475
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:46,667
Anthony, come talk to your uncle Nate.

476
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,306
Is this too much action for you ?

477
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,386
No, no, it's good.

478
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:55,348
- They wanted to come and see you.
- No, I didn't.

479
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:57,500
Anthony.

480
00:31:57,945 --> 00:32:01,001
Hey, don't worry about
your arm and your leg.

481
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,123
It feels strange.

482
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,672
I have to really concentrate
to make anything happen.

483
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,306
But it's not permanent.

484
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,813
There's a cop I know. They said he
would never get out of a wheelchair.

485
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,255
You know what ? Now he's running.

486
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:18,076
- Ha ! I won !
- What do you mean ?

487
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:21,788
You owe me a dollar.

488
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:24,356
Durrel, you're not taking
anybody's money.

489
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:28,182
Where's Anthony ?

490
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,319
He was right here.

491
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,765
Anthony, come back here.

492
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:38,530
I don't know how to thank you.

493
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,985
I'll think of a way.

494
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:43,600
No, I mean it.

495
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:46,685
I mean, how many guys
would spend the night

496
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:49,657
In a hospital on the first date ?

497
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,647
I mean, that is just fucking goodness.

498
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:00,558
- I didn't know you were like that.
- Not a big deal.

499
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,467
You'd do the same thing
for me, wouldn't you ?

500
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:07,567
I would now.

501
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,013
Thank you.

502
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,309
You're welcome.

503
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:24,417
Your brother's fine.

504
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,093
All I could think about
during the parent-Teacher meeting

505
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,351
Was how much I wanted to smoke a joint.

506
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,640
- Maggie.
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.

507
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:47,532
No. Please.

508
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,490
I won't stay. I just want to see him.

509
00:33:49,547 --> 00:33:51,368
Stay.

510
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:54,734
I'm sure my boys are
creating mayhem somewhere.

511
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,233
I'll be back in a little bit.

512
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,711
- Hi.
- Hi.

513
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,824
Are you all right ?

514
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,410
Swear to me.

515
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:10,997
I swear.

516
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,960
If only I hadn't asked you for a ride.

517
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,720
I'm not sorry for anything.

518
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,852
You're making love with
somebody and your head explodes.

519
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:25,842
That's a good sign.
- Stop it.

520
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:29,300
You're awful.

521
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,429
I'm so relieved.

522
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,481
Last night was just...

523
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,901
100 years long.

524
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,753
So many things I want to say.
I don't know where to begin.

525
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,612
Just rest.

526
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:51,880
- Oh, hey, Maggie.
- Hi, Rico.

527
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:57,967
Take care, Nate. I'll be in touch.

528
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,001
What do you want ?

529
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:15,509
Man, oh, man, oh, man.
What the hell, nate ?

530
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:16,855
Pretty fuckin' bizarre, huh ?

531
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,753
David told me, but
I couldn't believe it.

532
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:21,579
- I mean, you were fine.
- I'm still fine.

533
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,649
What a shock.

534
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:27,471
I had to come by, but
i only got a minute.

535
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:31,184
There's an intake. This
guy got mauled a cougar.

536
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:34,043
- No shit.
- Yeah, right here in L.A.

537
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,101
He was walking in the canyon.

538
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,860
The ecotone.

539
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:46,217
Ecotone. It's the area where

540
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,934
Two ecological worlds overlap.

541
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,477
You know, like wilderness
and civilization.

542
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:56,115
Ecotone.

543
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,867
I'll be sure to say
that in the intake.

544
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:27,378
Excuse me. I notice you have a bus.

545
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:35,219
Courtney. Courtney.

546
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:38,567
Please, somebody. I
just want to go home.

547
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:42,425
Hi. I'm Courtney. Is there a problem ?

548
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,617
I'm not hungry.

549
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:51,875
Fine. Then don't eat.

550
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,368
- I'll take his.
- I want to go home.

551
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,326
Why are you acting so crazy ?

552
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:05,967
We are staying with uncle Nate
until we are sure that he is better.

553
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,738
Man, it's okay. Just chill.

554
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:09,367
No !

555
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:12,306
- Hey, get back here.
- He's going for the front door.

556
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:15,532
Durrell, stay here and
help me clean this up.

557
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:19,898
- What is wrong with him ?
- Are you blind ?

558
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:23,499
He hates hospitals. We always
had to go when mama O.D'd.

559
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:27,626
- Why didn't he tell us ?
- You didn't ask.

560
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:31,095
Can I go get him now ?

561
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,194
Yeah.

562
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,767
Look who's here.

563
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:45,142
- Daddy !
- Hey.

564
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,166
Hey, big girl.

565
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,006
Come on up.

566
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:53,034
Come here.

567
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,259
Give me a big hug, would you ? Come here.

568
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:03,034
I am very happy to see you.

569
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:11,062
Why don't you read your book, honey ?

570
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,499
You brought a book, huh ?

571
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,856
I was waiting for you at
the church last night...

572
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,297
... when you and Maggie were...

573
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:26,967
Talking.

574
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:31,669
I told you to go do what you want.

575
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:33,575
I guess you did.

576
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,594
I'm sorry. I never
waed it to go this way.

577
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,472
Listen.

578
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:44,256
I've been up all night,

579
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:46,759
Thinking and...

580
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,463
You're alive.

581
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:55,034
That's all that really matters.

582
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:00,031
We've been through
worse together, I guess,

583
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,600
And we'll get through this, too.

584
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,300
I don't think so.

585
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:15,378
What ?

586
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,634
Not together.

587
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:25,603
Are you saying what
I think you're saying ?

588
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,082
Yeah.

589
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:45,775
- What about Maya ?
- We'll talk about that.

590
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,962
That's a future conversation.

591
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:57,535
So that's it ? You're done ?

592
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:05,832
We're... We're not even going to try ?

593
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:08,200
We've been trying.

594
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:12,068
Both of us, for a long time.

595
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:15,325
Since the beginning.

596
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:18,168
We're just different, that's all.

597
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:22,762
Yeah. You're a narcissist.

598
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,283
I don't even think you're capable

599
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:28,996
Of committing to anybody
or anything, even yourself.

600
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:33,567
I'm not going to fight.

601
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,168
I am so tired of fighting.

602
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:53,005
Do you really want a husband again ?

603
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:56,757
Maybe. I don't really feel
any better as a single woman.

604
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,959
- Did the crazy husband beat you ?
- Oh, no, no.

605
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,739
He's a gentle person,

606
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:14,166
Sometimes boring.

607
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,006
I think he may want a
mother more than a wife.

608
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:25,147
They're all like that.

609
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,114
Have you had other boyfriends ?

610
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,147
Yes, unfortunately.

611
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,053
What did she say ?

612
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,612
All men are crazy. Stick
with the devil you know.

613
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:45,663
Where the fuck could mom be ?

614
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:48,415
- Sorry, chuck.
- That's okay.

615
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:52,016
I'm a buddhist. We don't
care about that shit.

616
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:56,509
First, I was worried,
but now I'm just pissed.

617
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:58,908
It's really irresponsible of her.

618
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:03,725
She wouldn't have been
able to handle it, anyway.

619
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:06,875
You know, she'd get all upset

620
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,739
And flap around and squawk.
We'd have to take care of her.

621
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,255
Poor mom,  she's so out there.

622
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,747
It's all this stuff with george.
It really did a job on her.

623
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:21,733
Well, she could still show
up for her own son's coma.

624
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,409
Okay, I'm going to go
home and take a shower.

625
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:40,109
I was going to say.

626
00:42:40,954 --> 00:42:42,841
But then I'm going to come right back.

627
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:46,165
What are you going to do ? Watch the
nurses wake me up every 10 minutes ?

628
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:52,621
Okay. Will you call me later, please ?

629
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,165
Yep.

630
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:56,771
You, you rest.

631
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,353
- Good-Bye, Chuck.
- Good-Bye.

632
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:08,747
Dave, you should go, too.

633
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,428
Maybe later. I'll keep
you company a little while.

634
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:15,794
You look tired.

635
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:18,522
I am.

636
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,602
We'll watch tv.

637
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:30,766
- Hey, Chuck, turn it up, will you ?
- Yeah.

638
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,767
Nate !

639
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,208
Yo, Nate !

640
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:20,889
Fuck, dude, we've been honking
for, like, ever. Let's go.

641
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,396
We're going to be late.

642
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,702
Jesus, david. Watch the grip, man.

643
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,603
Lightweight.

644
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:50,346
Where's your suit ?

645
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:54,406
I'm wearing it, dude.

646
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:01,829
You stoked ?

647
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,337
- I guess.

648
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:08,003
You guess. You asshole,

649
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:10,455
We've been waiting for this
our whole fuckin' lives, man.

650
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:15,872
Oh, my motherfuckin' god.

651
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:18,891
This is so fuckin' weird.

652
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:21,956
What ?

653
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:24,337
I had this whole other idea of you.

654
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:27,698
I really thought you were this
whole completely other person.

655
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,684
You are so fuckin' toasted, man.

656
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:38,600
I don't know what it is. I must have
been dreaming or so fuckin' high.

657
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,224
Am I going to have to separate you boys ?

658
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:58,050
We are so fucking lost.

659
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,708
Give me that.

660
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:29,774
Whew ! Oh, man.

661
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:33,967
- I'm going in.
- Up to you.

662
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,826
- Nate, don't be stupid.
- Stupid ?

663
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,798
Stupid ? This is what we
came here to do, you asshole.

664
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,742
Play nice.

665
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,493
- Come on, bro ! You and me !
- There could be sharks !

666
00:46:46,922 --> 00:46:48,566
Why don't you join him ?

667
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:51,035
- Why don't you join him ?
- Dave !

668
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:53,594
You gotta try this !
It's so fuckin' warm !

669
00:47:00,054 --> 00:47:01,960
You wanna smoke some crack ?

670
00:47:09,612 --> 00:47:11,364
Nate.
