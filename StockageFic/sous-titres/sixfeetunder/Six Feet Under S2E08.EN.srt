1
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:51,130
That one's gonna be for the highlight reel
this weekend.

2
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,692
As we take another look....

3
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:56,527
If you don't get your fat ass in gear
you're gonna be late for work.

4
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,007
I just sat down.

5
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:01,926
Come on.
You only got this job two weeks a year.

6
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,687
All right.

7
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,572
You know, this goddamn suit
itches like hell.

8
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,644
You could lose a little padding here.

9
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,645
Careful. Only good little girls get presents.

10
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,208
No flirting with the faggoty elves.

11
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,883
Can I help it if the elves think I'm a stud?

12
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,487
You are a stud. But you're my stud.

13
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,044
-Careful.
-Yeah, like hell.

14
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,211
You're a loser.

15
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,452
Is that Santa?

16
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,407
It is. It's Santa.

17
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,087
Hi, Santa!

18
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,607
You told me Donald Green was Jewish.

19
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:27,611
I don't know.
His shop was closed on Yom Kippur.

20
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,412
He sent us a Christmas card
with a baby Jesus on it.

21
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,006
So he's not Jewish.

22
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,842
-We sent him one with a dreidel on it.
-Now he thinks we're Jewish.

23
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,286
Is Brenda Jewish?

24
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,045
Yeah, sort of.

25
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,288
Her dad's Jewish,
and her mom was raised Catholic, I think.

26
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,206
But now they're atheists. I think.

27
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:50,086
How would your children be raised?

28
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,447
We haven't gotten that far yet, Mom.

29
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:57,007
Is she coming to Christmas dinner?
I'm making my list.

30
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:58,162
That's the plan.

31
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,643
Christmas Eve at her mother's place,
and then Christmas dinner here.

32
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,122
-So I'll write you down for two.
-Great.

33
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,850
-David?
-You can put me down for one.

34
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,925
But what about Keith?
Aren't the two of you....

35
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,565
Yes, we're having healthy,
affection-based sex on a regular basis.

36
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:17,245
Twice a day sometimes.

37
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:21,645
Why won't you bring him here
for Christmas? Are you ashamed of us?

38
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,722
Of course not.

39
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,805
Taylor's living with him now.
They're having their own Christmas.

40
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,726
Invite them both. I'm cooking a goose.
Don't they like goose?

41
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:31,532
You really want them,
or are you being politically correct?

42
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:33,808
Of course I want them to be here.

43
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:36,805
If he's someone you care about,
then he should be here.

44
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,646
I am sick and tired
of this chip on your shoulder, David!

45
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,248
How am I supposed to accept you
if you resent every single attempt I make?

46
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,732
All right, fine.

47
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,090
We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night.
I'll ask him then.

48
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,126
If you both have plans for Christmas Eve...

49
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:54,932
who's going to midnight service with me?

50
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:03,924
I'd like for you
to go to church with me tomorrow night.

51
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:08,122
And I need to know if you're bringing
anyone to Christmas dinner.

52
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:13,209
-I was thinking about maybe asking Toby.
-Toby? I don't know any Toby.

53
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:17,442
I met him at Aunt Sarah's,
and we've been out a couple of times.

54
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,929
Doesn't Toby have a family of his own
to spend Christmas with?

55
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,129
His parents are pagans.

56
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,332
It's not his fault.

57
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:30,163
When are you going to invite him?
I need to know how many yams to buy.

58
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,768
Look, if he's coming,
I'll tell him to bring his own yam.

59
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,162
And when are we going
to decorate the tree?

60
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,322
You need to calm down.

61
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,973
Christmas is the day after tomorrow.
What about tonight?

62
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,850
I can't. I made plans.

63
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,366
Me, too.

64
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:47,123
I'm already doing the church thing.

65
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,682
I wish I knew what I did
to deserve such morose, surly children.

66
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,923
I'll be so glad
when these fucking holidays are over.

67
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,689
Baby, you're making it worse.

68
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,971
How come you can make
a squashed face look like new...

69
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,805
but you can't even fix a stupid wall?

70
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,361
It's the Sheetrock. It's all crumbled.

71
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:14,843
-I know. I'm still picking it out of the couch.
-Okay, Vanessa.

72
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,653
Why don't you tell me
what else I've done wrong lately?

73
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:21,931
I don't understand why you fired Ramon.
He was doing good work. He was cheap.

74
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,281
I had my reasons.

75
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,763
You're jealous 'cause he knows how
to fix things and makes you look bad.

76
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,162
I don't want him around here anymore.

77
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,369
Look at you, Rico, you're jealous.

78
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:35,685
All right, you wanna know
why I fired him? Yeah?

79
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:39,604
When I came home that afternoon,
he was screwing someone.

80
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,605
A man. Right here against this wall.

81
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,412
-Rico, that's disgusting. Stop lying.
-I'm not lying.

82
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,404
He was screwing a frigging man!

83
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,849
Right here, right in my fucking house,
he was screwing a man!

84
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,487
Oh, my God.

85
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,367
And that's why I fired him. Okay?

86
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, my God!

87
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:06,646
Okay, if you were a gay mortician,
what would you want for Christmas?

88
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:09,966
A new life?

89
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,292
-I hate Christmas.
-I hear you.

90
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,810
It's such pressure
to live up to these images.

91
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,808
The whole family
sitting around the dinner table...

92
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,487
as Mom, dressed in
her special Christmas apron...

93
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,689
serves a meal
that she spent three days making.

94
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,570
I mean, who has that?

95
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:30,402
I do.

96
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,652
You're kidding.

97
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,452
Just add the smell of death
and people crying downstairs...

98
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,444
you've got my life exactly.

99
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,651
-It doesn't sound half bad, actually.
-It's awful.

100
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:45,323
No, awful is when you celebrate
the winter solstice...

101
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,404
by watching your father play the recorder...

102
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,370
while your mother
dances around a bonfire...

103
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,887
chanting hymns to Gaea, the earth goddess.

104
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,845
Sure, it's funny to you.

105
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:03,005
So do you want to have Christmas dinner
with my creepy family?

106
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,250
Are you kidding? I would love it.
Do you really want me to?

107
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,244
It was my mother's idea.

108
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,241
Ever since my last boyfriend
tried to kill himself...

109
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,289
robbed a store, and shot at a guy...

110
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:18,730
before disappearing off the face of the earth,
she wants to meet everyone I date.

111
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,203
-A biker funeral?
-I know what you're thinking...

112
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,521
but they seem pretty cool.

113
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:26,650
Are you kidding? I love biker funerals.
These guys have big money.

114
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,928
They all have Harley dealerships
or repair shops...

115
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,527
And methamphetamine labs
in their basements.

116
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,008
Whatever. Money is money.

117
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,404
Mrs. Johnson, I'm David Fisher.
I've very sorry about your loss.

118
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,721
Thank you.

119
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,726
This is Pete, a close friend of the deceased.
This is my brother, David.

120
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,209
And this is Marilyn's brother, Bitsy.

121
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:50,885
As in Itsy.

122
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,608
So, is there a casket that appeals to you?

123
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,172
It's gotta be steel.

124
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,605
The Camry here is 20 gauge stainless steel.

125
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,292
That sounds foreign.

126
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:07,286
No, I assure you, it's built right here
in the United States of America.

127
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,723
All right. As long as it's the best.

128
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,131
Jesse never liked
to have a fuss made over him.

129
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,721
He always said that when his time comes...

130
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,321
just set him out by the curb on trash day.

131
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,927
But...

132
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:27,290
I want to do right by him.
He was a good man.

133
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,204
He was the fucking best!

134
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:34,001
Now, we want the casket airbrushed
the same as his gas tank.

135
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,932
It's midnight-purple with orange flames.

136
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,652
-I'm not sure...
-I'll give you the number of the guy...

137
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,372
that's restoring Jesse's hog.
He can do it all at once.

138
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,966
That is a hell of a bike.

139
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:48,887
And on the inside of the casket lid,
we want a picture of Marilyn here.

140
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,684
You know, so she's looking down on him
for all eternity.

141
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,167
That was Jesse's favorite picture of me.

142
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,651
It was Hustler's Beaver Hunt, April of '86.

143
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,892
It's a very nice picture of you.

144
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,851
Isn't it? I usually hate pictures of myself.

145
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,368
We're gonna need a couple of kegs of Bud...

146
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,603
and a case of Jack for the service.

147
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:14,850
I want this done right.

148
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:18,171
It's gonna be
one big-ass Christmas Day funeral.

149
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,573
Sorry. Christmas is the one day
we don't hold services.

150
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,723
We'd pay whatever it takes.

151
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:30,328
A big-ass Christmas Day funeral it is.

152
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:34,973
So we're gonna be working
on Christmas Day.

153
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,808
We've had worse Christmases.

154
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,526
Yeah, we have.

155
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,252
Do you remember
the last time you saw him?

156
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,842
No.

157
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,483
I can't believe it's Thanksgiving already.

158
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,411
What happened to this year?

159
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,804
I know. You can't even go anywhere
that isn't all decked out...

160
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:05,327
with candy canes and Santa heads and shit.

161
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,051
It's all so phony.

162
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:10,087
I think in Hell it's always Christmas.

163
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,487
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,287
Hey, buddy-boy.

165
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,205
What are you doing out here?

166
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:26,602
I had to take a break.
It was just too much food.

167
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:29,161
I know. Your mother's been baking all week.

168
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,724
She outdid herself this year.

169
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,364
So, how's Seattle treating you?

170
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,286
It's all right, I guess. I got no complaints.

171
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,727
Me, neither.

172
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:45,926
Not many people can say that,
you know, and mean it.

173
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:51,173
I guess we've got a lot to be thankful for.

174
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,892
Either that, or we've
lowered our expectations so much...

175
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,533
we've given up on anything better than this.

176
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,086
Oh, boy.

177
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:12,562
Listen, I gotta pick up a body...

178
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,368
so I'm not gonna be able
to drive you to the airport.

179
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:18,445
-That's okay. I can take him.
-Thank you, kitten.

180
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,044
You coming down for Christmas?

181
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:27,132
Yeah, I think so.
I gotta see how my schedule works out.

182
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,771
It's good to see you, son.

183
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,241
You, too, Dad.

184
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,525
Take care of yourself.

185
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,324
Anything I can help you with?

186
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,729
Yes, I'm looking for clothes so expensive...

187
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,611
only an idiot would buy them.
Oh, there they are.

188
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,169
-Excuse me.
-Be my guest.

189
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,967
Excuse me.

190
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:14,286
Your wife would like you to see
how she looks in her Jil Sanders sweater.

191
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:22,005
And I think you should leave,
or I'll have to call security.

192
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,286
Do you validate?

193
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:29,847
You smell good.

194
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,126
It's the flowers.

195
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,605
You are so beautiful.

196
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:36,332
I am not.

197
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:39,885
Did you not wear panties today like I asked?

198
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:43,490
I most certainly did not
not wear panties today.

199
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:47,450
-Why not?
-It's unhygienic.

200
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,208
What kind of panties did you wear?

201
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,211
Something sexy?

202
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,411
No, they're not sexy.

203
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,963
They are Fruit of the Loom
control top briefs...

204
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,772
and they come three to a pack
for $15 at Target.

205
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:09,651
I want you to go into the bathroom
and take them off...

206
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,805
-and then hide them someplace in my office.
-I will not.

207
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,491
And I wish you'd
stop talking to me that way.

208
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,768
You don't like when I talk dirty?

209
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,565
I didn't say that.

210
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,803
I don't like it here at work.

211
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,362
When I was shopping today,
this total stranger felt me up.

212
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,605
-That's irritating.
-No, it was really hot.

213
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,605
He was giving me the eye...

214
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:44,002
so I went over
and stood right next to him, like:

215
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,129
"What are you gonna do about it, pal?"

216
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,092
And he puts his hand on my ass
very tentatively.

217
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,564
I know, it was so polite.

218
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:58,811
So I took his hand
and I just put it inside me.

219
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:05,653
I mean, if you're gonna do it, do it.

220
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,042
Wow!

221
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,044
Does this mean you have...

222
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:14,685
maybe some mixed feelings
about marrying Nate?

223
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,042
No.

224
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,447
Seriously, that's not it at all.

225
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:26,162
I think it's just natural biological drive
at work.

226
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:30,361
The need to sample as diverse
a selection of people as possible...

227
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,842
before settling down with one mate.

228
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:35,812
It's normal.

229
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,002
Anyway, I got another chapter out of it.

230
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,644
Do you know
where the jaundice solution is?

231
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,325
Mrs. Doyle's looking very yellow.

232
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,564
It's back-ordered.
Use the ColorGuard. 10 ounces a gallon.

233
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,246
Take a little break.

234
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,122
Here, have some eggnog.

235
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,287
This isn't eggnog. It's whiskey.

236
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:28,524
Whiskey? It's rum, my boy.
The drink of holidays.

237
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:33,012
You know, when you were little,
you always wanted to...

238
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:36,563
leave milk and cookies out on the tray
for Santa Claus. Remember?

239
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:37,642
Yeah.

240
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:41,852
And you used to laugh and say,
"What Santa really needs is a shot. "

241
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:43,481
And I was right.

242
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:46,929
I always thought you meant a shot,
like a shot of penicillin.

243
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:57,092
-I should...
-David, it's Christmas. Come on.

244
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:59,683
Spend a little time among the living.

245
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,243
Sit down with your pop
and tell me what you want for Christmas.

246
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,369
Mrs. Doyle's viewing's at 4:00.

247
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:34,683
Mom said she might have
a special guest for dinner.

248
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,687
All right.

249
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,608
If he's anything like
her past special guests...

250
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:44,447
he's a 24-year-old Venezuelan pool boy
who makes up for his lack in English...

251
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,842
by being fluent
in the language of power-fucking.

252
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:49,731
I'll try not to get into a conversation
with him.

253
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,448
Hey, Bren, hold on just a sec.

254
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,132
Do you remember what happened
a year ago today?

255
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,131
Oh, God, I'm sorry, your father...

256
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,488
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

257
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,646
It's our anniversary.

258
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,246
Oh, my God!

259
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,087
Of course.

260
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:16,326
It's hard to believe it's only a year ago
that we met.

261
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,404
Yeah, it feels like 20 years.

262
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:23,405
If you don't want to be with me,
then don't, all right?

263
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:25,609
Nate, I'm kidding. Come on.

264
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,169
Of course I want to be with you. I love you.

265
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,403
Then why do you treat me like shit
all the time?

266
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,643
Because I had a really fucked-up life...

267
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,806
and I use sarcasm to hide
how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.

268
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,804
Come on. Jesus, you know that.

269
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,531
Happy anniversary.

270
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:46,851
I know I already got you another ring, but....

271
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,212
I can't believe you....

272
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,411
It was my grandmother's.
It didn't cost me anything.

273
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,605
Merry Christmas.

274
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:11,926
It's okay.

275
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:14,968
I love you.

276
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,130
Well, it's about time.

277
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:24,923
-Hey, Mom, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.

278
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,365
Nate, Merry Christmas.

279
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:34,641
I know there's some mistletoe
around here some place, God damn it!

280
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,406
What's wrong, honey? You look like shit.

281
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:40,291
-Enjoying a Scotch, Mom?
-Not nearly enough.

282
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,081
Sweetheart, would you freshen up my drink?

283
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,608
Come on, give your sister a big kiss.

284
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:04,087
I told you we were having a special guest.

285
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,202
Yes.

286
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:09,972
-I just didn't expect...
-To see your crazy brother. Sure.

287
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:11,802
Don't worry...

288
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:16,250
they pumped enough electricity through me
to light up the Eastern Seaboard.

289
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,403
Kidding. I'm sorry, Bren.

290
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:21,042
Come on, lighten up. It's Christmas.

291
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:29,092
-Come on, go get me another drink.
-Okay.

292
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:32,486
Mom, what the hell is he doing here?

293
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,564
I busted him out for Christmas.

294
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:38,045
-You could've warned me.
-Warned you?

295
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:41,006
You need to be warned
about seeing your own brother?

296
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,607
Ever since he came at me
with a knife? Yeah.

297
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:48,243
Okay, so how long is he out for?

298
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:53,085
For good. He's living with me now.

299
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,763
So I guess you're happy to be home.

300
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,407
Happy is a concept I try not to buy into.

301
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,564
It just gets me into trouble.

302
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,326
Listen, Nate...

303
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,011
I'm really sorry
about everything that happened.

304
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,801
I know I have to take responsibility
for what I did...

305
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:30,282
but I was sick.

306
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,249
And now you're not?

307
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,006
I'm still sick.

308
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,012
I'll always be sick.

309
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,564
Just the cards I was dealt.

310
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:52,164
I can manage it through medication,
for the most part...

311
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:57,162
but it's something I'll have to live with
for the rest of my life.

312
00:23:58,453 --> 00:23:59,852
It's not up to me.

313
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,722
Merry Christmas!

314
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,611
We can't stay long
because my mother's watching the kids.

315
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,332
Ramon, you shaved. You look so young.

316
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:13,684
-We brought some presents for the boys.
-Thank you. You're so sweet.

317
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,570
Just little things. Where are they?

318
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,406
Augusto's asleep. Julio's in the den
watching The Grinch...

319
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:20,404
for about the thousandth time.

320
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:23,363
I'll just put these under the tree.

321
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:28,331
Oh, please!
You haven't gotten that wall fixed yet?

322
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:31,132
Ramon would have had it finished by now.

323
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:34,528
What possessed you to make fig pudding?

324
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,685
It sounded Christmassy.

325
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,970
Well, it looks like throw up.

326
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,251
None of it was very good.

327
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,404
Be nice.

328
00:24:43,493 --> 00:24:45,051
Make better stuff.

329
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,451
How about
if we sing some Christmas carols?

330
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,483
Come on, I got a CD.
We can all sing along to it.

331
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,529
You've gotta be kidding me.

332
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,604
Come on, we'll scare the neighbors.

333
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,729
Okay, you two sing songs.

334
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:01,691
I'm gonna go get a Ding Dong
and watch The Simpsons.

335
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,325
-Motherfuck!
-Keith, relax.

336
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:09,847
I just wanted her to have a good Christmas,
you know?

337
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,652
After everything that she's been through.

338
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:17,723
You've been through a lot yourself lately.
You can afford to cut yourself some slack.

339
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,367
It doesn't mean you're a doormat.

340
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:35,246
-Are you sleeping any better?
-Not really.

341
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:38,608
I was reading an article
on post-traumatic stress...

342
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,002
I'm not suffering from anything, David.

343
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:44,051
What happened, happened.
It's a part of my job.

344
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,805
Let's just move on.

345
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:01,243
Why don't you and Taylor come to my house
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?

346
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,211
-Why?
-Because I'd like for you to be there.

347
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,361
Then why'd you wait until the night before
to ask me?

348
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:10,286
Because my mom didn't bring it up
until yesterday.

349
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:11,692
Your mother.

350
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:15,806
Jesus, Keith, all I did was invite you over
for Christmas dinner.

351
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:21,132
I don't think Taylor's quite ready
for something like this yet.

352
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:24,645
Are you sure Taylor's the one
who's not ready?

353
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:33,604
Just help me pick out a few poinsettias,
and we can be on our way to church.

354
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:35,047
Dear God!

355
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:37,206
What happened?

356
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,325
Oh, my goodness!

357
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,688
-Hello, Ruthie.
-Were you robbed?

358
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,205
-Did they hurt you?
-I am hurt, yes.

359
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,772
Where are you hurt?

360
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:56,845
There was fight. They break my legs.

361
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:01,370
We have to get you to the hospital.
Claire, back the car up to the door.

362
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:14,642
Mom?

363
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,169
You should take that down.

364
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,289
No. I love it.

365
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,805
-You look so mysterious.
-It's kind of ghoulish.

366
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,493
I don't like to think of myself
in that way anymore.

367
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:31,962
Then you'll just have to take
a new picture for me...

368
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,771
of how you feel now.

369
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,126
I know!

370
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:41,610
You should take Brenda
and Nate's wedding photos.

371
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:47,366
We're engaged.

372
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,085
Congratulations.

373
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,685
That is so great.

374
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,402
Thank you.

375
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:03,963
I love it when people
who really should get married do.

376
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:10,046
It doesn't happen that often, you know.

377
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,250
Now, you just hush.

378
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,446
It's true.

379
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,563
I can't believe she got Billy
out of the hospital...

380
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:25,121
so she would not have
to spend Christmas alone.

381
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:26,931
Fucking evil bitch.

382
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:30,971
He's not ready.

383
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:34,012
Really? I thought
he actually seemed pretty okay.

384
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:38,052
He's not okay. He's sick,
and nobody wants to deal with it.

385
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,523
Which is the way it's always fucking been!
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

386
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:45,572
I've been a fucking nursemaid
more than enough for one lifetime.

387
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,491
Merry Christmas.

388
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:07,768
You're bashful.
Don't worry. I don't see nothing.

389
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:10,051
Good morning, dear.

390
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,727
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Ruthie.

391
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:15,728
You haven't taken your painkillers.

392
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:19,408
-I hate pills. They make me crazy.
-Shut up and take them.

393
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,245
Shouldn't he be in the hospital?

394
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,882
We were there half the night
waiting for a doctor after you left.

395
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,885
-This is so hot!
-Merry Christmas, everybody.

396
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,283
He's gonna be here eight weeks?
You've gotta be kidding me.

397
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,762
That's how long he has to stay off his legs.

398
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:39,764
Mom, surely there's a better arrangement.

399
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:43,129
He has two broken legs.
What was I supposed to do with him?

400
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,488
He doesn't even have insurance.

401
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:50,006
-Then who's paying for all...
-I am.

402
00:29:55,853 --> 00:30:00,449
David, later this afternoon,
I want you to lift Nikolai into his wheelchair.

403
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:11,126
There was that time we was coming down
the big hill at Lone Pine.

404
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,001
I hit a patch of ice and went down.

405
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,925
Jesse comes barreling around that hairpin.

406
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:21,605
He seen me there in the middle of the road.

407
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:24,362
And instead of running me over...

408
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,931
he laid his bike down
and slid it into a bunch of trees.

409
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:30,004
He busted out his teeth.

410
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:34,810
'Cause that's just the kind of man
that he was.

411
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:37,572
A-fucking-men.

412
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:43,366
He was a fine friend and a good husband.

413
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:44,852
"From Jay Leno. "

414
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,845
Sure, he always sends flowers.
Never comes.

415
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,211
This world's a lot worse off without him.

416
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,083
The In-N-Out truck's out back.

417
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:00,491
We're gonna put on Jesse's favorite song...

418
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:03,133
and folks can help themselves
to some grub.

419
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:14,447
My brother lives up there,
which I've always been jealous of.

420
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,250
Once, when I was in junior high...

421
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,131
my dad was embalming someone
in the basement.

422
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:24,411
And the plumbing got backed up
and blood started squirting out of this hose.

423
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:29,005
-It was like a scene from The Shining.
-Nasty.

424
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:33,685
It was the first time I really thought about
what they did down there.

425
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:39,487
-Hello.
-Mom, this is Toby.

426
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:42,087
-Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
-You, too, Toby.

427
00:31:42,173 --> 00:31:45,245
-Thank you for joining us today.
-Thank you for having me.

428
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:49,929
Claire, surely that's not what you're
planning to wear for Christmas dinner?

429
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:54,609
No, I've got my Laura Bush pantsuit
on underneath. I didn't want to get it dirty.

430
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,245
Please, come in.

431
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,607
So, what did you get me for Christmas?

432
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:17,442
-Who the fuck lives in Reseda?
-So, what did you get me for Christmas?

433
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:20,843
Why are you even asking me?
You've barely ever spoken to me.

434
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,767
Who else is gonna be there?

435
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,287
I always wanted a silk smoking jacket.

436
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,648
-Dad, I'm on the phone.
-Something really garish...

437
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,928
with big embroidered peacocks.

438
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:33,372
Look, I've gotta go.
Just e-mail me directions.

439
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,047
Maybe I'll show up and maybe I won't.

440
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:41,286
God, can't a person
have a phone conversation around here?

441
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,807
Somebody special, huh? What's his name?

442
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:48,326
-Gabriel. Trust me, he's not that special.
-Don't waste your time with him, kitten.

443
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:51,689
-Because you deserve somebody special.
-Right.

444
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:55,971
You wanna go with me later to the airport
and pick up your big brother?

445
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,408
I can't. I've got last-minute shopping to do...

446
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,848
Could you try to be home for dinner?

447
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:05,006
Because we hardly ever have
the whole family together, and it's....

448
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,611
Merry Christmas.

449
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:18,526
-What's going on in here?
-Biker funeral.

450
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,527
-Can't we stay down here?
-Very funny.

451
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,361
Hey, Pete.

452
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:27,409
We're about to head upstairs
and have our Christmas dinner.

453
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:28,482
So?

454
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:32,407
-You've been here all day...
-Probably gonna be here all night.

455
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:34,967
You go on and eat. We don't need you.

456
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,331
It'll be fun.
Nikolai's out of his mind on Percodan.

457
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:48,962
Well, I think that's everything.

458
00:33:56,533 --> 00:34:00,287
-Dinner looks amazing, Mrs. Fisher.
-Thank you, Toby.

459
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:05,287
Probably one of the bikers
looking for the bathroom.

460
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:06,488
Look who's here.

461
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:07,847
-Hello.
-Hey, Keith.

462
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,493
-You made it!
-Merry Christmas, everyone.

463
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,445
I hope it's okay that we came by.

464
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,969
Of course it's okay.
We're so happy you could join us.

465
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,321
Does everyone know Taylor?

466
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,927
Your mom hasn't looked at me
since she saw the ring.

467
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,731
Have some more wine.

468
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,924
Hey, Keith. Hey, Taylor.

469
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:27,130
-That's a skinny turkey.
-It's a goose.

470
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,406
This is lovely. We're all here together.

471
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,121
Keith, would you say grace for us?

472
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,487
Yeah, sure.

473
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:50,089
Lord, for food in a world
where many walk in hunger...

474
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,290
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear...

475
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,604
and for friends in a world
where many walk alone...

476
00:34:56,773 --> 00:35:00,004
we give you thanks, O Lord,
on this Christmas Day.

477
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:01,888
Amen.

478
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:08,087
-That was lovely, Keith.
-Thank you.

479
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:12,172
Here you go, Nikolai.

480
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:21,968
Your mom will always hate me.

481
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:26,561
That's because you're a woman trying
to steal her baby.

482
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,007
Whatever.

483
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,371
Toby seems nice.

484
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:38,650
Yes, Toby's very nice.

485
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,286
Not your type, huh?

486
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:46,165
A deranged psychopath?
No, I guess he isn't.

487
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:51,723
Billy told me once that...

488
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:54,449
he got so used to living with crazy people...

489
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:58,321
that when he was sharing a room
with a guy who thought he was Pinocchio...

490
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:03,089
the only thing that seemed weird about it
was that the guy pronounced it "Pino-chio. "

491
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,602
So you've been talking to Billy?

492
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:09,963
Yeah, mostly through e-mail.

493
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:13,451
-He's really funny.
-Isn't he?

494
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:43,765
I've got a huge headache.
Can we go home now?

495
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,805
Bren, I'm working.

496
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,007
I'm leaving.
Come home when you can, okay?

497
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:50,367
I promise.

498
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,087
Where do you keep your toilet plunger?

499
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:39,252
Morning, Mr. F.

500
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,688
Rico, what are you doing here?
It's Christmas Eve.

501
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,968
Yeah, I have to do Mrs. Doyle.

502
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,045
-Her viewing is this afternoon.
-Let David take care of it.

503
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,728
-No, she's pretty simple.
-That's why I want David to do her.

504
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:54,567
I like to feed him the slow pitches,
if you know what I mean.

505
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:56,722
Sure.

506
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:59,647
I'm serious, kiddo.
Get the hell out of here. Go home.

507
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:02,042
Spend the day with the little one.

508
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,921
They grow up so fast,
you gotta enjoy it while it lasts. Go on.

509
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,332
Thanks, Mr. F.

510
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:14,251
-You have a merry Christmas.
-I intend to.

511
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:33,011
-She took my kids back to her mothers'.
-What?

512
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,891
You couldn't keep your fucking mouth shut.

513
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,211
Stop it!

514
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:43,012
-Merry fucking Christmas, Rico.
-Are you okay?

515
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:45,926
-Baby?
-You fucking told her?

516
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,764
I had to. I couldn't even look her in the eye.

517
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:53,050
She was so happy yesterday.
She told me she got him a Rolex watch.

518
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,045
-She has a right to know.
-I told you not to fucking tell her!

519
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,885
I'm sorry. I had to!

520
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,005
Fucking homo!

521
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:03,011
Fucking fuck!

522
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,691
They must not like that dead man too much.

523
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:27,810
Why do you say that?

524
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,486
Because they're all so happy he's dead.

525
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:38,205
I think it's about time we get you home.

526
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:41,922
No, but it's Christmas,
and I want to watch the funeral.

527
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,561
Too bad.

528
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,369
I'm really glad you came.

529
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:51,086
Why don't you come back with us?
I could make some hot chocolate.

530
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:55,810
I got a present or two that I didn't want you
to open in mixed company.

531
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:02,243
Let me talk to Nate.
I'll see if we can wrap this up.

532
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:14,726
-I think we should start moving them out.
-No, it's Christmas.

533
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,291
-Keith asked if I wanted to go with him.
-Go.

534
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:22,771
-I've got everything under control.
-Okay.

535
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:24,807
Thanks.

536
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,602
-Merry Christmas, Nate.
-You, too.

537
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:53,370
-What do you say we get out of here?
-You're not having fun?

538
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,492
No. This is like every party my parents have,
only with better music.

539
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:01,003
Where do you want to go?

540
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:06,843
We could drive around Hancock Park
and look at the Christmas lights.

541
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:09,686
Yeah, right. Not without a carton of eggs.

542
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:15,284
Why are you so hostile?

543
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,409
-I'm not hostile.
-Yes, you are.

544
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:22,725
You act like you're incredibly put out by,
I don't know, being alive.

545
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,246
Maybe you think that's cool, but really...

546
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,364
it's just irritating.

547
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:35,008
Okay, thanks for the input,
which is totally irrelevant, but....

548
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:38,366
Apparently you need to feel all superior
or something.

549
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:41,525
I mean, if you just take a look at your life...

550
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:44,653
you really don't have that much
to be angry about.

551
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:48,965
-You don't know anything about my life.
-Yeah, and I'm not really sure I want to...

552
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:52,363
considering how you like
to shit all over everything.

553
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:55,288
You know what?

554
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:59,969
I fully support your little desire
to have a life you'd see on Nickelodeon...

555
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,405
but I don't support
you being a judgmental dick.

556
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:08,924
Maybe I should just go.

557
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:11,682
Maybe.

558
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,889
Okay. Merry Christmas.

559
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:16,721
Whatever.

560
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:27,243
I'm glad I could spend one last Christmas
with Jesse.

561
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,769
He was a crazy son of a bitch,
but I sure loved him.

562
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,006
I can tell.

563
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:40,292
God, did he know how to live!
It was full throttle all the way.

564
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:45,849
We met in Sturgis, back in '78.

565
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:51,131
I was sitting at The Broken Spoke
with the biggest badass in town.

566
00:42:51,493 --> 00:42:52,892
But Jesse...

567
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,369
he had some balls on him.

568
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,769
He walked right up to me, I'll never forget it,
and he said:

569
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:06,403
"If I don't ask you to take a ride with me
I'll regret it the rest of my life. "

570
00:43:07,453 --> 00:43:09,728
And that ride lasted 23 years.

571
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:16,883
He always said his two favorite things
were riding his hog and riding me.

572
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:20,888
And he treated us both like queens.

573
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,487
You're probably wishing
he treated himself as carefully.

574
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,929
Honey, it just wasn't in his blood.

575
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:34,603
If he were a careful man,
he might have lived longer...

576
00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:39,851
but would he have enjoyed his life as much?

577
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,572
Would I have enjoyed his life as much?

578
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,248
I had a bike in high school.

579
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,166
Had it for about a week before I wiped out.

580
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:57,289
Just fucked it up royally.

581
00:43:58,253 --> 00:44:00,483
I still have a pin in my foot.

582
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:06,564
-I never got back on a bike after that.
-I could never give it up. No way.

583
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:10,929
Closest thing to flying
without leaving the ground.

584
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:18,172
Sometimes I fool myself into thinking
I've lived my life to the fullest.

585
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:21,484
But compared to you and Jesse
I think I've got a lot to learn.

586
00:44:21,573 --> 00:44:25,930
Honey, if I were a few years younger
I'd be willing to teach you.

587
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:28,923
I just might let you.

588
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:37,490
Jesse always said you gotta live every day
like you might die tomorrow.

589
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:40,525
-'Cause you know what?
-You just might.

590
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:40,049
Here's a glass of water.

591
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:41,807
I couldn't find a bell.

592
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:44,612
So if you need me during the night,
just yell very loudly.

593
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,206
I will be fine.

594
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:49,765
Did you call the police yet to file a report?

595
00:45:50,253 --> 00:45:52,244
No, I will do that later.

596
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,169
I'll put this where you can reach it.

597
00:45:58,253 --> 00:46:01,450
-I don't like for you to do this.
-Don't be silly.

598
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:06,492
You have two broken legs,
and you need someone to take care of you.

599
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:09,565
And I'm happy to do it,
so stop making a fuss.

600
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,002
What?

601
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,247
Nothing.

602
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:19,004
What I told you before.

603
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:22,250
That you are beautiful.

604
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:25,441
Stop it.

605
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:07,362
-I had the swirl in the dip just right.
-Just one for the road.

606
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:10,490
-Airport traffic's gonna be murder.
-Then you should get going.

607
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:11,926
All right.

608
00:47:43,933 --> 00:47:47,084
I want to stay up and play
with what Santa Claus brought me.

609
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:48,606
Give it up, Taylor.

610
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:51,412
I could make you guys a cupcake
with my Easy-Bake oven.

611
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,927
He's a cop. He doesn't take bribes.

612
00:47:57,053 --> 00:47:59,772
-Merry Christmas, baby.
-Mama!

613
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:06,048
I drove all day long just so I could be here.
That's how much your mama loves you.

614
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:09,206
I love you, too, Mama. I knew you'd come.

615
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,086
Billy didn't call or e-mail me all day.

616
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:17,127
So?

617
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,928
So, you know, it's Christmas.

618
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:24,646
You didn't exactly give him
a warm greeting last night.

619
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,930
That's what I'm saying.
If he'd written me, told me he'd be there...

620
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:31,005
I wouldn't have been so freaked out
by the whole thing.

621
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:33,653
Do you ever call or e-mail him?

622
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:37,530
Yeah, I e-mailed him in the hospital
last summer...

623
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,649
but he never wrote back.

624
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:45,488
He e-mails Claire all the time.

625
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:47,082
What?

626
00:48:47,493 --> 00:48:51,532
Yeah, even while we were there,
she was running off to check her mail.

627
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:57,923
Wait, when did this start?

628
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:01,608
-Did you bring any of that reindeer cake?
-I asked you a question.

629
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:03,684
I don't know. She just told me tonight.

630
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:07,527
I don't want Billy having anything
to do with Claire, you understand that?

631
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:10,446
Why not? You said that he was okay.

632
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:14,086
He's okay enough
to walk down the street without a leash...

633
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:16,687
but he's not okay enough
to be near my sister...

634
00:49:16,773 --> 00:49:20,129
who we both know
has this fucked-up attraction to sociopaths.

635
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:23,091
-Don't tell me...
-I am telling you. He is your brother!

636
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:26,131
You keep him away.
And if you don't, I swear to God, I will!

637
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,771
What are you gonna do, Nate?

638
00:49:27,853 --> 00:49:31,971
-Challenge him to a duel?
-Brenda, would you knock it the fuck off?

639
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,204
-Why don't you wear a cowboy cap...
-Would you fucking listen to me?

640
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:37,329
Will you shut the fuck up?

641
00:49:38,293 --> 00:49:39,442
Fuck.

642
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:50,289
-It's okay.
-It's not my fault.

643
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,444
It's okay. It's all right.

644
00:50:24,213 --> 00:50:25,771
-Shit.
-Yeah?

645
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,403
I think I'm gonna have.... Shit.

646
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,611
Nate, look at me!

647
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:42,012
Get off! Get the fuck off! I'm fine!

648
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:52,885
Nate, it's okay.

649
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,372
What was that?

650
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:10,523
So what are you taking for it?

651
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:12,612
Dilantin.

652
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:17,401
It's an anti-epileptic.
It's supposed to control the seizures.

653
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:21,483
-I thought it did, until tonight.
-We'll talk to your doctor.

654
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:24,565
Maybe we can switch you
to something stronger.

655
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:28,925
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

656
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,767
Why didn't you tell me about this?

657
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:42,288
I didn't want to be a burden.

658
00:51:45,053 --> 00:51:47,089
You'll never be a burden.

659
00:51:57,173 --> 00:51:59,482
-Good morning.
-Hi.

660
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:03,728
Marilyn Johnson left that for you.

661
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:10,765
She had a belt buckle with a big skull on it.

662
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:13,490
I thought that was odd.

663
00:54:07,653 --> 00:54:09,006
English
