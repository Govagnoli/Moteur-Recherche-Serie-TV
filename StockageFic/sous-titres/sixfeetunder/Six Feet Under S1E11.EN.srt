1
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,057
Dillon.

2
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:59,904
Hey, there, buddy.
What are you doing awake so late?

3
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:05,255
- Does he look okay to you?
- He's just fussing a little, is all.

4
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,138
He doesn't look a little funny?

5
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:11,180
Of course he looks a little funny.
That's his daddy's nose.

6
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:14,265
He's just a little sleepy.

7
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,665
There's my baby's smile.

8
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:28,938
Why don't you go back to bed?
I'll be in as soon as he falls asleep.

9
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,265
You sure?

10
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,021
It's all right. Go back to sleep.

11
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,382
Okay.

12
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,321
You're still here.

13
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:54,002
- What, no breakfast?
- I've got to go to work.

14
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:00,688
You were a lot nicer online.

15
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,678
Yeah, well, people aren't
always who they seem to be.

16
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,325
Tell me about it.

17
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,572
You need to leave.

18
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,327
Now.

19
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:15,803
Whatever.

20
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,049
See you in the chat rooms...

21
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,370
..."Jim. "

22
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,247
Again.

23
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,609
Again.

24
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,095
Again!

25
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:07,491
Fucking bitch.

26
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,175
Morning, Mom.

27
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,749
Bren, Bren, if you're there, pick up,
It's Billy,

28
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,109
- Pick up the phone, Brenda,
- Fuck you.

29
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,780
Pick up the fucking phone, Please?

30
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,632
Fuck you.

31
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:58,264
Look, I need you, Bren,
Things are not good, I need you,

32
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:02,425
Brenda!
Goddamn it! Fuck!

33
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,830
Bitch,

34
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:08,468
Lovely way to wake up, huh?

35
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,750
Brenda, you're gonna have
to face him sometime.

36
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:14,597
Sometime, just not now.

37
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:18,393
Let's get major espressos,
take a walk on the beach.

38
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:21,477
Can't. I gotta get ready for my trip.

39
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,590
What trip?

40
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,189
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

41
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,234
The annual Western States
Funeral Directors Conference.

42
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:32,672
Was that today?
I thought that was months away.

43
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,191
No, just me and David
and 300 funeral directors...

44
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:38,281
...cutting loose in the city of sin.
- Why would you do that to yourself?

45
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:42,761
One: We get to attend helpful seminars
where we learn new tricks of the trade.

46
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,841
Two: We get to commiserate
with all the other sad fucks...

47
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,433
...who are being edged out by Kroehner.

48
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:52,161
Three: We have the perfect opportunity
to get in Matt Gilardi's face, tell him...

49
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,960
...we know Kroehner burned down
the house across the street.

50
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:59,076
The ongoing pissing contest.

51
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,520
That'll be good for you and David.
You'll have fun.

52
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:06,401
I don't know how much fun
he's gonna have. He's giving this...

53
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,601
...big speech about the future of
the independent funeral home.

54
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,883
David doesn't strike me as the
type of guy who gives speeches.

55
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,767
My dad was scheduled to do it.
Dave volunteered to fill in.

56
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,721
It's kind of a big deal for him.
He's pretty nervous about it.

57
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,321
- Call me from Vegas.
- I will.

58
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:31,563
Unless I'm flailing about in a pool
having sex with some showgirl.

59
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:34,242
I'll miss you.

60
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,813
Oh, fuck you!

61
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:44,770
I know this is an exceptionally
difficult time for you...

62
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:48,686
...but can you tell us what you
had in mind for your son's...

63
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:50,411
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:55,329
We're only here because the
hospital suggested we call you guys.

65
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:58,611
We're not even sure
what we're doing here.

66
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,209
He is a perfectly healthy baby.

67
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,897
Can I ask, what was the cause of...?

68
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,258
SIDS.

69
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:13,773
Yes, well, if you need to take some time
before we start making arrangements...

70
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:16,451
...that's completely understandable.
- The arrangements?

71
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,062
What arrangements?

72
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,217
For his funeral.

73
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,340
Funeral?

74
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,145
- He was only 3 weeks old.
- It might help...

75
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,895
...if you think of it less as a funeral and
more as a way of saying goodbye to him.

76
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:37,703
I don't want to say goodbye.
He just barely got here.

77
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:41,703
Of course it's difficult for anyone
to come to terms with something...

78
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:46,539
...as unexpected as this, but...
- It's not just difficult.

79
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,342
It's not even remotely possible.

80
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:55,950
Some babies are just
too good for this world.

81
00:08:57,512 --> 00:09:00,584
We'll fix things so you can spend
as much time with him as you need.

82
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,706
- How old is he?
- Barely 3 weeks.

83
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,667
SIDS?

84
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,786
Yeah.

85
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,908
- Oh, Jesus.
- You should've been here for the intake.

86
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:20,232
The parents are practically
children themselves.

87
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,905
They didn't even know they were
supposed to have a funeral.

88
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:26,952
- Welcome back, Rico.
- Thanks, Nate.

89
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:30,913
- You're sure you're up to this?
- Yeah, yeah, it's no problem.

90
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,791
We'll only be gone till Sunday.

91
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,879
If you need anything, I can hop on a
plane and be back in an hour and a half.

92
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,470
I'll be fine.

93
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,962
I have some of your T-shirts here.
They're still warm.

94
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:58,155
Mom.

95
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,602
Oh, don't let me stop you.

96
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,606
You know, I probably should take
a couple of those T-shirts with me...

97
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,244
...to Las Vegas.

98
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,608
- David, I want to ask you something.
- I'm really kind of in a hurry here.

99
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,360
I just wanted to know...

100
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,965
- Are you...?
- Mom.

101
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,768
Can we talk about this
when I get back from Las Vegas?

102
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:47,044
Yes, of course.
That's a lovely idea.

103
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:51,169
We'll talk about it when you
get back from Las Vegas.

104
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:55,330
Mrs. Dimas?

105
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,686
It's Claire Fisher.

106
00:10:57,137 --> 00:11:00,369
I'm sorry to keep calling,
I was just wondering if you've...

107
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,490
...heard anything from Gabe yet.

108
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,535
What?

109
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,011
When?

110
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,858
Oh, my God.

111
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,369
Is he okay?

112
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,255
What hospital?

113
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,658
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Dimas.
Thank you.

114
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:38,261
- You are late. 10 minutes.
- I know, I'm sorry.

115
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:43,495
Is okay. I just want you to know that
I notice these kinds of things.

116
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:46,585
It won't happen again, Nikolai.

117
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:48,506
We have to talk.

118
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,666
- It's about your work.
- I said I was sorry for being late.

119
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,542
No, no, no, has nothing
to do with being late.

120
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,147
Is about how you arrange the flowers.

121
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,988
- What?
- There have been complaints...

122
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,068
...from some of the customers.
- There have not.

123
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:08,982
- Afraid so.
- Ruth. You are not so good at arranging.

124
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,944
- I am too.
- No, you're not.

125
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,542
From now on, Robbie will
handle arrangement...

126
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,871
...and you will work the register
and help with the books.

127
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,985
I don't want to help with the books!

128
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,345
I helped my husband with
the books for 30 years.

129
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:25,230
I want to do flower arrangements. Tell
me what's wrong with my arrangements.

130
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:29,475
Not all arrangements
are for funerals, cupcake.

131
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:33,076
You think my arrangements
look funereal?

132
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:37,431
It's like Robbie said. There have been
a few complaints from some customers.

133
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:40,152
No. We done talking now.

134
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,109
Robbie will do the arrangement,
you will work on the register.

135
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,317
You gonna nail Gilardi for
the arson job in your speech?

136
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:59,161
- No.
- Why not?

137
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,639
Let's think.
Possible libel charges, maybe.

138
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,039
- Mind if I say something to him?
- Yes. Don't.

139
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,279
Pussy.

140
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,158
Nate, do we have any evidence
against him? No.

141
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,481
Apparently the police don't either.

142
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,962
Look, I don't want you picking
a fight with Gilardi.

143
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,682
Why not? You basically threatened
to kill him that one time.

144
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,277
- I'm coming with you.
- Great.

145
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,327
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,209
- I need to get out of here.
- All right.

147
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,845
- Oh, my God, is that a penis?
- Rico.

148
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:46,524
- I'm sorry. It is, isn't it?
- Your wife doesn't want me to say.

149
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:49,806
- The baby's okay, right?
- Baby's fine.

150
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:53,165
But you have mild to
moderate preeclampsia.

151
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:56,965
- What is preeclampsia?
- A $ 10 word for prenatal hypertension.

152
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:59,771
Your blood pressure is a little
higher than we'd like.

153
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:02,251
Could cause some problems
if it gets out of hand...

154
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:05,016
...but we're not gonna let that happen.
- What kind of problems?

155
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:09,005
Let's not even go there.
This baby's fine.

156
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,051
Worse comes to worst, we go in
a little early, we do a C-section.

157
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,976
We'll take a look at your labs, check
your blood pressure in a day or two...

158
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:22,176
...and see how we're doing then.
Until then, I want you on strict bed rest.

159
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,573
I really wouldn't worry about this.
The baby is fine.

160
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:41,420
If you came looking to collect more
money for Anthony's funeral...

161
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,819
...I'm all tapped out at the moment.

162
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,219
This one...

163
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,893
...shoots up too much speed and heroin.

164
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,903
Now I'm stuck paying
for this fancy-ass hotel room...

165
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:56,623
...to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while
they keep him under observation.

166
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,424
I'm going out for coffee and smokes.

167
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,907
Speed and heroin?

168
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,341
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd try something different.

169
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:19,267
- Different like with a needle in your arm?
- Hey, what is this?!

170
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:23,068
Twenty fucking questions?
I've been through this already, all right?

171
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,423
With the doctors, with the police,
with my mom.

172
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,547
- Now I gotta put your mind at ease too?
- I'm sorry.

173
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:33,345
I would've been fine if you had just
minded your own fucking business.

174
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:36,912
Well, excuse me for giving a shit!

175
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:48,994
This wasn't an accident, was it?

176
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,315
I wish you would just
fucking leave already.

177
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,994
Fine. Here.

178
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,476
"The emerging role of funeral directors
in mass aviation disasters. "

179
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,402
That sounds like fun.

180
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,721
Do you realize how many of these
seminars are sponsored by Kroehner?

181
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,404
Who's "Jasmine Brecker"?

182
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:29,520
She's either a federal judge or a
sex surrogate. I haven't decided yet.

183
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,639
- You got any matches?
- Sure.

184
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,281
Thank you.

185
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:38,686
Okay, boys. Let's mingle.

186
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,838
When in Rome.

187
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,482
I think maybe my expectations
of this trip were a little high.

188
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,451
Oh, great. Happy hour.

189
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,652
Well, well. The Fisher brothers.

190
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:01,606
You know, I wondered
if you'd even bother to show.

191
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:06,004
I understand you'll be speaking
tomorrow in place of your father.

192
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:08,206
What was your topic again?

193
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,412
The future of independent funeral homes.

194
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:14,211
Well, I'm certainly
looking forward to that.

195
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:18,690
I'd invite you boys to the Kroehner
party at the Luxor, but...

196
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:20,296
...it's only for affiliates.

197
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,887
Damn.
Because we'd really like to be there.

198
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:25,612
I'm sure you corporate lackeys
really know how to party.

199
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:27,650
Have fun with the other
dinosaurs, boys.

200
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:31,291
Oh, Matt, I have something for you.

201
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,968
This is a pack of matches.

202
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,772
This is for a can of lighter fluid.

203
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:40,573
Next time you need to unload some
cumbersome real estate, you'll be all set.

204
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:51,019
- Nate, that was not smart.
- I should've set his fucking hair on fire.

205
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:53,454
Bottoms up.

206
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:14,144
I love Las Vegas. It has to be
the most artificial place on earth.

207
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:19,378
- You think so? More than Disneyland?
- Oh, come on, more than Japan.

208
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,982
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,751
What are all these little cartoon
explosions all over their butts?

210
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:30,671
- They look like they're farting.
- Yeah. Look, coupons.

211
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,701
Hey, Dave, you wanna get some of that
famous Las Vegas $4.99 prime rib?

212
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:40,668
I have it on good authority it's just as
good as the $6.99 prime rib over there.

213
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:42,672
No, I think I'll just head up to my room...

214
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,911
...order some room service,
make an early night of it.

215
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:46,304
You sure?

216
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,315
Yeah, I should work
on my speech anyway.

217
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:52,594
Okay. Well, we'll see you in the morning.

218
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:56,153
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- Yeah, not likely.

219
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,996
I have two words for you:

220
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:01,315
- Lap. Dance.
- Yeah, who says I want a lap dance?

221
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:05,273
- Who says it's for you, baby?
- Kinky.

222
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:28,993
- I thought I told you to leave.
- I drove all the way out here to Barstow.

223
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:32,038
If you think I'm gonna turn around and
drive back, you're seriously whacked.

224
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:35,716
- This is like Bumfuck, Egypt out here.
- You spent the night?

225
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,440
Yeah, I slept in my car.

226
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:45,478
- My mom still here?
- No, she went out for more cigarettes.

227
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,480
Did you say anything to her about...?

228
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,800
No.

229
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,720
Are you gonna?

230
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,525
I haven't decided.

231
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:04,564
- You hungry?
- No.

232
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,605
I can't eat this hospital shit.
It all tastes the same.

233
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:08,928
Here.

234
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,649
I got you an Egg McMuffin because
I know they're your favorite.

235
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,365
How is it?

236
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,524
Fucking cold.

237
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,296
But good.

238
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,212
Thanks.

239
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:10,097
In this class, we're gonna be working
on freeform summer arrangements.

240
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,184
And if we have any time at the end
of class, I'm not promising...

241
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:16,106
...because I want us to get
to our breathing exercises...

242
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:20,859
...but if we have time, we might try
a spiky arrangement or two.

243
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:25,824
But first we're gonna start by doing
a little work treating our stems.

244
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:29,739
And we're gonna start by working
with our woody stems...

245
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,503
...because they can be a little on the
tricky side and require the most TLC.

246
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,429
Tough loving care.

247
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:42,385
Okay, let's start with an azalea,
one of my favorites.

248
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:46,229
Starting an inch or two
from the bottom of the stem...

249
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,153
...and if it's a thick stem,
we really have to smash them...

250
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:52,391
...we split the stem vertically.

251
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,712
Does anyone know why we do this?

252
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:59,911
Anyone? Yes.

253
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:03,315
- So it will draw more water?
- Very good.

254
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:07,510
Did everyone hear that?
So it will draw more water.

255
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:12,873
Okay. Does everyone have
their hammers? Let's begin.

256
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,041
You're supposed to be in bed.

257
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:33,393
I needed to get some turkey franks
and milk for Julio.

258
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,357
Why didn't you call me? I could've
stopped home on my way from work.

259
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,158
- He has a snack at 3:30.
- Why didn't you call your sister?

260
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,799
She just got two days
on a new Nicolas Cage movie.

261
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:45,759
She plays this hooker who witnesses
a murder, then gets raped and killed.

262
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:49,276
She's got lines and everything! She
wants me to come visit her on the set.

263
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:50,556
Well, you're supposed to be in bed.

264
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,327
I got bored and went to the market.
What's the big deal?

265
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,122
- What are you doing home anyway?
- I came home for lunch.

266
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:59,604
- I was worried.
- Rico, please. I'm fine.

267
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,640
I'm not just worried about you.

268
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,525
Okay.
This is about the baby at work.

269
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,520
I just...
I can't do it.

270
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:14,049
Of course you can.

271
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:20,204
He looks like...

272
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:22,449
Like he's sleeping.

273
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,851
Like a baby who's fallen asleep.

274
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:31,687
He was 3 weeks old.
There was nothing wrong with him.

275
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:35,372
And then, just like that...

276
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,771
...he dies.

277
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,885
For no reason.

278
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:43,290
How can that be?

279
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:48,175
How can the beginning and end
be so damn close together?

280
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,333
And now I've got this real bad feeling.

281
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,171
I haven't done a baby
since Julio was born.

282
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,770
David always does them.

283
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:09,460
- So make David do this one.
- David's in Vegas until tomorrow.

284
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,542
The viewing is this afternoon.

285
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:21,298
Some babies just aren't meant
for this world, Rico.

286
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:25,426
But this one is.

287
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:37,986
Turn to page seven
in your notebooks...

288
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:40,465
...we'll go step by step
through the most challenging...

289
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,108
...cranial facial reconstruction
I ever faced.

290
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:47,779
If we could go to
the next slide, please.

291
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,984
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus.

292
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:59,230
- That shit is fucked up.
- Nate, this is Chloe Yorkin.

293
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:02,506
The job Federico left us
to do for Kroehner?

294
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,990
Oh, God.
That is like fucking science fiction.

295
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:10,107
The first question my team
and I asked ourselves was not...

296
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:13,114
...as it might have been at a
facility with less resources...

297
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:17,151
...can we do this?
- They don't even credit Rico by name.

298
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,430
Oh, man, he's gonna be furious.

299
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,596
Oh, God.

300
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,950
Well, that is a very generous
offer, Roger...

301
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,995
...but unfortunately I am in a relationship
at the moment. If I was...

302
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,396
Deal me in.

303
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:40,471
Jesus, Billy.

304
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:43,720
Hold on. Hey!
So where's your boyfriend?

305
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,357
What are you doing here?

306
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,322
I love Vegas.
You know I love Vegas.

307
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:52,040
And sometimes when my sister isn't
there when I need her, I hop in my car...

308
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,634
...start driving, wind up here.
- Billy, you're lying.

309
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,314
I'm really not.
I just saw you at the blackjack table.

310
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,596
- It was a total coincidence.
- You're a fucking liar.

311
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:03,356
You're a selfish, manipulative,
narcissistic liar.

312
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:11,484
- What did Mom and Dad tell you?
- They told me that you made a bomb.

313
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,318
That's fucking hilarious.
So now I'm like, what, a terrorist?

314
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,646
"Billy Mc Veigh"?

315
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:23,722
They're fucking liars, Brenda!

316
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:26,890
They hate each other and they're
miserable and they're jealous of us...

317
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,367
...and they want us to hate
each other too. So they lie to us!

318
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:32,804
No, they lied to me, you lied to me. You
let me believe you tried to kill yourself.

319
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,162
Do you know how fucked that is?

320
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,683
You know what?
I was so fucking drugged up...

321
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,612
...I don't even really
remember what happened.

322
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,692
Dad showed me what you wrote.

323
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,052
I was kidding, okay?

324
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,456
It wasn't serious.

325
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:56,176
Do you have any idea
what I gave up for you?

326
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:59,496
Because I thought that if you tried
to kill yourself again and succeeded...

327
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,657
...I could tell myself that I did
everything I could to save you.

328
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,293
And you did.

329
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,412
- You've saved me every day since then.
- Well, fuck you!

330
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:11,658
- Brenda, don't fucking walk away...
- I'm having a life. Just back off!

331
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:14,137
Hey, you heard her! Now, fuck off!

332
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,419
Nice.

333
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,981
Are you okay?

334
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:32,385
He followed us here.

335
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:38,060
I hate to say it,
but I'm not entirely surprised.

336
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,903
Very nice.

337
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,905
Luscious.

338
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:25,789
This is a little...

339
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,350
...tight.

340
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:31,107
- Tight?
- You're not breathing right.

341
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:34,072
- I'm not?
- You're breathing from here...

342
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,873
...when you should be
breathing from here.

343
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,116
- But my lungs are here.
- Of course they are.

344
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,197
I'm speaking metaphorically.

345
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,757
If you breathe from up here, your
arrangements will come from up here.

346
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:49,592
If you breathe from down here, your
arrangements will come from down here.

347
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:52,362
- And that's good?
- That's very good.

348
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,315
- Do you do yoga?
- No.

349
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:57,755
Okay. Would everybody grab
a yoga mat in the next room?

350
00:28:57,964 --> 00:29:02,641
We're gonna do some breathing
exercises before we break for dinner.

351
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:06,754
You're a bit of a control freak,
aren't you?

352
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:09,799
No, I'm not. I don't think I am.

353
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,325
- Am I?
- Yes.

354
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:14,360
And control freaks
do not make good arrangers.

355
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:17,287
Believe me, I know.
I used to be a control freak too.

356
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:20,196
But you know what?
You can get over it.

357
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:23,162
All you have to do is learn to breathe.

358
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,004
- Are you on antidepressants?
- No!

359
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,759
Well, Lord knows I'd be lost
without my Saint John's Wort.

360
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:37,251
There are countless challenges facing
independent funeral homes today:

361
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:41,332
Changing social attitudes
toward death and dying...

362
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:46,324
...economic hardship in communities
both large and small...

363
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:05,166
Oh, what the hell.

364
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:10,248
We all know what the real challenge is.

365
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,658
How are you doing today, Mr. Gilardi?

366
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,412
- Fine, thank you.
- Glad to hear it.

367
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,695
We all know of a certain organization...

368
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:25,939
...that controls the flow
of prep-room supplies...

369
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:31,854
...caskets, cemetery property and
flowers to everyone in this room.

370
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,624
And believe me, that organization
will stoop to almost any means...

371
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,292
...to make sure that the independent
funeral home has no future.

372
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:38,858
But hear me out.

373
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:44,056
My father was in this business
for over 35 years.

374
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,904
He...

375
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:50,416
He thought it was okay to tell people
about a cheaper casket.

376
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:53,620
He didn't always try
to talk people out of cremation.

377
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:56,023
There were even times
where I actually heard him say:

378
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:58,538
"To hell with our profit margin on this. "

379
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,950
These words are heresy
to a certain organization...

380
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,742
...because profit is all it cares about...

381
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,626
...no matter how many PR-motivated
seminars it sponsors.

382
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:09,981
That organization wants us
independents to believe...

383
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:12,581
...that we cannot afford to be
like my father anymore.

384
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,510
Well, I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

385
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,546
Don't get me wrong, my father
worried about the bottom line too...

386
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,221
...but he worried more
about other things.

387
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:22,345
Like comforting people...

388
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,909
...and helping them face profound loss.

389
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:33,154
Maybe now more than ever, we should
all try to be a little more like him.

390
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,596
Thank you.

391
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:06,163
- Very motivational.
- Good job.

392
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,797
How'd I do?

393
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:13,044
Are you kidding? You kicked
some serious ass, you big freak.

394
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:21,603
You didn't come home last night.

395
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,599
Well, it's not like it was a school night.

396
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,286
Would you like me to
make you something to eat?

397
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:31,923
Yeah, that'd be great.

398
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,768
Do you think I'm a control freak?

399
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:45,121
Yeah.

400
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:50,968
- Where do you think David gets it from?
- Your father was very controlling.

401
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:53,971
- Not like you.
- That's not nice.

402
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:55,442
You asked.

403
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:02,492
You're not as bad as you used to be.

404
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:06,573
May I ask where you were all night?

405
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,811
In Barstow.

406
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,133
What in God's name
were you doing there?

407
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,407
I was visiting a friend of mine
who's in the hospital.

408
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,449
Who?

409
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:19,486
Gabriel Dimas.

410
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:24,413
- The young man whose brother...
- Yeah.

411
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,294
What was he doing in the hospital?

412
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:31,780
He OD'd.

413
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,541
Good Lord.

414
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,499
Claire...

415
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:43,859
...he's obviously a deeply disturbed boy.

416
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:48,616
You need to steer clear of him.
Let his family deal with this.

417
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:52,738
Well, let's take stock
for a second, shall we?

418
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,705
His little brother's dead.
His father's dead.

419
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:58,858
His stepfather beat him up...

420
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:02,947
...his white-trash mother who smokes
like a fish could give a shit.

421
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:05,787
That leaves no one.

422
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:10,099
Was his overdose an accident?

423
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,825
- Of course it was an accident.
- Because sometimes these things aren't.

424
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,104
And if it wasn't, it could happen again.
There's an 80%/% chance that someone...

425
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,950
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

426
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:23,302
I hope, for his sake, you're right.

427
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,191
But if you're wrong, Claire...

428
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:30,863
I don't want you
getting too close to him.

429
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:41,989
- Thank you.
- No problem.

430
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,834
Look at him.

431
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,947
- He's a star.
- Hi. Really great.

432
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:50,390
I just want you guys to meet someone.

433
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:55,915
This is my brother and partner
Nathaniel Jr. And his...

434
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,112
- Jasmine.
- Hey, there, I'm Neil Schaeger.

435
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,356
- Schaeger and Sons, from Flagstaff.
- Raymond Dooley.

436
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,870
Dooley and Moss Funeral Home,
Reno, Nevada.

437
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:07,231
Moss couldn't be here. Bladder cancer.

438
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,718
That was a hell of a speech
David made.

439
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:12,914
Almost made me cry when those
Kroehner bastards got up and left.

440
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:16,798
Those fuckers have been trying
to buy us out for five goddamn years.

441
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,120
Your father was a good man.

442
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:20,519
Yes, he was.

443
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:23,403
Y'all don't mind if we drag your
little brother out with us, do you?

444
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:26,324
- I really shouldn't.
- Gotta let us buy you a drink at least.

445
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,517
- You're our hero.
- Well, maybe just a quick one.

446
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,035
Quick one, my Aunt Fanny.
We're gonna make a night of it.

447
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:33,124
Hey, you want to go with?
The more the merrier.

448
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:38,167
Oh, I don't think so.
We're just gonna lay low tonight.

449
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:43,363
- Yeah, but you guys have fun.
- Okay, your loss.

450
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:03,766
Excuse me.

451
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:07,533
We'd just like to thank you...

452
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:10,767
...very much.
- He looks so beautiful.

453
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:12,567
I'm glad you're pleased.

454
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:14,891
Mike's mom and dad
drove down from Salinas.

455
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:19,772
Yeah. They never got
a chance to meet him.

456
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:23,572
Now it's almost like they did.

457
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:29,094
- Do you have children?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

458
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:35,057
I have a 4-year-old boy and my...

459
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,613
Yes.

460
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,933
We'd like to be alone with him
for a little while, if that's okay.

461
00:36:45,142 --> 00:36:48,373
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Please take as much time as you need.

462
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:51,299
Thanks.

463
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,621
- Say fromage!
- Fromage.

464
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,303
Hey, you were really
great today, Nate.

465
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:25,582
Standing up to Billy.
I felt like some white-trash girl...

466
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,669
...whose boyfriend
was the biggest badass in town.

467
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,068
- Your brother's seriously ill, Brenda.
- Yeah, whatever.

468
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:36,743
But you know what?
We're in faux Paris, so let's party.

469
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,006
Hi.

470
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:18,686
- I'm Amber.
- David.

471
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:22,968
You're a lucky guy, David.

472
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:24,654
- I am?
- Very.

473
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:29,085
Your friend just bought you
a lap dance with me.

474
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:35,695
- Excuse me?
- So where you from, David?

475
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:40,611
- Boston.
- That is the coldest place I ever lived.

476
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,215
What part of town you live in?

477
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,289
Downtown.

478
00:39:55,902 --> 00:39:58,974
Are you even enjoying this at all?

479
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:02,820
- Yeah, I'm loving it, why?
- Because...

480
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:05,413
...your dick isn't responding one bit.

481
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,181
Look, I'm gay. It's not you.

482
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:14,419
It never is me.

483
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:20,384
Well, if you're gay, you won't mind
if we cut this one short, will you?

484
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:27,785
What happened, buddy?
Popped your cork too soon?

485
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:30,299
He's gay, you idiots.

486
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:42,104
- I wish you would've told us that.
- Yeah, believe me, so do I.

487
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,389
Thanks for a lovely evening, fellas.

488
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:53,270
Great. Great, I'll meet you out front.
Thank you.

489
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,837
Hello, Brad.

490
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:35,732
Very nice.

491
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:12,818
- Jim.
- Brad?

492
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:16,019
Yeah.

493
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:19,061
You look...

494
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,825
...different from the ad.
- Well, that's from '91.

495
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:25,098
I've been meaning to update it.
I've just been...

496
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:29,094
- You know, busy.
- You're...

497
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:32,982
- Almost 20 minutes late.
- Previous appointment ran a little over.

498
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:35,748
What can I say, Brad's a busy boy.

499
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,586
- How much...?
- You're not a cop, right?

500
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:41,542
- No, I'm not a cop.
- Because if you are, that's entrapment.

501
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,421
I'm not a cop.

502
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,419
You are kind of cute.

503
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,781
Thank you.

504
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:55,981
$200 gets you a pony ride all
the way to the moon and back.

505
00:43:56,832 --> 00:43:58,026
Up front.

506
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:00,551
Now would be a good time.

507
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:05,103
- All I've got is 80.
- Fine, fine.

508
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:07,832
Fine.

509
00:44:17,076 --> 00:44:20,672
- Where do you want to go, Jimbo?
- I don't know.

510
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:22,550
Where are you staying?

511
00:44:23,278 --> 00:44:27,033
- I'm not taking you back to my room.
- Okay.

512
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,799
Don't wanna wake the wife, I get it.

513
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,956
Then...

514
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,191
Where do you want to do this?

515
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,678
Oh, yeah.

516
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:42,919
Oh, yeah. Good.

517
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:47,796
- Oh, yeah, Jimbo, give it to me.
- Yeah.

518
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:50,677
Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:54,433
- You like that, don't you, faggot?
- Oh, yeah.

520
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:03,121
Oh, no.

521
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:09,445
Okay, boys, party's over.

522
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:22,604
All right. When you're done there, Sally,
you're allowed one phone call.

523
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,250
Your stuff.

524
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:14,491
He's all yours.

525
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:15,895
Thanks.

526
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:28,060
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

527
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:31,060
Are you okay?

528
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,741
I'm fine.

529
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:39,064
You didn't think you'd get caught
doing something this fucked up?

530
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:40,939
- I wasn't thinking.
- Clearly.

531
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:47,788
Were you using condoms?

532
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:53,221
I was drunk. I was very drunk.

533
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:56,388
You're lucky I had a couple
connections with the Vegas P.D.

534
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,663
All the charges are being dropped
and your file's being tossed.

535
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:03,068
- Next time you won't be this lucky.
- Thank you for doing this.

536
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:06,787
David, I did this because I love you.
But I won't ever do it again.

537
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,584
This shit isn't good for either one of us.

538
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,193
You need to get yourself some help.

539
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:24,184
Goodbye, David.

540
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,074
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Something's not right with the baby.

541
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:50,954
What? Come on, let's go.

542
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:54,711
I'll call your sister, okay?
We'll leave Julio over at her house.

543
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:07,036
Hey, you.

544
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,316
Late night?

545
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:12,596
Not really.

546
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:16,117
We tried calling your room this morning,
you didn't seem to be in.

547
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,397
I must have been in the shower.

548
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,406
Did you have fun with the guys?

549
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:26,399
I suppose so.
From a purely anthropological standpoint.

550
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:29,487
- Do you mind driving?
- Okay.

551
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:33,000
Thank you.
Let's get the hell out of here.

552
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:38,806
I think somebody got lucky last night.

553
00:48:52,654 --> 00:48:54,885
This is good, yeah.

554
00:48:55,095 --> 00:48:59,328
- You have been practicing.
- Practicing?

555
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:03,687
- I am a graduate.
- Cool.

556
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:08,494
Learning Annex. Wow! I hear
that school's really hard to get into.

557
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,973
Robbie, go take care of customer.

558
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:14,489
Today Ruth is going
to do all the arrangement.

559
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:17,498
Nikolai, get your head out
of your pants for two seconds.

560
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,894
That diploma means nothing.

561
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,739
It just means she's plunked down
a couple hundred dollars.

562
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,660
Have you got diploma
from flower class?

563
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:29,060
I have been arranging professionally
for almost 20 years.

564
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:33,779
Good. Today Ruth does arrangement.

565
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:56,458
Where's your mom?

566
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:01,901
She drove home today
because she had to go into work.

567
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:06,545
They said I might be getting out
of here this afternoon, though.

568
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,626
What are you...?

569
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,629
I love you.

570
00:50:33,555 --> 00:50:35,990
I love you too.

571
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,714
There's an adorable shot of you.

572
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,514
There's like three of you
with that cowboy-hat guy.

573
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,269
Oh, yeah?
By the way, I slept with him.

574
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,799
Was that wrong?

575
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,515
Oh, man. You took one of me
in the shower? Come on.

576
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:01,713
You looked so cute, I had to.

577
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:07,721
What?

578
00:51:07,923 --> 00:51:10,835
Come on, it can't be that bad.

579
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:24,961
Oh, fuck.

580
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,965
Oh, fuck, Billy!

581
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:32,716
Oh, shit.

582
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,891
Vitals are good.

583
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:51,969
Okay, we're almost there.

584
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:54,732
- How we doing, Mrs. Diaz?
- Fine.

585
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,651
- Almost got him.
- Him?

586
00:51:56,853 --> 00:51:59,926
That's right. I hate to spoil the surprise,
but you have another son.

587
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:04,571
It's a boy, baby. Did you hear that?
I knew it was gonna be a boy.

588
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:06,527
Shut up.

589
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:10,808
Heart rate's dropping.
Okay, let's get him out.

590
00:52:11,016 --> 00:52:12,608
Pull the catheter.

591
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:13,966
Here you go.

592
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:18,211
- Is the cord compressed?
- Yes. Clamp.

593
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:25,168
Breathe. Come on.

594
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:26,852
- Okay.
- Suction.

595
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,897
- Get the table ready.
- Where are they taking him?

596
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:39,174
Just to heat him up a little.
Have you picked out a name yet?

597
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:45,215
Augusto, after my father. Wait,
is there something wrong with my baby?

598
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:49,212
We're just gonna warm him up,
make sure his airways are clear.

599
00:53:00,746 --> 00:53:04,217
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's gonna be just fine.

600
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:07,101
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

601
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:11,348
- You swear on a stack of Bibles?
- Okay, Augusto.

602
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:13,028
Time to meet the parents.

603
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,624
Hello, Augusto.

604
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,221
He looks just like Julio.

605
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:31,345
- He is so pissed off.
- Can I grab him?

606
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:35,551
Okay. Here we go.

607
