1
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,432
Hello!

2
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,278
Hello!

3
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,276
Damn it.

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,949
If it hasn't worked for the last
45 minutes, it's not gonna work now.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,912
That goddamn night guard
must be drunk and deaf.

6
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,473
I'll try my phone.

7
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,432
We've already tried.
There's no reception up here.

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,550
Just wait for the rescue teams.

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,799
Shit.

10
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,638
- Shit.
- Don't do that.

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,557
- You'll make it worse!
- We have to.

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,593
Let's all try to open this door once more.
Give it everything we got.

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,312
OK, go.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,594
We're gonna drop ten floors and die!

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,553
We could use a little more
Bruce Willis attitude, mister.

16
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,156
Let me out. Here.
Just let me out!

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,509
- Will you just let me out?
- So obnoxious!

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,913
You'll be fine.

19
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,793
- Get up there, we'll give you a boost.
- OK.

20
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,274
I'll take the stairs. I'll get some help.

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,038
My God!

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,877
We're all gonna die!

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,471
- Somebody grab my hand.
- No, she should go first! Go.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,919
Come on.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,713
- Oh, my God!
- Ken, get in here!

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,115
No! Let me go.
Don't pull me back in!

27
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,428
Oh my God! What happened?
Go find out what happened!

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,233
Let's both go.
I think we should stay together.

29
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,271
I'm too scared.

30
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,198
George, the glass, put on your slippers.

31
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,276
What did you do?

32
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,272
I'm awake.

33
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,077
You were whimpering
and paddling with your feet.

34
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,395
What were you dreaming about?

35
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,795
I don't remember.

36
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,152
Yeah, it's at the Bellandi Gallery, downtown.

37
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Where Jimmy was.
You got my postcard, right?

38
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,314
OK, call me if you need directions.

39
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,830
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
Bring cool people.

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,270
Hi, Edie. It's Claire.

41
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,792
Listen, tomorrow is my show.

42
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,233
I know you probably won't be there
but I wish you would be there.

43
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,876
OK, never mind.

44
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,998
- I broke up with Russell.
- Why?

45
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,795
Why do you think? He's a big drama queen.
Everything's so heavy and negative.

46
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,516
- He's such a fucking victim.
- Yeah, really.

47
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,790
He got in my face about your show.

48
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,190
God, he's unbelievable.

49
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,995
I was like, whoever's idea it was,
and I don't fucking care, Claire ran with it.

50
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,156
I was like, adapt, dude.

51
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,430
Thank you for defending my honour.

52
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,952
I brought you a present. Happy fame.

53
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,553
My God, is that cocaine?

54
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,398
- This is so disco!
- Let's do a few lines.

55
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,072
Shit, I want to, but I have to go to my gallery
and meet some, like, huge movie star.

56
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,554
Seriously? What movie star?

57
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,752
I don't know. Some, like,
celebrity woman wants to buy my stuff.

58
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,839
- You're getting way too cool for me.
- Fuck you.

59
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,188
No, it's a fishtail.

60
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,595
- It's a fishtail!
- Yes.

61
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,078
I'm calling the lawyer again.

62
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,714
You're too clever. He already told you.

63
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,039
I know he already said that Barb has no right
to custody, but there's an article on the web.

64
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,313
You're the father. Barb's the aunt.
Maya's staying right here where she is.

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,271
You're not taking this seriously.

66
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,154
I am, but it doesn't do us any good
to live in this constant state of panic.

67
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,395
That's easy for you. Maya's not yours.

68
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,989
Yes, can you reach Mr Sutcliffe
for me, please? Nate Fisher.

69
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,158
- It's an emergency.
- This is about your emotions, not Maya.

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,795
Would you stop using the therapy voice?
It drives me nuts.

71
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,956
How would you know? You've never tried it.

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,276
I don't need it.
It's not my fault there's always a disaster.

73
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,949
What's with this book? It's macabre.
Just get rid of it or put it away.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,879
Michaela gave it to me to give to David.
I keep forgetting about it.

75
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,118
- I really wish you'd consider it.
- Everything is under control!

76
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,991
Of course it is.

77
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,158
Number three.

78
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,555
Excuse me?

79
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,716
That's him, number three.

80
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,279
David.

81
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,153
David, it's almost eleven.
Are you gonna get up?

82
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,553
Yeah.

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,032
What?

84
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,868
I'm still replaying that
fucking look he gave me.

85
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,834
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No, I don't want to talk about it.

86
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,758
I've told you about it 900 times.

87
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,828
I've told my therapist about it 900 times. I want
to fucking move on and leave it behind me.

88
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,190
So do it. You can.

89
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,357
No, I can't. I'm fucking stuck.

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,398
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

91
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,229
I'd tell him what I think of him
and what he did to me.

92
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,236
That evil, evil fuck.

93
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,510
Well, you can do that.

94
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,235
I know, I said it all to the therapy pillow.

95
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,669
No, you can visit him in jail.

96
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,148
What?

97
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,589
He'll either see you or he won't. But try.

98
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,916
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

99
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,468
It would be extremely self-destructive
to put myself in that situation!

100
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,239
I can't believe you'd even suggest it.

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,438
Two hours, great! Let me know when
you're on the ground and I'll come meet you.

102
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,311
Me too.

103
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,157
Bye.

104
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,357
My daughter's on her way
to Hawaii for a conference

105
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,039
and she has a layover this afternoon.

106
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,713
Would you like to meet her for lunch?

107
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,479
Maggie? Really?

108
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,829
Oh, yes!

109
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,075
This is so exciting!

110
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,192
What kind of conference?
I don't know what she does.

111
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,199
- Pharmaceutical rep.
- You're proud of her. I can tell.

112
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,231
She's the apple of your eye.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,309
I know you're doing this for me, too, George.

114
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,999
- Thank you.
- You'll like her.

115
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,156
I can't wait!

116
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm not the person
who's supposed to be here.

117
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,038
We've been divorced for ages.

118
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,356
He must have a new wife or a girlfriend.

119
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,476
You were his emergency contact.

120
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,799
He worked at the same place for 25 years.
I'm sure he just forgot to change the form.

121
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,597
Maybe he still loved you.

122
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,275
He's a very nice guy
but, you know, I've moved on.

123
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,830
I'm sorry, but there are decisions
to be made about the funeral.

124
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,155
Well, I don't want to make them!

125
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,351
Now there must be someone else
who can deal with this.

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,393
Cos I can't believe it!
How can you get killed by an elevator?

127
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,635
Three other people were stuck inside.

128
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,116
He tried to get them out
and the elevator tore him in half.

129
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,711
I hit a new low.

130
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,871
I made the bereaved vomit.

131
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,517
Don't say we have to send him elsewhere.
I just embalmed him.

132
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,551
No, we worked it out.

133
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,388
It's weird we don't sew him together.

134
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,556
Yeah.

135
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,559
Once he's in the casket,
can't even tell the difference.

136
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,558
Here, it's a present from Michaela.

137
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,631
What a sweet kid.

138
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,671
Little morbid, but sweet.

139
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,799
So unlike her mother,
that crazy bitch from hell.

140
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,831
What's that?

141
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,076
<i>It's Roger Pasquese</i>.
<i>Does that ring a bell?</i>

142
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,270
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

143
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,598
How are you, Keith?

144
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,950
I'm fine. A little surprised.
How are you?

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,754
I'm well, thank you.
Enjoying the day. Carpe diem.

146
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,109
Yeah, that's great. What's up?

147
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,073
<i>I'm taking a break</i>
<i>from angry ugly white men</i>.

148
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,998
Let's take it easy now, huh?

149
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,919
OK, seriously.
I have a business proposition for you

150
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,748
and I'd like for us to meet. What do you say
you come to my house and we talk?

151
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,998
Probably not. Nothing against you,
it just doesn't seem like a good idea.

152
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,270
<i>But thanks, anyway</i>.

153
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,630
You know, certain papers
have yet to be signed.

154
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,956
<i>Our lawsuit might rear its ugly head again</i>.

155
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,551
Roger, we had an agreement.

156
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,990
I don't think a blow job is legal or binding.

157
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,349
<i>How about tomorrow afternoon?</i>

158
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,119
I'll think about it.

159
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,912
Well, you see, Nicole,

160
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,475
Claire has a plurality of
influences at work here.

161
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,512
They're portraits, an ancient, classical form.

162
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,994
And they're photos, which are modern.

163
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,758
And then they're torn to bits.

164
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,997
A nod to the Dadaists and the Cubists as well.

165
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,270
Then the pieces are reassembled

166
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,995
for a deconstructed mix
of detachment and tenderness

167
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,556
which seems to me
to be very new millennium.

168
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,160
Anything you'd like to add, Claire?

169
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,071
What you said is part of it.

170
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,433
- Of course, it's more involved than that.
- I totally get it.

171
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,110
It reminds me of
paper dolls and bad relationships

172
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,073
and lies people tell about stupid things.

173
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,111
- Right?
- Right.

174
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,797
- ls this all you have?
- As a matter of fact,

175
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,276
she's working hard on a whole new series.

176
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,072
It looks very promising.

177
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,588
Cool, when can I see it?

178
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,076
Soon. Very soon.

179
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,111
I have to figure out some stuff.

180
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,992
We used to come
to this place when I was a girl.

181
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,158
Sarah and I would eat
Thousand lsland dressing all by itself.

182
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,317
- What a treat!
- I like this place.

183
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,679
The menu never changes.

184
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,633
And this building has stood through
all the mudslides, fires, earthquakes.

185
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,955
Yes, it's comforting.

186
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,228
- Maggie!
- Daddy!

187
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,435
- Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,711
Sweetie, it's great to see you.

189
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,955
- You, too.
- This is wonderful.

190
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,796
What a treat.

191
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,151
With managed care the way that it is,
most of these samples that I haul around

192
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,237
end up going to patients
who can't pay for prescriptions,

193
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,272
so everybody at the doctor's office
is glad to see Maggie.

194
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,035
So what's new in antibiotics?

195
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,229
Here. A course of this will knock out
just about anything.

196
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,714
But you have to take the whole seven days.

197
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,637
Any side effects?

198
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,558
Minimal. Maybe a little nausea,
so take it with food.

199
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,830
- Thanks, hon.
- Are you sick?

200
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,074
No. I just want to be prepared.

201
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,355
Of course, these things
won't touch anything viral.

202
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,598
Did you know that you can order
potassium iodide off the internet now?

203
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,838
That's great.
That is so much more convenient.

204
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,437
What's potassium iodide?

205
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,436
Anti-radiation.

206
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,995
If you take it in time,
it blocks the thyroid's uptake

207
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,077
of airborne radioactive iodine
from a nuclear accident.

208
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,750
Let's not worry today, Dad.
We're OK today.

209
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,751
Of course we are.

210
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,679
OK, I'd like to talk about this morning.

211
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,559
What about it?

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,628
Well, besides the fact that your attitude
to therapy is totally medieval,

213
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,391
you have really big emotions, Nate,
and they're not that easy to live with.

214
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,031
Sometimes you dump them all
on me and it's not fair.

215
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,358
Maybe if I got some support from you,
that's not how it'd feel to you.

216
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,918
You have got to be kidding, right?
All I do is support you. It's like a full-time job.

217
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,871
What are you looking at?

218
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,788
I can't compete with a dead woman.

219
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,919
<i>Brian and I just adored him</i>.

220
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,111
He took us hiking, camping...

221
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,314
Camping? I love camping!
We'll have to go, too.

222
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,989
- He taught us campfire songs.
- Campfire songs? You?

223
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,237
- Yeah, a couple.
- Remember?

224
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,033
It was kid heaven.

225
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,196
Oh, George.

226
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,470
If you ladies will excuse me...

227
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,871
Well, thank God he shaved for you.

228
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,435
He used to have a big scraggly beard.

229
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,711
A beard? I can't picture it.

230
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,954
- Yes, I can.
- Exactly.

231
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,913
He looked like he just walked out of the Bible.

232
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,159
- So how's he been?
- Fine.

233
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,236
No problems?

234
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,475
You can tell me.

235
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,635
What do you mean?

236
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,440
Ruth, I want you to have all my numbers.

237
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,830
If you need me, call. Anywhere, any time.

238
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,552
Well, thank you.

239
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,670
He trusts me.

240
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,477
<i>Can I ask you a personal question?</i>

241
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,193
- <i>If it isn't too personal</i>.
- <i>Are those whiskers your own?</i>

242
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,231
<i>No one else has claimed them</i>.

243
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,471
Do you think I should?

244
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,235
I can't tell you what to do.

245
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,392
What do you mean?
You love to tell me what to do.

246
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,317
This is different.

247
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,033
<i>One more question</i>.
<i>Are you wanted by the police?</i>

248
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,719
<i>That's just the trouble. Nobody wants me</i>.

249
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,435
Maybe if I see him and tell him how I feel,
I can finally get my balls back.

250
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,597
- You have balls.
- Yeah.

251
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,875
Look, if you decide to go, I'll go with you.

252
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,031
No, I have to handle this alone.

253
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,389
- I'm going.
- I just said...

254
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,673
I know what you said. The same thing you said
when I was on the road. ''I'm fine.''

255
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,712
But you weren't. You weren't honest with me.

256
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,395
I wasn't honest with myself.

257
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,829
- I did the best I could.
- I know.

258
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,431
But, I still don't know when to believe you.
I'm not taking any chances.

259
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,438
Come on, guys. Look at this mess.
You're supposed to be helping me out here.

260
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,756
And you're sitting too close to that TV.
Get away from it.

261
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,190
Garbage man, come on.

262
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,629
Come help Mommy out.

263
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,035
Very good. Thank you.

264
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,758
Would you turn off the light and go to sleep?

265
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,992
Can't.

266
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,476
Yes, you can,
if you quit suckin' weed and lie down.

267
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,432
I have to make sure
I invited everybody on my list.

268
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,710
Plus, I'm not tired. I'm all buzzy.

269
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,357
Did you get into that blow without me?

270
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,518
No, look, it's my first exhibition.
There's all this stress.

271
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,839
Claire. One night. Some pictures. A party.

272
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,951
I think you can deal.

273
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,957
- Hey, Bren!
- Maya's still asleep.

274
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,673
- Check this out, this is what Lisa wore.
- Yeah.

275
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,713
No, when she died.
She bought this shirt a week before she died.

276
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,557
- Nate.
- No, I know it.

277
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,591
- Don't do this.
- She showed it to me.

278
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,438
She asked me if I liked the colour.
This is the shirt.

279
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,792
This is the beach where she disappeared.
How did Michaela send this picture of Lisa

280
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,673
when Lisa never made it to Santa Cruz?

281
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,553
I don't know.
There's probably a simple explanation.

282
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,388
- Then I want to hear it.
- God, this is never going to end.

283
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,278
Don't you realise what's going on? There was
somebody there who took this photo.

284
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,634
- Why don't you call the girl and just ask her?
- No, I'm going up there.

285
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,753
The way they feel about me, do you think
they're gonna just give her the phone?

286
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,634
How do you think they're going to feel
when you turn up sounding crazy?

287
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,912
- Thanks for the support.
- Come on, this is ridiculous.

288
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,475
You're driving up there
all because of some random snapshot.

289
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,318
- I don't need your permission.
- No, you don't.

290
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,352
I don't. So I'm gonna take Maya
to my mother's house.

291
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,356
Why?

292
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,110
Well, because she's never
spent the night here without me.

293
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,799
If you don't think I can take care of Maya,

294
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,469
there's not really a lot of point
to the three of us living together.

295
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,910
OK, I'm sorry.

296
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,910
I'm sorry. I just, you know...

297
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,231
I have to do this.

298
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,549
Every day it seems harder to breathe.

299
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,512
ls that my imagination?

300
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,828
No. The air is poison, George.

301
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,235
It's a scientific fact.

302
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,753
They took blood samples from
a remote village of lndians in Bolivia.

303
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,749
Alto Los Zarzos.

304
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,711
Even they were contaminated.

305
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,955
There are chemicals in the rain.

306
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,277
I keep thinking any minute
something terrible will happen.

307
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,311
It's already happening.

308
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,431
Yes, I know, but...

309
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,189
Our days are numbered.
It's only a matter of time.

310
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,630
But I truly believe if we prepare...

311
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,514
Don't be naive, George,
you weren't brought up that way.

312
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,393
- There's no hope.
- Stop saying that!

313
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,392
Even if it's true, I can't give up.

314
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,190
No! No, I won't.

315
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,636
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

316
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,474
No.

317
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,114
Could you sit with me?

318
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,919
The way he died, God, it's awful.

319
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,954
I can't stop thinking about it.

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,915
If there was anyone
who deserved to go in their sleep, it was Ken.

321
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,952
It's the way that Ken lived that's important.

322
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,509
We weren't close any more.

323
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,074
- He was your husband once.
- 15 years ago.

324
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,755
Honestly, when I got the call,
I had to think, ''Ken? Ken who?''

325
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,436
Then I remembered.

326
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,758
Every minute we spent together,
I remember everything.

327
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,196
I'm going to bury him with the rest of my family.

328
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,634
- That's the way it should be, don't you think?
- Yes, yes I do.

329
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,274
Even if I marry again,

330
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,199
when I'm dead I want Ken there, too.

331
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,232
Family's family.
Divorce doesn't change that.

332
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,670
Not divorce, not death,

333
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,836
not anything. When people...

334
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,076
get in your heart...

335
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,839
They stay for good.

336
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,633
Maggie, this is Ruth.
I'm very sorry to bother you in Waikiki,

337
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,671
but please call me back.

338
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,316
I'm worried about your father.

339
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,795
Mr Fisher.

340
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,715
Can I see a valid passport, a visa,

341
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,797
alien registration card
or valid driver's licence?

342
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,234
You may take in one handkerchief,
an unopened pack of tissue,

343
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,510
$30 in coins and dollar bills only.

344
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,233
You may not take in cameras,
phones unless approved

345
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,794
prior to entering the visiting room.

346
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,116
I don't have anything.

347
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,391
Are you wearing implants
or prosthetic devices?

348
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,192
No.

349
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,836
Please go down the hall to the next officer.
He'll direct you to the metal detector.

350
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,629
Sir, please proceed down the hall.

351
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,869
What if a lot of people come?
They're all going to be looking at me.

352
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,797
lsn't that what you want?

353
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,072
I don't know. I haven't done much coke. I don't
wanna be more nervous than I already am.

354
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,795
No, it'll help. This shit's not cut with meth.
It's pretty smooth.

355
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,310
It makes you feel really important
for about 20 minutes.

356
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,952
Gimme.

357
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,038
- I'll hang on to it.
- I thought it was a present.

358
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,631
It is, but since it's your special night
I could be, like, the keeper of it.

359
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,957
- Yeah?
- OK. It's nice.

360
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,353
- What?
- I just want to look.

361
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,109
Whatever. I'll meet you back here
in a half hour for a little...

362
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,796
The boys are at a birthday party.

363
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,991
But if you call, you could probably stop over.

364
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,790
It's you I came to see.

365
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,111
Well, I gotta go soon.

366
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,234
Vanessa,

367
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,755
I apologise. This is...

368
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,351
This is all my fault.

369
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,550
All my fault.

370
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,309
What I gave Sophia,
the time and the attention...

371
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,237
The money.

372
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,589
The intimacy.

373
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,437
I had no right.

374
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,835
It all belonged to you and the kids.

375
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,110
Even if you hadn't slept with her,
it was adultery.

376
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,352
Being close to somebody else when
you're the most important person in my life,

377
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,231
yes, that was adultery.

378
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,596
I betrayed

379
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,676
my marriage.

380
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,711
I was so wrong.

381
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,197
I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart.

382
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,030
You finally said it. Thank you.

383
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,949
I'll come back home and
we'll go back to being ourselves again.

384
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,795
We can't go back.

385
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,673
Everything has changed.

386
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,950
I never expected this.

387
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,551
And I feel really sad, but it feels right.

388
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,193
No.

389
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,629
You know that we got together so young.

390
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,390
Being on my own is good for me now
and I think that maybe it's good for you, too.

391
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,831
No.

392
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,474
No, it is definitely not good.

393
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,154
- Don't you love me any more?
- Of course I love you.

394
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,076
It's just not like before.

395
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,229
Oh, Jesus.

396
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,431
I'm not trying to hurt you, Rico, I swear to God.

397
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,152
I want a divorce.

398
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,837
You don't mean it.

399
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,071
You don't mean it.

400
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,517
- Who are you?
- David Fisher.

401
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,193
Remember me?

402
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,833
Yeah, I think so.

403
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,398
How ya doing?

404
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,793
How do you think I am?

405
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,319
I don't know.

406
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,035
You look pretty good compared
to everybody else I see.

407
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,552
I hope you're happy here
behind bars where you belong.

408
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,556
Nobody belongs here, man.

409
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,990
You ever been through detox? It's like dying.

410
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,156
Every fucking minute you die.

411
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,272
Good.

412
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,473
Did you bring me something?

413
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,636
No, I hate you.

414
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,673
Oh, God. Here we go.

415
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,679
You soaked me with gasoline.
You beat me and stuck a gun in my mouth.

416
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,555
Well, yeah, you drove me all over hell with
a dead chick farting in the back of your van.

417
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,318
What was I supposed to do?

418
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,396
You scared me shitless.

419
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,433
Now I walk around feeling like everybody's
gonna humiliate and murder me.

420
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,952
Well, they are. So I did you a favour.
Now you'll be a little more careful, won't you?

421
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,195
Stop your fucking games for once...

422
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,710
It's your game. You come here
and you don't bring anything.

423
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,436
You just want to shit on me and break me
down, like everybody else. Well I won't let you.

424
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,470
- Apologise to me.
- For defending myself? Fuck you.

425
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,350
You have a family, right?

426
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,279
You have people looking out for you?

427
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,313
- Yeah, but...
- All I have is you, David, and you hate me.

428
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,239
You made a special trip up here
to tell me that you hate me.

429
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,397
I think I'm the one that
deserves a goddamn apology.

430
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,556
You really are sick.

431
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,751
I'm not the one who sits in jail
when he doesn't have to.

432
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,433
- Well, at least you know how I feel.
- And you know how I feel.

433
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,479
You can come visit me again
if you want to.

434
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,591
No, I won't be back.

435
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,558
Well, maybe when I get paroled
you can come and take me out to lunch.

436
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,710
Probably not. I'm pretty busy.

437
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,278
I don't think you can be an artist
without experiencing major suffering.

438
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,198
And you have to be aware
of the suffering around you.

439
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,879
Yeah, I've been influenced by
Dada and Cubism

440
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,878
but I also feel like I've added detachment...

441
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,673
..and tenderness, for the new millennium.

442
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,190
This is fucking fantastic.
Everybody loves my shit.

443
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,118
- There's somebody in here.
- Have you talked to Jimmy?

444
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,470
No, every time I see him,
somebody grabs me to talk.

445
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,717
- You should at least get him high.
- Here, you do it.

446
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,194
- How do you think it's going?
- What?

447
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,435
- My show, whore.
- Fine, whore.

448
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,152
What are people saying?

449
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,475
I don't know. I'm just hanging out.

450
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,638
Come on, I wanna know what they're saying.
And don't do it all. Save some for me.

451
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,193
Maya.

452
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,232
What are you doing?

453
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,799
Everyone is very impressed with Claire's
pictures. You must be very proud.

454
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,592
I certainly am.

455
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,870
I'm proud of all my children.

456
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,752
Nate and I back together again.
It must seem very sudden.

457
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,349
I married my husband
almost right after we met.

458
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,756
Sudden is something I understand now.

459
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,552
It's not always best.

460
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,236
But, sometimes it is.

461
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,472
Brenda, I'm glad Nate is with someone,

462
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,990
and I hope the three of you are very happy.

463
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,551
Thank you.

464
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,556
He says you're studying psychology.

465
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,956
Yes, I am going to be a cognitive therapist.

466
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,760
What does it mean when a person
starts talking to himself out of nowhere?

467
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,197
- None of your pieces have names. How come?
- I couldn't think of any.

468
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,437
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I'm actually interested.

469
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,998
I feel like when you give something a name
people take your word for it.

470
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,272
Which is OK for some things, but not these.

471
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,959
I didn't want to tell anybody what to see.

472
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,952
It's like music that's called Opus 15
or Three-Part lnvention ln A Minor.

473
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,558
What's that about?

474
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,197
I want you to really look at it
and deal with it on your own.

475
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,435
You know, it's like life.

476
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,710
It's kinda scary.

477
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,514
With no guide, I don't know where I'll end up.

478
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,431
You know what?

479
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,310
I have no fucking idea
what these pictures mean.

480
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,313
I know. lsn't it great?

481
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,955
- Roger, you don't need a bodyguard.
- Yes, I do.

482
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,199
Look, I have enemies. There are fuckers
out there that would do anything to get me.

483
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,074
Anything. I just want to feel safe.

484
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,395
And I will pay you a shitload of money.

485
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,040
Well, I couldn't work for you exclusively.
It would have to be a freelance situation.

486
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,436
I'm sure we can figure something out.
We'll draw up a contract.

487
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,952
First, I need something in writing that says
you're going to drop our lawsuit. Forever.

488
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,718
Oh, all right.

489
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,592
ls that one of the people you're afraid of?

490
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,598
No, that's Steve.

491
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,748
He stays in the guesthouse sometimes.

492
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,114
Well?

493
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,799
I'll give it serious consideration.

494
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,473
- I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- Of course I'm here.

495
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,355
You were my student, my assistant.
You think that means nothing to me?

496
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,153
It's my responsibility and pleasure
to support you.

497
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,035
Besides, you're competition now.

498
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,390
Though I thought it would be
Russell first in this position.

499
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,556
Well, you were wrong. Because it's me.

500
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,909
And so it all begins.

501
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,111
With the first success, corruption.

502
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,758
It's corrupt to feel like
I finally did something right?

503
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,792
Actually, yes, it is. You'll see.

504
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,509
But so what? Who wants to be a saint, right?

505
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,277
- Not me.
- No, no one does.

506
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,598
And the work suffers.

507
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,676
I toast you with this shitty wine.

508
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,436
Hello there.

509
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,550
Wow, you look recovered.

510
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,196
I feel fabulous. Everyone should drop an organ.

511
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,755
After the first shock, it's positively liberating.

512
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,353
So, is this the fruit of Nate's loins?

513
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,868
Maya, this is Margaret.

514
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,389
Look, don't take this personally,
but I don't think she likes you.

515
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,112
She hardly knows you're here.

516
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,915
Margaret can't help trying
to make us feel bad about ourselves.

517
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,512
You know, Brenda, it's unethical to use
an innocent child to express your resentment.

518
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,511
Claire, do you do commissions?

519
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,839
Yes.

520
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,078
Well, I want you to photograph Olivier and me
and do that thing you do,

521
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,591
only mix all our pieces together.
That will be a portrait.

522
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,393
Kudos, darling, you're brilliant.

523
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,110
Later.

524
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,435
Congratulations.

525
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,471
Thank you.

526
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,951
Excuse me.

527
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,790
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

528
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,991
Somebody may want to buy something.
I'll be right back.

529
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,508
What the fuck? Are you blowing me off?

530
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,632
- No!
- You haven't said shit to me since I got here.

531
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,389
I mean, what the fuck?
I think it's pretty fucking rude.

532
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,911
OK, maybe you didn't realise this
but I'm a little fucking busy right now.

533
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,235
I'm in the middle of my fucking show.

534
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,434
Maybe you don't remember, but I'm the one
who fucking got you this fucking show.

535
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,671
Jimmy.

536
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,399
Well, fuck you, then. Fuck you all.

537
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,915
- Hi, Michaela.
- Hi, Uncle Nate.

538
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,471
I gave the book to David.

539
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,351
Thank you.

540
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,391
He liked it a lot.

541
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,789
- There was a picture in it.
- I know.

542
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,910
Where'd the picture come from?

543
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,877
Do you know who took it?

544
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,875
Why did you put it in the book?

545
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,272
You should talk to my dad.
He's in the office.

546
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,754
God, you freak,
when are you gonna let it go?

547
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,110
When you admit in public
that I am part of your work.

548
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,878
You're not!

549
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,798
I created these pieces.
They are mine, people love them.

550
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,308
I love you.

551
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,715
You love? You fucked a man and lied about it.

552
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,228
- You fucked a woman!
- Not when I was with you!

553
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,796
No, you just went and had an abortion
without me!

554
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,037
Don't you dare go there.
Don't you fucking dare!

555
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,469
ls there a problem, guys?

556
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,590
You are so deeply irrelevant.

557
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,437
- Are you fucking him now?
- All right, Russell.

558
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,076
You fuck Jimmy, get a gallery.
What can Billy Chenowith do...

559
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,635
- You asshole, I fucking hate you.
- Stop now. It's time to leave.

560
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,716
- Get your hands off.
- Just leave.

561
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,830
This needs to stop. Out.

562
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,431
Are you all right?

563
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,598
Take me home.

564
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,839
Are you crazy?

565
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,634
If I was you, I'd move on down the road
before Barb finds out you're here.

566
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,798
Hoyt, I'll ask you one more time.
Then I'm calling the police.

567
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,876
Did you take that picture?

568
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,959
She's a Kimmel.
We tend to point cameras at each other.

569
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,231
Somebody obviously took it.
Maybe it was me.

570
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,796
No, I remember this. This was
a couple of years ago. We had a picnic.

571
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,950
You're a fucking liar.

572
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,592
You were with there with Lisa
on the beach the day she died.

573
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,235
- No...
- Yes, you were. And this proves it.

574
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,551
- You son of a bitch, what did you do to her?
- Nothing! God, nothing!

575
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,870
This was a place that we used to go.
I'd drive south and I'd meet her there.

576
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,550
Alone?

577
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,750
Maybe, a few times. Yeah.

578
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,311
Why?

579
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,758
We had a thing. It was on and off.

580
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,548
But it was intense. You know Lisa.

581
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,591
She was intense.

582
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,991
When was this? When we were married?

583
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,837
Before.

584
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,669
I don't believe you.

585
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,028
She told me what it was like to be your wife.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

586
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,799
Why did you put her through all that?

587
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,991
You think she just spent
her whole life waiting for you?

588
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,591
People loved Lisa. And she loved us back.

589
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,032
She might have killed herself because of you.
Did you ever think about that?

590
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,832
No, she...

591
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,515
Listen, let's take a walk, OK?
This is a big misunderstanding.

592
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,270
No! Lisa would never kill herself!
I know that.

593
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,349
She might leave me
but she would never leave Maya.

594
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,952
So you tell me what happened
on that beach right now. Right the fuck now!

595
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,628
I wanted some time by ourselves.
Lisa said she wasn't into it.

596
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,389
You know, clean slate, never again. OK, fine.

597
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,075
I couldn't let her tell Barb.

598
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,268
I did not get angry with her.

599
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,959
I played the guitar. I sang her a so..

600
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,792
I sang her a song.

601
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,712
And we...

602
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,076
went our separate ways.

603
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,674
Have you been here all night?

604
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,349
I had to put things in order
and I guess I fell asleep.

605
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,675
Didn't mean to worry you.

606
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,676
No harm done.

607
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,279
Come on, let's go back to the house.

608
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,152
I can't do that.

609
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,950
Yes, you can, dear. It's where we live.

610
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,077
No, Ruth.

611
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,111
This is where I live now.

612
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,869
Let's get married and have a baby.

613
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,031
Will you?

614
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,513
Yes.

615
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
Oh, good. My bougainvillea needs this.

616
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,311
You were brave to face him.

617
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,556
- Not really. There was a guard.
- Doesn't matter.

618
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,996
I'm proud of you.

619
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,869
I thought it would set me free
but it didn't change anything,

620
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,036
except now I know he really is insane.

621
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,233
You're missing the point.

622
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,518
There is no point. That's the point. lsn't it?

623
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,951
Don't give me this phoney existential bullshit.
I expect better from you.

624
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,639
The point's right in front of your face.

625
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,919
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't see it.

626
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,713
You're not even grateful, are you?

627
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,753
Grateful?
For the worst fucking experience of my life?

628
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,032
You hang onto your pain like it means
something, like it's worth something.

629
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,913
Well, let me tell you, it's not worth shit.
Let it go.

630
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,350
lnfinite possibilities and all he can do is whine.

631
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,559
- What am I supposed to do?
- What do you think?

632
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,275
You can do anything, you lucky bastard.
You're alive.

633
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,309
What's a little pain compared to that?

634
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,231
It can't be so simple.

635
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,031
What if it is?

636
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,069
English
