1
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:03,038
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:06,032
Marcus and his newest
recruit cannot be trusted.

3
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:07,423
Bring me the girl.

4
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:12,718
- You wanna break into Chthon?
- Girl's on a knife's edge.

5
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,843
If she falls off,
I want her falling our way.

6
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:17,022
- We're your family.
- My family is dead!

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,341
... you're the only vampire
who's ever felt pain?

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,335
Who's ever suffered loss?

9
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:26,199
- What I saw... you were?
- Younger?

10
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:27,262
Human.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,972
I'm here to
reopen negociations.

12
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:30,764
I want a piece of
your action too.

13
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,954
- Something's wrong with her.
- Yeah, she looks drunk.

14
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:36,241
No, something else.

15
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:37,780
It hurts so much, being alone.

16
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,922
Then you don't
have to be Krista.

17
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:19,712
Two beers.

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,782
Good crowd tonight?

19
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,453
Not if you're working
on tips.

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,123
You gotta take a day off.

21
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,130
You've ever been
to Detroit zoo?

22
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,503
We should go sometime.
They have lions.

23
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:34,862
Alright.

24
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,241
We're already in a zoo.

25
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:40,830
Can I get a vodka and tonic?

26
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,272
- Lime?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,221
4 bucks.

28
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:47,933
Hey?

29
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,580
What are you doing
off the floor?

30
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:51,661
You're tired already?

31
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:52,570
Thirsty.

32
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,072
Zed?

33
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,711
Watch and learn.

34
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:00,283
Just don't forget to pay
your tab this time.

35
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,532
Come on, sexy!

36
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,073
- It's Jennifer.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:10,753
You want to get out
of here?

38
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:11,741
Like leave?

39
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:12,891
Yeah.

40
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,112
This place is dead anyway.

41
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:53,910
Hello?

42
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,952
Can anybody hear me?

43
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:20,652
Who is there?

44
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:23,222
Who is that?

45
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:38,113
Let me go!

46
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:44,732
Leave me alone!

47
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,801
All you want!

48
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,983
Blade The Series - 110 - Hunters

49
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,731
***

50
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,070
I don't know. You know?

51
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,312
What am I gonna do?
I can't ***.

52
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,323
I didn't talk to her. You know.

53
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm sorry, Tom.

54
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,641
Come on, give me a break!

55
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:11,432
You know what?

56
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:12,593
Come on!

57
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,443
You're hunting?

58
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:17,982
Me too.

59
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,470
What... what are you doing?

60
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,173
Cleaning you up.

61
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,302
From what?

62
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,392
You got too close to Marcus.

63
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,311
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,921
House of Chthon keeps
their windows open at night.

65
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,272
I took a peak.

66
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,070
Screw you!

67
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:13,060
Hmm, screw me.

68
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,533
Come on Blade, look,
I had to protect my cover.

69
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:17,823
You're off the serum.

70
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,170
You drank blood.

71
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:21,912
Look, Blade...

72
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:22,931
I'm done.

73
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,383
I'm fine.

74
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,190
Fine huh?

75
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:53,912
Damn!

76
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:57,512
If the detox doesn't work.

77
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,963
Our partnership is done.

78
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,543
And you're ash.

79
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,110
What?

80
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,932
That asshole forgot
to pay his tab again.

81
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,061
It's Zed, he will be back.

82
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,030
Yeah, but he never
tips when he forgets.

83
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,942
Have some of mine.
I had a good night.

84
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:40,953
That's sweet but... it's ok.

85
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,013
Maybe this snake's
still here.

86
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:00,680
Zed?

87
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:07,363
Zed?

88
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:20,812
Zed?

89
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:50,003
Since when does a missing person
involve vampires?

90
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:54,013
They're the reason people
go missing around here.
You know that.

91
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,803
She's probably already dead,
or worse.

92
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,913
You didn't give up
when it was your sister.

93
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,100
That was different.

94
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,561
Before the Daywalker...

95
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:06,602
you did it anyway.

96
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,543
At least talk to the girl...

97
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,133
or you can forget
the free popcorn.

98
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,311
I don't have time for this.

99
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,101
I told you to wait.

100
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,062
I know, I'm sorry.

101
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:27,930
My name is Bethany.

102
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,020
He  said that
you could help me.

103
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,511
Will you?

104
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:37,872
I haven't spoken to her
in 4 days.

105
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:41,550
- You said your sister's
name was Nicki?
- Yeah.

106
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:43,193
Let me guess.

107
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,243
She's the wild sister?

108
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:48,190
Not  really, no.
Those are from work.

109
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,013
She's a waitress at a club.

110
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:51,843
It's some underground
place.

111
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:54,163
She's only been there
for a few weeks.

112
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,720
She was trying to get me
to move downtown with her.

113
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:58,553
She said that
she missed me.

114
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:01,453
I didn't know
she ever missed me.

115
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,871
But the police aren't
doing anything.

116
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,671
I don't have anyone else
to go to.

117
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:09,822
I'll look into it. Ok?

118
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:11,480
Thank you.

119
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,990
How did you get so big?

120
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:45,920
Don't bother, Chase.

121
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:48,830
He only likes to play
with human girls.

122
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,910
He has quite a collection.

123
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:52,362
I'm sure.

124
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,361
Relax, my dear.

125
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,162
If I wanted you dead,

126
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,473
Thorne would have already
twisted your head off.

127
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,133
You do know
why you're here.

128
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,391
I'm sure I don't,
Charlotte.

129
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,930
I've watched you
for decades Chase.

130
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,131
Most of the turned lacked
the proper perspective.

131
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:16,710
Their emotional turmoils from
their human lives carry over
into the next like phantom pains.

132
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,161
It's a weakness.

133
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:21,150
One the Pure Bloods
thankfully don't share.

134
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:24,663
Your anger from your human life
stains this one, Chase.

135
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,672
But somehow you've managed
to use it as fuel.

136
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,202
I know at your core

137
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,912
it's because
you are a survivor.

138
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,643
- I had to be.
- Yes.

139
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,183
Ambitious.
Thirsty for control.

140
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:38,243
Willing to tear apart
anything that threathens you.

141
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,823
Anything.

142
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,051
And I admire that.

143
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,482
The truth is...

144
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,952
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

145
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:50,194
And perhaps in 200 years,

146
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,674
you'll understand why
I do the things I do.

147
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,741
Have you ever smelled
something so sweet?

148
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:04,523
Fresh blood taken from
a newborn only hours old.

149
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,252
Free from the sourness of life.

150
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,260
Drink.

151
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:20,631
Marcus Van Sciver is
different than you and I Chase.

152
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,270
He suffers from
delusions of grandeur.

153
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:28,852
He doesn't understand that
the survival of our world
depends on a hierarchy.

154
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:30,951
I believe he's been
planning something sinister

155
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,120
against us for quite some time.

156
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,810
I  don't know.

157
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,290
Oh, but you do.

158
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,840
I've brought you here to ask you
one simple question Chase.

159
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,112
Are you loyalties of Marcus...

160
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,360
or Chthon?

161
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,641
So what do we do
if she gets out?

162
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,643
If Krista breaks out
before I let her out,

163
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:59,740
you treat her like
any other blood suckers.

164
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,143
Dude!

165
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:04,682
Van Sciver is ready
to make his move against
the Chthon Pure Bloods.

166
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,413
I wanna make sure he succeeds.

167
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:09,230
If Krista doesn't return to them,
there can be delays.

168
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,190
She could expose
herself and us.

169
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:13,582
Then everything we work towards
goes up in flame.

170
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,513
Man, she's had a rough few weeks.
Ease up a little.

171
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,590
I let her out,

172
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:19,410
she's going straight
for your throat.

173
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:20,900
She's not your friend right now.

174
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:23,880
She gets free, people will die!

175
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,181
And part of our job
is to keep people from dying.

176
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:31,012
- Right?
- What do you got?

177
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,332
So what do you think?

178
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:37,802
I don't see a face.

179
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,512
I didn't either but,

180
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,351
that's not what got my attention.
Check this out.

181
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:46,901
A glyph.

182
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm guessing, but it doesn't
belong to any of the Twelve Houses.

183
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,980
- No.
- And it makes no sense.

184
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,582
Unfortunately it does.

185
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,441
There are a lot of
unaffiliated vampires.

186
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,393
Building their own little kingdoms.

187
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:00,030
They don't want
to belong to the Houses?

188
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,443
Houses don't want them.

189
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:03,183
Too uncontrolable.

190
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:04,710
Like the White Prince.

191
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:06,303
That's who this glyph
belongs to?

192
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:09,612
- Now, who is he?
- Whistler mentionned
him once or twice.

193
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,453
I know the glyph
and the name, but...

194
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,843
that's about it.

195
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,952
See what you can dig up.

196
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,432
In the meantime,

197
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,932
I gonna find his familiar.

198
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,253
How are you gonna do that?

199
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,472
Shake the right tree.

200
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:38,912
This is *** god!
You own this place?

201
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,293
Dude, I own ten places.

202
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,142
If you get marked, you get it.

203
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,103
You want girls?
You want a fistful of cash?

204
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:45,902
You want *** for a while?

205
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,641
Get it all.

206
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,940
You sure you can get me in?

207
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:52,263
Dude, I'm the king
of familiars in this town.

208
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,340
Your dad being a judge
and all that?

209
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:55,990
You got a use.

210
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,110
You got a future.

211
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,973
How many years you gotta put in?
How much time for you're turned?

212
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:01,992
See, that's the beautiful
thing right there, Andy.

213
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,091
Once you get bit
by the bosses,

214
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:05,961
time don't matter no more.

215
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:09,402
Join up. Get marked.
Get it all.

216
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,763
Yeah!

217
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:12,981
Oh shit.

218
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,323
Oh yeah!

219
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,211
Hey, hey, we're cool, you are
not going to kill me, are you?

220
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,541
Come back here, I will.

221
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,122
Now you better get to a doctor.

222
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,161
You're bleeding.

223
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:29,080
Help me! Somebody help me!

224
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,822
Go get some ice cream.

225
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:42,611
This my club, it's under the
protection of Chthon.

226
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:45,633
King of familiars, uh?

227
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,173
Well, I got a question for you.

228
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:48,891
I'm looking for
another familiar.

229
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:50,311
Branded with this.

230
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,183
Know him?

231
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,062
Yeah, yeah,
there was a guy.

232
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,931
He was with the House of Erebus
until he found a better gig.

233
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,271
He became a personal
to some solo vamp.

234
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,761
He bragged about how he was on
the fast track to immortality.

235
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:03,042
What his asshole's name?

236
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:05,320
Man  I can't remember,
so many of these guys come and go!

237
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,362
Where do I find him?

238
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,741
Metal club called Trash.

239
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:13,433
Wannabee spends all
his time there.

240
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,152
Thanks.

241
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,093
Jesus Christ!

242
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,293
Krista?

243
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:36,342
Let me out.

244
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:40,713
-  I can't.
- No!

245
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,421
It hurts.

246
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,102
I know.

247
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:46,652
No, you don't.

248
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,141
Blade knows.

249
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,162
Blade doesn't know anything!

250
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,470
Krista, I know
you can do this.

251
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:59,033
You went to the Lychan
blood ritual and you came back.

252
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:00,902
I know you can handle this.

253
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,390
You can beat the thirst.

254
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:08,361
Krista?

255
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:29,682
Help!

256
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:33,190
Somebody help me, please!!!

257
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,493
What are you doing?

258
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,320
What are you doing to me?

259
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,073
No!

260
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:20,442
Please don't!

261
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,511
How has she been?

262
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,673
Quiet.

263
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:58,240
Really?

264
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:00,551
You think what
she's doing is easy?

265
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,591
I know it's not.

266
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,002
Have you found that familiar?

267
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:08,331
Getting there.

268
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:11,692
Hangs at the same club
the missing girl worked at.

269
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,600
Learned anything more
about this White Prince?

270
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,421
More than I want to.

271
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:20,102
Looks like our perp
is a nomad.

272
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:22,172
And he works on the
metonic lunar cycle.

273
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,333
Pops up once
every 19 years.

274
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:25,752
Have you ever heard of
Gilles de Rais?

275
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:26,893
Should I?

276
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,332
He was a 15th century nobleman
in France who had a taste for

277
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,482
canibalism, sadism,

278
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,413
and was probably a cat lover.

279
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:37,320
His servants used to lure
children back to his home

280
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,310
where he tortured
and mutilated them.

281
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,902
When they caught him, he was
found dancing in one of his
victims entrails.

282
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:45,043
Became known as
the White Prince.

283
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:47,510
And there have been other killers
like him throughout history.

284
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,470
Places where this glyph
would show up.

285
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:53,291
Garrett the Butcher,
16th century Germany.

286
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:56,441
And the Red Rover Man in Seattle,
early 1900s.

287
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,221
And you think
this is the same guy?

288
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,000
Changing his M.O.
along the way.

289
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,233
Not entirely.

290
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:03,921
It says that he disfigured
his face by his own hands,

291
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:07,350
So he somehow managed
to permanently scar himself
with silver.

292
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:10,302
That's why he's gotta get
familiars to lure his victims in.

293
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,403
I found out where the
new familiar likes to fish.

294
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:13,870
So let's go find him and ask him

295
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,251
where the Prince
is building his castle?

296
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,430
No.

297
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:18,521
We have to do it quietly.

298
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,681
Why?

299
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:23,042
One wrong move from us
and this guy is a shadow!

300
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,161
Could disappear for
another 19 years.

301
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:28,010
Then how do we get this familiar
to show us the way?

302
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,673
Give him what
his master wants.

303
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,272
A girl.

304
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:35,991
Who?

305
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,813
The sister.

306
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,270
You don't have
to do this, Bethany.

307
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:44,942
Who else is going to?

308
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,552
We could find someone.

309
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,472
And how long will that take?

310
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:51,751
You should know your sister
might not be alive.

311
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,263
Yeah.

312
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:56,953
You can only hope.

313
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,943
Do you know who took
my sister, Shen?

314
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:04,112
Not really but, we know that
he'll be going for another girl.

315
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,613
So I'll be that girl.

316
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,003
Alright.

317
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,401
What's that?

318
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,140
This has a transponder in it.

319
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,752
- I can track you anywhere you are.
- Ok.

320
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,510
- I just need to attach you.
- Ok.

321
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:24,221
Here.

322
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:26,022
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's ok. Just...

323
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,111
You can clip it on.

324
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:36,102
We won't let anything
happen to you, Bethany.

325
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,163
We?

326
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,140
Wow.

327
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,323
Don't freak.

328
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,293
Freak?

329
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,791
No, I...

330
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,302
Are you kidding?
I mean, he...

331
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:57,081
looks like he could
take anything on. And,
that's good, right?

332
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,202
Open your eyes.

333
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,892
Open them.

334
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:12,962
Do you know what I am?

335
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:15,530
I know what you are.

336
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,190
You're a child of God.

337
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,261
You're corrupted
by your sins.

338
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,632
I was too.

339
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,590
But I died.

340
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:28,062
And rose again.

341
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:31,333
Royalty reborn
as a seraphim.

342
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,012
A by-product of
humans and angels.

343
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:39,270
I will forever
walk on earth

344
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:44,423
drowning in your blood
to behold the glory.

345
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:49,390
Your insides hold the doorway
to the bite.

346
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:52,821
If only for the briefest
of moment.

347
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:02,783
You don't believe I'm what
I say I am, do you?

348
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:06,053
You're like the others,
you need to see.

349
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,852
I am chosen.

350
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:35,260
I am holy.

351
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,630
Do you have her in sight, Shen?

352
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,752
I see her.

353
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,092
She's cute.

354
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:14,312
What?

355
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:17,733
- That chick, she's cute.
- Yeah.

356
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:22,470
Can I get you a drink?

357
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:23,912
Coke.

358
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:24,841
And?

359
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:26,693
Just a coke.

360
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:28,832
Sure.

361
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:41,480
Blade?

362
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,003
I don't like this.

363
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:45,613
You don't think I'd rather be
in there cracking skulls open?

364
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:47,973
I  show my face, the White Prince disappear.

365
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,113
Look,

366
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,383
there's only one way
get in and out this place.

367
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:52,770
And I'm watching it.

368
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:53,773
Still,

369
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,911
using a desperate girl
as a piece of cheese.

370
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:57,373
It's the only move, Shen.

371
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,920
What about her sister?

372
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,993
You don't think
she's still alive, do you?

373
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,172
No.

374
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:03,760
Do you even hope she is?

375
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:05,103
Do you care?

376
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:07,100
You do that for me.

377
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:18,601
You're new here?

378
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,570
You're looking for someone?

379
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,800
Cause if not,

380
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,850
I'd like to buy you a drink.

381
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:31,463
- Shit!
- What?

382
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,533
Actually, I...
I am here with someone.

383
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,520
Must be a real lucky guy.

384
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:37,821
Why don't you tell me
how I can get that lucky.

385
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:40,983
Please, stop,
stop, stop, please!

386
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,000
Blade?

387
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:43,462
He's making a move for her.

388
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,931
Stick to the plan!

389
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:46,911
New plan! Hey!

390
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,763
Where is she, you prick?

391
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:50,682
Who?

392
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:52,042
Shen?

393
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,162
You know who.

394
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,153
Her sister.

395
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,082
The girl you picked up
the other night.

396
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,001
You alright?

397
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,141
Come on!

398
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,270
Show me the glyph.

399
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:06,442
What?

400
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,271
I don't know what
you're talking about!

401
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:12,302
I'm sorry, alright man.
I didn't know she was with you.

402
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:14,851
Bethany?

403
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,300
Bethany?

404
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:18,643
Blade?

405
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,841
- She didn't come out.
- But, she had to. She's not in.

406
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,443
Shit!

407
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:38,531
The virus will be ready
for transport in 3 days, sir.

408
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:39,633
Thank you.

409
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,071
Marcus.

410
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:46,101
Chase.

411
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,920
I've been looking for Krista.
Have you seen her?

412
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,061
No.

413
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:51,243
Where have you been?

414
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:52,832
At a tea party.

415
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:19,872
I know you can handle this.

416
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,130
You can beat the thirst.

417
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:25,192
I don't feel very well.

418
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:31,613
Our partnership is done.

419
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:34,453
And you're ash.

420
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,021
And you're ash.

421
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:38,191
We're doing a good thing.

422
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,463
We could't have done
it without you.

423
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:43,621
You can beat the thirst.

424
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:46,713
Hmm, Krista.
Don't forget to drink.

425
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,553
You shouldn't have gone
to Charlotte's.

426
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:05,353
I didn't have a choice.

427
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:06,950
What else did you tell her?

428
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,941
Our little girl
did most of the talking.

429
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:10,290
But did you tell her anything?

430
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:12,370
Nothing she didn't
already know.

431
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:15,931
She wants a pair of eyes
and ears inside your operations.

432
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:17,191
Mine.

433
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:18,820
And your answer?

434
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,452
I told Goldy Locks
I needed to think about it.

435
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,500
Go back to her.

436
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,861
Tell her you made up
your mind.

437
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:33,943
And you'd like to prove it.

438
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,531
I know!

439
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:52,400
I didn't say anything.

440
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,521
I made a mistake.

441
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,043
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

442
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:27,040
Holy shit!

443
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:28,100
Shen?

444
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:29,303
What?

445
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:30,831
The transponder is moving.

446
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,530
She's still in there.

447
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:36,060
Just looked! I didn't see her.

448
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,051
There's gotta be
another way out.

449
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,260
Is there a basement?

450
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,571
I don't know.

451
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,613
Yeah, I bet there is.

452
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,293
You bet there is what?

453
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,641
Where did you take her?

454
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,310
I don't know what
you're talking about.

455
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:00,293
Yes,

456
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:02,211
you goddamn
well know who.

457
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,222
You're that sick bastard's
delivery boy.

458
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,491
Shen?

459
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,163
Blade. I got him.

460
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:11,691
Shen?
Son of a bitch.

461
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:15,633
He's leading me to the glory,
to divinity.

462
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:17,690
Where is she?

463
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,111
He's been transformed.

464
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:23,010
And one day I will be...
into perfection.

465
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:49,232
Go, go ***. Come on!

466
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,363
You're his familiar,
aren't you?

467
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:46,441
We heard you talk to him.
Say his name... Blade!

468
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,740
Tell me.

469
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,041
After all the work you do
for him.

470
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,000
What's he gonna do for you.?

471
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:55,112
Fuck you.

472
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,700
Please, don't!

473
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:01,973
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:04,363
If I'd known you worked
for Blade, I...

475
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,282
Shen, find the girl.

476
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,950
What a pretty smile.

477
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:15,902
And I'm gonna rip yours off.

478
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:56,593
You're gonna be alright.

479
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,020
You're gonna be alright.

480
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:09,612
He said he wanted
a hundred people.

481
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,593
One hundred people and
I'd get to live forever.

482
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,680
You're not going anywhere.

483
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,361
Yes, we are.

484
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:37,110
Now living forever?

485
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:42,180
I got you!

486
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,943
It's just not you!

487
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:29,952
You're a hunter.
Like me.

488
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:31,650
I'm nothing like you.

489
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,273
But you are.
You enjoy it.

490
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,662
Enjoy what?

491
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:39,643
Killing, pain, torture.

492
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,441
You think you're special?

493
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:43,331
Some kind of god?

494
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:46,371
I am a seraphim!

495
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:50,290
A prince appointed by a power
much higher than us.

496
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:53,210
You're nothing but an another
crazy ass vampire.

497
00:37:54,298 --> 00:37:55,742
Blasphemy!

498
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:50,960
You were sent by the devil
to challenge my faith.

499
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:53,031
To close the doorway
to the heavens.

500
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,840
You talk too much.

501
00:39:04,116 --> 00:39:05,480
What's the matter, asshole?

502
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,213
Not smiling anymore?

503
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:10,430
You know, I think
I see the light.

504
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:35,782
I got you, ok?

505
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,220
Everything is gonna be
alright now.

506
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:44,501
I still don't understand
everything that happened.

507
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:48,100
Take care of yourself.

508
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:08,763
Thorne, we're going home.

509
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:11,373
Call the jet. I wanna be
in the air within the hour.

510
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:13,761
The board will be
very interested to hear this.

511
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:15,100
I'm sure they will.

512
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:16,632
You've done well, Chase.

513
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,901
It's only the beginning
of what I can do for you.

514
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:27,670
A present. How nice.

515
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,980
The Daywalker's?

516
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:43,421
A promise.

517
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:48,300
Marcus now, Blade next.

518
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:51,423
Our relationship
is paying off already.

519
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:06,293
Shit!

520
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:24,740
What do want me to say?

521
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,382
That you were right?

522
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,982
You don't have
to say anything.

523
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:35,581
I lost everyone, mmh...

524
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:37,983
everything.

525
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:40,833
Addicts never handle
loss very well.

526
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,583
And that's what you are.

527
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,493
An addict.

528
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,771
But you have a choice.

529
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:50,063
Keep going or not.

530
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:54,401
Does it ever getting better?

531
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:59,310
Every time I kill a vampire.

532
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:09,252
Marcus is making his move against
the Chthon Pure Bloods soon.

533
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,490
I need to know where
it's gonna be.

534
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,542
He's not gonna tell me.

535
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:15,111
Get him to trust you.

536
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,341
And he will.

537
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:20,131
Yeah.

538
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,251
Do you trust her?

539
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:44,001
Next time on Blade.

540
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,533
Do you know a Pure Blood
named Charlotte?

541
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:49,222
One of Chthon's heavy hitters.

542
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:52,701
Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet,
blew out of the sky about an hour ago.

543
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:54,463
This ain't nothing you wanna
get involved in.

544
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,152
- Just get the hell out of here.
- I'm staying.

545
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,591
