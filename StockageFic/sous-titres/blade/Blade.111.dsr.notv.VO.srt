1
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,189
Did you have fun?

2
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,150
Fun?

3
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,245
Where have you been for
last 36 hours?

4
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,605
I didn't know you were counting.

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,556
Your absence is always apparent.

6
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,076
Really?

7
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:06,061
When you're gone, I hardly
even notice.

8
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:08,654
All I'm saying Krista
is that you were missed.

9
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,294
So you and I spend a night together
and now I'm on your leash.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,010
Of course not.

11
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:17,293
I was just concerned.

12
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:18,354
Don't be.

13
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:20,183
About Charlotte.

14
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:22,550
What about her?

15
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,441
She intercepted Chase.

16
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:26,162
Tried to corrupt her.

17
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,730
And?

18
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:31,011
Chase loyalties are with us,
as they will always be.

19
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,320
Why would Charlotte
make a play now?

20
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:36,463
Do you think she knows?

21
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,011
About my plans against them?

22
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,361
It doesn't matter.

23
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,043
Since when?

24
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,243
Since right about...

25
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:48,311
this very moment.

26
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:20,451
Do you think this will
be our world forever?

27
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:25,252
Or we will one day walk in
daylight like Marcus promises?

28
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,992
For once, I'm at a loss to know.

29
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,132
So many changes occurring.

30
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,613
This Marcus business.

31
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:34,411
The Conclave approaching.

32
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,103
Yes, and Gonnesse.

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,142
Still part of me has hope.

34
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,950
Odd isn't it?

35
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:49,012
Perhaps, it's knowing that
Chase is now on our side.

36
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:52,572
Or perhaps it's the prize
she's promised us.

37
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:15,063
Didn't I say it'd be 
awesome up here.

38
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:18,183
You didn't say it'd this cold.

39
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,351
Small price to pay.

40
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,043
Hearing all this.

41
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,862
I don't hear anything.

42
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:30,952
Exactly, no cars,
no cell phones,

43
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:35,192
no corporate sheep babbling
their corporate bullshit.

44
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,163
Just you and me...

45
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:53,470
Holy shit!!!

46
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,870
Call 911!

47
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,173
We don't have cell phone!

48
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,031
Maybe someone made it.

49
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:03,651
Come on!

50
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:33,923
Blade The Series - 111 - Monsters

51
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,000
Any luck?

52
00:04:58,205 --> 00:04:59,552
Another dead end.

53
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,651
With a dead vampire
I'm guessing.

54
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,641
Only thing I made ***.

55
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,131
You get that list done yet?

56
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,901
It'd be easier finding places
Marcus didn't own property.

57
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,873
Dude got buildings worldwide.

58
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,953
I mean I find 90 so far 22
in North America alone.

59
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,940
We only need to find one.

60
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,383
Where he's gonna mask
to Chthon Pure Bloods.

61
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,242
So you can go watch?

62
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,270
So I can join the party.

63
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,711
We're gonna getting close uh?

64
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,510
The big brass ring.

65
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:36,832
We'll be getting a big brass dick
if we don't find out where
it’s going down.

66
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,870
Any word on Krista?

67
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,021
Not a peep since
she went back to Chthon.

68
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,222
You think she’s getting
hell for being AWOL too long?

69
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,563
All Chthon all you get is hell.

70
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:48,950
What's that?

71
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:50,422
Company.

72
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:54,551
Probably just a homeless guy
looking for a place to crash.

73
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,563
That's a gun, not a pillow.

74
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,993
Let's go wish him good night.

75
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,811
You, get up!

76
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:47,173
Ok.

77
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,791
Easy, put your hands
above you head.

78
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:51,461
Turn around slowly.

79
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,742
Were you Eric Brook...

80
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:55,611
Wait a minute,
you're not Blade!

81
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,990
And you're not that smart!

82
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,083
Oh...

83
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,172
my god!

84
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:17,722
Who was that?

85
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,351
Scott, no one...

86
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,463
would survive this.

87
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,730
I  don't think I wanna
be here anymore.

88
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:28,881
- Elise stay put, I'll be right back.
- No!

89
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,302
Jesus!

90
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,311
Honey, are you, are you...
are you ok?

91
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,221
I will be in a moment.

92
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:04,431
Scott?

93
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,162
Scott?

94
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:21,760
Enjoy your nap?

95
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,401
He won't wake up
for the next one.

96
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,062
Hey, easy guys, I'm uh,

97
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,133
I'm just someone looking
for a few answers.

98
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:28,230
Just someone?

99
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,452
Alright I'm a Fed.

100
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,191
Ok, that hurt.

101
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,443
I hate Feds.

102
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:36,853
Yeah he does. They anger him.

103
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,622
Now start talking.

104
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,772
Kind of a long story.

105
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,930
You ain't going nowhere.

106
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,253
So  Charlotte is dead?

107
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,131
As Cesar. And only
a hundred years too late.

108
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,841
- And a Pure Blood believe you.
- Unanimously.

109
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,612
I've been filling cause all day.

110
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:56,132
It's a horrible loss.
A painful day for the vampire nation.

111
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:59,422
And just what I told them it was.
A tragic accident.

112
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:02,132
Though, I may have planted
the tinyest seed.

113
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,252
Could have been an act of retaliation
from the House of Armaya.

114
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,601
Marcus?

115
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,480
Be careful.

116
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,332
- If the board suspects 
even the slightest thing.
- Please.

117
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,632
Compared to convincing Charlotte I
was a loyal servant all these years,

118
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:21,833
making those idiots think
that I'm consumed with grief
will be walking in a park.

119
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,850
So the Conclave is proceeding.

120
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:27,590
They're insisting upon it.

121
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:30,113
Said the delivery of Aurora
would have been Charlotte's wish.

122
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,502
A tribute to her enduring
legacy in the House of Chthon.

123
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,663
My  only regret?

124
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:41,741
It's that I didn't get to watch
the little bitch die in the same
excruciating manner they all will.

125
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,253
So Toronto?

126
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,733
What job do I get?

127
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,050
The best one.

128
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,191
Unleashing it.

129
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:53,971
Probably more condoleances now.

130
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,700
Van Sciver.

131
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,141
No.

132
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,190
No, don't put him on the phone.

133
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:07,400
I wanna to hear his explanation
in person in my office
first thing tomorrow.

134
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:08,861
Problem?

135
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:12,191
Renovation on the Conclave site
is falling behind.

136
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:15,041
Bringing the architect here
for a little come to Jesus!

137
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,313
Should I join the party?

138
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,812
You know how much I enjoy
helping people meet our Lord.

139
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,800
No you stay here.
Keep us on schedule.

140
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:22,031
Krista'll help me.

141
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:23,723
Marcus, not her!

142
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,941
You have your job Chase,
so do it.

143
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,600
Your people at the FBI
know you find me?

144
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,013
Actually.

145
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,234
I haven't uh,

146
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,263
kept them up to speed
in my investigation.

147
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,153
- I don't think they'd understand.
- Good.

148
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,382
Now do everybody a favor,
and leave.

149
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:46,820
Leave?

150
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:50,100
This ain't nothing
you wanna get involved in.

151
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,453
You got a ring on your finger.

152
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,101
Go back to your family
wherever they are.

153
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,910
- Just get the hell out of here.
- I'm staying.

154
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,222
Not if you plan
on living.

155
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,713
Hey listen to me!

156
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,553
I'm not some asshole off
the street. I'm a Federal agent!

157
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,673
We can work together.
Take down Van Sciver.

158
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,531
- Nobody is bringing him down.
- He's a goddamn killer.

159
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:08,873
I'm not saying he doesn't
deserve it.

160
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:10,793
But right now his goals
are my goals.

161
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,143
Enemy of my enemy
and all that...

162
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,213
Fine, so when you're done with that,
then we take him down.

163
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,512
We?

164
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,402
There's no we.

165
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,573
There's me and there's vampires.

166
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,210
I kill 'em and they die.

167
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:29,892
Only way it works.

168
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,170
You want me stopped?

169
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,302
Stop me.

170
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,092
Not a problem.

171
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,142
Another incoming.

172
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:39,783
Payphone...

173
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,772
22nd & Adams.

174
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:42,833
Gotta be her.

175
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,593
And?

176
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:47,542
I'll kill him in a second.
Just answer it.

177
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,481
- Krista?
- Yeah, it's me.

178
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,911
Tell me you've found
out where the Conclave is at.

179
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,912
Sorry, but Marcus has already
started the blood bath.

180
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:57,753
Do you know a Pure Blood
named Charlotte?

181
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,940
- One of Chthon's heavy hitters.
- Well not anymore.

182
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:04,431
Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet,
blew out of the sky about an hour ago.

183
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,922
Hey, one hunter down, five to go.

184
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,632
Where was Charlotte's plane
when he took her down?

185
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,753
Somewhere over
north of Michigan.

186
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,730
Hey, listen, I gotta get back.

187
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,793
Just thought you guys should know.

188
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,221
We gotta find that plane.

189
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:25,111
Blade those vamps ashed
long before they hit the ground.

190
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,442
I'm not looking for them.

191
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:27,613
Just what they had.

192
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,153
Pure Bloods live like ghosts.

193
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,450
Secret lives, always on the move.

194
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,230
Which means all the information
travels with them.

195
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,723
Maybe even edges to the Conclave.

196
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,522
If it didn't burn up.

197
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,510
We find the wreckage
and we find out.

198
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,432
- So get on it.
- Ok,

199
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,603
but finding a down plane
in the middle of nowhere

200
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:48,121
could take a couple of hours,
maybe a couple of days.
I'm not exactly the FAA.

201
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,402
You don't need the FAA,
just the FBI.

202
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:55,130
Bureau has access
to Napster 3.0 for flights.

203
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:56,813
Domestic surveillance imaging.

204
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,280
So do it.

205
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:00,250
We need the information.

206
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,563
We?

207
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:04,671
- I... I thought there was no we.
- Let me guess,

208
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,433
unless you're involved.

209
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,423
Where you go I go.

210
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,421
Forget it.

211
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,211
And good luck finding
that plane!

212
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,383
Hey Collins, he barely lets me
going anywhere with him

213
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,332
and this time I'm going.

214
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,151
Dude.

215
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,411
He's staying here.

216
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,213
Track the Conclave for ***.

217
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:25,263
- You said we've find it out there.
- I said maybe.

218
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,781
It could turn out just to be
another dead end.

219
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:27,811
Great!

220
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,570
So it's back printouts 
and push pens and hey!

221
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:33,810
Even before I do that,
I gotta pull a missing jet
out of my ass!

222
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,640
Wasting time
doing that too.

223
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:38,042
Answer might just be
a few clicks away.

224
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,950
Okay, Collins.

225
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,640
Find the goddamn plane.

226
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,763
Alright.

227
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:23,031
Sir?

228
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,462
You wanted to see me?

229
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:27,800
Don't I always?

230
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,681
Yeah.

231
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,622
Sometimes so much
you come to my room unasked.

232
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,993
Not to be confused with
those times you invite me in.

233
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,291
Let me say again.

234
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:43,160
I invaded your privacy
and I apologize.

235
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,071
Accepted.

236
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:47,270
Now,

237
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,530
about me invading your privacy.

238
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:55,843
Well that was simply
something that happened.

239
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,433
Exactly.

240
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,241
Not to say it was meaningless.

241
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,033
- I didn't...
- Good, because I would hate
to exclude you

242
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,222
from the number of things
recently that have given me
great pleasure.

243
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,483
- Like?
- Like,

244
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,771
you coming to a better
understanding of who I am.

245
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,070
And me getting to collect
on a debt long owned me by Domic.

246
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,093
Hallucinations and murder.

247
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:17,603
I'm almost touched the game
with me ranks so highly.

248
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:19,312
You know what I mean.

249
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:22,850
So what's on the menu
for today?

250
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:25,873
Well, despite Charlotte's
tragic demise,

251
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,253
the leaders of our House have
agreed that Aurora should be
delivered as planned.

252
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,872
Right now they're preparing
to join into the Conclave from
points around the world.

253
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,451
Unfortunately though,
the building's restauration
is falling behind schedule.

254
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:38,972
I have summoned my architect.

255
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,913
I was hoping that you and I could 
impress upon him the importance
of meeting our deadline.

256
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:45,133
I'm sure we can.

257
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,103
And it shouldn't take long
for me to get up to speed either.

258
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,940
That...

259
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:53,960
would be a terrible mistake.

260
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,410
You don't trust me?

261
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,042
I think

262
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:03,663
that you and I can spend
the next half-an-hour
more productively.

263
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,120
You didn't answer my question.

264
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:11,273
I only trust those I know.

265
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,501
So this would be you getting
to know me better?

266
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:16,111
Like I said,

267
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,323
you've  got under my skin.

268
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,381
And allow me the same pleasure.

269
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:33,903
Holy shit!

270
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:38,363
Come on!

271
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,593
So what exactly
are we looking for?

272
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,523
Paper work, laptops,

273
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,213
any kind of information.

274
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,510
Hey Blade?

275
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,063
Did you find any bodies?

276
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,121
I'm not expecting to.

277
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,582
Charlotte's people
would have all been vampires.

278
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,281
Vampires ash.

279
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:25,490
We have a pretty good
hole here.

280
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:27,100
Take it back and
comb through it.

281
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,890
Not just yet.

282
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:31,381
What is it?

283
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,830
Blood.

284
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:35,352
Jesus!

285
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,563
- What are you, a vampire?
- Half.

286
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:42,053
Still happy you came along?

287
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:53,753
Ok...

288
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:56,510
Collins, over here!

289
00:17:56,717 --> 00:18:00,092
Jesus! I guess there was
a human aboard.

290
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,800
Look at their necks.

291
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,760
There were fed on.

292
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,660
Somebody in that plane survived.

293
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,103
How is that possible?

294
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:12,003
Doesn't  matter.

295
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,491
Only thing that matters
is finding 'em

296
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,632
and killing 'em.

297
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,082
Faster, it will be light soon.

298
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,293
Put me down.

299
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:39,891
Finally, refuge.

300
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,950
Another meal as well.

301
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:51,680
So what uh,
what language is this?

302
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,321
Serdic, vampire mother tongue.

303
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,651
- You can read it?
- Shen can.

304
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,053
The other guy who
is working for you.

305
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,133
Not working,
an arrangement.

306
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,763
He's been looking for
a couple of vampires for years.

307
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,551
And then you kill them?

308
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,043
Just find them.
Shen gets the honors.

309
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,163
What about the girl
who called? Krista?

310
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,843
What about we see how long
you can walk without asking
me a question?

311
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:13,991
Sorry.

312
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,463
Investigating is the job.

313
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,123
Was.

314
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:19,461
You got fired from the FBI.

315
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,043
On the computer.

316
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,621
You tipped in
the name Jessica Ellis.

317
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,892
So,

318
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:28,211
- unless you had
some kind of an operation.
- No.

319
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,093
No. I got fired.

320
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,231
I found out my bosses were working
for Van Sciver as well as the Bureau.

321
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,150
He had some kind of a...

322
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,112
- a tatoo on his wrist like a...
- Glyph.

323
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,292
Your bosses are familiars.

324
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:44,011
That's what you call 'em,
familiars?

325
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,053
I call 'em targets.

326
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:51,503
Blade you and I are more
like than you think.

327
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:53,963
We both kill monsters.

328
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:58,093
What do you know
about monsters?

329
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,400
More than I'd like,

330
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,513
year and a half ago.

331
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,363
I arrested to a spree killer,

332
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,413
he just liked murdering people.

333
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,290
Tracked  him down, made a case,
locked him up.

334
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:16,081
His lawyer found a problem
with the warrant.

335
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,322
Got him sprung.

336
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,132
While he was awaiting his trial,

337
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,312
he took the opportunity to uh,

338
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:25,242
break into my house.

339
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:30,811
He murdered my wife and child.

340
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,230
Sara and Johanna.

341
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:38,762
I made sure he didn't make it
to the second trial.

342
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,310
Franck?

343
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,222
You are on pancakes.

344
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:03,590
Ok, when those doors open,

345
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:06,472
I want big smiles,
people, big smiles.

346
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,993
Knock it off before 
I start cracking heads.

347
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,181
I'm going to the back
to get more of *** sugar.

348
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,802
Let's go come on!

349
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,351
It's good.

350
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,221
Good Lord!

351
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,620
Are you alright?

352
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,032
Sir, can I help you?

353
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,630
Sir, can you hear me?

354
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,023
Nice place.

355
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,750
Look quiet though.

356
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,471
Like a crypt.

357
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,390
Where do you want to start?

358
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:29,870
Where they did.

359
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:50,911
Jesus!

360
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,091
I've seen some things but...

361
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,103
Closer you'll get to Charlotte,
the worse you're gonna see.

362
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:57,821
You think she's still here?

363
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,510
It's light out.

364
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,551
Nowhere else for her to go.

365
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,851
- Now let's get busy!
- Hey wait no!

366
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:05,571
They'll rise again.

367
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,710
- Exactly why she turned them.
- They're people!

368
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:08,993
Not anymore!

369
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,763
That's why we send 'em
to their graves now.

370
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,723
Hey, maybe someone
is still alive, come on!

371
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,541
No, Collins!

372
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,103
Dumbass!

373
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,673
Ok I got this!

374
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:29,850
Collins.

375
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:30,930
Ready?

376
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,032
It's a trap.

377
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,190
It's a school.

378
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,151
It could be a kid.

379
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,283
You gotta be kidding me!

380
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:37,351
Come on.

381
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:40,311
This is outrageous.

382
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:41,912
Marcus is pissed

383
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,692
because we're behind, so he
makes me drop everything
and come all the way here

384
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:47,061
just to keep me waiting!

385
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,271
Is there a problem Tucker?

386
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,772
Yes there is, your boss.

387
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,730
Who is he in with, Sabine?

388
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,493
Sorry for the delay,
please come in.

389
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,111
- I already told you that...
- No one

390
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,071
shuts me out.

391
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:22,630
How bad is it?

392
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,042
Bad.

393
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:27,811
Femoral artery.

394
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,522
Alright, I'm not leaving.

395
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,951
You will when I'll put your ass
out into the street.

396
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:36,053
Blade, half the town is
in here, ready to rise.
You told me yourself.

397
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,912
Do you ever leave
when someone tells you to?

398
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:39,083
Look,

399
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:41,162
you just go find Charlotte and
I'll take care of the rest of 'em.

400
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:42,423
How?

401
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,012
By being the bait.

402
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:49,502
I understand why you want
to retina scanners on the entrance.

403
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:53,263
I just don't get why the entire
ventilation system needs refitting.

404
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:54,730
Because I requested it.

405
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,822
But the one in there is fine!

406
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:58,633
The compressors are 78/50,

407
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,883
the ACH for the *** fine.

408
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,490
Which is way more than enough.

409
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,370
My guests are irreclusive.

410
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,252
I know who your guests are.

411
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,552
I'm busting my ass for accomodating
their long lists of security needs.

412
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:11,830
As well as yours.

413
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:14,490
The location for the Conclave site
is very highly guarded secret.

414
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,983
I get that!

415
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:19,041
You just need to understand
this is a very old building.

416
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:20,772
Beautiful but old.

417
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:22,132
Which means the preparation...

418
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:25,241
Mr. Marfit,
this is not a negociation.

419
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,443
- Who is she?
- My associate.

420
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:30,372
Well, tell your associate
I do not respond to threats.

421
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:31,921
What do you respond to, Tucker?

422
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:32,883
Excuse me?

423
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,403
Is it more money?

424
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:37,411
Because I'm suddendly getting
the distinct impression I'm being widdeled.

425
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:39,211
You know what Marcus?

426
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,931
You don't like
I'm doing this job?

427
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,240
Do it yourself.

428
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:43,682
You said what?

429
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:45,130
You've heard me.

430
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:46,801
I'm hoping I didn't.

431
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:48,373
Or what?

432
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:51,011
You'll fire me, kill me?

433
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:52,692
This close to your big party.

434
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:55,400
And even if you did,

435
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:59,042
you'll never find someone
half as good as me.

436
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,851
There are buildings all over
the world that attest of the fact

437
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,890
that we are a hell of a team.

438
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:09,200
But you must remember that you're not
the only one under a hell of
lot of pressure on this job!

439
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:12,250
And even though,
I may be just a familiar

440
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:13,961
but I believe
I've earned the right

441
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,802
to not be treated like
a goddamn shoe-shine boy.

442
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,770
You know, Tucker, you're right.

443
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,170
I'm not going to fire you.

444
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:31,961
And I'm certainly not gonna waste
your considerable talent
by killing you.

445
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,841
In fact, I'll make you a promise.

446
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:39,073
Money is as no object,
while this project is concerned.

447
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:41,250
We'll supply you with
every additional ressource.

448
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,320
Tools, man power,
anything you require.

449
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:50,702
Thank you.

450
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,453
And if even then,

451
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,593
though you get everything
you've asked for,

452
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,393
the location is not completely
ready for the Conclave,

453
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:00,921
I promise I will render every one
you ever loved...

454
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:03,063
just like this!

455
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,442
You may not be replacible,

456
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:13,182
but every one around you...

457
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:14,752
is.

458
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,460
Sabine!

459
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:24,982
See, you already
have a new assistant.

460
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,572
Don't worry, Mr. Marfit,

461
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:29,260
I'll be right behind you
every step away.

462
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,870
Now Tucker,
do us all a favor.

463
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:34,750
Go back and finish your job.

464
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:46,130
Thank you.

465
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:53,753
Dispose of that.

466
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:57,150
Krista!

467
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,172
I'll do it,
as I always have.

468
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:05,003
Yes Chase,
as you always have.

469
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:22,612
You're sure about this?

470
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,812
It's better than leaving huh?

471
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,082
And if it doesn't work.

472
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,190
Then you do me a favor.

473
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:35,402
- And you make sure...
- Trust me, you won't.

474
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:27,061
No, I'm safe where I am 
for the moment.

475
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,372
Send no one until dusk.

476
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:31,190
Make no other moves.

477
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:34,911
I want Marcus to enjoy
his little illusion of victory.

478
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,713
Till it's time for him
not to enjoy it.

479
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,531
I'll sleep untill dark.
Then we're gone.

480
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,200
Ok.

481
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,023
Come on, you bastards!

482
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,571
That's right.

483
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,342
Fresh human blood.

484
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,602
Everybody gets a taste,
come on!

485
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,212
God, I hope this works.

486
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,973
What was that?

487
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:29,430
Time is up, Pure Blood.

488
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:38,280
Charlotte?

489
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:48,322
Hey, Lurch.

490
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:42,392
Freeze.

491
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:44,402
Please don't hurt me.

492
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,033
Those things out there.

493
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:47,962
We were helping out with pancakes.

494
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:49,791
They got my daddy.

495
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,562
I ran in here to hide.

496
00:33:53,006 --> 00:33:53,923
No.

497
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,423
No, you're the...
the Pure Blood.

498
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,443
I just wanna find my daddy.

499
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:01,853
And make everything ok.

500
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:10,513
Alright, honey.

501
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,900
I'll help you find your daddy.

502
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,742
I wanna hear you scream.

503
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:33,720
Scream!!!

504
00:34:35,938 --> 00:34:37,903
Can you hear me now???

505
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:43,561
Collins.

506
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,733
Blade?

507
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,520
Blade!

508
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,501
So good to finally meet you.

509
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,252
Wish I could say the same.

510
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:18,761
Come now.

511
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,793
No respect for
long time fellow?

512
00:35:20,915 --> 00:35:22,081
Not even a little.

513
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,300
Well, I have respect for you.

514
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,531
That's why hope you'll entertain
my offer.

515
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:30,540
You're in a position
to offer anything?

516
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:31,841
I'll admit,

517
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:35,473
recent events haven't quite gone
as I would have liked.

518
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,161
But now it's clear.

519
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:39,760
You and I share
a common ennemy.

520
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:41,862
Marcus.

521
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:46,443
I might even be able to broker
you a deal between you and
the Twelve Houses.

522
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:50,782
Allow me to get to the Conclave
and I'll secure you a place
in the family.

523
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,610
You're half of what we are Blade.

524
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:56,932
I wouldn't even claim that much
keenship with a traitor like Marcus.

525
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,860
Think about it.

526
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:02,583
A chance to have a home.
To lay down your arms.

527
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:05,340
We could put your skills
to their best use.

528
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:09,040
Help your many talents
flower like never before.

529
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,362
You know Charlotte,

530
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:15,141
that does sound pretty good.

531
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:20,411
But this is my only talent.

532
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,613
Nice.

533
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:31,862
Collins,

534
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,193
don't worry.

535
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm getting you out of here.

536
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,073
No, it's too late.

537
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:38,663
But,

538
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,731
thanks for letting me do it.

539
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,551
Do what?

540
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:46,431
Kill a few monsters.

541
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:50,902
Now it's your turn.

542
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:53,911
Collins, listen you don't...

543
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,121
No,

544
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:56,952
no, you promised.

545
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:40,750
Oh Marcus, no.

546
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:42,200
Yes.

547
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:44,493
It was hers.

548
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:47,553
Long ago, too long.

549
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:28,601
Doesn't anyone knock
in this place?

550
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,483
I knocked, you didn't answer.

551
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,313
I was in the shower.

552
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:35,041
For a very long time.

553
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,443
What do you want Chase?

554
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,340
Only to let you know

555
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,093
that I understand.

556
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,031
Understand?

557
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,033
What he sees in you.

558
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,463
Your beauty.

559
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,342
Your youth.

560
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,311
Even a man trully dead

561
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,710
cannot help but notice.

562
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:15,840
I only wish
he could see what I see.

563
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:18,320
Which is?

564
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,080
Nothing.

565
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,650
I look at you Krista,

566
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,333
and I see absolutely nothing.

567
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:29,603
Oh, maybe not nothing.

568
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:33,131
I suppose I do see
a hollow little girl

569
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:35,961
playing hollow little games.

570
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,520
The only thing

571
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:41,092
about you of any substance,

572
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:44,803
any real value, is this.

573
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,541
And it isn't even yours.

574
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,841
It is now.

575
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:54,953
At least you've finally found
the grace to accept one
of the many gifts

576
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,702
- you've been offered.
- Such as?

577
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,172
The gift of this House.

578
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:06,893
The gift of friendship
I've continually extended to you.

579
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,400
The gift

580
00:40:08,585 --> 00:40:10,981
of healing.

581
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,393
Is that what this visit
is about Chase? Healing?

582
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,682
Or do you just want
your man back?

583
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,573
That's entirely up to you.

584
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:26,863
But I'd hate to think that
in the next few days

585
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,633
when so much change
is happening to the House.

586
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:31,953
You didn't have me
as your friend.

587
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:35,511
Because I know you don't
want me as your enemy.

588
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:38,621
Can I get back
to you on that?

589
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:41,770
Of course.

590
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:58,100
Let's just hope time
doesn't run out before you do!

591
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,821
Tic toc.

592
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:23,562
Next time on the
season finale of Blade.

593
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:26,321
You gotta get out, Marcus' people
are coming for you.

594
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:28,272
Give it up, Daywalker!

595
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:31,422
What are you doing?

596
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:33,351
Toying with you.

597
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,740
My final performance.

598
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:38,500
Where is the new place?

599
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,982
Waiting your touch.

600
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:41,811
I come bearing a magnificient gift.

601
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:44,051
The gift of a new dawn
for our House.

602
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:52,590
