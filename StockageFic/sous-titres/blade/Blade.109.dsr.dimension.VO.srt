00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:03,228
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:05,535
We can stay together for a while.

3
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:07,605
We can stay together
forever if you want.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,223
What are you doing?!

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:11,669
- She turned her mother.
- That's what it looks like.

6
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:12,766
Boone is dead.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,366
- Domic learnt nothing from him.
- He knows!

8
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:16,429
Charlotte!

9
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:17,605
Domic!

10
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:20,553
Armaya is back in the fold by Friday.

11
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,899
Or Chthon will be destroyed.

12
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,143
Silver, mirrors are backed with it.

13
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,203
What is this?

14
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,553
Sex trade, illegal body parts,

15
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:32,000
I've never seen this before.

16
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,423
Van Sciver isn't human.

17
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,822
- I've gonna get...
- No, you have to believe me,
I've seen things.

18
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,110
- I don't buy this...
- No, listen to me!

19
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,300
And what are you?

20
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,670
You're just... infected.

21
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:44,021
You're nothing but pieces of
meat that got a reprieve.

22
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:48,112
Chase, what are you doing?

23
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:51,361
Giving you the chance to prove
that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.

24
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,373
Pure Bloods could die, and that we,

25
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,341
the infected ones, will be
the ones to take you all down.

26
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,871
Who is infected now?

27
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,871
I'm so thirsty, honey!

28
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:06,180
She's fed to many times,

29
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,022
she's been turned for too long.

30
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:09,990
Mom!

31
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:11,030
Krista?

32
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:12,710
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,912
Slow down, sweetheart.

34
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,591
Then again, everyone
who loved you is dead.

35
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,232
And it's all your fault.

36
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,502
I need another one.

37
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:18,991
Beautiful women...

38
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,623
should never have
to buy their own drinks.

39
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:25,282
Thanks.

40
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,970
I'm Lance by the way.

41
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:37,713
You see, this is where
you supposed to say who you are.

42
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,390
Someone you don't
wanna know.

43
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,661
Why? Do you bite?

44
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:46,500
So mystery girl, are you...

45
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,262
here to forget a bad day or
are you looking to have
a good night?

46
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,830
Just trying to have a drink.

47
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:52,721
Alone.

48
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,443
In a place like this?

49
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,283
Let me get you another one.

50
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,511
Bartender?

51
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,262
Whatever she's having,
we'll have the bottle.

52
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:03,470
Lance?
Go away.

53
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:04,652
Look,

54
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,473
VIP room upstairs

55
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,352
guy ***

56
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:11,822
You and I will go out
and we chill, and uh...

57
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,240
You can use some warmed up,
you're ice cold honey.

58
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,082
I can get a lot colder.

59
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:23,743
You're a crazy bitch,
you know that?

60
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:25,520
Yeah, I know.

61
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,752
Blade The Series - 109 - Angels and Demons

62
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,102
You look like a little boy,

63
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,441
Waiting to open presents
on Christmas morning.

64
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:26,540
These are exciting times, Chase.

65
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:28,282
So the final ***
is confirmed?

66
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:29,860
Overwhelmingly.

67
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:33,460
All that's left is replication
the pathogen and of generalization
for delivery.

68
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,501
That,

69
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,271
and you enjoy the last look
on their faces.

70
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,862
I hate to ruin your day,

71
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,290
but you remember a few nights ago
when that woman stormed the lobby

72
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,752
then killed our disposal team?

73
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,543
One Lisa Starr.

74
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,511
Tell me you're joking.

75
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,303
Crazed, out of control,

76
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,272
like mother, like daughter.

77
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,481
Where is Krista?

78
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,683
We are about to achieve
something magnificient here.

79
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:59,980
Transform Chthon into
something new, something better.

80
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:03,250
Maybe it's time we thin our ranks,
clear out the underbrush.

81
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,703
Locate Krista and
collect her, safely.

82
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:10,122
Once the Pure Bloods are gone,
the last thing we need
is a problem like Krista.

83
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,521
Chase!
Find her!

84
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,452
This is where you guys work?

85
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,931
I gotta say, it looks
better over a computer.

86
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,742
Ever heard of a lamp,
maybe a couple of throw pillows?

87
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,882
- Did you bring 'em?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:32,833
The Aurora vaccine
I just needed in half,

89
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:37,233
and, a little bit less of the
stuff that came out of the girl.

90
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,040
Final results are right here.

91
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,682
So Marcus is making a...

92
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:46,913
Pure Blood poison?

93
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,803
It's biological masterpiece.

94
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,941
The Aurora vaccine
was just a start.

95
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,473
The emerging agent
is a DNA-based weapon

96
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:56,501
specifically engineered
to attack the Pure Blood genom.

97
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,550
It's one nasty bug.

98
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:00,932
Why use a pregnant woman?

99
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,922
A womb is the perfect
nutrient rich incubator.

100
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:08,493
It also ensures biological immunity
for anyone other than
the intended target.

101
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,190
So it's armless against us.

102
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,011
It only kills Pure Bloods.

103
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:17,491
So that sneaky bastard
wasn't even trying to create
a vampire immunity.

104
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,611
He was playing a palace coup.

105
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,311
Dude, crack a smile.

106
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:25,042
If Marcus takes out the
Pure Blood trash, we don't have to.

107
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,381
Maybe.

108
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,501
All he needs to do is get
the Pure Bloods together
in one place.

109
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,002
Sounds like a party.

110
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,920
You think Krista
got an invitation?

111
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,471
Find her, and I'll ask.

112
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:36,951
I'm trying.

113
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,712
Blurried all eyes in the street
but no one's seen her shadow.

114
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,363
Jus get it done.

115
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,453
No, really Blade.
You don't have to thank me.

116
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:49,711
Welcome to my nightmare.

117
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,873
Get off of me!

118
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,930
Please, I... said no!

119
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,911
***

120
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,831
Is that the only word
you bitches can say!

121
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,181
"No"?

122
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,291
Please!

123
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,631
I said no!

124
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,993
You... leave!

125
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:33,483
You... die!

126
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,413
Krista.

127
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,312
We've been looking
for you, darling.

128
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,862
It's time to go home.

129
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:14,890
Excuse-me sir.

130
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:18,482
What?

131
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,752
Armaya's reinstatement
has just become official.

132
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:26,000
The leaders of all the factions
are sending very generous gifts.

133
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,362
Send them back.

134
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:29,982
Sir?

135
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:31,922
Screw them all.

136
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,972
We're going to clean
this House.

137
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,093
Once I'm done with
the House of Chthon.

138
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:38,390
I thought that we were.

139
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,961
We haven't even started.

140
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,673
Call Van Sciver.

141
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,902
Tell him that we're stopping
by for a little visit.

142
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,472
Domic, with all your respect,
it's not wise.

143
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,202
It's necessary.

144
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:52,529
Charlotte and her lap dog Marcus
have been living the good lives
for years.

145
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,353
Forcing us to live of
of tables craps.

146
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,573
But Chthon has already
provided you with everything
you've demanded.

147
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,613
Then it's time to demand more.

148
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,422
- Let go of me.
- Look what I've found.

149
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,021
Where have you been?

150
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,381
In a filthy alley,
rummaging for a midnight snack.

151
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,250
I've been worried
about you Krista.

152
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,270
You know, well, worry is
your middle name, ain't it?

153
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,190
You've been drinking.

154
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,342
Obviously not enough.

155
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,932
You know, bitterness
isn't the most attractive emotion.

156
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,473
What am I supposed to feel Marcus, mmh?

157
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,792
Gratitude?

158
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:35,382
It would be a start.

159
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,110
No, the start was when
you killed my brother.

160
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,613
I told you before.

161
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,250
I didn't mean to kill Zack.

162
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,112
Don't you even say his name!

163
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:52,521
You need to accept
you brother's fate,

164
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,743
the same you need
to accept your own.

165
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,210
What, by living here?

166
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,461
With you animals?

167
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,541
We're your family.

168
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:02,983
My family is dead!

169
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:06,990
All I ever loved,

170
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,132
everything I ever was
is gone!

171
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,820
Replaced by a life
even better.

172
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,382
Life?

173
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,873
All you've given me is
one long night of nothing!

174
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,330
Then you simply haven't
opened your eyes.

175
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,891
Oh they are opened,

176
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,131
and every day they look at you
and see the bastard that killed me.

177
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,713
You think you're the only one.

178
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:40,463
You think you're the only vampire
who's ever felt pain?

179
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,430
Who's ever suffered loss?

180
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,030
Help me!!!

181
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,297
Get her to her room.

182
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,851
Clean her off.

183
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:13,593
Sir?

184
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:14,593
He just called.

185
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,791
- He?
- Domic, he'll be here tomorrow night.

186
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:26,880
Shen?

187
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:28,990
Haven't found Krista yet.

188
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:31,102
So what are you
doing about it?

189
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,452
I told you.

190
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:33,742
Put the word out.

191
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,371
What do you want me to do?
Tack up flyers around the neighborhood?

192
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,853
Lost vampire. Last scene :
ashing her own mother.

193
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,951
Maybe suicidal, homicidal or both.
Needs her meds.

194
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,343
We have to find out where Marcus
is going to poison the Pure Bloods.

195
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,983
And Krista will tell us,
just relax!

196
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,451
Give the girl some time.

197
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,660
It's weird, isn't it?

198
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,052
What?

199
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,322
That I haven't taken
your head off yet?

200
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,202
No, you and Marcus,

201
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,601
on the same side, gunning
for the Pure Bloods.

202
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:02,253
I guess the ennemy of
my ennemy is my friend.

203
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,302
Well, I don't have a problem
of killing my friends either.

204
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,323
Oh, bingo.

205
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,331
What?

206
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:14,171
One of those streets punks
that hangs out downtown.

207
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,242
He just saw Krista get scooped
outside a club before daybreak.

208
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:20,612
- Hot ride, hotter blonde.
- Chase.

209
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,961
At least our girl's
still alive.

210
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,251
So to speak.

211
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,753
Grab your shit.

212
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,320
We're going to Chthon.

213
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,353
What do you want?

214
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:55,251
I need to know that you're better.

215
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:57,570
Uh, you mean no longer a threat.

216
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,543
If I thought you really meant
the things you said and did
in my office

217
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:04,293
then Chase would be disposing
an ash stained carpet right about now.

218
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,703
Then why am I tied up?

219
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,060
Because you are a threat
to yourself.

220
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,546
Screw you!

221
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,053
Krista?

222
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,681
Krista?

223
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,842
Do you really think
you're alone?

224
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,980
Everyone I had is gone.

225
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:22,232
Everyone you thought you had.

226
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,561
The ones whose memories
are fading even now

227
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,393
no matter how hard you try
to hold on to them.

228
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,862
What are those people
to you really?

229
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,970
Acquaintances come and go,

230
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,992
friends... lose touch.

231
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:37,141
- You move on, they move on.
- But my family?

232
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,000
Accident of birth.

233
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:42,112
No more intentional than the color
of your eyes.

234
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,141
But you and I...

235
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,832
we're connected.

236
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,632
My life is in you.

237
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,322
Flows through you.

238
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,241
You know this.

239
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,500
A.D.E...

240
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:02,852
Every vampire shares an eternal
link with the one who turned them.

241
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:05,283
That's the gift of the
after death experience.

242
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,152
Who I am, who I was,

243
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,271
now lives in your blood.

244
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:11,712
Your mind,

245
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:16,322
is the only bone that
can't be broken by hate or hurt

246
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,623
or even time.

247
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:23,532
So if you want to kill me,
fine.

248
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:29,602
Just know that you can't kill
the part of me that will live
inside of you... forever.

249
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,661
Marcus, where are you
taking me?

250
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,242
Your eyes are closed?

251
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:51,883
Ok, nearly there.

252
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,552
- Are they still closed?
- Yes.

253
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,481
Ok.

254
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:58,710
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

255
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,492
- But you're really ready?
- Marcus!

256
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,421
Ok, open.

257
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,373
Oh, it's beautiful.

258
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,500
It's ***.

259
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,722
It's, it's apauling.

260
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,573
No, it's ours.
It's yours and mine.

261
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,981
We can start with dry goods,
and then fresh produce and flowers.

262
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,693
Let's start by removing
the rog*** first, shall we?

263
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:25,270
Didn't I tell you coming here
would change everything?

264
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:26,912
Your father can't stop us now.

265
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:30,241
We're oceans away,
and we can do whatever we choose.

266
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,720
So, we can buy a house?

267
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,511
As soon as you find one.

268
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:34,700
Start a family?

269
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,121
Maybe even sooner than that.

270
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,002
Whatever I am, Isabelle,

271
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,382
whatever kind of man I become,

272
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:47,401
it's all because of you.

273
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,101
No, it's all been
taken care of.

274
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,851
He's here.
See you when we land.

275
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,450
Hey Ray, are you ready?

276
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,580
You keep your word
and get me that meeting with Hendricks.

277
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,272
That was the director's office
on the horn

278
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:16,902
Said they'll have a car waiting
for us.

279
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,643
Let's go.

280
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:20,030
I'm proud at you, Ray.

281
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,880
Coming in is the
right thing to do.

282
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,353
Oh, what are you doing, buddy?

283
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,543
Thanking God that I didn't
give you my back up yesterday.

284
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:32,851
Come one Ray,
don't do anything crazy.

285
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,050
Come on!

286
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,343
I saw the mark.

287
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,113
I know!

288
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,691
So what, you're gonna start
running like there's some place
to hide from them?

289
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,630
You tell me, you work for them!

290
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,993
What you gonna do, shoot me, now?
Here in the street? Come on!

291
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,523
Shoot me.

292
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:48,530
Come on!

293
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:50,711
Shoot me, Ray.

294
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,380
Isabelle?

295
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,530
Yes.

296
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,601
She is beautiful.

297
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,253
In every way.

298
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:26,763
And you were?

299
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:28,103
Younger?

300
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:31,212
Human.

301
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:38,490
What I saw, you and Isabelle,
was that before you were turned?

302
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,270
You already know.

303
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:01,833
Marcus?

304
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:03,503
Marcus?

305
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,252
Take a break,
I'll bring you dinner.

306
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:06,623
Isabelle.

307
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,423
Don't have time.

308
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:10,721
We open in 2 days.

309
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,441
Oh, 5 minutes won't kill you.

310
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,372
Hum, I'm sorry gentlemen,

311
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,682
but we don't actually open until
the day after tomorrow.

312
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:29,280
Evening, friend.

313
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,293
That's some venture
you're undertaking.

314
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:32,463
Ambitious.

315
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,011
Thank you.

316
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,033
- Uh, mister?
- Domic.

317
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,171
And let me guess
you are not from Detroit.

318
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:39,260
London.

319
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,882
Disgusting city.

320
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,632
*** the smell of myself.

321
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,072
What can I do for you
Mr. Domic?

322
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,622
Actually, it's...
what I could do for you.

323
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,031
I'm not sure I follow.

324
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,270
You're surely noticed ours
is a growing city.

325
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,643
Each day more enterprises are commenced,
more people arrive.

326
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:59,601
Unfortunately not all newcomers
are honest in these industries such as yourself.

327
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:02,151
Rebels who don't know how to comport
themselves like gentlemen.

328
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:06,332
I understand, and you would like
to protect me from such rebel.

329
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,913
All that is due me is a small
sum paid weekly.

330
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:11,670
For that, my associates and
I will provide a bull work

331
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:14,710
against the unsafe tides raising
in our fair streets.

332
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,862
That's very generous,
Mr. Domic, but uh,

333
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,432
I believe I'll decline
your offer.

334
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:19,422
Offer?

335
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,013
I don't recall making one.

336
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:24,983
Marcus?

337
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:27,950
It's all right, dear.

338
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,720
It's just our neighbors ***.

339
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,143
We should be opening properly
in the next few days.

340
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:35,181
Yes.

341
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,581
We'll be back then,
to finalize our arrangement.

342
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,110
Untill then Madam,

343
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,600
just tell your husband
to secure the front doors.

344
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,443
Detroit is a lovely city but

345
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,080
it has his ugly elements.

346
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,752
I heard his demands.

347
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,663
Then you heard my refusal.

348
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,921
- Marcus, I don't think a man like...
- Isabelle!

349
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,131
He's gone.

350
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:08,631
It's all right.

351
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,593
Now,

352
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,941
how about that dinner
that smells so good.

353
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:23,321
You're shitting me?
You wanna break into Chthon?

354
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,311
Girl's on a knife's edge.

355
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,380
If she falls off,
I wanna her falling our way.

356
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,050
So you can catch her right?

357
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,662
Right?

358
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,082
That's our way in.

359
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,463
The sewer?
Lovely.

360
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,312
It's how Krista
got to their labs.

361
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,260
And got caught.

362
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,060
We'll do it quieter.

363
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,281
I'll grab my tools.

364
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,141
And I'll grab mine.

365
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,173
How is sleeping beauty?

366
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,273
She's still sleeping.

367
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,342
You've been terribly
indulgent with her.

368
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:12,381
We all make allowances with
those who share birth experience.

369
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:13,861
You and Frederick for example.

370
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,470
I'd like to kill him.

371
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:18,432
And yet, you never have.

372
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:21,700
I hear Domic's on his way.

373
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,661
In a few hours.

374
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:26,741
What are you going to do?

375
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,543
Remind him who he's dealing with.

376
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,902
So shop keep, our arrangement?

377
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,540
I told you, there'll be none.

378
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,132
It would be wise to reconsider.

379
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,732
You'd be wise
to leave my store.

380
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:04,271
Better do as he says, fellows.

381
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,502
Man's armed with the push ***.

382
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:17,861
You'll get nothing from me Domic,
nothing!

383
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:21,390
We'll see, shop keep.
We'll see.

384
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:38,703
And I thought vampires were
the most disgusting things
in this place.

385
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:42,942
Well, Krista said the pipe
leading to the med lab is
around this corner.

386
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:49,883
Van Sciver bricked it up.

387
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:53,760
So this enjoyable little *** has gotten squat..

388
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:57,732
- We can get through this.
- No, no, no, wait!

389
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,820
Shock sensors.

390
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:04,813
Any unordinary vibration
and the cavalery comes running.

391
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:08,413
Well, we have to find the way
to know what's going on with Krista.

392
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:11,470
Think we just did.

393
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:27,263
Still no word from Gonesse?

394
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,573
Then we must assume they never will be.

395
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:33,160
At least, it confirms
our suspicions.

396
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:37,220
Marcus and his newest recruit
cannot be trusted.

397
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,841
Which means we will
accelerate our plans.

398
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,581
Bring me the girl.

399
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,260
*** the *** of
the security camera.

400
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:55,933
Oh, if I don't fry
myself first.

401
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:57,610
Got it.

402
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:02,240
Now, this trunk supports
the IT system PBX,

403
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:07,051
phones, data and alpha can just
isolate the security feed.

404
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,962
And, pop an uplink,

405
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:12,163
who can tune in to BSTV.

406
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:13,733
BSTV?

407
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:18,010
Blood Sucker Television,
24-hour Chthon network,

408
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:20,763
all vamps, all the time!

409
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,960
Tough room.

410
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,123
You think it's vampire
or familiars?

411
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:31,403
Either way, they die.

412
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,310
Keep working.

413
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:38,882
Control?

414
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,040
Have a possible breach
in tunnel 12,

415
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,393
checking it out now.

416
00:24:57,335 --> 00:24:58,603
You?

417
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,163
What you doing?

418
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:02,671
What does it look like I'm doing?
Getting a manucure?

419
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,191
Someone called city about an IT
line that got chewed through.

420
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,273
This is motorisation.

421
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,663
Toolbox, right there.

422
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:14,340
You got some real
problems, pal.

423
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:16,353
Real scary shit.

424
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:17,543
What?

425
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:18,910
Like rats?

426
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:20,440
No.

427
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,262
Daywalkers.

428
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,050
Done.

429
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,130
So was he.

430
00:25:56,915 --> 00:25:58,622
Sleep my angel.

431
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:16,783
Marcus!

432
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,631
You had your chance to pay.

433
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:27,261
No!

434
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,263
Now she will!

435
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,661
No, Isabelle!

436
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:35,681
No!

437
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,062
What kind of a monster
are you?

438
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,382
A monster?

439
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,130
I am something far greater.

440
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:35,430
Something you'll come
to understand.

441
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,230
I'd be rather choose death.

442
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:42,032
Death just chose you,
shop keep.

443
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:45,960
Isabelle?

444
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,810
Marcus?

445
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,612
Where are you taking me?

446
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:43,772
Blade.

447
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:45,003
I'm online.

448
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,080
So where is she?

449
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:58,951
There!

450
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,351
Something's wrong with her.

451
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,830
Yeah, she looks drunk.

452
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:07,243
No, something else.

453
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:17,610
Wait!

454
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:38,412
Help. Help me.

455
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,813
Agent Collins?

456
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:23,870
I'm sorry,

457
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,982
I had nowhere else to go.

458
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,592
- Come in, please.
- Thanks.

459
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,393
Was Sorensen alive?

460
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,212
I don't know. I think so.

461
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:41,032
- But you don't know...
- He was trying to kill me,
I didn't check his pulse.

462
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:45,203
I just have to stay alive
long enough to

463
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,931
expose these things for what
they are and the people who helped them.

464
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:50,153
Bastards like Sorensen.

465
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:53,613
You must think
I'm out of my mind.

466
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,362
Then we both are.

467
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,282
If you'd shown up at my door step
in the middle of the night

468
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:00,663
a month ago talking
about vampires.

469
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,473
Governments in collusion.

470
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,482
I probably would have called the cops.

471
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,912
What changed?

472
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,670
Everything.

473
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,283
What's this?

474
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:15,263
Proof

475
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:16,721
that you're not crazy

476
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:18,081
and neither am I.

477
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:19,762
Believe me, I started
to feel pretty nuts

478
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:22,041
trying to figure out
what happened that night
at the truck store.

479
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,722
The butcher truck?

480
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:25,481
Yeah, fire, the body pallets.

481
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,202
It all just got too weird.

482
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,253
So I called in a favor at central.

483
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:31,283
A friend of mine gave me
all the files of every case

484
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:33,452
over the last 10 years
with even the slightest similarity.

485
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:34,833
And?

486
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:36,591
And I found stuff.

487
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:38,343
Strange deaths.

488
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,410
Corpses with bite wounds.

489
00:32:40,565 --> 00:32:41,741
Evidence of...

490
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:44,223
events describing
spontaneous combustion.

491
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:45,983
So what are the people
to be ***?

492
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:48,280
Whoever does is trying
to burry him.

493
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:52,333
Right after I xeroxed all these
and got the originals
back to my friend at central.

494
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:53,821
He disappeared.

495
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:56,851
His job, his appartment,
every trace of him is gone.

496
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,021
They got him.

497
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,021
Somebody did.

498
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,822
So there's no one
who can help us?

499
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:03,412
There might be one.

500
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:05,262
He uh,

501
00:33:05,456 --> 00:33:07,990
he goes with
the name of Blade.

502
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:12,802
The guy is in profiling peg him
as psychopath with psyzophrenic deviations.

503
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,353
Blade on the other hand
reffers to himself as a hunter.

504
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:16,483
Who is he hunting?

505
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,891
Not who, what.

506
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:21,502
Is he custody?

507
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,792
He escaped.

508
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,453
Last seen in Detroit.

509
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,180
Van Sciver.

510
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:45,462
Domic.

511
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,231
I'm surprised you allowed me in.

512
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,803
Is that why you brought help?

513
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:50,600
Puzic, wait downstairs.

514
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:52,622
- Sir, I don't...
- Wait downstairs.

515
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:06,370
So, this is where it
all happens uh?

516
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:10,820
The heights from which the mighty
Marcus Van Sciver makes
the world do his bidding.

517
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,360
It's good furniture, Domic.

518
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,543
Please, suppress the urge
to urinate on it.

519
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:17,762
I just thought for the self proclaimed
leaders of the vampire nation,

520
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:20,642
the House of Chthon would be
a little more... upscale.

521
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,081
Get to the point.

522
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,413
Do I need one?

523
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,520
Can't I just visit?

524
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,132
We are partners now right?

525
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:28,852
Under protest.

526
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:30,290
Oh yeah, that's right,

527
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:34,541
you didn't want Charlotte
cutting me in on your little
experiments, did you?

528
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:38,633
Even after I found out it was
my people you were cutting up
to make it happen.

529
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:42,352
The House of Armaya will receive
priority access when
the Aurora vaccine is ready.

530
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:44,793
The negociations for this
arrangement have been concluded.

531
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:47,072
So there really is nothing left
for us to discuss.

532
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,693
That's just it.

533
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:51,133
I'm here to reopen
negociations.

534
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,261
I want a piece of
your action too.

535
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,030
Precisely what action
would that be?

536
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,082
All of it.

537
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,800
Real estate developments,

538
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,892
currency speculation.

539
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:05,502
My House has been living out
of *** for centuries.

540
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,922
So I want a slice of every pie
you got your fingers in.

541
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:11,402
I'm afraid,
you've made your trip in vain.

542
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:13,093
You'll receive nothing
more from me.

543
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:14,513
Or my House.

544
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:17,121
Do I have to remind you of
your place in the world, Van Sciver?

545
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,813
I am a Pure Blood.

546
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:23,233
I can take whatever I want from you
and there's not a goddamn thing
you could say about it.

547
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,140
You know what Domic,

548
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,641
there was a time when
it was indeed true.

549
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:32,520
You did take everything I had.

550
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:33,810
What are you talking about?

551
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,531
A hundred years ago.

552
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,120
My wife Isabelle.

553
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:39,002
I swallowed my grief.

554
00:35:39,148 --> 00:35:40,603
Biding my time.

555
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:42,803
A century's worth.

556
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:44,480
And now it's here.

557
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:48,362
The moment where I...
take from you.

558
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,931
Screw you!

559
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:51,622
And screw Isabelle!

560
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,710
Marcus?

561
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:24,562
Do you know how many men
I killed over the years?

562
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:27,163
How many women I've taken?

563
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:30,613
Why are you laughing?

564
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:32,831
You, all this time,

565
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,991
burning with revenge for me.

566
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,003
I don't even remember you

567
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:40,790
of whoever you say that whore
was you say I killed.

568
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:48,090
I don't remember.

569
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:50,801
I don't remember.

570
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,291
I do!

571
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,650
Marcus?

572
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,102
I'm fine!

573
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:10,390
I'll alert medical.

574
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:12,630
I said I'm fine Chase!

575
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:18,012
Domic's man. He's downstairs.

576
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:19,352
On my way.

577
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:28,482
Marcus, I saw what
happen to Isabelle.

578
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:29,800
To you.

579
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:32,560
It's only what happens
to all our kind.

580
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,702
Like you and your mother.

581
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:40,763
It hurts so much,
being alone.

582
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,263
Then you don't have
to be Krista...

583
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,810
ever.

584
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:07,701
Where is Domic?

585
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:08,843
Hell.

586
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,191
Care to join him?

587
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:46,380
Wait, wait, here she is.

588
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:51,103
- Who is she with? Is that...
- Yeah.

589
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,653
So where are they going?

590
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,002
It just got worse.

591
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:07,122
They're onto us, They're trying
to find our taps.

592
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:10,743
Not yet.

593
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,422
Damn it!

594
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,191
Hey?

595
00:40:22,658 --> 00:40:23,783
Where are you going?

596
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:27,650
