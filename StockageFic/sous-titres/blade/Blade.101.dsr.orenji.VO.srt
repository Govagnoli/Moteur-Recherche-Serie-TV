1
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,567
Do you know what happens next?

2
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:49,985
Da.

3
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,742
Where are you
shipping the bodies?

4
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,160
Detroit.

5
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,246
Who is taking possession?

6
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,997
Van Sciver.

7
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,375
Marcus Van Sciver.

8
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,214
Okay, you can go.

9
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,341
You kidding, yes ?

10
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,053
Yes.

11
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:05,268
Blade The Series - 101 - Pilot

12
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,418
You're lost ?

13
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,499
These streets are dangerous.

14
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:29,370
I can take care of myself.

15
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,172
Oh, really ?

16
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:36,552
And, uh,
these can take care of you.

17
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,013
Well, bring them him.

18
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,890
Not you.

19
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,941
We're gonna go
for a little ride.

20
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,042
Where are we ?

21
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:17,542
Friend of mine's.

22
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:24,840
- What is this place ?
- You're gonna love it, sweetheart.

23
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,272
Are you robbing me, asshole ?

24
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,193
Just wait here a
second, beautiful.

25
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,743
What the hell is in there ?

26
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,910
Don't worry about it.

27
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:17,351
It's easier if you don't struggle,
honey. 50 bucks ? Cheap Whore !

28
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,661
It's a disaster.

29
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,581
Just the way you like it.

30
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:21,963
Barred windows. Plenty of space.
And, if we get bored,

31
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:24,211
there's a ping pong
table in the back.

32
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,302
I know how much
you love ping pong.

33
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:29,513
Come on !

34
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:34,281
I've taken you to a half of dozen sites
sealed as tight as a frog's ass, you
pissed on every one of them.

35
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,812
You said we have to move fast.

36
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:36,600
We do.

37
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:39,862
Well then pick a place and throw
down your damn sleeping bag.

38
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,230
Set up shop.

39
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,660
Thanks Marcus.

40
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:58,121
You don't know how
much this means to me.

41
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,121
You deserve this, Zack.

42
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,542
You've been such a good boy !

43
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,251
It's right. But it's,

44
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,130
like, the last time you
ever really feel pain ?

45
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:19,692
There's only
pleasure I had baby.

46
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,550
- Hey Marcus. Is there anything I should know ?
- Get out of the car.

47
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:54,093
Is there a... speech I need to
say or a... prayer or something ?

48
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,560
Nobody wants a prayer.

49
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,563
We are big on unity, Zack, and trust
is an important part of that unity.

50
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:06,020
That's why we brought in here.

51
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,653
The House of Chthon has
a lot of locked doors.

52
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,660
Doors meant to hold my secrets.

53
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,331
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.

54
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,081
- Too many.
- Wait, wait !

55
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:08,343
She's home. Oh, my baby girl's home !
I missed you!

56
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm back.

57
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,790
It's great to have you back.

58
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,792
It's great to be back.

59
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:53,010
I heard about the
action you saw.

60
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:03,312
You know, I run that support
group up in Pyac if you need it.

61
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,103
How about that beer ?

62
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:09,652
Works too ! For a while.

63
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,440
You should eat something.

64
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,650
I will in a little while.

65
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:17,241
Where is Zack ?

66
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,623
He was arrested last week.

67
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,083
Listen.

68
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:27,041
I'm thinking we should all sit down,
have a nice long talk

69
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,793
- before he winds up in prison.
- Waste of time.

70
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:33,552
Mum ! He's not a bad guy!
He's just a little lost !

71
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,760
- Why do you always defend him ?
- Because nobody else will !

72
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,263
Look, why don't we just cool
down here and think about...

73
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:43,011
Oh, it's probably
Zack right now.

74
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:50,153
Is this the family of Zack Starr ?
- Yes.

75
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:54,071
Sorry, but there's
been a shooting.

76
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,411
I know this is very difficult for you,
Miss Starr.

77
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:20,593
That's my brother.

78
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:25,562
Twin brother, eh ?

79
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,192
Yeah.

80
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,101
Harsh.

81
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,653
What is that ?

82
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:37,863
Oh, that, it's a gang sign,
I've seen it around.

83
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:39,820
He wasn't in a gang.

84
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:43,121
Yeah? When was the
last time you saw him?

85
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,410
Two years ago.

86
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:48,410
A lot can change in two years.

87
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,870
Zack wasn't in a gang !

88
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:54,293
We are doing everything we can
to find out who do this. Hey !

89
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:12,312
So, well, uh, I'll uh,
I'll be in touch.

90
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:19,820
Bryan Boone.
Call me, I mean if you need any help.

91
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:46,723
3 men may be tied to the east side
but an identified man fired an
assault riffle.

92
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:50,820
This  continues away the violence that
hits the city over the last two months.

93
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:54,193
The mayor called it a priority
of the city earlier this morning

94
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:59,572
after the body of Zack Starr, an
alleged gang member, was discovered
by the Detroit river.

95
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:03,032
This is the tenth gang-related
death in the last three weeks.

96
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:06,540
Authorities are asking anyone for
information to please come forward.

97
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,120
Back to you Bill.

98
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,293
Have you finished ?

99
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,673
Yeah, I'm finished.

100
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:19,253
Security, media feeds
and infrared are on.

101
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:25,803
Sun's down.
Time to make some new friends.

102
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,910
Huh Blade.
Try to do this quietly.

103
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,080
Yeah, that's my M.O..

104
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,031
How does it feel ?

105
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,072
Hum, that hurts.

106
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,953
Good tattoo always does.

107
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:15,542
It's not a buttlerfly or a key
or some 5-minute shit like that.

108
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:21,220
Doesn't count if you don't need
the needle for at least an hour.

109
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:23,923
How long have you been
working for Van Sciver ?

110
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,463
Tell me!
Tell me what I want to know !

111
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,853
Get him off !

112
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,852
What  do you wanna know?
Tell me, I'll tell you.

113
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,761
What the hell ?
I told you I'd talk.

114
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:12,131
Sorry, I didn't hear.

115
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:32,920
You've reached Detective Bryan Booin
robbery and homicide, I'm not avalaible
right now,

116
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:38,080
but if it's an emergency hang up, then
dial 911. Otherwise leave a message
after the tone.

117
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,472
Zack...

118
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:15,511
Hey  !

119
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,323
Come on in.

120
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:16,993
Oh god !

121
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,030
No, no, no, no, I gotta go.

122
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,123
I'm sorry about that, hello.

123
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:25,912
I left some messages.

124
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,451
And you are uh ?

125
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,913
Krista Starr.

126
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:31,003
Krista St...

127
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,830
Oh right, the dealer's sister.

128
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:36,801
My brother wasn't a drug
dealer or a gang member.

129
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:42,392
Ok, that took place...
Here we go. The, the docks right ?

130
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,072
I was just to his appartment and there
was this man there going through
his stuff.

131
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,683
What did he looked like ?

132
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:49,813
Black, dressed in black.

133
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,773
Oh black, that narrows it down.

134
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,571
But he could be a suspect
or he can know something.

135
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:56,822
- Can I see my brother's file ?
- No.

136
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,741
Maybe I could help,
I was a sergent in the Army.

137
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:02,411
Yeah, this ain't the army.
Listen, sweetheart.

138
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:05,463
At the end of the day, your brother got
caught up and somebody shot him, okay ?

139
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,421
Got in over his head, he pissed off the
wrong people just like every single one
of these guys.

140
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,581
My brother isn't like every
single one of these guys.

141
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:17,020
Look, people like this, all they end up
doing is taking up file space, you
understand ?

142
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:20,173
Yeah, I understand.

143
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,343
Have a nice day.

144
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,148
Boone. Ah, yeah !

145
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,118
- Take it easy, pal!
- Hey pancho! Shut that guy up!

146
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,879
Son of a bitch.

147
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:44,381
What ? I got hungry too.

148
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,811
I need those inhalers.

149
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:52,061
I'm working on it.

150
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,142
Work... faster.

151
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,401
Dude, most of ??? is destroyed.

152
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,453
The serum that keeps the thirst is
easy to replicate but inhalers work on a
completely different system.

153
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,791
You see,
they allow you to generate hemoglobine.

154
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:09,132
Humains have genes that develop
proteins, but vampires have disabled
links between them.

155
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:11,540
These inhalers help diffuse...

156
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,750
Figure it out !

157
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,722
You're supposed to
be the smart one.

158
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:18,083
Yeah, I'm the
good-looking one too.

159
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,982
Got any leads on what
Marcus is up to ?

160
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,992
I cracked open a dozen
families last night.

161
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:51,073
If they knew what he was realy
doing in Detroit. So would I.

162
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:53,910
Well, can't hide forever.

163
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:57,371
He is Detroit's
great white hope.

164
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,641
The guy started some kind of
Renaissance movement two years ago.

165
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:03,380
Restored a dozen
buildings from late 1800s,

166
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,432
preached about the
historical value of the city

167
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,722
??? his way to in the future,
blah blah blah.

168
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:11,600
It's only a matter of time before
he shows his smug little face.

169
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,722
And when he does,
he'll be surrounded by the press.

170
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,401
He'll be hard to get close to.

171
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:24,532
And you don't exactly blend in.

172
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:39,461
Damn.

173
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,170
- Danny Milano ?
- Yeah.

174
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:44,211
Do I know you ?

175
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,171
I'm Zack's sister.

176
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:47,921
Don't know him.

177
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:54,393
He's the guy you got
arrested with last week.

178
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,851
I don't know who you think I am.
I'm not. I'm not.

179
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:04,362
Did you kill my brother ?

180
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:07,310
No, no, no freaking way.
Why would I wanna kill Zack ?

181
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:08,571
Memory coming back ?

182
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:11,082
All right, yeah. He lived a
street from me. We hung around.

183
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,660
Who wanted him dead ?

184
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:16,032
I don't know. People disappear
around here all the time.

185
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:17,701
What is that ?

186
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,083
Gang sign ?

187
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:20,831
It's just a tatoo.

188
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,630
Of what ?

189
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:33,760
Psycho bitch!

190
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,663
Yeah, hey.

191
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:06,710
Zack's sister showed up.
I think we got a problem.

192
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:09,823
Yes ?

193
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:12,072
Professor Melvin Caylo ?

194
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,782
Who are you ?

195
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,700
What is this ?

196
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,122
Let me see.

197
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:28,962
Hello ?

198
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,472
Let me see your wrist.

199
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:38,051
- What ?
- Let me see them !

200
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,012
And the neck. The neck !

201
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,250
You didn't use it, did you ?

202
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:08,620
Use it ?

203
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,922
The hash. It's found its
way under the streets now.

204
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,010
With the rest of the drugs.

205
00:27:15,346 --> 00:27:19,682
Inhale enough of it, it will give you
the abilities of the omines nocturni.

206
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,012
It is for an hour or two.

207
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:24,353
Though the sad effects. The...

208
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:28,060
The thirst that comes with it.

209
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:32,113
Most end up chewing
their own fingers off.

210
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:35,613
The omines nocturni?

211
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:38,862
Vampires.  This is vampire hash.

212
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,110
It's quite expensive too.

213
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:46,043
This vial is at least
a thousand dollars.

214
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,333
Ten if it comes
from a pure blood.

215
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:54,712
And I supposed next you're gonna
to tell me that werewolves exist.

216
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,421
My colleague Mock's
area of expertise.

217
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,181
Really ?

218
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:09,390
What do you think this means ?

219
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:14,063
This brand's familiar,
it's dedicated to the House of Chthon.

220
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:17,030
Humans who ???
their lives or their culture.

221
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,153
Hoping to be changed some day.

222
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:25,412
They're everywhere you see, the police,
the governement, everywhere.

223
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,993
Here.

224
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:31,211
Take this and flush
it down the toilet.

225
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,833
But I read you were
searching for proof.

226
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,630
I have plenty of that.

227
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,801
Proof.

228
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,770
Hum, thank you for your time.

229
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:54,812
Wait ! Come back !

230
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:19,173
God. What a hell of a day!

231
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:34,691
You okay ?

232
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:40,940
Hello ?

233
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,780
Hello ?

234
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:49,120
Hey !

235
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,293
Jesus !

236
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:03,631
Krista.

237
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,273
Krista.

238
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:21,733
Krista.

239
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:30,081
I know who killed your brother.

240
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:32,413
Here. Hurry !

241
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:13,332
Hello ?

242
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:57,411
You wanna know what happen to
your brother ? The wannabe.

243
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,831
He is now meat...

244
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:06,963
just like you.

245
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:21,002
Holly shit !

246
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:28,052
- Those... are...
- Were.

247
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,713
... vampires !

248
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,132
And what does that make you ?

249
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,803
Something else.

250
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,722
What does that mean ?

251
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:44,231
- Oh, god! What is that smell ?
- Garlic.

252
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,691
They don't like it either.

253
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,693
This is impossible.

254
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:54,111
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.

255
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,163
Why is it everybody
know my name ?

256
00:33:57,417 --> 00:34:00,491
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city !

257
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:03,542
Forget everything
you saw here tonight.

258
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,711
Yeah, right ! I can't just forget
about this. I mean, I just...

259
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,712
Hey !

260
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,761
Vampires exist, young lady.

261
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,972
But most people don't
see the dangers.

262
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,310
So, who the hell is Blade ?

263
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:06,313
My favorite fascination.

264
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:14,361
His parents were Robert
and Vanessa Brooks.

265
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:16,362
They lived in Detroit.

266
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:22,413
Vanessa was nine months pregnant the
night she was attacked, bitten, left
for dead.

267
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:29,460
Robert found her, struggling to survive
for the sake of her unborn child outside
of their apartment.

268
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:34,132
He rushed her into the hospital where
their son was delivered by C-section.

269
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:38,722
Robert named him Eric.

270
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:46,311
The boy aged
relatively normally.

271
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:48,560
But he wasn't normal.

272
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,520
Yeah, kind of figured it that.

273
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,443
Eric went through
genetic changes at birth.

274
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:58,820
He was born a different
kind of vampire. ???

275
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:02,452
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

276
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,293
Ah... except of the thirst.

277
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:10,670
The thirst is what controls
all omines nocturni.

278
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:14,091
And no one can fight it.

279
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,632
Except for Blade.

280
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:21,182
His father...
kept Blade secret.

281
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:26,970
He provided fresh blood for him for the
ten first years of his life. Don't ask
me how.

282
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,941
Until he couldn't
handle it anymore.

283
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:33,652
And Blade was loose
out on the streets.

284
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:38,863
Until a friend of mine, Abraham
Whistler found him and took him in.

285
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,952
So we saved Blade from
drinking the blood of animals,

286
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:46,951
others... clone suppliers
like the House of Lychan.

287
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:49,202
But I know the truth,

288
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:53,922
he  lives off a synthetic serum.

289
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,092
Where can I find him ?

290
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:01,721
Well, I will tell you,

291
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,682
he hasn't stayed in
one place very long.

292
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:13,152
Here uh,
the only address he ever had.

293
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:25,362
How can you see
with those things ?

294
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:27,152
What are you doing here ?

295
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:29,320
You were following me.

296
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,531
You should have left !

297
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,580
You've seen them in the flesh.

298
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:36,083
You've been seen all ???
after you.

299
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:38,553
You know who killed my brother.
He was one of them.

300
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,211
Let it go !

301
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,501
Help me take out
these bastards !

302
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,422
Help you?

303
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:52,803
I'm going after them,
with or without you.

304
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,771
Silver bullet.

305
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:57,313
Mmh. Doesn't work on me.

306
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:00,152
But I bet it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

307
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:01,563
Blade ?

308
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,152
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead ?

309
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,112
I'm not talking to you.

310
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:07,280
What ?

311
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,382
News... Van Sciver finished
restoring some art gallery last week.

312
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:14,870
Tonight there's a big party and
our boy's making an appearence.

313
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,160
Good.

314
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:17,123
Good ?

315
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,962
Who are you talking to, man?

316
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:21,383
Where are you ?

317
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:26,513
No, no. Dude, that is Zack's sister.
Do not get her involved.

318
00:40:27,055 --> 00:40:29,930
I'll hold this,
you have a job to do.

319
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:33,600
- You're listening to me ?
- No, no, Blade. Damn !

320
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:39,813
Test subject, G1139,

321
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,191
baseline trial on batch 97G.

322
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:50,743
Beginning vaccine
injection, now.

323
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:53,873
Stand by for Stage
1 confirmation.

324
00:40:57,587 --> 00:41:02,422
Introduction of Stage
1 garlic extract now.

325
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:15,932
Stage 1 failure.

326
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:19,272
Moving on to batch 98G.

327
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:33,322
New UV blade is not working.

328
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,281
My stuff always works.

329
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,041
Isn't all of this a
little elaborate ?

330
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,171
He likes the pretty lights.

331
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:53,263
What is this ?

332
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:54,722
The fat lady.

333
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,513
Oh, the fat lady.

334
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,812
Ultrasonic brain scrambler.

335
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,982
Finally, something I recognize.

336
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,523
Kind of.

337
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:11,321
Customized PDW.

338
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,450
We call it a shotgun.

339
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:18,491
One taste of liquid garlic chamber from
that monster sends any vampire in
anaphylactic shock.

340
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,083
Their skin ruptures,
their blood evaporates.

341
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:22,792
I know.

342
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:25,170
I saw in action already.

343
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:30,462
So, what about crosses
and holy water ?

344
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:32,052
They don't do anything.

345
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:33,973
You don't need this.

346
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,631
Why not ?

347
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,010
Here, this is a transponder.

348
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:40,311
To track it anywhere
in the city.

349
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,811
I see, you want me to carry it.

350
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,521
We want someone else too.

351
00:42:45,736 --> 00:42:48,382
Marcus Van Sciver is a player
in the House of Chthon.

352
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,642
The largest vampire
colony in North America.

353
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,192
And tonight you'll be parading
around the Van Sciver house gallery.

354
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,952
So take him out.

355
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,703
I ash Van Sciver.

356
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:05,013
There is a dozen other vampires
to step up and take his place.

357
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,422
So take them out too.

358
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:14,883
If we can track him,
he can lead us to the House of Chthon.

359
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:18,140
If we play this cool,
if we have a little patience,

360
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:22,101
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.

361
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,390
You take this seriously.

362
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,312
There's no other
way to take it.

363
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:39,200
A big party.

364
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,712
Excuse me.

365
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:59,263
This gallery hasn't opened
its doors since 1978.

366
00:43:59,478 --> 00:44:03,520
How does it feel to be a part of another
revitalized institution, Mr Van
Sciver ?

367
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:08,271
I'm just doing my best to keep
this city alive. Thank you.

368
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:12,063
There's our girl.

369
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:25,991
Of course, Chief Edwards.
We always look after our friends.

370
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,883
Dr Dideo.

371
00:44:36,347 --> 00:44:38,263
Fire chief, councilman.

372
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:43,010
That's the man right there.

373
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:46,100
It's like stepping
back in time.

374
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,680
Exactly.

375
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,190
She's gonna do it !

376
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:51,520
This building,

377
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:57,120
none would have been possible if it
wasn't for the efforts of ten coming up
pioneers in the automotive industry.

378
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:58,281
Come on.

379
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:07,163
I am simply...
following the legacy they left.

380
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:11,670
Oh, don't be so modest.

381
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,341
They say you're the man
who's gonna save Detroit.

382
00:45:17,308 --> 00:45:18,841
Some do.

383
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,593
Gentlemen excuse me. Fritz.

384
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:23,263
Gentlemen.

385
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:27,010
I believe we are all to quick to
forget our past. Did you know ?

386
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:31,731
The average age of building in United
States is less than 30 years old.

387
00:45:31,948 --> 00:45:33,270
Didn't know that.

388
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:37,401
Take this city, it's been around
since the 18th century and yet,

389
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:40,621
if  you ask somebody to point out
a prominent historical landmark,

390
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,110
they probably aim for
the Joe Louis Arena.

391
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:48,331
You see the past has been torn down and
replaced by something that in a short
matter of time

392
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:51,461
will also be torn
down and replaced.

393
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,832
It's a wasteful cycle.

394
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:58,053
There's only one thing this country
values when it comes to old age.

395
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:03,592
So, try to recapture the past ?

396
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,971
Just try not to forget it.

397
00:46:07,107 --> 00:46:08,930
Me either.

398
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,982
So tell me about you.

399
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,862
So much to tell.

400
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,320
Well, you could just
start with a name.

401
00:46:22,998 --> 00:46:24,490
Katherine.

402
00:46:25,746 --> 00:46:27,280
Katherine ?

403
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:36,212
Now you seem to me to be more like a...
Krista !

404
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,132
Man, I told you !

405
00:46:39,595 --> 00:46:41,343
You look familiar.

406
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,513
Like someone I once knew.

407
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:47,471
There was this young man,

408
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:51,521
his name was... Zack Starr.

409
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:56,480
And he wasn't particularly
bright or assertive.

410
00:46:56,738 --> 00:46:59,772
But he was desperate.

411
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,242
Desperate for some sort
of control of his life.

412
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:04,323
Let go.

413
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:07,991
People like him are always
taking never giving,

414
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:10,282
draining on the
people around him.

415
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:13,541
Sucking a life from them.

416
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:16,373
Honestly,

417
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,291
he's better off.

418
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:21,211
Or at least the world is.

419
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,991
Screw this.

420
00:47:45,288 --> 00:47:46,530
Where is she going ?

421
00:47:54,295 --> 00:47:56,292
What the hell is she doing ?

422
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:03,673
I'm gonna kill her !

423
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:12,180
Excuse me, Mr Van Sciver.

424
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,351
It's okay.

425
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:16,773
She wanted me to give you this.

426
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:18,140
Who ?

427
00:48:18,488 --> 00:48:20,402
The woman you were talking to.

428
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,822
Hello, Krista.

429
00:48:34,086 --> 00:48:35,743
I know what you are.

430
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:40,792
You're watching me,
aren't you ?

431
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:48,053
Through a ten power scope attached to
the top of a matched grade sniper rifle.

432
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,640
Wow, it sounds impressive.

433
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:58,143
You're allergic to garlic so,

434
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:01,062
let's stay away
from the gaspacho.

435
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:04,270
I did, thank you.

436
00:49:07,538 --> 00:49:09,243
There you are.

437
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:12,241
Tell me more.

438
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:16,373
Sunlight can burn your skin.

439
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,411
It will turn you into ash.

440
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:24,543
and I've got a silver bullet ready to
blow that stupid smile right of
your face.

441
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:32,680
You killed my brother.

442
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:37,643
Yes, yes I did.

443
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:42,693
If you knew who I was,
why mess with me like that ?

444
00:49:42,907 --> 00:49:44,812
Because it's my nature.

445
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:49,320
You're everything your brother wasn't,
aren't you ?

446
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:52,031
A success where
he was a failure.

447
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:55,322
Bright... where he was dimmed.

448
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:56,912
Shut up !

449
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:06,290
Oh come on, Krista,
take the shot !

450
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:14,340
I don't care how
fast vampires are.

451
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:18,762
You can't dodge with a bullet moving
2000 meters per second and trust me,

452
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:24,102
I'm a hell of a good shot.

453
00:50:54,937 --> 00:50:55,881
What happened ?

454
00:50:56,935 --> 00:50:58,970
She screwed up.

455
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:41,601
I'm impressed, Krista.

456
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:46,600
I hope you still are when I'm
shoving a stake up your ass !

457
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:51,611
I killed a lot of people.

458
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:56,321
But your brother,
that wasn't out of pleasure.

459
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,530
I really did like him.

460
00:51:58,998 --> 00:52:01,892
But he was looking around of
things he wasn't supposed to.

461
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,251
Being too curious.

462
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:09,753
You on the other hand,
might just work.

463
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:13,050
What you're gonna do ?
Bite me ?

464
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:15,213
Bite you...

465
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,183
That's for savages.

466
00:52:18,476 --> 00:52:21,851
In truth, it's not the most
reliable form of transmission.

467
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:26,601
No. Here is the
House of Chthon.

468
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,491
We're people civilized.

469
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,133
You need permission Marcus.

470
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,403
Not this time, no.

471
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,262
Just let me kill
her and end it.

472
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,743
Hush, Chase.

473
00:52:56,516 --> 00:52:58,673
Stay the hell away from me !

474
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:01,553
Oh I know, you're scared.

475
00:53:01,688 --> 00:53:05,260
You think of us as sociopaths that
just walked out of a nightmare.

476
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:10,191
But this is an honor, Krista.
Trust me.

477
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:14,691
There are severe restrictions based on
the number of humans we're allowed
to turn.

478
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:19,071
We don't wanna attract unwanted
attention or put a strain on our
food soures.

479
00:53:19,955 --> 00:53:23,030
We survive by living
in the shadows.

480
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:24,871
???

481
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:47,431
It's okay to fight.
It's only natural.

482
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:53,691
But you will think so much better,
so much clearer

483
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:55,983
once you've been
through the change.

484
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:37,860
Now Krista,
all you have to do is die.

485
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,373
Wake up !

486
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:56,882
Zack ?

487
00:54:58,216 --> 00:55:00,550
He can't catch me, catch me...

488
00:55:04,515 --> 00:55:06,342
Ah ah ah !

489
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:15,273
Over there,
I want to tell you something.

490
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:18,403
Zack.

491
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,480
Krista, all you
have to do is die.

492
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:27,911
You understand ?

493
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:05,611
Please, kill me. Kill me!

494
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,663
Hello, Krista.

495
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:17,490
Welcome to the family.

496
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:22,962
You can't stop looking.

497
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,001
Body was delivered at the city morgue
last night at 2 a.m. Vanished about 3.

498
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:29,463
Has she been turned?

499
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,012
Blade, we can't cure her.

500
00:58:32,226 --> 00:58:35,823
And the thirst is going to take over
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.

501
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:39,522
You find her, you got to stake her.
Just like always.

502
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:40,680
The serum ?

503
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:42,240
You mean the chance
of that working ?

504
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:43,143
Are what ?

505
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:44,442
Slim, man !

506
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,663
You pump her full of it before sunrise,
she might get a clear head for a
few hours.

507
00:58:47,697 --> 00:58:50,453
But if she feeds off a fresh kill
before, then who the hell knows !

508
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,230
And finding her is
still a problem.

509
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,370
Krista left a loose end out there.
I'm gonna tie it up.

510
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:34,492
I would have warned you.

511
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:38,823
But there is something to be said
for learning from experience.

512
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:44,330
You've been asleep all day.

513
00:59:46,468 --> 00:59:50,171
- I feel...
- Alive ?

514
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:52,173
Yeah.

515
00:59:54,846 --> 01:00:00,100
Those shoes, put them on.

516
01:00:10,528 --> 01:00:15,032
You see Krista,
the so-called living.

517
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:17,911
The ones growing
obese and passive.

518
01:00:18,205 --> 01:00:21,123
Oblivious to the
true layers of life.

519
01:00:21,457 --> 01:00:24,332
They are the ones you are dead.

520
01:00:24,498 --> 01:00:28,542
The dull senses have no abilities to
unlock the real beauty of this world.

521
01:00:30,428 --> 01:00:32,040
Unlike us.

522
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,921
You will learn, soon enough,

523
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:40,183
everything has so many
more facets of pleasure.

524
01:00:40,728 --> 01:00:45,223
Music, food, sex.

525
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:48,812
Your rebirth is here.

526
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,942
Your grihalt.

527
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:55,191
Grihalt?

528
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:59,202
In our language, it means someone
who has achieved true life.

529
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:03,030
And as your sponsor,
it's my privilege to teach it to you.

530
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:05,332
And to introduce
you to our culture.

531
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:13,712
I saw you.
And I saw my brother.

532
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:16,673
The images you witnessed
are part of your ADE.

533
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:21,022
And after that experience triggered by
the genetic memories of your sponsor.

534
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:24,722
And your own synapses,
they rebuilt your cognitive functions.

535
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:30,060
The visions you witnessed
are sacred, Krista.

536
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:33,562
And must only be shared with
someone you really trust.

537
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:38,070
Don't touch me.

538
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,412
What did you do to me ?

539
01:01:47,088 --> 01:01:49,000
What did you do ?

540
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:53,293
I saved you.

541
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,921
Take her with you.

542
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:02,933
This is a mistake.

543
01:02:03,146 --> 01:02:05,143
What is ? Her ?

544
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:06,973
Yes, Marcus.

545
01:02:08,026 --> 01:02:10,182
And when you were
turned, Chase?

546
01:02:11,568 --> 01:02:14,401
Everyone starts somewhere.

547
01:02:14,695 --> 01:02:15,690
And some...

548
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:18,782
start a lot lower in
life than Krista Starr.

549
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:23,782
You will take her on a ride along.
And you will teach her.

550
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,822
And you will dress her.

551
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,680
When the board finds out
what you've been doing.

552
01:02:30,627 --> 01:02:35,673
Don't question me, Chase!
Ever !

553
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:48,680
I told the sister
everything I know.

554
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:54,441
You can't do that !
You can't do that... I'm protected.

555
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,101
Not from me.

556
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:59,213
If someone disappears down here,
who knows where they go ?

557
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:00,151
I don't know.

558
01:03:01,697 --> 01:03:03,240
Give me a name, Danny.

559
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:09,580
He's a cop, Boone. He got the
charges on Zack and I dropped.

560
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:11,793
You gotta understand
why we do this man.

561
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:13,871
We wanna be like you.

562
01:03:14,215 --> 01:03:19,963
Strong, fast. And immortality, man.
I'm gonna live for freaking ever.

563
01:03:20,177 --> 01:03:21,513
No, you won't.

564
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:41,403
Can you see it ?

565
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:44,863
Krista ?

566
01:03:45,787 --> 01:03:46,950
See what ?

567
01:03:47,495 --> 01:03:49,162
Relax your eyes.

568
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:50,950
Pull your focus back.

569
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:53,542
Look !

570
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:00,040
I see something.

571
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:03,591
They can only be read in
the ultraviolet spectrum.

572
01:04:04,597 --> 01:04:06,631
The House of Chthon's glyph.

573
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:08,430
It means it's ours.

574
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:11,222
Ours ?

575
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:13,520
One of the places we recruit.

576
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:17,850
We also have save houses throughout the
city where fresh blood is delivered.

577
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,650
If you're out and dawn approaches,
you go.

578
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:27,320
But if you see the House of
Lychan glyph, stay away.

579
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:32,200
The thirst, it hurts.

580
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:33,872
Yes.

581
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:38,922
You'll drink.

582
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:44,253
Soon enough.

583
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:53,310
Fritz, go.

584
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:13,662
Blade, the
transponder's online.

585
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,050
I smell it.

586
01:05:33,518 --> 01:05:35,263
Me too.

587
01:05:41,946 --> 01:05:43,271
Drink.

588
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:51,363
Slowly, take it all in slowly.

589
01:05:57,837 --> 01:05:59,413
When did that happen to you ?

590
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,962
When did you become grihalt?

591
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:06,462
Marcus told you that,
didn't he ?

592
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:08,261
It's his favorite word.

593
01:06:08,676 --> 01:06:11,181
He says the same
speech to all of them.

594
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:12,970
All of who ?

595
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:19,143
The new born. But with the strict
rules we live by, the enemies outside,

596
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:22,142
most of them don't last a year.

597
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:25,691
Did Marcus change you ?

598
01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:33,453
No. My husband did.
And lived to regret it.

599
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,743
He still does.

600
01:06:50,557 --> 01:06:51,511
Hey !

601
01:06:56,265 --> 01:07:00,060
You should be careful out there, honey.
These streets are dangerous.

602
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:33,382
There a bed inside ?

603
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:37,340
You wouldn't believe what's inside.
You are just a little snack thing, huh?

604
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:38,552
Jesus.

605
01:07:39,395 --> 01:07:42,061
I thought I told you my pets
are on the strict diet.

606
01:07:43,437 --> 01:07:45,353
- Hello.
- Hi.

607
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:55,493
Don't pull that Dracula shit, sneaking
up on people, I almost crap myself.

608
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:57,533
You've been
overfeeding them again.

609
01:07:57,826 --> 01:07:59,073
And for what ?

610
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:01,161
A few dirty twenties ?

611
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:05,582
I've got something for you.

612
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,620
Shit !

613
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:39,620
Blade.

614
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:42,412
Fat lady's early.

615
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,203
Burn her.

616
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,661
I told you too many times.

617
01:08:47,966 --> 01:08:49,972
All right, all right,
I'll stay away ok ?

618
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:51,463
You got to help me now.

619
01:08:51,758 --> 01:08:54,853
If I was like you, I mean I could
do some much more. Come on !

620
01:08:54,888 --> 01:08:56,010
Make me Marcus.

621
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:01,603
Make you?

622
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:28,751
I've put up with your desobedience
and carelessness long enough.

623
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:31,253
Come on man ! I...

624
01:09:32,928 --> 01:09:35,843
Wait a minute, you turned her ?

625
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,053
That slacker sister !

626
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:40,260
It's my turn, my...

627
01:09:42,855 --> 01:09:46,431
There is no room for someone
like you in my inner circle.

628
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:48,353
It's time to cut bait.

629
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:50,193
And unfortunately for you,

630
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:53,023
you're the only person
I know she hates.

631
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:57,782
You'll make it easy for her.

632
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:11,081
Now Krista,
it's time for your fist kill.

633
01:10:19,388 --> 01:10:20,593
That's enough!

634
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:22,682
Live him be.

635
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:26,510
This is something she
must do on her own.

636
01:10:34,737 --> 01:10:35,942
No...

637
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:39,690
Come along,
the new vaccine is ready.

638
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,350
Blade's here.

639
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:56,600
Deal with it.

640
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:02,901
Marcus, give me
the new vaccine.

641
01:12:03,788 --> 01:12:04,572
No.

642
01:12:05,657 --> 01:12:07,162
He is here.

643
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:10,830
Let me serve you.

644
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:25,920
Krista !

645
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:29,761
You can still fight it.

646
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:58,490
It's been fun.

647
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,132
His shit always works my ass !

648
01:15:17,557 --> 01:15:19,180
Shen?

649
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:25,351
- Shen ? Shen ?
- I'm here, I'm here !

650
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,612
Shen, something's wrong.

651
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:48,502
Shen, make the fat
lady sing now !

652
01:16:00,816 --> 01:16:04,391
I hope your earplugs are in,
buddy, here we go !

653
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:27,210
Fritz ? That's enough.

654
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,463
You're my new favorite.

655
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:32,343
You've proven our success.

656
01:16:39,098 --> 01:16:40,510
Shit !

657
01:16:44,776 --> 01:16:47,030
Fat lady is recharging.
She's got one more hit in her.

658
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:49,903
Give me one sec to get
her to do it again.

659
01:17:36,035 --> 01:17:38,113
She is singing again !

660
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:47,751
Blade, gotta juice. Coming in.

661
01:17:48,717 --> 01:17:49,751
Shen, don't !

662
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:51,042
Sorry brother.

663
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:52,922
Go, goddamn it !

664
01:18:13,067 --> 01:18:15,322
What did you do ?

665
01:19:32,816 --> 01:19:35,900
This stuff doesn't work,
but I found you, didn't I ?

666
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,360
Up. There you go, big guy.

667
01:19:44,995 --> 01:19:48,781
Next time I offer
backup you take it.

668
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,210
Good day, Fritz.

669
01:19:55,926 --> 01:19:57,333
You did well, Krista.

670
01:19:57,796 --> 01:19:59,131
How's Chase ?

671
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:00,752
She'll be fine.

672
01:20:01,098 --> 01:20:05,011
Marcus, the ??? would like a
few words with you, privately.

673
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,303
Of course.

674
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:08,141
Excuse me.

675
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:11,182
Marcus ?

676
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:20,730
Yes.

677
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:24,651
The visions I saw
when I was changed.

678
01:20:24,906 --> 01:20:26,410
The ones with my brother,

679
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,412
what did they mean ?

680
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,082
What did you see ?

681
01:20:34,045 --> 01:20:35,661
Him and I,

682
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:41,041
a long time ago as kids in this
story book village we used to go to.

683
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:44,881
Zach wanted me to chase him.

684
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:48,720
He was trying to
show you something.

685
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,050
What should I do ?

686
01:20:51,516 --> 01:20:54,560
What you have been, follow him.

687
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:38,190
My stuff always works.

688
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:39,563
Not this time !

689
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:40,940
Where did you hit him ?

690
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:44,402
Then it's something else.

691
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:36,031
So what the hell are
they doing here ?

692
01:24:33,076 --> 01:24:34,493
What did you do to me ?

693
01:24:34,748 --> 01:24:36,282
I injected you with a serum,

694
01:24:36,498 --> 01:24:38,243
to get you thinking straight.

695
01:24:38,455 --> 01:24:40,873
Krista, Krista !

696
01:24:44,255 --> 01:24:45,793
That cop,

697
01:24:48,675 --> 01:24:51,211
I ripped his throat out.

698
01:24:52,848 --> 01:24:54,302
I killed him.

699
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:55,672
Listen,

700
01:24:57,636 --> 01:24:59,852
if you take this
serum twice a day,

701
01:25:00,437 --> 01:25:02,892
it might keep the
thirst under control.

702
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:07,641
Look, you wanted in,
and you're in.

703
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:10,310
In as far as you can go.

704
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:12,572
You're one of them.

705
01:25:13,486 --> 01:25:15,193
So are you.

706
01:25:15,865 --> 01:25:17,653
You can learn so much.

707
01:25:18,537 --> 01:25:20,621
I can work with you.

708
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:23,702
Just like I worked
with your brother.

709
01:25:28,676 --> 01:25:30,331
My brother ?

01:25:34,556 --> 01:25:36,671
Zack worked for you ?

711
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:40,432
Yes. He was my contact here.

712
01:25:42,227 --> 01:25:47,313
- Oh my god, you got him killed.
- No, Marcus did.

713
01:25:47,608 --> 01:25:49,852
But Marcus was wrong about him.

714
01:25:50,657 --> 01:25:52,862
He was a good man.

715
01:26:03,285 --> 01:26:04,952
Give me the serum.

716
01:26:08,838 --> 01:26:10,793
I got to get back.

717
01:26:21,097 --> 01:26:22,721
What do you think ?

718
01:26:26,568 --> 01:26:28,352
Could go either away.

719
01:26:54,635 --> 01:26:56,801
No !!!

720
01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:02,682
Next time on Blade.

721
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:04,291
I need information on Fritz.

722
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:05,352
Like what ?

723
01:27:05,645 --> 01:27:07,041
He's not your every vampire.

724
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:08,991
I'm beginning to
think you like this.

725
01:27:09,185 --> 01:27:10,743
You're sure the
vaccine is stable ?

726
01:27:10,778 --> 01:27:12,063
Yes, it's stable.

727
01:27:12,278 --> 01:27:14,270
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.

728
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:22,910
No !!!

729
01:27:29,337 --> 01:27:31,410
Let's finish this.
