1
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,915
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,790
If they figured out how to neutralize
garlic and silver, we are up shit's creek.

3
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,360
- You're sure the vaccine is stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

4
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:19,511
Trace those. Tell me who bought that.

5
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,922
Doctor Vonner...
No!!!

6
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:29,939
What do you know about
the House of Lychan?

7
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:33,161
You can't go Krista.
They have this ritual.

8
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:36,602
You've ever heard of a sweat lodge,
the native American thing where
you see visions?

9
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:38,409
What, they want me to see Boone?

10
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,560
That's the idea,
except there's no sweat.

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,058
Just lots of blood.

12
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,764
If it will stop Boone...
I'm doing it.

13
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,188
Hey sis'!

14
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:45,731
Zach?

15
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,240
How you doin'?

16
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:50,542
I missed you so much!

17
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,471
Mmh, I missed you too!

18
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,613
How is Mom?

19
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,131
She's ok.

20
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,673
Too bad she doesn't know
you're a vampire.

21
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,480
She's not gonna know.

22
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,480
What are you doing out here?

23
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:05,650
What do you mean?

24
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,380
I mean, right place,

25
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,060
wrong time.

26
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,161
I need to feel the sun.

27
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,471
You need to finish
what you started.

28
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,203
Zach, I want to be done.

29
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,983
Oh sweetie, it's just beginning.

30
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,781
Boone's in there.

31
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:19,383
The eyes of Texas are upon you,
all the live-long day

32
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,351
The eyes of Texas are...

33
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,870
Badada..

34
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,250
Come on honey,

35
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:34,973
we got miles to go
before you'll sleep.

36
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:38,461
Next stop, Silvan Louisiana,

37
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,840
you're gonna meet my new
best friend.

38
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:48,700
Hell, put the hammer down, might
even make it there by midnight.

39
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,303
What do you think?

40
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,072
I think so too.

41
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:14,903
Help her!

42
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:21,843
Did you see Boone?

43
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,051
Where is he?

44
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,161
She needs a moment Chase.

45
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,661
What did you see?

46
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,050
I know, I know!

47
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,242
What?

48
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:32,701
I know where he's going.

49
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:35,303
I know where he's going.

50
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,973
You didn't really think Marcus was
going to pay his last respects, did you?

51
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:59,523
Not in the middle
of the day. No.

52
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,922
There is that.

53
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:04,703
- Anything else of interest?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,550
People loved this guy.

55
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:13,671
After him we knew.

56
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,082
I bet some of them did.

57
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,480
Well, she's cute.

58
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,650
She's pregnant.

59
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,070
Figures.

60
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,900
The question is...

61
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,232
with what?

62
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,033
Blade - 105 - The Evil Within

63
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,032
Krista connected.

64
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:08,032
Boone's next stop is a
small town in Louisiana.

65
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,673
Some place called Silvan.

66
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,080
Silvan?

67
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,562
Does that mean something?

68
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,341
There's a splinter faction there.

69
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:15,810
Of what House?

70
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,310
The House of Armaya.

71
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,091
Domic's faction.

72
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:23,893
You don't think Boone can really
get an audience with a Pure Blood, do you?

73
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,381
I'm not willing to risk it.

74
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:28,581
I want you in Silvan.
I'll send a team to meet you there.

75
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:29,941
I'm sending Krista back.

76
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,182
No! Use every asset.

77
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,040
If he gets to Domic and he discovers 
what we've been doing here.

78
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,160
He won't.

79
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,971
Just kill him and come home.

80
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,801
I'm tying up some of Dr. Vonner's
loose ends and I'll need you 
to secure them.

81
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,023
Krista.

82
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:12,893
How are you feeling?

83
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:14,810
Thirsty.

84
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,751
What?

85
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:21,430
Five hours.

86
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:25,733
You were under for 5 hours
and 9 minutes to be precise.

87
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,651
Until now the longest time
for a lychan blood ritual
was 27 minutes.

88
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:33,612
So after doing a little research
in the archives,

89
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,323
I've come to the conclusion
that there are 2

90
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,362
possible explanations for this.

91
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,780
One, you don't want
this vampire Boone found,

92
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,580
for either conscious
or subconscious reasons.

93
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,173
So you rejected the connection
for as long as possible.

94
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,931
Of course I want him found,
Marcus wants him get...

95
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,993
Or two,

96
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,931
you're rejecting the world of death
that Marcus and Chase have led you to.

97
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,441
Which would make things
very complicated.

98
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:05,221
Now, is there anything
you'd like to say?

99
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:11,970
Boone and I, we had a...

100
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,992
relationship.

101
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,700
And all that went flash.

102
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,201
Yes.

103
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:23,860
And that's why you've fought
the connection, because
you don't want him killed.

104
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:24,731
Yes.

105
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:28,292
Yes!

106
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,132
Alright then.

107
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:34,830
Get dressed. We're leaving.

108
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,302
She needs to rest.

109
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,400
She needs to go and so do I.

110
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:42,610
One more minute of listening to you
yap on about solace and serenity and
I'll ash myself.

111
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:43,821
Please.

112
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:44,961
You know...

113
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:47,510
You once were such a vampire.

114
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,903
I still am.

115
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,041
Sweetheart,

116
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,850
you're not even close.

117
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,521
Her name is Vanessa Sims.

118
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:33,760
She's 26, grew up in Cincinatti,
moved to Detroit in 98.

119
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:36,903
She does temp work, mostly
secretarial, waitressing,

120
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,923
all minimum wage stuff.

121
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:39,762
Married?

122
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,622
No, and no boyfriend
that I can see.

123
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:44,552
How do you know that?

124
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,630
Her movie rentals are 
all chickflicks.

125
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:48,751
Hundreds of them.

126
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:53,213
That she watches on her
brand new HD plasma TV costing

127
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,093
over 9000 dollars,
thank you very much.

128
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,101
Fat pockets.

129
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,280
A whole lot fatter than 
a few weeks ago.

130
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,302
You think they're paying her
to carry a vampire baby?

131
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,742
She's carrying something.

132
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,123
Yo yo, what's up, what you need,
brother, what you need?

133
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,602
Smoke, coke, ups, downs,
point where you want to go baby,
I'll get you there.

134
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,321
You know what I'm saying?

135
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:22,213
Oh, oh, my man looking to get sideways.

136
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,243
Ok, baby, I can get that to you,
you know what I'm saying...

137
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:27,363
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
what??? What???

138
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,871
What, you're selling here 
without my say-so?

139
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,901
N-no, baby, don't work that way.
You know what I'm saying?

140
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:36,842
Move!

141
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:40,020
So what? You want it, uh?
Come on!

142
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:43,431
What you got brother? Bring it.
Come on!

143
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,412
Come on!

144
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,298
Come on! Come on!

145
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,094
Now! Tonight!

146
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,198
Let's go! 
The girl is alive in there.

147
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,222
It's about freaking time.

148
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:33,842
You Armayans got some shit to learn about
how to treat your guest department.

149
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,791
I had a grandmother 
that looked like you.

150
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:41,193
Had less teeth,
but still much prettier.

151
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,713
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

152
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:48,093
Last night she looked even better
with my dick in her rear.

153
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,912
And which one of you
beauty is Domic?

154
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,790
Mr Domic is not here.

155
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,922
What do you mean, he's not here?
Come on, what is this?

156
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,170
We will deliver the message.

157
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,940
So what is it?

158
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,153
No, no, I ain't come always to end up

159
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,271
with a bunch of
junior level students.

160
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,970
I speak to Domic and nobody else.

161
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,083
Aah, so now you think you're worthy
of an audience with a Pure Blood, uh?

162
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,030
Yeah, like that means anything.

163
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:16,102
You desorganized idiots haven't had
a seat at the table a long time, pal.

164
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:21,303
So shove your desillusions of grandeur
up your ass and go fetch Domic. Chop, chop!

165
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:25,790
Oh yeah, and tell your boss
I come bearing a nice goddamn gift.

166
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:30,990
** but her seal ain't been broken 
if you get my drift.

167
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:40,692
Very considerate of you but you
know Mr Domic will still want to know
what your message is about?

168
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:42,033
What's it about?

169
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:43,571
Revenge.

170
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:46,362
Oh yeah, I've done my homework
on you Armayans.

171
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,991
I know all about
you backward bastards.

172
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:50,830
Sucking high in tit.

173
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:54,831
And I know that same high ranking
son of a bitch that backstabbed me

174
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:58,150
has been disappearing you guys
for the last few years.

175
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,411
Oh yeah, I know about that.

176
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,173
I know who's doing it and why.

177
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:07,192
And Domic's gonna want 
to know it too.

178
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,692
It's time for a
little payback brother.

179
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,530
Let me make a call.

180
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,412
Get down!

181
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,112
Let's go!

182
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:26,592
Dust 'em all.

183
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,280
Boone!

184
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:36,343
Go! Go! Move!

185
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,033
***

186
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:04,700
Go! Move!

187
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,640
Go! Go!

188
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:08,992
Move, bitch!

189
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:11,951
Boone stop!

190
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,911
Wow, wow, wow, now look
you gotta understand.

191
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,471
Me and Marcus had an agreement,
but he doublecrossed me.

192
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:20,110
He threw me to the wolves, shit,
he threw me to you, you bitch!

193
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,233
Let her go.

194
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:22,571
Do what?

195
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:25,221
You're kidding? This meat
means something to you?

196
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:26,373
No more killing.

197
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:27,833
No more.

198
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:29,131
No more killing?

199
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,952
It's a tall order, sweetheart.

200
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,811
I'll tell you what, why don't you
suck on this instead?

201
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,541
No!!!

202
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,380
Where is Boone?

203
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,350
Go!

204
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,250
Go!

205
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,792
- Go!
- Shut up!

206
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,943
Predictable piece of shit!

207
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,831
Shut up! Shut up!

208
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,403
Come on, what do you see?

209
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,713
Courtesy flush.

210
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,162
- Boone's dead?
- Yes, no thanks to you.

211
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,811
Finish your little snack.

212
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:03,930
She's long gone.

213
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,012
Then so are we.

214
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,563
- Is he in?
- Yes, but, uh...

215
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:04,993
I ccompletely agree.

216
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,003
And if there's anything else
I can do to help,

217
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,263
please do not hesitate to contact.

218
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,730
How goes the day job?

219
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:15,700
They want another environmental impact
report on the Bristol Park project.

220
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,603
If you'd like I could
impact their environment.

221
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,660
Now you've done enough for one night.

222
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:22,941
But thank you for taking care
of our Boone problem.

223
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,161
Both of you.

224
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:25,891
Our little war hero 
didn't miss a beat.

225
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:30,471
Expect for getting the munchies
in the middle of the fire fight.

226
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,322
Momentary laps.

227
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:36,001
And how is your ex-husband?

228
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,632
I was thinking,
if I had a little time,

229
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,792
I go back and castrate him.

230
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,323
Well, there was somewhere else
I would rather you go.

231
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,450
Krista, will you excuse us?

232
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,723
Of course.

233
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:51,770
So, where am I going?

234
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,041
Berlin.

235
00:17:57,516 --> 00:18:00,041
I need you to safeguard
something for me.

236
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:01,800
Our future depends upon it.

237
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,151
Something to do with Aurora?

238
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,371
This goes beyond on Aurora.

239
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,593
What are you doing?

240
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,912
I'm asking you for help.

241
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:15,112
And this must remain a secret.

242
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,643
Or the Pure Bloods
will kill us all.

243
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,310
Why would they do that?

244
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,193
What are you planning?

245
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,393
I can't tell you yet.

246
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,463
Just know that
it is very important.

247
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:27,770
Alright.

248
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,480
Thank you.

249
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:34,822
Mr Van Sciver?
There's someone to see you.

250
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,401
No more visitors, Sabine.

251
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:38,430
Sir, it's a Pure Blood.

252
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,442
Chase.

253
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,912
Ah, this is a surprise.

254
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,600
Thank you, Thorne.

255
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,172
Charlotte, if you told me
you were coming...

256
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,982
You would have done everything
in your power

257
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:20,230
to make me believe I haven't
a care in the world.

258
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:21,620
Yes.

259
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:26,690
But that, as we both know,
would be just another of your 
many... lies.

260
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,890
Son of a bitch!

261
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,312
You're good.

262
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,112
No... no I need more.

263
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:47,642
I need more.

264
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,460
You've had enough.

265
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:55,230
Krista.

266
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:02,290
I saw his kills... Boone!

267
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,563
I know.

268
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:09,653
You know what I'm feeling?

269
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,631
Besides guilt?

270
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,231
That's just it 
I don't feel guilty.

271
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:23,551
What I... what I feel is...
is left out!

272
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,150
I'm jealous.

273
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:31,013
Cause of the way...
his freedom!

274
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:34,841
The way he can just...
he can just be and I can't.

275
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,592
What is happening to me?

276
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,161
You'll get through this.

277
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,522
Why, because you did?

278
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,860
You're half-human.

279
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:46,593
I've nothing human left.

280
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:56,542
Eyes up.

281
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,950
Oh, Jesus!

282
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,973
What can you tell me
about her?

283
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,832
What is it?

284
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,163
Her name's Vanessa.

285
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:15,891
Marcus had me deliver
something to her.

286
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,983
She wanted me to thank
her doctor.

287
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:21,083
Her doctor's dead.

288
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,403
Of course he is.

289
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,371
- I need to find her.
- Why?

290
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,991
She's pregnant.

291
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:33,410
What's that got to do
with Project Aurora?

292
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:47,002
Has Marcus ever mentioned
this place here? It's in Berlin.

293
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:50,563
Marcus just send
Chase to Berlin.

294
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:56,931
This vampire safe house must
be where she's headed.

295
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:58,661
I have people.

296
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,712
They tell me it's gotten busy.

297
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,871
Somebody just arrived that fits
Vanessa's description.

298
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:10,290
This isn't just us, is it?

299
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:13,122
What you got, some sort
of a underground network?

300
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:14,971
Do they know
I'm working for you?

301
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:18,590
Or is one of them gonna kill me one day, 
thinking they're doing you a favor.

302
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,530
You have to be careful.

303
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,900
What if I kill one
of your friends?

304
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,060
Cost of doing business.

305
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,473
How close are you to getting
your hands on the Aurora vaccine?

306
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,400
- Krista?
- I'll get it!

307
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,371
There's a med lab underground,
heavily protected.

308
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:39,321
Just gotta find a way in.

309
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,722
Get it before
I get back from Berlin.

310
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,333
Aurora could change
the entire game.

311
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,642
We can't let that happen.

312
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:56,363
I'm never gonna see
the sunlight again, am I?

313
00:22:56,855 --> 00:23:00,721
If you do, it'd the last
thing you ever see.

314
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:11,061
The wound on her neck, and where
tissue was lacerated

315
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:14,042
is consistant with an animal attack,
a wild dog maybe.

316
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:15,681
Where was she found?

317
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:20,962
Out by St. Langrish parish, 
about 5 miles west of here.

318
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:24,042
A trucker found her walking
alone on the side of the road.

319
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:25,831
What's out that way?

320
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:28,371
Mostly swamp.

321
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,522
Did she say anything to anybody?

322
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:36,761
When they wheeled into the E.R.
she was jibber jaberish on
something about a lady helping her.

323
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:37,902
A lady?

324
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:39,173
Yeah.

325
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,001
Or maybe a...

326
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:43,650
a soldier, somebody with a gun,

327
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,461
E.M.T.s couldn't make
much sense of it

328
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,041
and then she lost consciouness.

329
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,613
Tricia?

330
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:57,453
I want you to look
at something for me.

331
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,152
Oh, that's not a good idea.

332
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:04,792
Here.

333
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,620
Right here.

334
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:19,332
- Hold on, you're upsetting her.
- You can shut up or you can leave.

335
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,162
No, you don't understand.

336
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:23,103
Her larynx...

337
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,932
What? What? This?

338
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:27,692
This right here, what...
this is what he looked like?

339
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:53,140
There's still the question of
the vaccine's long term viability.

340
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:56,601
- And Doctor Vonner's death affected us how?
- Not at all.

341
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,552
I'm moving forward.

342
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:00,622
When will you reach it?

343
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,002
5 weeks.

344
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,223
We'll have to accelerate
final testing.

345
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,883
At no additonnal cost
to the board.

346
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:09,603
But at what cost to the stability
of the Twelve Houses.

347
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,883
I know about Boone.

348
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:13,971
You've got a little problem there,
don't you?

349
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,373
Not anymore.

350
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:16,942
Boone's dead.

351
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:19,782
We got to him before
there was any trouble.

352
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:23,701
What sort of trouble might
there have been, Marcus?

353
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,623
Domic.

354
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:30,840
Boone gets to Domic, tells him
we've been experimenting
on his people.

355
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:35,513
Just the sort of thing, the House
of Armaya might need to turn this
into full scale war.

356
00:25:35,716 --> 00:25:36,580
That didn't happen.

357
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,131
Not yet.

358
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:40,882
When Domic does find out what
we've been up to.

359
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,382
They're to fractured and desorganized
to cause any problems.

360
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:50,740
Domic didn't survive as Armaya's
last remaining Pure Blood by shutting
those beedy little eyes of his.

361
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:54,581
And it won't just be the House
of Armaya that comes after us.

362
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,480
At least 5 other Houses
will join them.

363
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,320
They don't even ever have
a seat at the council...

364
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:05,380
Armaya may be exiled but that doesn't
mean they don't have sympathisers.

365
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:07,602
And if there is a war,

366
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:09,621
we will loose,

367
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,052
unless Aurora works,

368
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,591
unless we can strike first,

369
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,900
in day light.

370
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,781
It will work.

371
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:21,621
It'd damn well better.

372
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,342
Well, I'm tired,

373
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:27,722
I've had a long day,
and I'd like to rest.

374
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,100
I thought you'd be
taking the plane back.

375
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:32,830
No Marcus, I will be
staying here tonight.

376
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,931
If you could have
my room prepared.

377
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,631
Of course.

378
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:40,672
And Marcus...

379
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,193
Yes.

380
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:44,012
Bring me something to eat.

381
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,761
Something young.

382
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:12,443
How close are you to get your
hands on the Aurora vaccine?

383
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,793
Just gotta find a way in.

384
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:46,363
Papers are proved and ready?

385
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:47,831
Just get 'em to Chase.

386
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:50,571
Tell her not to hurt anyone
but to make the implication clear.

387
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:52,022
Yes, Sir.

388
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,991
T unnels.

389
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:40,142
What is your business in Germany?

390
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:42,992
Pleasure.

391
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,593
You have a place in mind?

392
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:47,042
Waiting for confirmation
on the adminities.

393
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,631
According to my sources,

394
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,620
a positive Berlin institute has exactly

395
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,532
what you're looking for.

396
00:29:57,168 --> 00:30:01,710
And to aid you in your travels.

397
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:47,110
Hey.

398
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:52,050
Good morning,
have a nice coma.

399
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,410
There's something wrong
with my baby?

400
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,862
Everything's fine.

401
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,501
Where am I?

402
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,933
You're safe, just relax.

403
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:16,461
I have to get up.

404
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,702
Shh, you really must relax.

405
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,910
Give your body a chance
to incubate your pride and joy.

406
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:26,101
Sound like a good idea,

407
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:27,980
Who are you?

408
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:30,353
The big bad wolf.

409
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:36,101
Now go back to sleep before I huff
and puff and blow your head off.

410
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:48,531
Security check, talk to me.

411
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,223
That's all clear.

412
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:52,333
Second floor clear.

413
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:55,711
Walk everything down.
Double check it.

414
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,702
Perimeter?

415
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,452
Perimeter is good too.

416
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,863
Ja, it's secured, ja.

417
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,891
Chase, come in,
I'm on the first fl...

418
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,673
It is Chase, say again?

419
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,530
I'm on the first floor.

420
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,101
No one goes in or out but me.

421
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,171
Who are you?

422
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,211
You stay away from me!

423
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,473
You stay away from...

424
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,672
Are you the devil?

425
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,090
Whatever works.

426
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,072
Goddamn it!

427
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,670
She wanted to see me.

428
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,701
Is everything alright?

429
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:48,150
It's fine Gonesse, I was just
waiting for the sunrise.

430
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:57,170
So how long has it been Gonesse?

431
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,003
Since you were turned.

432
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,681
This May, it will be 52 years.

433
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:03,983
So you must still dream of it.

434
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,080
Dream of what?

435
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:07,570
The sun.

436
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,111
I do, sometimes.

437
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,433
Don't feel guilty.

438
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,293
It's only natural.

439
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,002
A part of who you used to be.

440
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:23,861
I've never felt it.

441
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,761
Pure Bloods, born as vampires.

442
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,741
- We've never known day light.
- You will.

443
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,790
When Mr Van Sciver
delivers Aurora.

444
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,371
If that's even his plan.

445
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,893
Madam.

446
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:39,373
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.

447
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,062
Tell me what to do.

448
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:45,250
I want an internal audit,
top to bottom.

449
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:50,232
Covered investigation into everything
the House of Chthon is involved with.

450
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:53,081
Everything on the books and off.

451
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:55,642
I want phones tapped, cars tailed

452
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:58,602
and I want you to focus
on Marcus Van Sciver.

453
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:04,430
I want whoever he's turned from
the moment he first tasted blood
until now investigated.

454
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:05,951
Yes, madam.

455
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:09,631
And Gonesse, do this quietly.

456
00:38:56,598 --> 00:38:58,511
Screw all of them.

457
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:14,620
Hold Krista.

458
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,423
You miss your world.

459
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,940
The one you left behind.

460
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:22,050
Yeah, and I want it back.

461
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:24,051
That's impossible.

462
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,621
Can come close... with this.

463
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:29,722
Doesn't work.

464
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,130
You're lying.

465
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:32,972
Not at the moment.

466
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:34,530
I saw Fritz.

467
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:38,713
Fritz was an unexpected and
quite frankly unwanted success.

468
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:41,611
In couple of days, he would
have started to decompose.

469
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,093
Is that what you want?

470
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:44,731
To die?

471
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:46,891
Don't touch me.

472
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,140
Aurora's effects are temporary.

473
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:58,803
It is simply a stepping stone.

474
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,013
To what?

475
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,762
A better world, for all of us.

476
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:06,043
- You mean for vampires.
- I mean for the House of Chthon.

477
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:10,442
From the dying ashes of one world,
we will emerge into better one.

478
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:12,961
You make it sound like apocalpyse.

479
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,972
Destruction is always required
before rebirth.

480
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:18,942
Now, you have 2 choices.

481
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:22,002
You can ever join me
in this new life.

482
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,661
Or you can die in your old one.

483
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,731
Trust me, Krista.

484
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:37,131
There is nothing left for you
but the life I can offer.

485
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:38,492
Stop fighting.

486
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,510
Stop wanting.

487
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:44,151
Let go and come with me.

488
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,401
Be with me.

489
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,312
Forever.

490
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,483
Next time on Blade...

491
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,502
Come on!

492
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:10,970
What did he do to you?

493
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,002
I'm not telling you
anything, you freak.

494
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:15,001
No! No!

495
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,923
Is something wrong with my baby?

496
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,392
Blade.

497
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,760
Boone is dead.

498
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:30,582
Domic learnt nothing from him.

499
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:31,622
He knows.

500
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:32,731
Charlotte!

501
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:33,963
Domic.

502
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,852
Armaya is back in the fold 
by Friday.

503
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,521
All Chthon will be destroyed.

504
