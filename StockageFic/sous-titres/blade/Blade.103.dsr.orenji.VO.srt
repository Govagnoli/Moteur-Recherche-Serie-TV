1
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:10,914
Previously on Blade.

2
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:13,506
You know an ash dealer named Kane?
Used to be a familiar.

3
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:14,666
Next stop?

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,065
Hell.

5
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,131
Dispatch, I need an ambulance ASAP.

6
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,289
It's a little late for that, sweetheart.

7
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:27,785
Kill everything. Burn it to the ground.

8
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:31,242
Krista!

9
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,545
Kill Fritz! Do it now!

10
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:06,391
Deep breath, sweety.
This might sting.

11
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,933
I think we woke the neighbors.

12
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,623
Screw them.

13
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,210
I've got a better idea.

14
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,050
What's the problem, asshole?

15
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,713
Ready to answer my question?

16
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,373
I didn't know you asked one.

17
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:55,812
If you weren't running,
you would have heard it.

18
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:01,152
Wow!

19
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:03,983
Okay! Okay!

20
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:07,621
Ask me the question.

21
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,152
Sands. A vampire.

22
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:11,622
You know him?

23
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:15,321
No. Yeah! Yeah, Sands.
I know him.

24
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,552
I was his personal familiar for a while.

25
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:21,072
Quick is the perk with shit.

26
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,533
How do I find him?

27
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,603
Man, how the hell would I know?

28
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,371
Shit!

29
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:28,861
Goddamn it!

30
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:30,930
The guy's got a habit.

31
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,260
Gambling.

32
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:34,630
- He hangs out in casinos?
- Huh-uh.

33
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,043
He got a favorite one?

34
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:37,903
I don't know, man, something shitty.

35
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,713
Something with bad lighting,
he doesn't like to be looked at.

36
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,681
He got pretty messed up a while back.

37
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:46,831
What? That's it?

38
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,070
Bonus question.

39
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:49,481
Great.

40
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,521
You pissed off the House of Chthon.

41
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,201
Do you know how?

42
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,673
Yeah, I ashed a heavy hitter.

43
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:58,780
Winston Haupt.

44
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:00,670
Haupt?

45
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,612
You're sure?

46
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:07,212
Two years ago, I watched him
serv up a cubscout at a party.

47
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,001
I'm sure.

48
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:15,551
Hey! Hey! Hey, do not
take my money!

49
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,020
That is some bullshit!

50
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:23,133
Hey!

51
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,593
About you ashing vampires...

52
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,821
Yeah?

53
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,610
Keep it up.

54
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:57,292
Blade The Series - 103 - Descent

55
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,290
That's tags?

56
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:35,021
Yeah, car belongs to one Patricia Barton.

57
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,282
Waitress, married, mother of 3.

58
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,482
Disappeared some place between
her last shift and her home in
Spearfith, South Dakota.

59
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,623
I went to her wedding.

60
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,382
They were about to adopt.

61
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,432
It's connected to that rest
stop thing at Sturges?

62
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:55,932
What thing?

63
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,493
Just came in. Trucker vanished
from the rest stop.

64
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,192
Lots of blood, no body.

65
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,791
Whoever it was torched the cargo.

66
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,303
Where's the truck?

67
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,793
- Have to ask Sturges.
- You ask 'em.

68
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,703
Please.

69
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,470
I'm told you're not
drinking enough.

70
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,461
The more hemoglobin your
body metabolizes,

71
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:51,822
the faster you regenerate
damaged tissue.

72
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,290
Allow me.

73
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,491
The curative properties should
be particularly potent...

74
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,533
I just fed.

75
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,520
Sorry about Fritz.

76
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:19,203
His demise was an
unfortunate necessity.

77
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:22,492
One you recognized
and acted upon.

78
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,681
Otherwise Blade would
have taken him.

79
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,331
For preventing that,

80
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,572
you have my most
sincere appreciation.

81
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:37,771
Only few have faced
Blade and survived.

82
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,193
I guess I got lucky.

83
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:45,443
No, you had an angel
on your shoulder.

84
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,190
How are you feeling?

85
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,122
Thankful.

86
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:12,590
It's amazing... sometimes...

87
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:19,592
how things work out.

88
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,570
Krista needs her rest.

89
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,343
I think we can leave
this door unlocked now.

90
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:30,320
And Krista...

91
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,333
don't forget to drink.

92
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,473
Oh, thank you.

93
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,572
What's this?

94
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,623
For services rendered.

95
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,621
You found Kane.

96
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,970
Is he dead?

97
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,783
Man's doing a public service.

98
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:12,593
Keeping people hooked
on dead vampire ash?

99
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,111
Sometimes you have to take
the good with the bad.

100
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,270
From my side, it's all bad.

101
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,900
Well, if you can't use it.

102
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,953
Wait, wait, no, I can use it.

103
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,232
I can use it.

104
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:23,823
It's just...

105
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:25,922
I'm out here treating the symptom

106
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:29,031
and you're going after the disease,
no doubt about it.

107
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:30,563
What's you point?

108
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,230
There might be another approach.

109
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:35,870
Not for me.

110
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,523
Good luck.

111
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,333
You know it's all getting bad,
don't you?

112
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:43,423
It always does.

113
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:40,143
Krista! Thank God!

114
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,061
Are you all right?

115
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:49,542
Where did I get this?
Can't remember.

116
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,813
I gave it to you.
Your 6th birthday.

117
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,141
Honey, where have you been?

118
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,422
We haven't heard
from you in days.

119
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,420
I've been busy.

120
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,222
Well, where are you staying?

121
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,372
Uncle Pat's been looking everywhere.

122
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,952
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,163
Honey, are you in trouble?

124
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,672
Just trying to make things right.

125
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,470
For us.

126
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,091
For Zach.

127
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,823
For Zach?

128
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:32,032
Oh Krista!
What are you doing?

129
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:35,502
I'm just...

130
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:38,222
I'm just letting you know

131
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,763
I won't be around for a while.

132
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,971
Mom! Mom!

133
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,721
- Here. Here. Go over here.
- No, I'm ok.

134
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:51,363
I'm good. I'm good.

135
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,800
- What's the matter?
- I'm fine.

136
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,573
I just don't wanna lose you.

137
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:01,571
Krista, if anything bad happened,

138
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:03,613
Zach's gone.

139
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,681
You're all I have left.

140
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,293
I know we've had our troubles...

141
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:08,421
Mom.

142
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:10,691
I just want time.

143
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,420
I want to get to know
my daughter again.

144
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,423
I want it like it was.

145
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,013
There'll be time for that.

146
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,660
But I need to do this first.

147
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:28,271
And I need you to trust me.

148
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,661
Please.

149
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,751
You're so cold.

150
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,153
If I can track you,
so can Chthon.

151
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,043
I had to see my mother.

152
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,223
Get in.

153
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,502
If Marcus even suspects

154
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,080
you still have links to your past...

155
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,623
Marcus spends his time
renovating old buildings,

156
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:21,780
- I don't think having a link to my past...
- That's his cover.

157
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:24,601
Yours doesn't include
dropping in on mom's.

158
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,923
If you're pissed about Fritz...

159
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:28,392
No.

160
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,371
You played it right.

161
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,323
How's that healing?

162
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:40,351
- Slowly.
- Good.

163
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,760
What did they give to Fritz
to make him immune?

164
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,001
- It's called Aurora.
- What is?

165
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,843
Some kind of vaccine.
Marcus made it.

166
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,020
No.

167
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,592
Someone made it for him.

168
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,521
- Any ideas about that?
- No.

169
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,480
- Are they all on it?
- I don't know.

170
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,781
Get me a sample.

171
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,590
Sure I'll get right on that.

172
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:07,071
And while I'm doing that,
what are you gonna be doing?

173
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:08,670
Looking for a vampire named Sands.

174
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,420
Why?

175
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:14,110
He may be one of Marcus'
failed experiments.

176
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,982
See if he can lead me to
the doctor in charge.

177
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,081
I didn't sign up for this.

178
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,322
Yes, you did.

179
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,751
You wanted to know what Marcus
is up to, I told you.

180
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,931
If I get you this vaccine,
this Aurora thing,

181
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,421
that's your proof.

182
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:30,562
After that,

183
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:32,190
I'm done.

184
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:05,530
Come on!

185
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:10,780
Son of a bitch!

186
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,302
Used to be a halfly
respectable joint.

187
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,491
Now they let in
everybody in here.

188
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:18,783
Let's go.

189
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,671
Or what?

190
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,671
You're gonna stake me right here?

191
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,942
Take a hike, daywalker.

192
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,090
Eye in the sky is watching you.

193
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,230
Okay, go ahead.

194
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,163
Kill me, see if I care.

195
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:07,390
'Cause living for everything
ain't nothing but one long bust.

196
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,671
What? You're gonna sunglass
me to death?

197
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,421
Wondering about the scars.

198
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,063
Go to hell.

199
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:17,801
What do you want?

200
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,410
I wanna know who did that.

201
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,212
Okay.

202
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,103
You want information I wanna
keep breathing so...

203
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,373
here are my terms.

204
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,313
Here are the terms.

205
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,331
You talk and you get to
keep your rotten dick.

206
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,161
Ah ah! Junk grows back!

207
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,830
Then I'll be busy.

208
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,180
Time to run!

209
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,322
That's off limits.

210
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,202
Oh, it is?

211
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,322
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
This place is like a maze.

212
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,122
Where's the kitchen?

213
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,113
Marcus wants you.

214
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:28,892
Now.

215
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,493
You don't trust her, do you?

216
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:35,911
I trust your judgement.

217
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,081
That wasn't the question.

218
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,963
Yes, it was.

219
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,590
How are you this evening?

220
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,201
Bored?

221
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:48,960
You can say it.

222
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:52,801
No, just wondering what
I'm gonna be doing

223
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,091
for the next few hundred years.

224
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,391
Some decades I wondered the same.

225
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:59,340
We're shorthanded at the moment.

226
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,662
We need you to make a delivery.

227
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,923
140 Park Place. Give that to Vanessa.
Carver and Schultz.

228
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:06,581
- Is that a law firm?
- No.

229
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:10,270
Well, do I need to know
what's in the bag?

230
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:12,783
Do you?

231
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:19,163
The clock is ticking.

232
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,033
Evening, boys.

233
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,341
This is a private game.

234
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:43,261
I've got my invitation right here.

235
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,093
Hey, hot stuff. Johnny Black
on the rocks.

236
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,642
Hold the rocks, make it a double.

237
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,791
You were cheating vampires?

238
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,140
Yeah, mostly scum from
the House of Armaya.

239
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,293
You fleest Armayans.

240
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,892
And I thought you
lived dangerously.

241
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:09,600
2,000.

242
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:15,683
Raise. 5,000.

243
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:27,030
Oh yeah? Gotta be in it
to win it, huh?

244
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,331
Call.

245
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,162
Cheater!

246
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:51,073
Hey, today must be my lucky day.
You know?

247
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:56,070
Think again, hot stuff.

248
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:18,152
I walked right into an ambush.

249
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,093
They dragged us out and they locked
us up in cages right there.

250
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,340
The whole operation was right there.

251
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,392
The lab, scientists types

252
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,353
and lots of knives.

253
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,251
How did you get out?

254
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,910
A few weeks later, I found a
loose brick in the wall.

255
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,841
that lead to a crack in the
foundations so I crawled through,

256
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:36,305
dug my way out.

257
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,421
Some of the others were behind
me when it all hit the fan.

258
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,143
They didn't make it.

259
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,512
Pal, I've been reading
faces a long time.

260
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,310
Yours is telling me you know
exactly what's going on.

261
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,263
Who carved me up?

262
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,412
The hired help.

263
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,183
Research scientists who work
for one of the Houses.

264
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,152
Researching what?

265
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,242
Tell me. What was I there for?

266
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,990
What was I there for?

267
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,060
What I need from you is a name.

268
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:08,913
The doctor in charge.

269
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,641
I don't have one.

270
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,902
Okay? Nobody used names.
No nametags.

271
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,221
Okay, let's go.

272
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:18,700
Go where?

273
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,301
Go there? No!

274
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:23,980
No way. i'm not going.
You're kidding me?

275
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,103
Just in case.

276
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,233
Carver and Schultz?

277
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,270
I think you missed all the fun.

278
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,560
Yeah.

279
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,192
Congratulations.

280
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:18,083
I'm just glad the damn
thing is finally over.

281
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:21,173
Vanessa's been expecting you.

282
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,940
Vanessa?

283
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,203
Only as fast as I can.

284
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,213
Sorry, I thought you were my boss.

285
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:45,673
No problem, just making a delivery.

286
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:08,563
Is everything okay?

287
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:10,973
Tell the doctor I said thanks.

288
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,400
Sure.

289
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:17,390
Which doctor should I thank?
I work for a few.

290
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:36,233
Okay, seen enough can we go now?

291
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,272
You get the point, right?
There's not much to see here so...

292
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:42,783
Keep it up, he's gonna
nail your jaw shut.

293
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:02,693
Ah! Looks like a dead-end to me.

294
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,770
Now can you just take me back
or kill me, please?

295
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:15,833
Or you could smash my
head through a wall.

296
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,261
You want the 6 or the 9?

297
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,892
The 9 should do.

298
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,273
Watch our backs.

299
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,992
Hey, how about I get one
of he big weapons?

300
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:00,030
Shut up.

301
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,960
No, really, my timing's off.
I've got this thing with my eye...

302
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:04,961
Seriously, shut up!

303
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,022
They kept 10 of us in here.

304
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:23,872
All from the House of Armaya.

305
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,633
Except me.

306
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:29,170
First 2 weeks, they didn't feed us.
No blood, no nothing.

307
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,171
Then when we were
too weak to stand,

308
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,700
took us out one by one.

309
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,520
And did what?

310
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:38,660
We're not talking about that.

311
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,790
Lab was down here.

312
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,660
Let's get this over with.

313
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,262
Stop!

314
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:56,320
Four aces, my ass!

315
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,580
I ain't good.

316
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:04,570
I'm hungry.

317
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:26,112
Buffet is closed, Pal.

318
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:09,942
Time to follow. We gotta go.

319
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,952
I've got one last
thing I gotta kill.

320
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,582
Get out of here. You're done.

321
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:42,853
What?

322
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:44,691
Don't make him say it twice.

323
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,472
I think we may have the doctor's home.

324
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:56,923
How?

325
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,922
Trace those.
Tell me who bought that.

326
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,323
Might just be another
Van Sciver front.

327
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:06,832
Might not be.

328
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:24,263
Hope you don't mind.

329
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:30,842
Pretty. Where did you get it?

330
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,603
Found it. What are you doing?

331
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,570
Seeing what you have to wear.

332
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,750
These aren't my clothes.

333
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,502
I don't know where
they came from.

334
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,840
We pick a few things up here
and there, along the way.

335
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,262
Did you make the delivery?

336
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:45,470
Yeah.

337
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,471
Did you peek?

338
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:50,753
I bet you peeked, didn't you?

339
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:52,380
No.

340
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,740
We're going out.

341
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:06,062
Just you and me.

342
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,240
Still haven't found the truck driver.

343
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:29,780
But if the prints are in the system,
we should get a hit by tomorrow.

344
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:32,723
You said they were pallets.

345
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,222
Right over here.

346
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:36,292
Who's he cargo?

347
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,593
Based on the remains,
we think it was people.

348
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:39,671
Alive?

349
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,781
Dead folk don't need oxygen.

350
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,132
What is this?

351
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:47,832
Sex trafficking,
illegal body parts,

352
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:50,302
I've never seen this before.

353
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,381
For the record, the truck has
Michigan's plates

354
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:56,183
but there's no record of any
company based out of Michigan

355
00:30:56,495 --> 00:31:00,412
or anywhere in the country
for that matter by the name
of American Butcher.

356
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,302
It's hot fire.

357
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:05,712
To get this kind of ash,
you need 1500 degrees.

358
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,323
And the truck, it's barely burned.

359
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,501
Not likely when the fire
lasts 2 seconds.

360
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,373
So how does that happen?

361
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,113
You caught me.

362
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:16,760
This is interesting.

363
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,001
This pallet is pretty
much untouched.

364
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:21,230
There is no ignition source.

365
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:22,943
Either there was nothing on it

366
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,900
or maybe somebody came along
and took what was there

367
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:28,943
before doing the driver and
torching the cargo.

368
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:30,893
What's this gotta do
with your kidnapping?

369
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,631
Maybe nothing it
was just a busy night.

370
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:33,633
And weird.

371
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,510
Very weird.

372
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,700
I'll be over there if you have
any more questions.

373
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,430
Hi, my name is Sarah.

374
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,312
Hi, Sarah.

375
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,511
I had a rough week.

376
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,733
Not that anyone
cares all that much.

377
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,481
But I got through it.

378
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:20,672
One day at a time, right?

379
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:26,553
Look, I'm not gonna stand here
and play victim.

380
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,692
Sure it would be really easy,

381
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:33,300
I could tell you my ex husband
was a real sick bastard.

382
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:37,172
Tell you how he'd get wasted
and smack me around.

383
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:41,002
Bring his buddies home so they
could have their turn.

384
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:44,570
That's not who I am anymore.

385
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:49,422
That pathetic,
cowering little girl

386
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,233
is long dead and buried

387
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:56,441
along with all the nightmares
and all the suffering.

388
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,260
Nobody gets to hurt me anymore.

389
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:00,830
Nobody.

390
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:07,583
Just sitting the whole funny.

391
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:09,522
Trolling for the drags,

392
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:12,492
the ones no one will miss.

393
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:19,753
Well, all right Sarah.

394
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:22,643
Takes a mighty strong woman
to do what you did.

395
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:25,043
And I love strong women.

396
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:27,193
That'd be my addiction of choice.

397
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,543
If you had a choice.

398
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:34,282
- Name is Phil.
- Pleased to meet you.

399
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,570
Who's your friend?

400
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,221
Oh, that's Chuck.

401
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:42,260
Chuck!

402
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,851
Chuck, meet Carol.

403
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:48,250
Hey, Carol.

404
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:58,713
Yeah, so I've been rebuilding
the thing for about a year now.

405
00:33:58,728 --> 00:34:00,493
It was my dad's truck so...

406
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,421
sentimental reasons and all that.

407
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:03,411
Sure.

408
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:05,011
Hey, Carol.

409
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:08,791
Do you think you kids may wanna
run off and have a good time?

410
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:11,570
- Run off where?
- Well...

411
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,721
We're going in here.

412
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:18,460
If this alley's a-rocking.
Don't come a-knocking.

413
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,693
- Your friend's pretty funny.
- Yeah.

414
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:35,762
- So, how long have 
you been sober for?
- No!

415
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,710
What do you mean no?

416
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,432
Oh, you need a drink 
to loosen up.

417
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:45,351
Stupid bitch!

418
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:49,702
Phil?

419
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,341
You gotta get out of here!

420
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:58,231
Hey, you're all right man?

421
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,513
Phil?

422
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,843
Jesus Christ!

423
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,201
What are you doing?

424
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,661
- I...
- You're gonna eat that?

425
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:18,873
Don't sweat it.

426
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:21,513
A puppet killed takes a little
getting used to.

427
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,753
We should go.

428
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:25,722
Just a second.

429
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:33,952
After you.

430
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,650
Everybody okay?

431
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:42,480
We're fine. My boyfriend
just passed out!

432
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:19,270
Okay, according to customs,

433
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,343
the entire production
batch was shipped

434
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,581
from a manufacturer in Pennsylvania

435
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:26,013
to a clearing house in the Ukraine.

436
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,612
Set for 9 months before being
shipped back to the US

437
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:32,031
and sold to one Ravenson
Wholesale Medical.

438
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,810
Right here in Detroit.

439
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:38,092
Ravenson medical database for
Detroit number is 2700.

440
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:41,162
- 2700 customers?
- Give or take.

441
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:44,403
- Get me one.
- I'm grounding through that now.

442
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,303
How you doing? Keeping your
blood pressure down?

443
00:38:46,595 --> 00:38:48,530
Dropping in unannouced?

444
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,150
Not a good idea.

445
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,012
Yeah, well, I saw 2 men
murdered last night.

446
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,082
- Did you feed?
- Screw you!

447
00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:57,501
- Did you?
- No.

448
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,230
You need more serum.

449
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,881
I'm fine. Considering...

450
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,910
You just came by
to cry on my shoulder?

451
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,253
What about Aurora?

452
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,943
I know where they're keeping
it but security's tight.

453
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,910
Get around it.

454
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:17,970
How about I just
tell you where it is

455
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,640
and then you can go
in and get it yourself?

456
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,053
Too noisy.

457
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:24,013
Since when that's ever been
a problem for you?

458
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:26,283
I've been doing this a long time.

459
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:28,760
I make a move, they counter it.

460
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:31,282
They make a move, I react.

461
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,430
It's time to change the game.

462
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,251
If I'm gonna keep them from
winning this fight,

463
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:39,271
I have to trust another human being.

464
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:42,043
Just so happens she's a vampire.

465
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:53,062
And how hard is that?

466
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:55,312
Almost impossible.

467
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:05,190
Take care of yourself.

468
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,493
I'll get you what you want.

469
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,691
Thank you.

470
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,440
In case you're interested,

471
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:25,191
I found the doctor.

472
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:36,061
You a cop?

473
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,683
Took the eggs overeasy.

474
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:41,283
Sure.

475
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:44,241
I bet your family doesn't
appreciate you bringing your
work home with you.

476
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,820
It doesn't bother them anymore.

477
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,483
And a bacon too.

478
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,360
Sure.

479
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,373
Good luck with that.

480
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,350
Collins.

481
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,853
Hey, I've got these print
results back from the truck.

482
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:06,430
Okay, hold on.

483
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,641
Okay, go ahead.

484
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:10,830
The print belongs to
a fellow out of Detroit.

485
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:12,481
- Name?
- Brian Boone.

486
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:14,760
510. 190 pounds.

487
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:17,582
Oh, and he just happens to be
one of Detroit's finest.

488
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:19,093
He's a cop?

489
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,123
A homicide detective to be precise.

490
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:23,303
One who's been recently
listed as missing.

491
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,731
- Is this your guy?
- I'll let you know.

492
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,842
Can I help you?

493
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,540
Next time on Blade.

494
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:55,812
Blade!

495
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:03,893
Welcome home, old man.

496
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:07,281
I can deliver you Blade,
wrapped up and ready to die.

497
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,503
- What's in Oregon?
- The House of Lychan.

498
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:11,022
They know where Boone is.

499
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,932
No, you do.

500
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:15,281
Lychan is just going to take it out.

501
