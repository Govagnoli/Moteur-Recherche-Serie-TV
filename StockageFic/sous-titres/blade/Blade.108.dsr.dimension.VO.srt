1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:02,211
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,749
What did you do to me ?

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,507
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.

4
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:11,235
Aurora's effects are temporary.

5
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:12,740
It is simply a stepping stone.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,986
To what?

7
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,588
A better world, for all of us.

8
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:18,714
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.

9
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,285
Tell me what to do.

10
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:21,921
I think I'm looking for a monster.

11
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:23,819
They're all monsters,
let someone else do it.

12
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:25,053
Is she dying?

13
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:27,543
With a bone marrow transplant
she's got a good chance.

14
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,143
I can't do it.

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,783
- What do you mean?
- I mean I can't!

16
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,051
It's medecine.

17
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:33,862
But I can't give it to you yet.

18
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:35,991
We have to do something first.

19
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,842
Then we can be together forever.

20
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,153
No! No!

21
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:44,593
Mr. Van Sciver will be interested
to know that you have somehow
required a large stash of...

22
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,083
What is this exactly?

23
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:47,652
FBI, hold it!

24
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:49,770
Oh shit!

25
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,281
You got the serum from
the Daywalker, didn't you?

26
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,010
You work for him?

27
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,610
How unlucky for you!

28
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:29,352
Take your last breath,
you traitorous bitch!

29
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:40,511
Silver, mirrors are backed with it,
didn't you know that?

30
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,970
Good bye.

31
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,473
What the hell is...?

32
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:53,053
Hold it!

33
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,263
You need to get out of my way.

34
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,161
What are you?

35
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,812
Krista?

36
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,013
Blade The Series - 108 - Turn of the Screw

37
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,431
We should do something
about that.

38
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,230
Blade?

39
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:06,813
It'll heal.

40
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:09,243
It always does.

41
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,031
You're going after him?

42
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:14,711
Who?

43
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,103
Your father.

44
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:21,463
Man, I...

45
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,140
I'd do anything to get
my old man back.

46
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,410
Difference between
you and me.

47
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:30,103
- Look, I'm just saying...
- I need serum.

48
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,473
Shen.

49
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:07,810
What was she doing?

50
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:52,590
I was under the impression Van Sciver
was serious about this venture.

51
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,692
He wouldn't have sent me out here,
if he wasn't.

52
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,060
He's offering me 4 million dollars
less than he promised

53
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,453
don't come to my club
and give me blue balls.

54
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,831
He's giving you 2 million
over the market price.

55
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,251
Marcus considers this
a personal favor.

56
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:05,542
Really?

57
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,111
If he wants to play in Vegas,
he'll pony up.

58
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:10,532
He has 2 days before
I move on to another buyer.

59
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,861
- Mr. Taylor...
- And you tell Marcus

60
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:14,810
next time he wants to screw me,

61
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:17,141
he should do it face to face.

62
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,380
Shawn?

63
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,311
Do you know who that is?

64
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,423
She's from *** on business.

65
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,662
Tell me where she's staying.

66
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:04,622
- Someone got dusted.
- Krista?

67
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,170
I doubt it.

68
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,771
Cytoxin?

69
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,491
That's a chimio therapy drug.

70
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:23,792
Her mother has cancer?

71
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:25,700
Had.

72
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:27,782
So when did she die?

73
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,013
Probably after Krista
stole my serum.

74
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,361
She turned her mother.

75
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,531
That's what it looks like.

76
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,013
I can't find her.

77
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,650
Help me.

78
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:25,951
What's this?

79
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:28,283
Well, I saw you in that club,

80
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,441
and you looked uh, lonely.

81
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,403
And you want to what?

82
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,333
Keep me company?

83
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:39,203
Sure, why not?

84
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,503
You look good, Chase.

85
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,873
That's the best you could do,
after what, 60 years?

86
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,291
63,

87
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,821
but who's counting?

88
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,010
Apparently, you are.

89
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,561
I've waited for you, you know.
All night.

90
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:09,301
And then, every night after that,
for months.

91
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:13,280
Surrounded by your fair share of
champagne and starlets I'm sure.

92
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,740
And I'd given 'em all up,
if you had left Marcus.

93
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,712
Let's leave the past
where it belongs.

94
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,032
You're here now.

95
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:26,180
Yes, I am.

96
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,183
She was dying.

97
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,111
That's what humans do.

98
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:42,861
Who shot you?

99
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,961
I don't know.

100
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,210
I think he was a cop.

101
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:49,811
A cop?

102
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:52,193
I've never seen him before.

103
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,680
Who did you ash?

104
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:56,961
Some woman,

105
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,311
she came after me.

106
00:09:58,518 --> 00:09:59,473
From Chthon?

107
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,481
No, I don't know!

108
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:04,823
- But she saw you, with serum.
- I took care of it!

109
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:08,542
You know, my mother is out there
somewhere and we got to find her.

110
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,552
Did you inject her before
she went out the window?

111
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,820
Did you?

112
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:23,751
- We have to take care of this.
- What does that mean?

113
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,240
Blade.

114
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,553
The serum worked for her,

115
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,432
I mean it kept her
thinking straight.

116
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:34,603
Maybe it's not too late
for her mother.

117
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,061
Give her your jacket.

118
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:46,083
Where was she going?

119
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:47,741
I don't know.

120
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,513
Some place she thinks it's safe.

121
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,501
Where would that be?

122
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:53,862
Oh no!

123
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,620
Lisa?

124
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,481
Pat?

125
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:56,533
Before Vegas, it was in Hong Kong.
Before that, Rio.

126
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,573
Been traveling for a while,
trying to get some distance.

127
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,322
From what?

128
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,733
The House of Erebus is becoming
increasingly conservative.

129
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,122
Claiming in the old ways,
the old laws...

130
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,622
The other Pure Bloods,
they're afraid.

131
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:12,750
Of what?

132
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,530
Losing their grip.

133
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,492
And you're not?

134
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,710
Well, I've never had
a grip on anything.

135
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:21,543
I beg to differ.

136
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,280
Yes.

137
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,671
But you got away,
didn't you?

138
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:28,170
You're a Pure Blood.

139
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:32,092
You were born a vampire,
and I was turned.

140
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,523
I'm unworthy.

141
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:37,320
Come on, Chase,
that is so old world.

142
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,241
It's not me anymore.

143
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,542
You're still with Marcus?

144
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:47,809
Of course.

145
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,163
But is he with you?

146
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,933
Your master's voice.

147
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,110
Excuse me.

148
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,103
Hello, Marcus.

149
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,891
You didn't close the deal?

150
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,803
No, it didn't go well.

151
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,702
Nothing has since Berlin.

152
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,483
What's wrong with you, Chase?

153
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,280
You said you were ready
to come back to work.

154
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,922
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.

155
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,332
So what's the problem?

156
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,562
Taylor is playing hardball,
he won't budge on the price.

157
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,310
You assured me you could do this.

158
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,311
Do I need to send someone else
out there who can make this happen?

159
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,973
No, I'll get it done.

160
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:38,352
The clock is ticking.

161
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:52,301
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.

162
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,473
Let me guess...

163
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,121
Tall, brown hair.

164
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,462
How did you know?

165
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,491
When things get stressful, Marcus
reverts to his old bad habits.

166
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,052
What does that mean?

167
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:02,612
His wife.

168
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:04,262
Tall...

169
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,880
brown hair...

170
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,840
Really quite the beauty,

171
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:14,032
until she wasn't, but I guess
we all have our weaknesses, uh?

172
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:16,580
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.

173
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,240
A long time ago,
it didn't end well.

174
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,353
Then again,

175
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:25,361
what does?

176
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,570
I have missed you.

177
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,463
I haven't thought of you once.

178
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,133
Maybe it's time
for you to get out.

179
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,580
Maybe it's time
for you to shut up!

180
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,610
Close the deal and get out.

181
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,132
I will, I have to.

182
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,072
What are you up to, Chase?

183
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,281
I need change.

184
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,471
What do you mean?

185
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,370
Vegas. I could leave Detroit.

186
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:55,272
Run things from out here.

187
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,432
Put a little space between
Marcus and I.

188
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:01,630
What for?

189
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,032
Is he hurting you?

190
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,421
No.

191
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,353
Not yet.

192
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,161
It's complicated.

193
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,830
Alright.

194
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,380
Then what is Taylor asking for?

195
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,110
Four million.

196
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:29,272
It's a drop in the bucket for
a guy like Marcus.

197
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,912
I think he wants me to fail.

198
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,313
Why?

199
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,872
I almost died in Berlin.

200
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,291
Blade.

201
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,302
I got burned.

202
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,430
I think Marcus
lost faith in me.

203
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:49,083
All he needs is an excuse
to replace me.

204
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,540
Then he's a goddamn fool.

205
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,580
Lisa?

206
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:14,962
Lisa.

207
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,222
I called the house
but nobody's there.

208
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,290
Nobody's answering.

209
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,840
Is the nurse there?

210
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,442
Lisa?

211
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,482
You chill to the bone.

212
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,060
Do you wanna go
to the hospital?

213
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,373
Alright, alright...

214
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,852
Well, let me
take you home.

215
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,890
I don't want
to go back there.

216
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:45,170
I don't feel very well.

217
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,102
What the hell is that?

218
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:58,461
Ok, I'm gonna call 911.

219
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:12,931
Come on, pick up
that goddamn phone.

220
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:19,743
I think I need
something to eat.

221
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:40,053
Please hang up,
and try your call again.

222
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:43,952
Please hang up now,
this is a recording.

223
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,572
Please hang up, and tr...

224
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,682
Krista.

225
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,421
Oh no!

226
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:02,251
No!

227
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,241
Is he dead?

228
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:07,263
Yeah.

229
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,601
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.

230
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,363
Where will she go now?

231
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,312
I don't know.

232
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,930
- Think.
- I don't know!!!

233
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,833
They are all dead!
My entire family is...

234
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,003
dead.

235
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,070
Not yet.

236
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:39,282
But the sun is coming up soon.

237
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:46,621
Let's go.

238
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,802
She's hanging out with
a different crowd now.

239
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,690
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?

240
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:39,373
Van Sciver Incorporated,
how can I direct your call, hello?

241
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,952
Hello?

242
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:54,691
Krista.

243
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,573
All you have to do is die.

244
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,152
Welcome to the family.

245
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:15,270
Family?

246
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,243
Hey, is somebody down there?

247
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:23,783
I didn't see you sign in.

248
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:30,512
Hey?

249
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:32,712
Is this somebody in here?

250
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,193
You're beautiful.

251
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:17,573
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.

252
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:20,571
No, please continue.
It's a hell of a show.

253
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:21,893
Marcus?

254
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,693
Get dressed. We're leaving.

255
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,350
Wow, no!

256
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:31,930
Wait.

257
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:36,443
You don't wait,
you don't listen to him!

258
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:40,252
You get up and you get dressed now
or I will kill you
before you take another breath.

259
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,047
You were here to close a deal,

260
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:45,290
not to whore yourself out
to a degenerate Pure Blood.

261
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:08,592
Wouldn't you rather just,
cut the insults and rip my throat out.

262
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,312
Oh that's right you can't,

263
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,373
because I am a Pure Blood.

264
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,043
And what are you?

265
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,393
You're just...

266
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:19,002
infected. Which is all
you'll ever be.

267
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:22,590
Doing our biddings, serving our will.
Yeah.

268
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:24,533
Vampires like you it's...

269
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:28,563
nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.

270
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,100
Thank you of
reminding me of that.

271
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,590
Chase?

272
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:36,630
Chase?

273
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:05,081
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.

274
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,463
Where?

275
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:07,962
To the cemetary.

276
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:11,773
Your brother's grave.

277
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:14,132
My dead brother
is not the problem.

278
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,441
Your mother is.

279
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:19,153
She might be dropping by
just to say hello.

280
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:20,560
Mothers are like that.

281
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,822
So we're gonna go stake out
a cemetary?

282
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:26,083
Until you come over
with something better.

283
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:31,921
A.D.E.

284
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:33,440
What?

285
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,731
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.

286
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,923
My mom had one
when I turned her.

287
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:39,991
Which means she saw you
being turned.

288
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,003
By Marcus.

289
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,920
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.

290
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,063
Please, please help me!

291
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:18,771
I need to see my daughter. I...

292
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,730
Sorry, sir.
She came out of nowhere.

293
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,141
Not a problem. Happens
from time to time. Is she?

294
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:24,562
Infected...

295
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:26,230
Lane, this is Leon.

296
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,683
I've got a stray in the lobby
who needs an immediate
transportation to disposal.

297
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:30,812
Ma'am,

298
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,632
if you'd like to accompany
these gentlemen through that door,

299
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,811
I'll see to it that you receive
all the attention you deserve.

300
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:23,873
I want my daughter,
where is my daughter?

301
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:25,672
Ma'am, we're gonna
take care of you.

302
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,383
I want my daughter.

303
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:56,243
Agent Collins,

304
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:58,581
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.

305
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,301
Will you follow me?

306
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,151
Sure, thank you.

307
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:26,780
My mom is in that ambulance,
let's go!

308
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:35,161
What can I do for the FBI?

309
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,842
Well, I'm just following up on a case.

310
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,611
What do you know about
a young man named Zack Starr?

311
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,221
That name isn't familiar.

312
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,940
What about Krista Starr?

313
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,533
- His wife?
- Sister.

314
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:54,931
I'm sorry, what is this about?

315
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:59,232
Zack Starr was murdered
and the case was being handled
by a local detective,

316
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:01,190
a cop named Brian Boone.

317
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:03,771
Looks like Krista Starr was involved
in the investigation.

318
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:06,280
- Well, have you talked to her?
- No, she's missing.

319
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,127
You wouldn't know where I could
find her by any chance, would you?

320
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,533
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.

321
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:14,741
Is this the same detective
who is being accused of
this cross country killing spree?

322
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:15,862
Yeah.

323
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,250
And you're handling that case.

324
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:21,370
Well, it might be tied
to the Starr murder.

325
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:24,362
You think it might be 2 murders,
him and his sister?

326
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:25,041
No.

327
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:26,663
She isn't dead.

328
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:31,211
In fact,
her uncle saw her recently,

329
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,131
just doesn't know how
to get ahold of her.

330
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:35,641
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.

331
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:39,240
And he tells me that you and Krista
know each other pretty well.

332
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,972
Tell me...

333
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:53,762
- Do you understand british
divorce courts, Mr. Collins?
- Sorry.

334
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,181
UK law,
elementary requirements.

335
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,943
Not at all.

336
00:28:58,248 --> 00:29:00,192
My situation is such that

337
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:03,813
discretion in this case
with this single young woman

338
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,733
is both financially
and publically essential.

339
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,343
So you, you do know
about Zack Starr?

340
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm afraid so. Yes.

341
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:15,743
Only what Krista told me over
the pillow, so to speak.

342
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:17,173
How did you two meet?

343
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:19,082
Social function.

344
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:23,211
I was at a gallery opening,
she walked in, and, I noticed.

345
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,552
It happened like that.

346
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:25,983
Did it?

347
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:29,052
So can you tell me
where she is now?

348
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:30,813
No.

349
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:33,052
I haven't seen her
in a few days.

350
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,943
And to be quite honest,
she finds me,

351
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:37,852
I don't have a number
or an address,

352
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:41,682
- just a willingness
to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.

353
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,270
I tell you what.

354
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,882
If you meet me at

355
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:49,732
this park,

356
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,281
I've got a meeting downtown, I'll...

357
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,671
have some of my people
dig her up for you.

358
00:29:56,658 --> 00:30:00,371
I'm sorry, poor choice of words,
but I'm sure once I get them onto it.

359
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:02,692
I'll be able to tell you
exactly where she's been found.

360
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,862
Now if there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.

361
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,120
There is one more thing,
Mr. Van Sciver.

362
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,731
Do you know what
this symbol is?

363
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:13,360
Should I?

364
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:14,933
That wasn't my question.

365
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,250
No.

366
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,030
I don't know what it is.

367
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,292
Do you?

368
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,391
Not yet.

369
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,580
Now we are done here.

370
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:30,851
I apologize again.

371
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,011
For what?

372
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,530
Keeping me waiting or
lying to me?

373
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:37,002
Both.
Good evening.

374
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:39,240
Sabine will show you out.

375
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,123
Picked the wrong House
to crash, Ma'am.

376
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,523
Chthon is pretty picky.

377
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,011
I was looking for my daughter.

378
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:05,630
She was there.

379
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,710
A lot of people
pass through them, Ma'am.

380
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,103
What's that?

381
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:10,822
An extract of garlic.

382
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,500
I'd say this is gonna hurt
a little but I'd be lying.

383
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:15,363
I've always hated garlic.

384
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,990
This will be the last time
you'll be able to smell it.

385
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,670
I promise.

386
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,150
Oh my god, mom!

387
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:09,963
What are you doing?

388
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:11,281
Get out of the way.

389
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,710
You're gonna have to kill me first,
you son of a bitch.

390
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:20,872
Blade.

391
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:33,720
Krista?

392
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,540
Mum, we're gonna
get you out of here.

393
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,913
I'm a little busy, sweetheart.

394
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,503
Mom, look at me!

395
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,781
You've to come with me now!
Right now!

396
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:51,803
What, what have you done to me?

397
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:56,341
I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that.
Just...

398
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:57,861
give me your hand.

399
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:00,221
Come on.

400
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:02,501
Come on.

401
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:24,591
Alex.

402
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:25,971
What are you doing here?

403
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,983
Getting you out.

404
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:29,893
Please?

405
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:39,131
Here is a... cashier's check

406
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:40,911
for 4 million dollars.

407
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:44,480
It's what you need to get
that property from Taylor.

408
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:47,152
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.

409
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:50,071
I only want Chase.

410
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:54,221
Alex,

411
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:58,662
you do know that relationships
between Pure Bloods and non
Pure Bloods is frowned upon.

412
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:00,012
To speak nothing of a...

413
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,613
financial arrangement between
Erebus ans the House of Chthon...

414
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:03,702
Trust me.

415
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:07,820
No one knows I'm here, this is
strictly between you and me. So...

416
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,303
take the money,
buy whatever you want,

417
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:13,930
but let Chase go.

418
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:15,320
You're buying me.

419
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,341
I'm rescuing you.

420
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:18,712
There's a difference.

421
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:22,402
Yes, there is.

422
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,150
You're right.

423
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:34,121
Since Berlin,
I'm just not the same.

424
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:44,402
Fine, go.

425
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:48,190
Let me say goodbye properly.

426
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,473
Pour us a drink, Chase.

427
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,523
Let's toast to our new lifes.

428
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:25,833
To endings and beginnings.

429
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:45,242
Sorensen?

430
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,323
- You're a long way from home, Ray.
- Yes, so are you.

431
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:50,510
But I'm not the one
who's been ruffling feathers.

432
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:52,022
Where did you hear that?

433
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,903
I got a call from
Director Hendricks

434
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:55,542
who heard of a Michigan senator

435
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,371
who was responding to a call
from a local mover and shaker.

436
00:35:58,508 --> 00:35:59,652
Marcus Van Sciver.

437
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,590
Is that the guy you've been
accusing of killing people?

438
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:04,811
I didn't accuse him of anything.

439
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:07,212
But this has to do with that local cop
that you've been chasing.

440
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:09,610
Starts there, I don't know
where it's gonna end.

441
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,663
It's gonna end right here, Ray.

442
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:14,082
Right here.

443
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:18,783
It's time to fold up the tent,
people are tired of the sideshow, Ray.

444
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,062
You're asking for my gun?

445
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:22,952
Do I have to ask?

446
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:29,192
- Do you have a spare?
- No.

447
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,081
I'm gonna believe that.

448
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:37,391
Is there something else?

449
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,643
What?

450
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:47,382
Van Sciver isn't human.

451
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:52,713
Ok Ray, I've gonna get...

452
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:54,661
No, you have to believe me,
I've seen things.

453
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,012
- I don't buy this...
- No, listen to me!

454
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:58,641
There's a conspiracy here.

455
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,710
And it goes way back.

456
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:03,212
I, I'm not sure who it involves,
but these...

457
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,183
these people, these things...

458
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,501
Hey, I'm gonna
make you promise,

459
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:09,500
hey look at me,
look at me in my eyes!

460
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:12,280
We're gonna go home,
you're gonna get to talk to...

461
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:13,963
I'm not talking to another doctor!

462
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:15,551
Talk to Hendricks.

463
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,133
If you believe this,
whatever it is,

464
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:19,792
and I don't bring it forward
in this day and age...

465
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,740
I'm not willing take that risk.

466
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,182
You've shitting me right?

467
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:25,400
I've known you too long.

468
00:37:29,245 --> 00:37:30,660
Thank you.

469
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,303
There's a flight at 7.30 am.

470
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,072
- You got a hotel here, right?
- Yeah.

471
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,660
I'll pick you up first thing.

472
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:39,471
We're gonna figure this out,
Ray, you and me.

473
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:41,793
We're gonna gat all this squared away.

474
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,870
This ***.

475
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:05,223
Where I am ?

476
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:08,180
You are where you need to be, honey.

477
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:10,792
You don't have to this, Chase.

478
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,380
This is the only way
to ensure the project success.

479
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,592
What project?

480
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,020
What are you talking about?

481
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:26,600
What is he doing?

482
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:33,880
Chase?

483
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,152
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.

484
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,261
What is that?

485
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,792
What is he doing?

486
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:44,663
Marcus?

487
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:46,933
Marcus?

488
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:48,970
It's just an experiment.

489
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,093
But one I'm sure will work.

490
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:57,901
Ready.

491
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,982
You're sure about this, Chase?

492
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:02,070
I've nothing but faith in you.

493
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,131
Chase?

494
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:41,222
What's happening?

495
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:42,862
Deep breaths.

496
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:45,643
What are you doing?

497
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:50,291
Giving you the chance to prove
that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.

498
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:51,520
Pure Bloods could die,

499
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,882
and that we, the infected ones,

500
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,140
will be the ones
to take you all down.

501
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:43,722
I... I... I thought 
you loved me.

502
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:44,763
I do.

503
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:48,182
For everything you've just done
for Marcus and I.

504
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:55,993
Who is infected now?

505
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:36,211
I know it hurts, mom.

506
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:39,111
- Please don't!!!
- I can't.

507
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,212
Stop it you bitch!

508
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,311
It has to work right?

509
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:47,042
Tell me it's gonna work!

510
00:41:57,608 --> 00:42:00,083
I'm so thristy!

511
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:02,850
I can smell him, he's right there.

512
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:08,513
I'm so thirsty, honey, please!

513
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,883
Why isn't this working?

514
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:13,781
She's fed to many times,
she's been turned for too long.

515
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:15,752
Let me out!!!

516
00:42:16,058 --> 00:42:17,482
What can I do?

517
00:42:18,627 --> 00:42:20,040
You can let me do it.

518
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,520
Mom!

519
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:31,682
Krista?

520
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,592
I'm sorry.
