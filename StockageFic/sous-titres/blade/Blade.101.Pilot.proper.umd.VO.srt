1
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,908
Do you know what happens next?

2
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,327
Da.

3
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,103
Where are you
shipping the bodies?

4
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:40,521
Detroit.

5
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,608
Who is taking possession?

6
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,359
Van Sciver.

7
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,738
Marcus Van Sciver.

8
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:52,580
Okay, you can go.

9
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,708
You kidding, yes?

10
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,412
Yes.

11
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,638
Blade The Series - 101- Pilot

12
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:24,798
You're lost?

13
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:27,879
These streets are dangerous.

14
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,750
I can take care of myself.

15
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,550
Oh, really?

16
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:36,930
And, uh,
these can take care of you.

17
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,391
Well, bring them him.

18
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,271
Not you.

19
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:56,330
We're gonna go
for a little ride.

20
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,441
Where are we?

21
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,940
Friend of mine's.

22
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,240
- What is this place?
- You're gonna love it, sweetheart.

23
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,670
Are you robbing me, asshole?

24
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:38,593
Just wait here a
second, beautiful.

25
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,153
What the hell is in there?

26
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,323
Don't worry about it.

27
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:17,061
It's easier if you don't struggle,
honey. 50 bucks? Cheap Whore!

28
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,100
It's a disaster.

29
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:17,021
Just the way you like it.

30
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:22,400
Barred windows. Plenty of space.
And, if we get bored,

31
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,660
there's a ping pong
table in the back.

32
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,750
I know how much
you love ping pong.

33
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:32,411
Come on! I've taken you to a half of dozen
sites sealed as tight as a frog's ass,

34
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:34,530
you pissed on every one of them.

35
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,582
You said we have to move fast.

36
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:36,370
We do.

37
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,663
Well then pick a place and throw
down your damn sleeping bag.

38
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,051
Set up shop.

39
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,573
Thanks Marcus.

40
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:58,041
You don't know how
much this means to me.

41
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,062
You deserve this, Zack.

42
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:02,500
You've been such a good boy!

43
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,223
It's right. But it's,

44
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:08,120
like, the last time you
ever really feel pain?

45
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,773
There's only
pleasure I had baby.

46
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,492
Hey Marcus. Is there anything I should know?

47
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,823
Get out of the car.

48
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:54,412
Is there a... speech I need to
say or a... prayer or something?

49
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:56,900
Nobody wants a prayer.

50
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:03,820
We are big on unity, Zack, and trust
is an important part of that unity.

51
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,421
That's why we brought in here.

52
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:11,083
The House of Chthon has
a lot of locked doors.

53
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:14,121
Doors meant to hold my secrets.

54
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:17,812
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.

55
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,751
- Too many.
- Wait, wait!

56
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:09,030
She's home. Oh, my baby girl's home!
I missed you!

57
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,662
I'm back.

58
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:47,371
It's great to have you back.

59
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,361
It's great to be back.

60
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:53,571
I heard about the
action you saw.

61
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:03,842
You know, I run that support
group up in Pyac if you need it.

62
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:05,621
How about that beer?

63
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:10,163
Works too! For a while.

64
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,943
You should eat something.

65
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,141
I will in a little while.

66
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,721
Where is Zack?

67
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:22,090
He was arrested last week.

68
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,553
Listen.

69
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:27,502
I'm thinking we should all sit down,
have a nice long talk

70
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:30,241
- before he winds up in prison.
- Waste of time.

71
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,983
Mum! He's not a bad guy!
He's just a little lost!

72
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:37,193
- Why do you always defend him?
- Because nobody else will!

73
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:40,683
Look, why don't we just cool
down here and think about...

74
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:43,420
Oh, it's probably
Zack right now.

75
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:50,541
Is this the family of Zack Starr?
- Yes.

76
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,453
Sorry, but there's
been a shooting.

77
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,753
I know this is very difficult for you,
Miss Starr.

78
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:20,881
That's my brother.

79
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,840
Twin brother, eh?

80
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,460
Yeah.

81
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,360
Harsh.

82
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:34,901
What is that?

83
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:38,100
Oh, that, it's a gang sign,
I've seen it around.

84
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:40,063
He wasn't in a gang.

85
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,351
Yeah? When was the
last time you saw him?

86
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,633
Two years ago.

87
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,621
A lot can change in two years.

88
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:51,070
Zack wasn't in a gang!

89
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:55,143
We are doing everything we can
to find out who do this. Hey!

90
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:12,610
So, well, uh, I'll uh,
I'll be in touch.

91
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:19,502
Bryan Boone.
Call me, I mean if you need any help.

92
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:47,123
3  men may be tied to the east side but
an identified man fired an assault riffle.

93
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:51,203
This continues away the violence that
hits the city over the last two months.

94
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,563
The mayor called it a priority
of the city earlier this morning...

95
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,422
after the body of Zack Starr,
an alleged gang member,

96
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,930
was discovered by the Detroit river.

97
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:03,370
This is the tenth gang-related
death in the last three weeks.

98
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:06,882
Authorities are asking anyone for
information to please come forward.

99
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,450
Back to you Bill.

100
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,611
Have you finished?

101
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,981
Yeah, I'm finished.

102
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:19,541
Security, media feeds
and infrared are on.

103
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:26,072
Sun's down.
Time to make some new friends.

104
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:50,110
Huh Blade.
Try to do this quietly.

105
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:54,270
Yeah, that's my M.O..

106
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,002
How does it feel?

107
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:08,033
Hum, that hurts.

108
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:11,902
Good tattoo always does.

109
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:15,482
It's not a buttlerfly or a key
or some 5-minute shit like that.

110
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:21,141
Doesn't count if you don't need
the needle for at least an hour.

111
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,830
How long have you been
working for Van Sciver?

112
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,331
Tell  me!
Tell me what I want to know!

113
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,711
Get him off!

114
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,640
What do you wanna know?
Tell me, I'll tell you.

115
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,533
What the hell?
I told you I'd talk.

116
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:13,202
Sorry, I didn't hear.

117
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,190
You've reached Detective Bryan Booin robbery
and homicide, I'm not avalaible right now,

118
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,833
but  if it's an emergency hang up,
then dial 911.

119
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:39,442
Otherwise leave a message after the tone.

120
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,720
Zack...

121
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:16,690
Hey!

122
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,392
Come on in.

123
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,051
Oh god!

124
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,091
No, no, no, no, I gotta go.

125
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:25,173
I'm sorry about that, hello.

126
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:26,961
I left some messages.

127
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,492
And you are uh?

128
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:29,950
Krista Starr.

129
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,040
Krista St...

130
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,870
Oh right, the dealer's sister.

131
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,832
My brother wasn't a drug
dealer or a gang member.

132
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:43,410
Ok, that took place...
Here we go. The, the docks right?

133
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,082
I was just to his appartment and there
was this man there going through his stuff.

134
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,691
What did he looked like?

135
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,821
Black, dressed in black.

136
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:52,770
Oh black, that narrows it down.

137
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,572
But he could be a suspect
or he can know something.

138
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,812
- Can I see my brother's file?
- No.

139
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,730
Maybe I could help,
I was a sergent in the Army.

140
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,391
Yeah, this ain't the army.
Listen, sweetheart.

141
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:06,430
At the end of the day, your brother got
caught up and somebody shot him, okay?

142
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:08,433
Got in over his head, hepissed off
the wrong people...

143
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,292
just like every single one of these guys.

144
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:13,248
My brother isn't like every
single one of these guys.

145
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,358
Look, people like this,
all they end up doing...

146
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,979
is taking up file space, you understand?

147
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:21,123
Yeah, I understand.

148
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,283
Have a nice day.

149
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:27,080
Boone. Ah, yeah!

150
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:38,031
- Take it easy, pal!
- Hey pancho! Shut that guy up!

151
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,770
Son of a bitch.

152
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:45,170
What? I got hungry too.

153
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,591
I need those inhalers.

154
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:52,842
I'm working on it.

155
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:54,921
Work... faster.

156
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:58,171
Dude, most of? is destroyed.

157
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,072
The serum that keeps the thirst
is easy to replicate...

158
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:03,213
but inhalers work on a completely
different system.

159
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,551
You see,
they allow you to generate hemoglobine.

160
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,700
Humains have genes that develop proteins,

161
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:09,880
but vampires have disabled links
between them.

162
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,290
These inhalers help diffuse...

163
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,492
Figure it out!

164
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:16,463
You're supposed to
be the smart one.

165
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:18,812
Yeah, I'm the
good-looking one too.

166
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,673
Got any leads on what
Marcus is up to?

167
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,673
I cracked open a dozen
families last night.

168
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:51,740
If they knew what he was realy
doing in Detroit. So would I.

169
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,583
Well, can't hide forever.

170
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:58,033
He is Detroit's
great white hope.

171
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,300
The guy started some kind of
Renaissance movement two years ago.

172
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,033
Restored a dozen
buildings from late 1800s,

173
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,080
preached about the
historical value of the city...

174
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:08,360
pass show his way to in the future,
blah blah blah.

175
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:13,020
It's only a matter of time before
he shows his smug little face.

176
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:17,143
And when he does,
he'll be surrounded by the press.

177
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:21,832
He'll be hard to get close to.

178
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:25,960
And you don't exactly blend in.

179
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:40,902
Damn.

180
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,623
- Danny Milano?
- Yeah.

181
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,660
Do I know you?

182
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,620
I'm Zack's sister.

183
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,372
Don't know him.

184
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:55,841
He's the guy you got
arrested with last week.

185
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:03,313
I don't know who you think I am.
I'm not. I'm not.

186
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:05,823
Did you kill my brother?

187
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,030
No, no, no freaking way.
Why would I wanna kill Zack?

188
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,541
Memory coming back?

189
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:12,142
All right, yeah. He lived a
street from me. We hung around.

190
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,382
Who wanted him dead?

191
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:17,302
I don't know. People disappear
around here all the time.

192
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:19,183
What is that?

193
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:20,562
Gang sign?

194
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,310
It's just a tatoo.

195
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,112
Of what?

196
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,251
Psycho bitch!

197
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,171
Yeah, hey.

198
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:07,523
Zack's sister showed up.
I think we got a problem.

199
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,162
Yes?

200
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,412
Professor Melvin Caylo?

201
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,112
Who are you?

202
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:21,032
What is this?

203
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,450
Let me see.

204
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,283
Hello?

205
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,792
Let me see your wrist.

206
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:39,361
- What?
- Let me see them!

207
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:43,321
And the neck. The neck!

208
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,531
You didn't use it, did you?

209
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:09,901
Use it?

210
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:14,190
The hash. It's found its
way under the streets now.

211
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,280
With  the rest of the drugs.

212
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:20,953
Inhale enough of it, it will give you
the abilities of the omines nocturni.

213
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:23,270
It is for an hour or two.

214
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,610
Though the sad effects. The...

215
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,323
The thirst that comes with it.

216
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,360
Most end up chewing
their own fingers off.

217
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,863
The omines nocturni?

218
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:40,111
Vampires. This is vampire hash.

219
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,350
It's quite expensive too.

220
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:47,283
This vial is at least
a thousand dollars.

221
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,573
Ten if it comes
from a pure blood.

222
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:55,942
And I supposed next you're gonna
to tell me that werewolves exist.

223
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:59,653
My colleague Mock's
area of expertise.

224
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,400
Really?

225
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,600
What do you think this means?

226
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:15,270
This brand's familiar,
it's dedicated to the House of Chthon.

227
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:18,240
Humans who?
their lives or their culture.

228
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,353
Hoping to be changed some day.

229
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:26,613
They're everywhere you see, the police,
the governement, everywhere.

230
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:28,190
Here.

231
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:32,402
Take this and flush
it down the toilet.

232
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:35,021
But I read you were
searching for proof.

233
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:38,810
I have plenty of that.

234
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,981
Proof.

235
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,943
Hum, thank you for your time.

236
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:56,523
Wait! Come back!

237
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:20,733
God. What a hell of a day!

238
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:36,262
You okay?

239
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:42,520
Hello?

240
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:48,362
Hello?

241
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:50,701
Hey!

242
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:57,873
Jesus!

243
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:05,221
Krista.

244
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:13,860
Krista.

245
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,330
Krista.

246
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,680
I know who killed your brother.

247
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,021
Here. Hurry!

248
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:14,960
Hello?

249
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:59,070
You wanna know what happen to
your brother? The wannabe.

250
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:03,492
He is now meat...

251
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:08,633
just like you.

252
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,710
Holly shit!

253
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:29,412
- Those... are...
- Were.

254
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:31,072
...vampires!

255
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:35,502
And what does that make you?

256
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,183
Something else.

257
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:40,103
What does that mean?

258
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:45,632
- Oh, god! What is that smell?
- Garlic.

259
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:49,100
They don't like it either.

260
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:52,112
This is impossible.

261
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,531
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.

262
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,590
Why is it everybody
know my name?

263
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:01,931
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city!

264
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:05,153
Forget everything
you saw here tonight.

265
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,322
Yeah, right! I can't just forget
about this. I mean, I just...

266
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:11,682
Hey!

267
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:01,290
Vampires exist, young lady.

268
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,502
But most people don't
see the dangers.

269
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:05,840
So, who the hell is Blade?

270
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,842
My favorite fascination.

271
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,891
His parents were Robert
and Vanessa Brooks.

272
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:18,890
They lived in Detroit.

273
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:24,941
Vanessa was nine months pregnant the night
she was attacked, bitten, left for dead.

274
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:32,003
Robert found her, struggling to survive for the
sake of her unborn child outside of their apartment.

275
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:36,672
He rushed her into the hospital where
their son was delivered by C-section.

276
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,260
Robert named him Eric.

277
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:48,851
The boy aged
relatively normally.

278
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:51,100
But he wasn't normal.

279
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,061
Yeah, kind of figured it that.

280
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,990
Eric went through
genetic changes at birth.

281
00:35:56,247 --> 00:36:01,360
He was born a different
kind of vampire.?

282
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:05,000
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

283
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:08,840
Ah... except of the thirst.

284
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:13,220
The thirst is what controls
all omines nocturni.

285
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:16,643
And no one can fight it.

286
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:19,180
Except for Blade.

287
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:23,733
His father...
kept Blade secret.

288
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:29,523
He  provided fresh blood for him for the ten
first years of his life. Don't ask me how.

289
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:32,493
Until he couldn't
handle it anymore.

290
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,200
And Blade was loose
out on the streets.

291
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:41,423
Until a friend of mine, Abraham
Whistler found him and took him in.

292
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:44,512
So we saved Blade from
drinking the blood of animals,

293
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:49,511
others... clone suppliers
like the House of Lychan.

294
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,760
But I know the truth,

295
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:56,480
he lives off a synthetic serum.

296
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:58,650
Where can I find him?

297
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:04,282
Well, I will tell you,

298
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:07,243
he hasn't stayed in
one place very long.

299
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:15,722
Here uh,
the only address he ever had.

300
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,962
How can you see
with those things?

301
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:29,763
What are you doing here?

302
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:31,931
You were following me.

303
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,141
You should have left!

304
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,190
You've seen them in the flesh.

305
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:38,693
You've been seen all?
after you.

306
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:41,163
You know who killed my brother.
He was one of them.

307
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:42,821
Let it go!

308
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:45,110
Help me take out
these bastards!

309
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,033
Help you?

310
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:55,413
I'm going after them,
with or without you.

311
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:57,381
Silver bullet.

312
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,921
Mmh. Doesn't work on me.

313
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:02,770
But I bet it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

314
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:04,173
Blade?

315
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,773
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead?

316
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,722
I'm not talking to you.

317
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:09,900
What?

318
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:13,000
News... Van Sciver finished
restoring some art gallery last week.

319
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:17,492
Tonight there's a big party and
our boy's making an appearence.

320
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:18,783
Good.

321
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:19,740
Good?

322
00:40:19,955 --> 00:40:21,581
Who are you talking to, man?

323
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,000
Where are you?

324
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:29,133
No, no. Dude, that is Zack's sister.
Do not get her involved.

325
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:32,550
I'll hold this,
you have a job to do.

326
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:36,221
- You're listening to me?
- No, no, Blade. Damn!

327
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:42,442
Test subject, G1139,

328
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:45,821
baseline trial on batch 97G.

329
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:53,373
Beginning vaccine
injection, now.

330
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,500
Stand by for Stage
1 confirmation.

331
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:05,051
Introduction of Stage
1 garlic extract now.

332
00:41:16,868 --> 00:41:18,573
Stage 1 failure.

333
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,913
Moving on to batch 98G.

334
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,961
New UV blade is not working.

335
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,923
My stuff always works.

336
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,680
Isn't all of this a
little elaborate?

337
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:51,821
He likes the pretty lights.

338
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:55,912
What is this?

339
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:57,370
The fat lady.

340
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,161
Oh, the fat lady.

341
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,460
Ultrasonic brain scrambler.

342
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:06,631
Finally, something I recognize.

343
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:10,173
Kind of.

344
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,970
Customized PDW.

345
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:16,102
We call it a shotgun.

346
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:21,143
One taste of liquid garlic chamber from that
monster sends any vampire in anaphylactic shock.

347
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,743
Their skin ruptures,
their blood evaporates.

348
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,442
I know.

349
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,831
I saw in action already.

350
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:33,122
So, what about crosses
and holy water?

351
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:34,713
They don't do anything.

352
00:42:35,257 --> 00:42:36,633
You don't need this.

353
00:42:37,047 --> 00:42:38,292
Why not?

354
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,672
Here, this is a transponder.

355
00:42:40,896 --> 00:42:42,970
To track it anywhere
in the city.

356
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:46,471
I see, you want me to carry it.

357
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,181
We want someone else too.

358
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:51,041
Marcus Van Sciver is a player
in the House of Chthon.

359
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:53,303
The largest vampire
colony in North America.

360
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:56,850
And tonight you'll be parading
around the Van Sciver house gallery.

361
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,612
So take him out.

362
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,372
I ash Van Sciver.

363
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:07,680
There is a dozen other vampires
to step up and take his place.

364
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,090
So take them out too.

365
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:17,552
If we can track him,
he can lead us to the House of Chthon.

366
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,810
If we play this cool,
if we have a little patience,

367
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:24,773
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.

368
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:29,063
You take this seriously.

369
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,981
There's no other
way to take it.

370
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:41,882
A big party.

371
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,393
Excuse me.

372
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:01,942
This gallery hasn't opened
its doors since 1978.

373
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:06,203
How does it feel to be a part of another
revitalized institution, Mr Van Sciver?

374
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm just doing my best to keep
this city alive. Thank you.

375
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,751
There's our girl.

376
00:44:24,986 --> 00:44:28,680
Of course, Chief Edwards.
We always look after our friends.

377
00:44:36,955 --> 00:44:38,573
Dr Dideo.

378
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,951
Fire chief, councilman.

379
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,701
That's the man right there.

380
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:48,803
It's like stepping
back in time.

381
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:50,382
Exactly.

382
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:52,893
She's gonna do it!

383
00:44:53,145 --> 00:44:54,223
This building,

384
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:59,823
none would have been possible if it wasn't for the efforts
of ten coming up pioneers in the automotive industry.

385
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:00,980
Come on.

386
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:09,860
I am simply...
following the legacy they left.

387
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:14,372
Oh, don't be so modest.

388
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:18,040
They say you're the man
who's gonna save Detroit.

389
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,553
Some  do.

390
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:24,303
Gentlemen excuse me. Fritz.

391
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:25,973
Gentlemen.

392
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:29,723
I believe we are all to quick to
forget our past. Did you know?

393
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:34,440
The average age of building in United
States is less than 30 years old.

394
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:35,982
Didn't know that.

395
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:40,110
Take this city, it's been around
since the 18th century and yet,

396
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:43,332
if you ask somebody to point out
a prominent historical landmark,

397
00:45:43,378 --> 00:45:45,821
they probably aim for
the Joe Louis Arena.

398
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:51,041
You see the past has been torn down and replaced
by something that in a short matter of time

399
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,171
will also be torn
down and replaced.

400
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:56,550
It's a wasteful cycle.

401
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,761
There's only one thing this country
values when it comes to old age.

402
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:06,311
So, try to recapture the past?

403
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:08,693
Just try not to forget it.

404
00:46:09,828 --> 00:46:11,650
Me either.

405
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:19,701
So tell me about you.

406
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,580
So much to tell.

407
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:24,040
Well, you could just
start with a name.

408
00:46:25,725 --> 00:46:27,222
Katherine.

409
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,012
Katherine?

410
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:38,940
Now you seem to me to be more like a...
Krista!

411
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:41,861
Man, I told you!

412
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:44,073
You look familiar.

413
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:48,243
Like someone I once knew.

414
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,202
There was this young man,

415
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:54,252
his name was... Zack Starr.

416
00:46:56,056 --> 00:46:59,212
And he wasn't particularly
bright or assertive.

417
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:02,501
But he was desperate.

418
00:47:03,017 --> 00:47:05,981
Desperate for some sort
of control of his life.

419
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:07,060
Let go.

420
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:10,731
People like him are always
taking never giving,

421
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:13,023
draining on the
people around him.

422
00:47:13,276 --> 00:47:16,281
Sucking a life from them.

423
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:19,110
Honestly,

424
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,033
he's better off.

425
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,950
Or at least the world is.

426
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,742
Screw this.

427
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:49,282
Where is she going?

428
00:47:57,057 --> 00:47:59,041
What the hell is she doing?

429
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,422
I'm gonna kill her!

430
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:14,940
Excuse me, Mr Van Sciver.

431
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,113
It's okay.

432
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:19,531
She wanted me to give you this.

433
00:48:20,157 --> 00:48:20,893
Who?

434
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,163
The woman you were talking to.

435
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:35,583
Hello, Krista.

436
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,503
I know what you are.

437
00:48:41,438 --> 00:48:43,550
You're watching me,
aren't you?

438
00:48:45,528 --> 00:48:50,812
Through a ten power scope attached to
the top of a matched grade sniper rifle.

439
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:54,411
Wow, it sounds impressive.

440
00:48:58,128 --> 00:49:00,913
You're allergic to garlic so,

441
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:03,831
let's stay away
from the gaspacho.

442
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:06,932
I did, thank you.

443
00:49:10,206 --> 00:49:11,912
There you are.

444
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,912
Tell me more.

445
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:19,050
Sunlight can burn your skin.

446
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:21,093
It will turn you into ash.

447
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:27,230
and I've got a silver bullet ready to
blow that stupid smile right of your face.

448
00:49:33,726 --> 00:49:35,390
You killed my brother.

449
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:40,363
Yes, yes I did.

450
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:45,411
If you knew who I was,
why mess with me like that?

451
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:47,543
Because it's my nature.

452
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:52,063
You're everything your brother wasn't,
aren't you?

453
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:54,772
A success where
he was a failure.

454
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,073
Bright... where he was dimmed.

455
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,660
Shut up!

456
00:50:05,648 --> 00:50:09,060
Oh come on, Krista,
take the shot!

457
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:17,121
I don't care how
fast vampires are.

458
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:21,553
You can't dodge with a bullet moving
2000 meters per second and trust me,

459
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:26,892
I'm a hell of a good shot.

460
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,321
What happened?

461
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,393
She screwed up.

462
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:44,761
I'm impressed, Krista.

463
00:51:46,387 --> 00:51:49,733
I hope you still are when I'm
shoving a stake up your ass!

464
00:51:51,077 --> 00:51:54,720
I killed a lot of people.

465
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:59,391
But your brother,
that wasn't out of pleasure.

466
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:01,590
I really did like him.

467
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:04,932
But he was looking around of
things he wasn't supposed to.

468
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:08,270
Being too curious.

469
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:12,753
You on the other hand,
might just work.

470
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:16,030
What you're gonna do?
Bite me?

471
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:18,172
Bite you...

472
00:52:19,226 --> 00:52:21,121
That's for savages.

473
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:24,771
In truth, it's not the most
reliable form of transmission.

474
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:29,502
No. Here is the
House of Chthon.

475
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:39,320
We're people civilized.

476
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:40,961
You need permission Marcus.

477
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,220
Not this time, no.

478
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:44,072
Just let me kill
her and end it.

479
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:46,991
Hush, Chase.

480
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:01,903
Stay the hell away from me!

481
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:04,771
Oh I know, you're scared.

482
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:08,471
You think of us as sociopaths that
just walked out of a nightmare.

483
00:53:08,697 --> 00:53:13,392
But this is an honor, Krista.
Trust me.

484
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:17,890
There are severe restrictions based on
the number of humans we're allowed to turn.

485
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:22,262
We don't wanna attract unwanted attention
or put a strain on our food soures.

486
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,211
We survive by living
in the shadows.

487
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:50,573
It's okay to fight.
It's only natural.

488
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:56,821
But you will think so much better,
so much clearer

489
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:59,112
once you've been
through the change.

490
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:40,911
Now Krista,
all you have to do is die.

491
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,640
Wake up!

492
00:54:58,856 --> 00:55:00,142
Zack?

493
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:03,800
He can't catch me, catch me...

494
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:09,571
Ah ah ah!

495
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:18,482
Over there,
I want to tell you something.

496
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:21,600
Zack.

497
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:28,663
Krista, all you
have to do is die.

498
00:55:29,598 --> 00:55:31,080
You understand?

499
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:05,072
Please, kill me.

500
00:56:06,755 --> 00:56:08,981
Kill me!

501
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:16,953
Hello, Krista.

502
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:20,712
Welcome to the family.

503
00:58:24,576 --> 00:58:26,090
You can't stop looking.

504
00:58:26,456 --> 00:58:31,040
Body was delivered at the city morgue
last night at 2 a. m. Vanished about 3.

505
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,472
Has she been turned?

506
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:34,983
Blade, we can't cure her.

507
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:38,722
And the thirst is going to take over
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.

508
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,363
You find her, you got to stake her.
Just like always.

509
00:58:42,526 --> 00:58:43,502
The serum?

510
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:45,032
You mean the chance
of that working?

511
00:58:45,077 --> 00:58:45,913
Are what?

512
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:47,193
Slim, man!

513
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,351
You pump her full of it before sunrise,
she might get a clear head for a few hours.

514
00:58:50,397 --> 00:58:53,100
But if she feeds off a fresh kill
before, then who the hell knows!

515
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:54,841
And finding her is
still a problem.

516
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:59,602
Krista left a loose end out there.
I'm gonna tie it up.

517
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:37,753
I would have warned you.

518
00:59:38,586 --> 00:59:42,080
But there is something to be said
for learning from experience.

519
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:47,600
You've been asleep all day.

520
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:53,440
- I feel...
- Alive?

521
00:59:54,496 --> 00:59:55,443
Yeah.

522
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:03,380
Those shoes, put them on.

523
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:18,323
You see Krista,
the so-called living.

524
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,212
The ones growing
obese and passive.

525
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:24,421
Oblivious to the
true layers of life.

526
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:27,632
They are the ones you are dead.

527
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:31,840
The dull senses have no abilities to
unlock the real beauty of this world.

528
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:35,351
Unlike us.

529
01:00:36,775 --> 01:00:39,230
You will learn, soon enough,

530
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:43,492
everything has so many
more facets of pleasure.

531
01:00:44,047 --> 01:00:48,543
Music, food, sex.

532
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:52,131
Your rebirth is here.

533
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,263
Your grihalt.

534
01:00:57,065 --> 01:00:58,511
Grihalt?

535
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:02,530
In our language, it means someone
who has achieved true life.

536
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:06,360
And as your sponsor,
it's my privilege to teach it to you.

537
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:08,663
And to introduce
you to our culture.

538
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:12,040
I saw you.

539
01:01:14,715 --> 01:01:16,960
And I saw my brother.

540
01:01:17,018 --> 01:01:20,012
The images you witnessed
are part of your ADE.

541
01:01:20,616 --> 01:01:24,370
And after that experience triggered by
the genetic memories of your sponsor.

542
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:28,070
And your own synapses,
they rebuilt your cognitive functions.

543
01:01:29,678 --> 01:01:33,410
The visions you witnessed
are sacred, Krista.

544
01:01:33,715 --> 01:01:36,923
And must only be shared with
someone you really trust.

545
01:01:39,806 --> 01:01:41,430
Don't touch me.

546
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:46,780
What did you do to me?

547
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,370
What did you do?

548
01:01:54,556 --> 01:01:56,661
I saved you.

549
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:04,301
Take her with you.

550
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:06,311
This is a mistake.

551
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:08,520
What is? Her?

552
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,360
Yes, Marcus.

553
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:13,571
And when you were
turned, Chase?

554
01:02:14,955 --> 01:02:17,790
Everyone starts somewhere.

555
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:19,083
And some...

556
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:22,180
start a lot lower in
life than Krista Starr.

557
01:02:22,768 --> 01:02:27,183
You will take her on a ride along.
And you will teach her.

558
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:29,223
And you will dress her.

559
01:02:29,698 --> 01:02:32,080
When the board finds out
what you've been doing.

560
01:02:34,036 --> 01:02:39,080
Don't question me, Chase!
Ever!

561
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:52,103
I told the sister
everything I know.

562
01:02:54,956 --> 01:02:57,873
You can't do that!
You can't do that... I'm protected.

563
01:02:57,935 --> 01:02:59,531
Not from me.

564
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:02,241
If someone disappears down here,
who knows where they go?

565
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:03,580
I don't know.

566
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:06,672
Give me a name, Danny.

567
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:13,023
He's a cop, Boone. He got the
charges on Zack and I dropped.

568
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:15,232
You gotta understand
why we do this man.

569
01:03:15,497 --> 01:03:17,311
We wanna be like you.

570
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:23,411
Strong, fast. And immortality, man.
I'm gonna live for freaking ever.

571
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:24,960
No, you won't.

572
01:03:43,457 --> 01:03:44,873
Can you see it?

573
01:03:46,796 --> 01:03:48,332
Krista?

574
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:50,422
See what?

575
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:52,631
Relax your eyes.

576
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:54,420
Pull your focus back.

577
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:57,020
Look!

578
01:04:02,195 --> 01:04:03,521
I see something.

579
01:04:03,788 --> 01:04:07,083
They can only be read in
the ultraviolet spectrum.

580
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:10,122
The House of Chthon's glyph.

581
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:11,922
It means it's ours.

582
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:14,713
Ours?

583
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,013
One of the places we recruit.

584
01:04:17,227 --> 01:04:21,351
We also have save houses throughout the
city where fresh blood is delivered.

585
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:24,150
If you're out and dawn approaches,
you go.

586
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:30,433
But if you see the House of
Lychan glyph, stay away.

587
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:35,710
The thirst, it hurts.

588
01:04:36,218 --> 01:04:37,381
Yes.

589
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:42,431
You'll drink.

590
01:04:45,947 --> 01:04:47,773
Soon enough.

591
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:56,841
Fritz, go.

592
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:17,201
Blade, the
transponder's online.

593
01:05:34,908 --> 01:05:36,611
I smell it.

594
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:38,823
Me too.

595
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:46,843
Drink.

596
01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:54,941
Slowly, take it all in slowly.

597
01:06:01,197 --> 01:06:02,772
When did that happen to you?

598
01:06:03,495 --> 01:06:07,342
When did you become grihalt?

599
01:06:07,646 --> 01:06:09,850
Marcus told you that,
didn't he?

600
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:11,663
It's his favorite word.

601
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:14,601
He says the same
speech to all of them.

602
01:06:15,196 --> 01:06:16,402
All of who?

603
01:06:16,738 --> 01:06:22,590
The new born. But with the strict
rules we live by, the enemies outside,

604
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:25,613
most of them don't last a year.

605
01:06:26,925 --> 01:06:29,183
Did Marcus change you?

606
01:06:30,868 --> 01:06:36,871
No. My husband did.
And lived to regret it.

607
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:39,983
He still does.

608
01:06:54,165 --> 01:06:55,123
Hey!

609
01:06:59,907 --> 01:07:03,693
You should be careful out there, honey.
These streets are dangerous.

610
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,832
There a bed inside?

611
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:40,780
You wouldn't believe what's inside.
You are just a little snack thing, huh?

612
01:07:41,096 --> 01:07:41,990
Jesus.

613
01:07:42,848 --> 01:07:45,500
I thought I told you my pets
are on the strict diet.

614
01:07:46,877 --> 01:07:48,793
- Hello.
- Hi.

615
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:58,923
Don't pull that Dracula shit, sneaking
up on people, I almost crap myself.

616
01:07:59,136 --> 01:08:00,961
You've been
overfeeding them again.

617
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:02,501
And for what?

618
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:04,581
A few dirty twenties?

619
01:08:07,138 --> 01:08:09,001
I've got something for you.

620
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:11,042
Shit!

621
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,010
Blade.

622
01:08:44,355 --> 01:08:45,803
Fat lady's early.

623
01:08:46,308 --> 01:08:47,592
Burn her.

624
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,042
I told you too many times.

625
01:08:51,355 --> 01:08:53,352
All right, all right,
I'll stay away ok?

626
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,842
You got to help me now.

627
01:08:55,148 --> 01:08:58,230
If I was like you, I mean I could
do some much more. Come on!

628
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,392
Make me Marcus.

629
01:09:02,146 --> 01:09:04,972
Make you?

630
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:32,102
I've put up with your desobedience
and carelessness long enough.

631
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:34,602
Come on man! I...

632
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:39,181
Wait a minute, you turned her?

633
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:41,391
That slacker sister!

634
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:43,603
It's my turn, my...

635
01:09:46,197 --> 01:09:49,770
There is no room for someone
like you in my inner circle.

636
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:51,681
It's time to cut bait.

637
01:09:51,986 --> 01:09:53,522
And unfortunately for you,

638
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:56,350
you're the only person
I know she hates.

639
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,111
You'll make it easy for her.

640
01:10:10,316 --> 01:10:14,393
Now Krista,
it's time for your fist kill.

641
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:23,900
That's enough!

642
01:10:24,578 --> 01:10:25,982
Live him be.

643
01:10:26,245 --> 01:10:29,811
This is something she
must do on her own.

644
01:10:38,035 --> 01:10:39,233
No...

645
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:43,511
Come along,
the new vaccine is ready.

646
01:11:58,556 --> 01:11:59,500
Blade's here.

647
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:00,762
Deal with it.

648
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:07,063
Marcus, give me
the new vaccine.

649
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:08,730
No.

650
01:12:09,816 --> 01:12:11,320
He is here.

651
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:14,990
Let me serve you.

652
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:30,093
Krista!

653
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:33,931
You can still fight it.

654
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:02,750
It's been fun.

655
01:15:13,478 --> 01:15:15,392
His shit always works my ass!

656
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:23,451
Shen?

657
01:15:24,795 --> 01:15:29,620
- Shen? Shen?
- I'm here, I'm here!

658
01:15:29,876 --> 01:15:31,881
Shen, something's wrong.

659
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,783
Shen, make the fat
lady sing now!

660
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:08,680
I hope your earplugs are in,
buddy, here we go!

661
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:31,512
Fritz? That's enough.

662
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:33,773
You're my new favorite.

663
01:16:34,815 --> 01:16:36,651
You've proven our success.

664
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:44,822
Shit!

665
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:51,352
Fat lady is recharging.
She's got one more hit in her.

666
01:16:51,385 --> 01:16:54,221
Give me one sec to get
her to do it again.

667
01:17:40,385 --> 01:17:42,450
She is singing again!

668
01:17:49,307 --> 01:17:52,103
Blade, gotta juice. Coming in.

669
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:54,103
Shen, don't!

670
01:17:54,286 --> 01:17:55,390
Sorry brother.

671
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:57,273
Go, goddamn it!

672
01:18:17,438 --> 01:18:19,681
What did you do?

673
01:19:37,227 --> 01:19:40,313
This stuff doesn't work,
but I found you, didn't I?

674
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,770
Up. There you go, big guy.

675
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:53,190
Next time I offer
backup you take it.

676
01:19:56,295 --> 01:19:57,631
Good day, Fritz.

677
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:01,753
You did well, Krista.

678
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:03,551
How's Chase?

679
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:05,171
She'll be fine.

680
01:20:05,525 --> 01:20:09,432
Marcus, the? would like a
few words with you, privately.

681
01:20:09,696 --> 01:20:10,723
Of course.

682
01:20:11,575 --> 01:20:12,560
Excuse me.

683
01:20:14,446 --> 01:20:15,610
Marcus?

684
01:20:23,965 --> 01:20:25,161
Yes.

685
01:20:26,308 --> 01:20:29,083
The visions I saw
when I was changed.

686
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:30,851
The ones with my brother,

687
01:20:31,187 --> 01:20:32,851
what did they mean?

688
01:20:35,226 --> 01:20:36,521
What did you see?

689
01:20:38,497 --> 01:20:40,100
Him and I,

690
01:20:40,705 --> 01:20:45,482
a long time ago as kids in this
story book village we used to go to.

691
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,321
Zach wanted me to chase him.

692
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,173
He was trying to
show you something.

693
01:20:53,798 --> 01:20:55,501
What should I do?

694
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:59,012
What you have been, follow him.

695
01:21:41,216 --> 01:21:42,663
My stuff always works.

696
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:43,833
Not this time!

697
01:21:44,055 --> 01:21:45,213
Where did you hit him?

698
01:21:47,056 --> 01:21:48,680
Then it's something else.

699
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:40,371
So what the hell are
they doing here?

700
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:38,963
What did you do to me?

701
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:40,751
I injected you with a serum,

702
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:42,722
to get you thinking straight.

703
01:24:42,936 --> 01:24:45,353
Krista, Krista!

704
01:24:48,746 --> 01:24:50,273
That cop,

705
01:24:53,168 --> 01:24:55,701
I ripped his throat out.

706
01:24:57,348 --> 01:24:58,790
I killed him.

707
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:00,171
Listen,

708
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:04,353
if you take this
serum twice a day,

709
01:25:04,945 --> 01:25:07,391
it might keep the
thirst under control.

710
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:12,150
Look, you wanted in,
and you're in.

711
01:25:12,786 --> 01:25:14,821
In as far as you can go.

712
01:25:15,797 --> 01:25:17,081
You're one of them.

713
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:19,710
So are you.

714
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:22,171
You can learn so much.

715
01:25:23,056 --> 01:25:25,143
I can work with you.

716
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:28,231
Just like I worked
with your brother.

717
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:34,870
My brother?

718
01:25:39,096 --> 01:25:41,210
Zack worked for you?

719
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:44,970
Yes. He was my contact here.

720
01:25:46,778 --> 01:25:51,861
- Oh my god, you got him killed.
- No, Marcus did.

721
01:25:52,165 --> 01:25:54,401
But Marcus was wrong about him.

722
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:57,423
He was a good man.

723
01:26:07,868 --> 01:26:09,520
Give me the serum.

724
01:26:13,415 --> 01:26:15,372
I got to get back.

725
01:26:25,697 --> 01:26:27,310
What do you think?

726
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:32,953
Could go either away.

727
01:26:59,277 --> 01:27:01,430
No!

728
01:27:06,195 --> 01:27:07,322
Next time on Blade.

729
01:27:07,535 --> 01:27:08,932
I need information on Fritz.

730
01:27:09,078 --> 01:27:09,990
Like what?

731
01:27:10,296 --> 01:27:11,682
He's not your every vampire.

732
01:27:11,797 --> 01:27:13,643
I'm beginning to
think you like this.

733
01:27:13,838 --> 01:27:15,393
You're sure the
vaccine is stable?

734
01:27:15,426 --> 01:27:16,712
Yes, it's stable.

735
01:27:16,925 --> 01:27:18,921
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.

736
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:27,573
No!

737
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:36,523
Let's finish this.

738
01:27:38,115 --> 01:27:41,113
