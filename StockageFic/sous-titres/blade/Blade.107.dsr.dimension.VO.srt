1
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,702
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,032
- Your mother needs you
now more than ever!
- Mom is fine!

3
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,432
She's not fine Krista,
she's sick!

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,736
What's wrong with her?

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:18,950
Blade.

6
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:21,584
Blade? Yes I know.

7
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:23,317
I want you in Berlin tonight.

8
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:25,950
- What's in Berlin?
- My property was stolen.

9
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,239
I want you to find her
and bring her back to me.

10
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:30,273
- Silver has no effect on Blade.
- I know.

11
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,638
I'm in a war. With you.
I better look like it.

12
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,271
- What happened?
- Blade happened.

13
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,914
I salvaged what I could.
Blade got nothing.

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,113
We reached out to help you.
You bit us for it.

15
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,390
You were killers way
before I even met you.

16
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:51,630
Another time, little man.

17
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,841
Hello, Donny.

18
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,963
Looks like your past is...

19
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,741
finally coming back to haunt you.

20
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,543
What do you want from me?

21
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,882
This!

22
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,852
Did you call your friend at the CDC?

23
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:07,842
When did I become your secretary?

24
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:11,583
You wanna dial her up,
just hit that key, right there.

25
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,162
I *** the choice to fill.

26
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,032
I don't do this.

27
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,802
That's cause I do everything.

28
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,163
Didn't fix the AC
in the car yet.

29
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:27,192
Maybe you should look into 
getting the bad-ass summer-weight coat.

30
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,740
Hey, you gotta stop biting me,

31
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:36,651
- I'm going as fast...
- Do you know what it is?

32
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,661
Like I said before,
not completely.

33
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,583
You got the sample 3 days ago.

34
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,420
Yeah, and I got access
to CDC computers 9 hours ago.

35
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,201
You're stressing everybody, dude.

36
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,153
What have you learned in 9 hours?

37
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:50,342
Ok, I think it's a key hole virus.

38
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,753
- A key hole virus?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,823
A virus targeted
at a specific DNA sequence.

40
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,480
So, it's targeted at one person?

41
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,773
People, I think, a race maybe,
even a species.

42
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:01,053
Human or vampire?

43
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,840
Working on that now.

44
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,332
When will you know?

45
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:06,980
I'll call you when I have something.

46
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,210
Later.

47
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,712
First Marcus is trying to make 
vampires immune to their weaknesses.

48
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:17,602
And now, he's trying to make
a virus that wipes out, what?

49
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,083
If your girlfriend worked faster,
we'd know.

50
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,330
Can I make a suggestion?

51
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,012
Take a walk.

52
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,961
I hear the houseware
on the fifth floor is wide open,

53
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:29,041
with nothing but
dark empty space. Go chill.

54
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,401
What's that?

55
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,823
A name just tripped the system.

56
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,792
Donny Flanigan.

57
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,403
What happened to him?

58
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,002
He died...

59
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,203
oddly.

60
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:48,333
Went down a few minutes ago.

61
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:49,703
He was an ex-cop.

62
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:54,520
Blade?

63
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,801
Who is it?

64
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,141
Blade The Series - 107 - Sacrifice

65
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,572
Mom? Hold on, they're here.

66
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,233
She has leuchimia, stage 4.
It's chronic lymphocytic.

67
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:43,680
She's on Pyridazine, 
Dolasetron and Predozon.

68
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:46,290
Mom? The ambulance is here ok?

69
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:47,553
No hospital.

70
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:50,140
She's been coughing up blood
for the past 15 minutes.

71
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,660
Let's go, let's go!

72
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,630
Krista, I'm not going to the hospital.

73
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,472
- I want to stay here.
- No, Mom, you're not staying here.

74
00:04:57,646 --> 00:05:00,170
Krista, I'm not dying in a hospital.

75
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:05,812
They can do what they need to here.

76
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,723
I'm not leaving my home.

77
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,622
Krista?

78
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,693
Krista?

79
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:28,580
Right now, the best thing
for her is to do what she wants.

80
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,822
Right now, the best thing
for her is to stay alive.

81
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:35,271
That's not gonna happen Krista.

82
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:36,971
We  gotta let her go.

83
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,443
No, we don't.

84
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:56,693
Radio made it sound like

85
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,932
crime scene techs
will be here in 15.

86
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,553
We don't have much time.

87
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:04,510
When I'll clear the room,
you'll be in there. Ok?

88
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:07,762
Yeah?

89
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:08,831
Yeah.

90
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,081
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to clear this room.

91
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,791
I need a minute alone
to process this.

92
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,581
Ok.

93
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:49,471
This is going to come up a suicide.

94
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,772
We'll see. I'm sorry did you know him?

95
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:53,571
Yeah.

96
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:57,133
Ok guys, let's go!

97
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,971
This wasn't a suicide.

98
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,030
Gun hand's broken.

99
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:33,662
He was a cop,
maybe he had ennemies.

100
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,102
You knew him?

101
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,773
Yeah.

102
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,970
Eric Brooks, how you doin' kid?

103
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,331
- Hey Flanigan.
- You feeling better?

104
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:52,671
Sleepy.

105
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:56,501
That's what you get for running
into the countryside, uh?

106
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,082
Viola is gonna get you all fixed up.
Make a fist, honey.

107
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,472
Hey, I brought you some uh,
some comic books.

108
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,293
All *** heroes.

109
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,533
- The Avengers.
- Yeah, you bet!

110
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,263
Gonna have a lot of holes in you.
That's for sure.

111
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,781
No.

112
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:19,253
Viola says that I'm healing.

113
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:20,460
That's right.

114
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,491
Hole today, gone tomorrow.

115
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:26,022
Hey you just lay back
and get some rest.

116
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,022
And I'll check on that
in a couple of hours.

117
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,223
Ok.

118
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,670
You stay cool, ok buddy?

119
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:47,400
No  more funny stuff now,
you hear? You rest.

120
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:48,721
Yes, Daddy.

121
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,541
Thanks Donny and Viola.

122
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,550
- I don't know how he's doing it.
- He's a kid.

123
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,053
Sneaking out is what kids do.

124
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,753
No, it's like he's a ghost.

125
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah, well, at least we know
he is not a ghost.

126
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,543
Robert, I'm having
a problem at work.

127
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,651
They're getting suspicious
about the blood.

128
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,120
I  don't think I can keep up
these deliveries.

129
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:25,821
You just start tapping me again.

130
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:27,271
We can't do that forever!

131
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:29,241
What about the guy at
the slaughter house?

132
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,333
- The cow blood was...
- No!

133
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,993
This stuff just made him sick.

134
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:35,093
Can we talk about
this professor Caylo guy?

135
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:36,273
I mean, he knows people,

136
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:37,921
people who might be able to,
I don't know, talk...

137
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:40,991
Come on! He's just some crazy
asshole movie freak.

138
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:43,152
He's gonna tell you my son is
some kind of monster.

139
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,723
Robert, he's not going
to be a boy forever.

140
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,221
You can not keep him locked up.

141
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,521
Out of school, 
away from the world!

142
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:53,022
He's going to find out
what he is soon enough.

143
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,110
And how are you 
going handle that?

144
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:59,098
I'm is father. 
I'll handle it.

145
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,501
Blade?

146
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,564
There's something in his mouth.

147
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,623
What's that about?

148
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,251
It's about me.

149
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,111
Does that hurt?

150
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,110
No.

151
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,963
Cover the other eye please.

152
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:04,752
Good.

153
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:09,850
Can you read that?

154
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,880
There's nothing on it.

155
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,330
Ultraviolet spectrum.

156
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,133
It's a glyph from 
one of the Houses.

157
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,161
M-mmh, Armaya.

158
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,611
You should know that.

159
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:28,810
I do.

160
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,602
Look I'm fine, can I go?

161
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:33,221
Your arm isn't fine 
but it's healing.

162
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,110
Wear these until
you don't need them anymore.

163
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,112
I heal from everything.

164
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:51,313
Except the silver stake
through the head.

165
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,212
Too much exposure to the sun.

166
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,091
Garlic, but I guess you know
all those rules by now.

167
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,192
Yeah.

168
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:02,463
What if I was sick before
I was turned?

169
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:06,820
I've seen cases of MS
cured over night.

170
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,423
Cripples walk again.

171
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:12,032
Mortality and immunity.

172
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:15,300
That's why some of the familiars
are so desperate to be turned.

173
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,810
I got to go!

174
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:21,320
Where to?

175
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,412
Chase, I haven't seen you
in a while.

176
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,241
Butterfly isn't ready to emerge yet.

177
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,860
How are you feeling Krista?

178
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:30,832
I'm thirsty.

179
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,781
You haven't been drinking enough.

180
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,600
You'd be healing faster if you had.

181
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,780
- Why don't we take you down
to the feeding room?
- No!

182
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:42,121
I need to get out.
I want a fresh kill.

183
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,800
Maybe I'll come with you.

184
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,243
We had fun, didn't we, last time?

185
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:48,831
Actually, Chase, I need you
for something else.

186
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,833
Happy hunting.

187
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,791
What do you have 
in store for me?

188
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,382
The details are there,
but in general terms.

189
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:14,723
Per our agreement.

190
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:18,822
The money we fronted Marcus to
produce the Aurora vaccine

191
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,403
it's been laundered through his
legitimate businesses.

192
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,900
Dispersed through the global network
of harvesters.

193
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,140
The money went nowhere else?

194
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,623
Not that I can see.

195
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:30,170
He's either a very good boy or
he's very good at covering his tracks.

196
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:33,690
No evidence of a side project.
Or something we didn't contract for?

197
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:36,802
Not so far. I still have
two investigators in the field.

198
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,241
How soon before we get Aurora?

199
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:42,993
Madam, I'm not sure
Aurora will ever be delivered.

200
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,570
Or if it is, it will make us
immune to our weaknesses.

201
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,922
And why is that?

202
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:51,542
Marcus has shut down all the facilities
except one outside Reno, Nevada.

203
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,970
Per our arrangement with Domic.

204
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:57,810
Aramayans are being delivered
but soon after their arrival
they're being destroyed.

205
00:13:57,968 --> 00:13:58,973
Prior to testing.

206
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,770
It seems so.

207
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,980
So Marcus is making theater.
Trying to delay us?

208
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,141
Or distract us.

209
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,242
From what?

210
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,272
From whatever Berlin was perhaps.

211
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:10,951
I would like more time
to investigate Marcus' women.

212
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:13,092
Chase? She's been with him 
for years.

213
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,630
No, the new girl. Krista.

214
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,721
Marcus killed her brother a few
days before she fell into Chthon.

215
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,101
Killing a sibbling is a common lure.

216
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,653
I've used it myself.

217
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,860
Still there's something off.

218
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,900
Something of influence
that I can't quite see.

219
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:30,891
Alright. Investigate.

220
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:34,012
Now, did you bring me
what I asked for?

221
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:48,482
Lovely.

222
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,860
Gonesse, you never disappoint.

223
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:59,293
Oh, look at you.

224
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,391
I could just eat you up!

225
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:06,292
Yes I could, yes I could.

226
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,002
I smell blood.

227
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,270
Who was he?

228
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:50,610
A friend.

229
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:10,373
Check.

230
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,522
Take a moment now.

231
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,351
I've been taken a lot of moments.

232
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,173
In this moment you'll see
the trap I leave for you.

233
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,242
I saw it.
You don't see my way out.

234
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:22,932
I got you beat.

235
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:25,921
What?

236
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,741
Do you see it?

237
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,193
You knew where I was going?

238
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:36,931
Because I was thinking like you.

239
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,802
What were you thinking like?

240
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,822
Shining knight on a powerful
horse riding to the rescue?

241
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,111
Learn to think like your opponent.

242
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:46,461
Or lose every time.

243
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:49,683
Checkmate!

244
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,572
I have to say you had worried.
For a while there.

245
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,300
Yeah, you bet I did.

246
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,833
E ric?

247
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,471
Mr. Brooks?

248
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:01,751
Mr. Taka please, 
just stay out of this.

249
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:04,880
Eric, get up. Get over here.

250
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,460
Eric?

251
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,350
Eric?

252
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:19,991
Dad?

253
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't feel so good.

254
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,511
It's uh...

255
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:27,642
It's gonna be ok, just uh, 
we'd better go home, come on, 
let's go.

256
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:28,951
I was playing the game.

257
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,691
There'll be other games here.

258
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:32,510
Let's go.

259
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,093
Shen?

260
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,041
I'm awake.

261
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,961
Find Viola.

262
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,150
I'm working on it.

263
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:05,362
Any guesses as to
who's done this?

264
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,090
A few.

265
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:10,512
You wanna share?

266
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:12,662
Not yet.

267
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:14,253
Now focus.

268
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,792
I am focused.

269
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,122
As focused as I've ever been.

270
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,360
Got something.

271
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:28,142
What?

272
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:34,120
Viola Watkins, 
changed her name in 1981.

273
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:35,430
To what?

274
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,942
I, uh... I don't know yet.

275
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:40,343
Why you think 
she changed her name?

276
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:46,003
I'm sure she had her reasons.

277
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,301
Dad?

278
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,142
Yeah, son.

279
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,811
Is something happening to me?

280
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,822
Yeah. There is.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,541
What  are you gonna do?

282
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,983
I'm gonna help you, I am.

283
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,861
We're gonna fix this together.
You and me.

284
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,143
Why?

285
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,613
Am I broken?

286
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:17,920
No.

287
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:19,821
Just special.

288
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,780
We just gotta be extra careful.

289
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,960
You said there was somebody.

290
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,902
Somebody who could help.

291
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,572
Yeah, I got a name.

292
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:53,903
It's a guy who's had experience
with this sort of things, but...

293
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:55,860
well, would you got
to know something...

294
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:56,940
What?

295
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,750
If you do this,

296
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,681
everything is gonna be different,
I mean, forever.

297
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,331
Alright.

298
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,583
What's his name?

299
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,512
Mr. Brooks?

300
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,473
Yeah.

301
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,251
I'm here about the boy.

302
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,090
I'm Abraham Whistler.

303
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:43,162
These would be the only things
that could stop him
if he was a true vampire.

304
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,471
But he ain't.

305
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:45,823
So what is he?

306
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,170
He's a Daywalker.

307
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:50,540
Born of a woman who was bitten
but not yet turned.

308
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:53,480
In time he will come to possess
all their strenghs

309
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,022
but none of their weaknesses.

310
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,451
When will that happen?

311
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:58,902
As soon as he starts 
feeling thirst.

312
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:01,860
Something neither he nor you
will be able to control.

313
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,211
What he is trying 
to tell you, Robert...

314
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,040
Your boy is unstoppable.

315
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,500
But he's not like the others.

316
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,892
And he's not even a Pure Blood.

317
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,651
And what the hell is a Pure Blood?

318
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,111
Born vampires.

319
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,840
They're the elite, the rules 
of the Houses,

320
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:17,092
everything, power, influence, evil...

321
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,023
Flows from them down to the ***.

322
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,981
***.

323
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:22,442
But your son is different.

324
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,320
It will be a force to be reckoned with.

325
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:25,640
So what do you want 
to do with him?

326
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,193
Enlist him in the fight.

327
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,912
They're giving us a weapon.

328
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:31,491
We can either use it or kill it.

329
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,802
So you want my son to help you.

330
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,512
Start some kind of war.

331
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,602
You're not listening to me.

332
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,200
War is already raging.

333
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:39,920
Your boy is at a crossroads.

334
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,341
Now he's tasted blood.

335
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,060
He's got to killer insticts now.

336
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:46,173
At this moment, we can decide
who he's gonna destroy.

337
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,243
Innocent people?

338
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,410
Or those responsible for his pain.

339
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,330
And yours.

340
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:05,342
What?

341
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:06,361
Eric?

342
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:21,443
Eric?

343
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:24,653
Eric???

344
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:40,012
Mr. Taka?

345
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:44,651
Mr. Taka?

346
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:51,632
Mr Taka?

347
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,540
Quit making so much noise, man!

348
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,131
Just open the safe.

349
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,183
Come on, come on!

350
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,533
Hurry up, old man.

351
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,511
I ain't gonna say it again.

352
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,570
Look, listen to me!

353
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,310
If this thing ain't 
open in 3 seconds,

354
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:49,220
my  boy here is gonna 
cut your heart out, alright?

355
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,631
Leave him alone!

356
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,291
Eric! No!

357
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,380
Pit, he's gonna look!

358
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:54,972
No!

359
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,120
What have you done?

360
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,102
Dad?

361
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,111
Oh my god...

362
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,021
Step aside, Mr. Brooks.

363
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:42,290
I'm ok, I'm ok.

364
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,713
You said me and you 
would get through this.

365
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,811
You lied.

366
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,461
You don't want me anymore.

367
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,103
Eric.

368
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:05,992
No Eric, stop!

369
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:18,541
Oh my god!

370
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,190
Oh Eric.

371
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:29,761
I'm gonna find her.

372
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,801
Can I ask you a question?

373
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:33,893
What?

374
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:37,792
Since you mom passed away,
was your dad and Viola...

375
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:38,963
Yes.

376
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:41,820
Maybe he's a target of all this.

377
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:43,723
He's not.

378
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:45,741
Uh, you're sure?

379
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:50,000
He's dead, I'm sure.

380
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,671
Got it.

381
00:26:01,717 --> 00:26:04,351
Names and addresses...

382
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,513
Place and employment.

383
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,880
Set the alarms.

384
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:16,791
Let's go.

385
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:20,763
What's her name?

386
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,273
Sally Porter.

387
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,821
Oh yeah sir,
do you have an appointment?

388
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,133
Yes.

389
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:29,880
She was going to give me
a tour of the facilities.

390
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,810
For my mother.

391
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:36,762
Oh yeah absolutely, 
you know give me one second 
and I'll just track her down for you.

392
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:41,171
I'm Sally Porter. 
How can I help you?

393
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:48,223
Hi.

394
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,730
How she's doing now?

395
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,030
She's doing ok.

396
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:55,391
She's been talking about you.
You have a birthday coming in?

397
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,020
No, I don't.

398
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:00,310
It's the morphine.

399
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,383
She thinks you're gonna be 6.

400
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:04,382
She's been shopping.

401
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,790
A music box.

402
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:07,353
Yeah.

403
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:09,660
I still have it.

404
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:15,050
Look, if you wanna go,
I can stay until, uh,

405
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,341
just before dawn and
if you can get another nurse.

406
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:22,391
Yeah, the day shift nurse,
I can get her here by 5.

407
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:23,473
Thanks.

408
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,661
Right, have a good night.

409
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:35,971
Can I, can I ask you how long?

410
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:40,390
Well, it's difficult to say.

411
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:47,712
It might be 2 days, I wouldn't say
more than a week. I'm sorry.

412
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:52,642
Thank you.

413
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:54,591
Thanks for everything.

414
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,373
Hey!

415
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,452
You're gonna be late.

416
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:10,780
You can't afford to be late.

417
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,373
Late for what?

418
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:14,102
For school.

419
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:18,420
You better go or
you're gonna miss the bus.

420
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:21,262
It's not a school day.

421
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:22,903
It isn't?

422
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,432
Well, then.

423
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,070
Why don't you sit here with me?

424
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,641
We can stay together for a while.

425
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,180
We can stay together forever
if you want.

426
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:38,012
Would you like that?

427
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:39,010
Honey...

428
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,752
that would be wonderful.

429
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,953
Sally Porter? Where is she?

430
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:10,730
She's giving a tour... 
Boy, that is some serious bling 
you got getting on there.

431
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:12,261
Where is she?

432
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,870
Down in rehab.

433
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,242
This isn't good.

434
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:16,951
Come on, Viola!

435
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:18,793
Come on back!

436
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:25,531
Eric?

437
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:30,230
Oh my god! Oh my god!

438
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:32,820
Are you alright?

439
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:36,022
No, no, he's killing everyone!

440
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:37,493
Do you know who it is?

441
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:41,651
- He had these...
- Steppin' Razor!

442
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:45,863
Do you know where he's going?

443
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,723
Home, your home.

444
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:53,220
He's going to kill your father.

445
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:59,140
Viola, my father's dead.

446
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:00,961
No, honey...

447
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:03,823
he's not.

448
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:08,841
He came back to town 2 months ago.

449
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,842
He's here because of you.

450
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,540
Stay with her.

451
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,072
I was wondering 
when you'd turned up.

452
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,933
Well, you'll stop wondering.

453
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:10,982
You killed him too?

454
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:15,442
I wouldn't had to if you'd gotten
your stories straight.

455
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:18,640
You said your daddy been shot,
you saw him die.

456
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,172
That's what I saw.

457
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:22,623
Uh, I think that's what you hoped.

458
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:26,343
The good thing is his girlfriend 
was a nurse.

459
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,181
Where is he?

460
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,490
Where is he?

461
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:34,201
Out to lunch, gone fishing.

462
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,850
That doesn't matter now, 
does it?

463
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:39,343
It's just you and me now.

464
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:41,670
Another second, it'll just be me.

465
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:42,650
Sure.

466
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,943
You know if you ask me...

467
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:47,983
he's been keeping an eye on you.

468
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:49,842
You hit Detroit.

469
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:53,113
And guess what? 
He shows up, he...

470
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,753
He kinda gets me.

471
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,810
Right here.

472
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:29,410
Just like old times, uh?

473
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:14,011
Hello, son.

474
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:20,322
They're dead, Flanigan, Taka...

475
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,902
He did that?

476
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:25,260
Viola?

477
00:36:28,176 --> 00:36:29,873
She's alive.

478
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:35,452
You saved her.

479
00:36:38,637 --> 00:36:39,453
Son?

480
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:43,260
There's some things we need
to talk about.

481
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,970
I'm not interested!

482
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,271
Eric, you got to know,

483
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:50,002
I was never ever gonna let you go!

484
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:53,900
You're not a monster, you're...
you're my son.

485
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,083
Not anymore.

486
00:36:57,688 --> 00:36:59,951
You couldn't accept me.

487
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:07,001
What could I do, tell me right now,
tell me, what the hell could I do?

488
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,442
Go to hell!

489
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:16,553
Eric...

490
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,550
That's not my name!

491
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:24,033
And you're not my father!

492
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,652
He was the vampire who
attacked my mother.

493
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:33,611
You just the guy who was
stuck holding a bag.

494
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:39,002
Please, please...

495
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,122
If you wanna live,

496
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:44,391
get as far away 
from me as possible!

497
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:28,171
Mr. Gerrard, 
I'd like to talk to you.

498
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,531
So when did my nephew's murder
become a federal case?

499
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:36,590
It hasn't.

500
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,573
I'm looking for your niece, Krista.

501
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:40,122
Why? What's she done?

502
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:41,392
Nothing that I know of.

503
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:42,792
You know where I can find her?

504
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:43,962
No, I don't.

505
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,932
I mean she's here in Detroit but uh,
I don't know where she's staying.

506
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:49,253
I called her mother's house,
I spoke to the nurse.

507
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,032
You did what?

508
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:54,051
- I understand the situation...
- Yeah, well maybe, you don't.

509
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,270
Krista has pretty much checked
out of this family.

510
00:38:56,478 --> 00:39:00,011
After his brother Zack was killed,
she kinda went off the rails.

511
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:02,082
She's hanging out with
a different crowd now.

512
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:03,760
What kind of crowd?

513
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:06,280
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?

514
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:08,173
No, who he is?

515
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:10,612
This town's answer to Donald Trump.

516
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:14,581
So what Krista is doing with him?

517
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,473
God only knows.

518
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:29,521
Oh, there's my sweetheart.

519
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:30,990
Hey, mom.

520
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:33,622
Do you know how much I love you?

521
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:36,223
I think so.

522
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,900
Mom, I don't want you to go.

523
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,281
I have to.

524
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,420
There's nothing more we can do.

525
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:46,873
Yes, there is.

526
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,312
What is that?

527
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:56,913
It's medecine.

528
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,822
But I can't give it to you yet.

529
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,951
We have to do something first.

530
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,341
What do we have to do?

531
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,193
It's gonna hurt.

532
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:11,562
But only for a minute.

533
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,311
And then what?

534
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:16,302
Then you won't feel anything.

535
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:19,723
And when you wake up,
I can give you this.

536
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:22,301
And we can be together forever.

537
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,423
That's nice.

538
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,410
Honey!

539
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:46,433
Honey, what are you doing?!

540
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:47,850
No!

541
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,933
I love you, mom!

542
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,373
Wasn't that touching?

543
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,571
- Give it back.
