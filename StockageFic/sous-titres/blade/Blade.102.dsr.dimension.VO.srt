1
00:00:00,597 --> 00:00:01,979
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,051
Where are you
shipping the bodies ?

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,081
Detroit.

4
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:07,329
Who is taking possession ?

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,010
Marcus Van Sciver.

6
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:11,795
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.

7
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,101
It's my brother.

8
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,337
Your brother got caught up
and somebody shot him, okay ?

9
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:22,387
Got in over his head, he pissed off
the wrong people just like every
single one of these guys.

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,961
The ash. It's found its
way onto the streets now.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,068
With the rest of the drugs.

12
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:32,278
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.

13
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,279
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city !

14
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:35,890
You know who killed my brother.

15
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,511
If we have a little patience,

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,170
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.

17
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,810
You look familiar.

18
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,881
Like someone I once knew.

19
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:48,163
It's ok to fight.
It's only natural.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,563
You turned her ?

21
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,250
It's my turn, my...

22
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:55,581
He's here.

23
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,803
Let me serve you.

24
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,910
It's been fun.

25
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,702
Fritz. That's enough.

26
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,462
You're my new favorite.

27
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,811
What did you do to me ?

28
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,961
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.

29
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,311
I can work with you.

30
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,220
Just like I worked
with your brother.

31
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,531
I got to get back.

32
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,280
What do you think ?

33
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:23,121
Could go either away.

34
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,002
No !!!

35
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,201
You better do it !

36
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:18,721
Wouldn't want any vampire running
around the countryside, now would we ?

37
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:22,853
- Please, god!
- God's off playing with himself.

38
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:32,560
Just you and me now, lunch meat.

39
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,981
Blade The Series - 102 - Death Goes On

40
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:18,230
If they figured out how to neutralize
garlic and silver, we are chit ???

41
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,193
Any sign of Krista ?

42
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,691
Nothing.

43
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,622
Good morning, sweetheart.

44
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:49,991
You must be hungry.

45
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,282
Mom ?

46
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,503
You can't be here.

47
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:56,010
I know, it's all so confusing.

48
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:59,241
But it will come down.
You just need to eat.

49
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,152
Get out !

50
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,352
Get out !

51
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:10,603
Get out !

52
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:11,700
Krista !

53
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,973
No !

54
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,980
No !!!

55
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh god...

56
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:35,402
Help ! Help ! Help !

57
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,831
Bloody newborns!

58
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,010
You had night terrors for ten years.

59
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,000
She won't last that long.

60
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:47,121
But she's gone
the first chance I get.

61
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,032
What's different ?

62
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:06,391
In this world.

63
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,991
What's new ?

64
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:12,081
Besides, you deciding to work with a
revenge-crazed vampire chick.

65
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:15,471
Ash.

66
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,720
Vampire ash.

67
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,572
Now you think Marcus is
juicing his own troups ?

68
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,161
I'll have to have Fritz
when I'll catch him.

69
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:25,553
You mean kill him.

70
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,840
Catch him.
Dissectr him.

71
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:32,711
Then kill him.

72
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,321
Does the silver burn?

73
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,040
No. It tickles.

74
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,712
I'm going to think
you like this.

75
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:58,972
Marcus.

76
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:00,953
- Pleasant flight?
- No complaints.

77
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,020
Heard you raised a few eyebrows.
It's a new girl ?

78
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,011
An essential addition to the fold.

79
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,741
And how is Prague ?

80
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:08,821
Missing you.

81
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,361
I'll never understand what
you see in this despicable city.

82
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,441
It has a special
place in my heart.

83
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,762
Hello, Winston.

84
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:24,780
Chase.

85
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,153
Fritz.

86
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,832
Trenched in blood as always.
And how are you ?

87
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,371
Feeling like a rock star ?

88
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,622
I'm feeling like a rematch.

89
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:36,751
Blade.

90
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,992
I see.
Is that wise?

91
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:42,653
No, not yet.

92
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:46,522
The  vaccine works. We should
take advantage of it.

93
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,980
Fritz.

94
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,572
Blade's interference must
make things difficult.

95
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,852
We're moving RND
to the West Coast.

96
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:57,122
Trucks carrying test subjects
should be arriving now.

97
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,261
Well, that will be welcomed
news for the board.

98
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:05,032
You're sure the
vaccine is stable ?

99
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,983
Yes, it's stable.

100
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,911
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.

101
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:26,473
I haven't done ash in two days.
It's so hard.

102
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:31,881
Ok.

103
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:37,672
You spend this on aspirine,
antiseptic and food for your baby.

104
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,820
Cherry ? Cherry ?

105
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,571
You're listening to me ?

106
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,863
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,973
Next meeting
tomorrow on noon,

108
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,342
you stay out of
the ash until there.

109
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:54,002
And keep your fingers
out of your mouth.

110
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:56,163
Thank you, Reverend.

111
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,263
Sorry for the interruption.

112
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:13,551
The  church let you back in ?

113
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:16,071
They call me Reverend
out of respect.

114
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:18,850
You don't have to be
ordained to have a calling.

115
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,661
As you already know.

116
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,623
Having much success?

117
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,513
Some.

118
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:28,172
Vampire  ash ain't like
the usual junk.

119
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,561
best stuff hooks you bone deep.

120
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:34,812
I was wondering
if you'd ever return.

121
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:39,382
And now I can start worrying that
my recovering ashes are gonna get
caught up in your crossfire.

122
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,123
Your ashes ?

123
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:45,122
All they need is a little help and
I offer 'em empathy, support, love.

124
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:46,872
You should try it sometimes.

125
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:48,250
Back to the question.

126
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,661
There's some vampire
moving in on the ash trade.

127
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,143
Wouldn't surprise me.
Feeding off our own.

128
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,581
But you've heard
nothing concrete ?

129
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,640
Experiments.

130
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:03,453
On vampires, might be
ash related, might not.

131
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,532
How will I find out ?

132
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,543
You know an ash dealer named Cain ?

133
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:10,572
Not yet.

134
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,642
So maybe Cain will give
you some answers.

135
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,470
How do I find Cain ?

136
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:17,610
Try to ask one of
his customers.

137
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,893
But watch yourself.

138
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:24,041
If they're amped up on vampires dope,
you might find yourself in some serious shit.

139
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:39,202
Where's Cain ?

140
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,452
How much ash did you do?

141
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:50,922
All of it.

142
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,163
Like I've got
time for this.

143
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,853
I hear you're having
a difficult time.

144
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,088
Yeah, death's a bitch.

145
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,318
You're not dead, Krista.

146
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:11,569
My life is over.

147
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,813
What I was,
where I was going.

148
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,072
All that's gone.

149
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:21,762
Your life is
just beginning.

150
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,572
My life is what ?

151
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,632
Some sort of
a prisonner ?

152
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,400
My door's locked.

153
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,713
It's just a precaution.

154
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,623
Newborns sometimes snap.

155
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:36,242
It's only until your mind and body
reconcile with the metabolic changes.

156
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,430
Here I was thinking it was
because nobody trusted me.

157
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:41,730
Perhaps I haven't given
you the proper respect.

158
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,472
Yeah, throwing me off the
building was a little rude.

159
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,540
Yeah, you were trying to
kill me, let's not forget.

160
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,183
I haven't.

161
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,063
You will.

162
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,153
We should talk.

163
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,911
Aren't we ?

164
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:07,730
I mean over dinner.

165
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,221
I'll collect you
in one hour.

166
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,520
And what's
on the menu ?

167
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,252
Leftovers.

168
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,303
Courtesy of
Detective Boone.

169
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,620
We're not all monsters, Krista.

170
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:26,393
This will get easier.
I promise.

171
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:37,173
- Yes.
- This complicates things ?

172
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,461
Immeasurably.

173
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:39,823
Is Chase in on the joke ?

174
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:40,732
No.

175
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,060
Only the doctor.

176
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,493
And he's more surprised then I am.

177
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,242
It's all I can do to
keep on track.

178
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:50,900
Maybe this is fate trying
to tell you something.

179
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,200
Well, there is a bigger
picture Winston, much bigger.

180
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,330
Yes.

181
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,223
Let's hope the board never sees it.

182
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,031
I'll leave that up to you.

183
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:02,393
Safe journey.

184
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,610
And to you, my friend.

185
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,461
We're making a detour.

186
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,663
Take me to Meanus.

187
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:14,682
Yes, sir.

188
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,010
Who's this ?

189
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,181
Asher.

190
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,453
Is he high ?

191
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,053
Oh, yeah.

192
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,731
Son of a bitch.

193
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:55,713
One more time,
where's Cain ?

194
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,183
Go to hell !

195
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,493
Who is Cain ?

196
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,102
A lead that Carlyle gave me.

197
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:09,540
What about Fritz ?

198
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,023
Fine.

199
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:15,392
Then I won't tell you that Marcus
made reservation for two at Lotus.

200
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:16,693
How did you find out ?

201
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:19,011
Hey, it's what you
don't pay me for.

202
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,812
Is he with Krista ?

203
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,722
That, I can't tell you.

204
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:26,260
But it is his usual table.
From what I hear, a nice one.

205
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,303
Keep your fingers
away from him.

206
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,420
Anything here
tempt your palate ?

207
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,092
What are they tranqued with ?

208
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:40,681
You won't taste it.

209
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,370
It's a new herbal recipe.

210
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,532
Too many complaints with
the other stuff.

211
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,482
Mmh,  good.

212
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:55,131
But I was hoping for something
a little more cornfed.

213
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:59,571
It's not everyday I get to
sample American cuisine.

214
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,882
You're in luck.

215
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:04,222
I've just took possession of an honor
student from Illinois out on vacation.

216
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,280
Plucked from a Cancun beach.

217
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,603
Blonde, big boned.

218
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,453
Carpet matches drapes?

219
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:12,072
Hardwood floor.

220
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,740
Kids!

221
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,010
Don't be so surprised.

222
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:32,070
- I just... wasn't expecting...
- Food ?

223
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,221
Thank you.

224
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:39,172
Nutrionally, its effect are negligeable.
But it is pleasurable nonetheless.

225
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,930
You have noticed
your senses are hightened.

226
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,061
Is that what we're
living for now ?

227
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,360
Pleasure ?

228
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,243
Some of us.

229
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:53,402
As in most families, there are the
breadwinners and the freeloaders.

230
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:54,890
What are we ?

231
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,731
If I'm successful,

232
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,083
the House of Chthon is going to be
something different entirely.

233
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,392
What's that ?

234
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:03,923
Eternal.

235
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,820
You were thinking we are already ?

236
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,182
Apart from silver and
garlic we'll live forever ?

237
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,420
No.

238
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:18,583
Granted our years on this earth
are generous. But like most lives.

239
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,520
We're subjects to nature
occasional calling.

240
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,702
And your experiments
in the slaughterhouse ?

241
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:27,271
I'm assuring we are not
subject to anything.

242
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,621
Least of all nature.

243
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,680
- What about...
- Blade ?

244
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,653
Ashers ?

245
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,563
You know about them.

246
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,613
I know that there's a drug
trade based on dead vampires.

247
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,192
I'd imagine that's
a problem for you.

248
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,322
Increasingly.

249
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,220
Well, maybe one day
they'll take out Blade.

250
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:54,133
Blade isn't a vampire.
He's a Daywalker.

251
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:58,190
half human. And he is the bane
of the Twelve Houses.

252
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:01,000
Twelve Houses ?

253
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:02,652
Ah yes.

254
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,990
Your new family
is quite extended.

255
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,833
Is everyone here ?

256
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:12,952
No.

257
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:14,750
Just us.

258
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,042
You alright ?

259
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:22,473
- I don't think so.
- Krista !

260
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,370
It's the serum.

261
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,172
Food will make you sick.

262
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,601
That's nice to know.

263
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,450
- Marcus is up there.
- I know.

264
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:56,442
I need information
on Fritz.

265
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:58,143
Like what ?

266
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:00,453
He is not your average vampire.

267
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,683
Find out what you can.

268
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,081
How he did it.
Hurry.

269
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,202
Krista ?

270
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,572
Feeling better ?

271
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:34,373
Next stop ?

272
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,260
Hell !

273
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,120
Yo Cain.

274
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,793
Product's in the back.

275
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,642
He just fed so step
on it a few times.

276
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,121
How many times ?

277
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,253
23.

278
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:51,273
Just make it last.
Dipshit.

279
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,061
You're keeping the car ?

280
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,730
Crash it.

281
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:11,792
Is there a problem ?

282
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:13,690
Winston missed
his flight.

283
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,452
We can't trace the driver.

284
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,640
GPS ?

285
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,370
The signal was
terminated.

286
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,300
But we did get
a final fix.

287
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:21,332
Where ?

288
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,891
M eanus.

289
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,402
You're driving.

290
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,081
You are staying here.

291
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:27,603
I don't think that's
a good idea.

292
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,640
You said what?

293
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,021
If Blade took Winston...

294
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,630
In all likelyhood, you're
Blade number one target.

295
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:39,992
If you cross paths,

296
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:41,111
either you'll kill him,

297
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:42,421
he'll kill you

298
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:45,022
or quite possibly he'll take
you down and carve you up

299
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:49,001
thereby discovering and ruining
all of our considerable efforts.

300
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:53,281
I'm not going
to risk that.

301
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:54,590
Neither should you.

302
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:56,741
Is that quiet clear ?

303
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:57,823
Yeah.

304
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,082
Can I get something to drink now ?

305
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:12,913
You haven't told
where Cain is.

306
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:16,051
I don't know anything.
Swear to god !

307
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,812
You know.

308
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,323
Please, can I
get some blood ?

309
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,663
It'll chew off my gut.

310
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:35,001
How about an
appetizer ?

311
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,793
What happens now ?

312
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:45,081
He wakes up in a ditch and
leads me to Cain.

313
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:46,971
That's positive
thinking ?

314
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,402
He's an addict.
I'm a threat.

315
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,470
He needs to protect
his source.

316
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:55,191
Something I know
a little about.

317
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,921
We found him maybe 30
minutes after Winston left.

318
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,292
Look, Blade's in town, right ?

319
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,013
Maybe Blade got him.

320
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,740
Blade got Winston.

321
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,551
The man is a scurge.

322
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,480
You really should do
something about it.

323
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,342
This wasn't Blade.

324
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:15,292
Blade wouldn't have just
stopped Winston.

325
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:22,552
He would have come in here, slaughtered
you and then freed the poor soldiers
celled to people like us.

326
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,822
Where can Chase find a towel?

327
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:28,470
There's a closet
in there.

328
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,823
So,

329
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,021
how was your
asher problem ?

330
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:36,342
It's not so bad.

331
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:39,693
Ok.

332
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:43,372
Ok, so we've had some
little trouble lately.

333
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,800
Please, Marcus,
don't shut me down.

334
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,912
Look, I'm upgrading security.

335
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:54,763
I've a vested interest in keeping
my clientele as safe as possible.

336
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:59,361
And how many of your clients
have you lost so far ?

337
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:02,511
This month, 4...

338
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:05,820
5 if you want to count Winston.

339
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,210
If I must ?

340
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,501
What's with the towel ?

341
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,781
He's shuting you down.

342
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:37,612
That's a private party ?

343
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:38,750
Yeah.

344
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,251
Get out !

345
00:26:42,696 --> 00:26:45,791
I thought you were
Marcus' right hand man.

346
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,350
Seems strange him
not letting you...

347
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:51,781
do what you do.

348
00:26:51,996 --> 00:26:53,670
He has his reasons.

349
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,350
Which you don't
agree with.

350
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:58,993
Not sure I do either.

351
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,380
Things change.

352
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:01,790
Take you.

353
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,462
One day you're
home from Iraq.

354
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:09,340
The next thing you're
the boss' new plaything.

355
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:12,082
You're walking around,
asking questions.

356
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:13,792
I'm asking you.

357
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:15,150
What happened ?

358
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:18,143
I don't get why Blade
would wanna carve you up.

359
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,552
What's he gonna learn ?

360
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:24,073
Nothing.
He'll be dead.

361
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,113
And I'll be the
one to kill him.

362
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,113
In broad daylight.

363
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:30,621
But that's not possible.

364
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,381
Like I said, things change.

365
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:36,143
One day you're scared
shitless of a pizza topping.

366
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:40,470
And the silver fillings
of some old man's teeth.

367
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:44,262
Of the dawn's early
goddamn light.

368
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,080
The sun doesn't
matter anymore.

369
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,611
Because you're different.

370
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:52,611
Because you believed
in something.

371
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,251
You helped make some
things happen.

372
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:56,652
What happened ?

373
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,812
Project Aurora.

374
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,143
Five years and
millions of dollars.

375
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:04,792
And a thousand dead
vampires later.

376
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:06,633
You get me...

377
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,192
The vaccines were a success,

378
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:10,893
and where am I ?

379
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:15,210
In the basement,
beating meat.

380
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,282
Sorry.

381
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:37,403
Honey, it's okay.

382
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:43,693
It will be over soon,
I promise.

383
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,551
Just need to
talk about this.

384
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:53,902
I'm sorry I don't know. I swear to
god, I don't know anything.

385
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:59,411
We know you use it.
That you use us.

386
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:06,372
That your blood smells so bad that
it makes me want to drown you in it.

387
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:10,212
I'll quit snorting ash,
I will I promise.

388
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:14,022
I've got a baby.

389
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,941
I've  got a little
boy please.

390
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,373
Does his blood reak too ?

391
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:23,501
No, no, no, no,
please, no !

392
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:32,041
You tell me you took my friend
Winston and your boy grows
safe and sound.

393
00:29:32,486 --> 00:29:37,610
Cross my barely
beating hearts.

394
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:45,142
Give me a name or I'll eat
him in front of you.

395
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,450
I think we must assume
that Winston is gone.

396
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,720
Yes, Charlotte, yes.

397
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,582
I'm taking care
of that problem.

398
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:59,703
Yes, but as I outlined in the proposal,
Blade's involvement is inevitable.

399
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,981
I'm just surprised
you're taking this...

400
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,973
Yes, Charlotte, absolutely.

401
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,890
Everything will be handled.

402
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,902
All assets will be secured.

403
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,753
They want proof of
Aurora's success.

404
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:14,891
I'm right here.

405
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,292
But there're not willing to
send another evaluator.

406
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:19,712
They want you in Prague.

407
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,982
And you want me as far
away from Blade as possible.

408
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,930
I know you're eager to
finish what you started.

409
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,843
But Blade must wait.

410
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:33,341
I'm beholden from those above me,
and they demand caution.

411
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:39,480
We have done an amazing thing but
no one must know how we did it.

412
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,230
Fritz ?

413
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:49,791
Fritz tells me you caught
him in a weak moment.

414
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,742
Aurora ?

415
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,922
I want it.

416
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,592
You want ?

417
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,323
We should all have it.

418
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,241
If it's everything that
Fritz said it is.

419
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,511
Fritz has no idea what it is.
And neither do you.

420
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:10,500
And you will not discuss it
anymore especially with Fritz.

421
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,642
What did you do to him ?

422
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,932
He's going away tonight.
Some place safe.

423
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:15,960
Marcus.

424
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:18,671
The girl,

425
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:21,403
she knew who took Winston.
- Are you certain ?

426
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,582
Dead. His name is Cain.

427
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:27,683
He deals in ash.

428
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,552
We hit him.

429
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:32,362
We hit the largest
ash lab in Detroit.

430
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,622
I can have a red
team ready in one hour.

431
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:35,870
Good.

432
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:41,120
Let's take the war hero.

433
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:44,690
I'm sure you'll find it
invigorating.

434
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:49,501
That's a splendid idea.

435
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:55,732
Krista.

436
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:57,333
Keep your head down.

437
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,631
Where are you going?

438
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,312
A warehouse in West Mile.

439
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,161
Where you ate the raver ?

440
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:05,001
Stop with me.

441
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,753
You best get packed.

442
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,470
See you in a few days.

443
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,053
Kill everything.

444
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:19,120
Burn it to the ground.

445
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,713
Hey !

446
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:35,632
Let me in.

447
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,310
Hey, let me in !

448
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:43,711
I got to see Cain,
I got to warn him.

449
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,700
Shit's coming down.

450
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,861
Blade.

451
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,913
I didn't tell him anything.

452
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,061
You didn't have to.

453
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,750
Stupid son a bitch !

454
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,423
Man, I did you a favor.

455
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:21,691
Thanks for that.

456
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:24,712
Give me the belt.

457
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,351
Guys, down there.

458
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,662
Stay with me.

459
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:45,241
This way !

460
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:54,913
We got movement on
the north side.

461
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:56,442
Say again.

462
00:33:56,966 --> 00:34:00,142
Repeat, movement inbound.

463
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,952
Get a fix and pin it down.

464
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,530
We'll do. I'll investigate
and report back.

465
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,412
Let's get going.

466
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:14,761
Sorry, sir.

467
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:16,991
Just listening to
the assault feed.

468
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,823
- Seems like Chase's got her hands full.
- What's happening ?

469
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:23,532
- Not sure, something inbound.
- Really?

470
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,632
Go !

471
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,412
They're gone.

472
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,761
Something over here !

473
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,572
Where's Cain ?

474
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,180
Chase ?

475
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,033
Shut up.

476
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:44,800
God, don't !

477
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:16,411
I can't move my leg.

478
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:36,362
So much for the frying pan.

479
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:39,831
Welcome to the fire.

480
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:53,080
Fritz !

481
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,800
Stop, Fritz !

482
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:15,793
Let's finish this !

483
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:29,591
Krista, don't let
him take Fritz !

484
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:40,833
Krista, kill him !
Do it now !

485
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,633
You think she's gone native?

486
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:56,112
No.

487
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:01,690
She killed the golden goose.
Fritz was the key.

488
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:03,792
She did what
she had to do.

489
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,372
She's the key.

490
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:07,020
She's the way in.

491
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:10,572
And what about Cain ?

492
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:13,491
Another day.

493
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:15,103
Hey ?

494
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,651
Wake up !

495
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:43,402
Dispatcher, I need a
coroner on county 319,

496
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:46,673
2 miles east of the Boxton overpass
overpassed and a tow truck.

497
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,541
Better tell the crime lab to.

498
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:50,050
What you got ?

499
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:53,113
Body under a blanket
in a silver Dodge.

500
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:59,602
South Dakota plate 3 6 Adam 4 7 9 current.

501
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,122
Body appears male.

502
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,893
No obvious signs of foul play.

503
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,180
Hardware's rolling.

504
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:05,530
ETA in 15 minutes.

505
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:07,392
Thanks, Dany.

506
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:18,150
Somebody in there ?

507
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,590
I'm a state trooper. I'm armed.

508
00:42:21,878 --> 00:42:23,881
Come out hands first.

509
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:33,911
Dispatch, I need
an ambulance ASAP.

510
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,603
Did you say an ambulance ?

511
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:36,821
Come back.

512
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:39,141
Too late for that, sweetheart.

513
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:54,171
Next time on Blade.

514
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,993
I think we waked up
the neighboors.

515
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:01,921
Ready to answer
my question ?

516
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:03,193
I need you to
make a delivery.

517
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:04,960
Do I need to know
what it's in the bag ?

518
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:06,391
Do you ?

519
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:08,152
You killing vampires ?

520
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:09,670
Scum from the House of Armaya.

521
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:11,832
You ???

522
00:43:15,188 --> 00:43:17,252
Jesus Christ !
