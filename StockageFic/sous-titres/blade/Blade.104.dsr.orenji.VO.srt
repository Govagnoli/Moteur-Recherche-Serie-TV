1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,883
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:12,891
He was born a different
kind of vampire.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,992
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,737
Except of the thirst.

5
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:20,666
He lives off a synthetic serum.

6
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:24,216
- Did Marcus change you?
- My husband did.

7
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,427
And lived to regret it.

8
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:34,977
Now Krista, it's time
for your first kill.

9
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:38,441
Dispatch, I need
an ambulance ASAP.

10
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:39,990
Did you say an ambulance ?

11
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,138
A little late for that, sweetheart.

12
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:47,713
The print belongs to
a fellow out of Detroit.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,440
Brian Boone. 510. 190 pounds.

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,161
Oh, and he just happens to be
one of Detroit's finest.

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,403
He's a cop?

16
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:56,261
I'm out here
treating the symptom

17
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:59,200
and you're going after the
disease, no doubt about it.

18
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,561
What's your point?

19
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:02,130
There might be
another approach.

20
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:04,862
Not for me.

21
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,651
What did they give to Fritz
to make him immune?

22
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,600
- It's called Aurora.
- What is?

23
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:11,593
Some kind of vaccine.
Marcus made it.

24
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,211
No. Someone made it for him.

25
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,262
Everything's come back.

26
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,441
Amnosynthesis tested
negative for AFPE.

27
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:36,881
No blood disorders,
no neurotube defects,

28
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:38,740
and no abnormalities
on the sonogram.

29
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:40,092
So our baby's fine?

30
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:41,773
He's perfectly normal.

31
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,193
Doctor Vonner?

32
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,511
Where is the doctor?

33
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,440
Oh my god!

34
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:04,212
Oh my god!

35
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,740
There's a dead-end.

36
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:16,382
I suggest you get his
files and get out of there.

37
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,850
No time for that.

38
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,863
Send me his home address.

39
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:25,921
Marcus got his people
in and out right now.

40
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,752
So you think this baby
doctor thing was just for fun?

41
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,052
There's a reason Marcus
recruited him for Aurora.

42
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:38,192
Hm, if you believe this guy's press.

43
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,081
He was a miracle worker.

44
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,322
He looks like he worked
one for Marcus.

45
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,781
Every vampire needs a
familiar with skills.

46
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah, I make the weapons.

47
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,803
And I use them.
That's the arrangement.

48
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,113
No shit!

49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,361
I thought we were dating.

50
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,532
Blade?

51
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,302
Blade?

52
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,331
Nailed is ass.

53
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,242
Damn straight.

54
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:35,203
Blade The Series - 104 - Bloodlines

55
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:14,853
Chain him up.

56
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,013
Zack was here.

57
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:33,501
Can I get you anything else?

58
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:34,872
No, I'm done.

59
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,763
All right, you can pay at
the register when you're done.

60
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:46,303
You play soccer?

61
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:13,843
Good evening.

62
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,501
- Hey!
- Hey!

63
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:49,452
Well...

64
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:51,612
That is a dead-end.

65
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,851
Every vampire needs a
familiar with skills.

66
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:04,002
Ah, I make the weapons,

67
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,883
and I use them,
that's the arrangement.

68
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:11,632
Bullshit, I thought
we were dating.

69
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,190
Little man.

70
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:19,992
*** this.

71
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,693
Damn straight.

72
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,430
We have Aurora.

73
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,161
We know it works.

74
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:41,661
You were going to kill
Doctor Vonner anyway.

75
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,462
Blade just saved you the trouble.

76
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,733
At the moment, I have
different troubles.

77
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,790
Those shipments were
your responsability.

78
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,832
And so is Boone,
I'll take care of him.

79
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,530
No.

80
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,210
You and Krista will together.

81
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,391
I don't need her!

82
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,053
Boone is Krista's first turn.

83
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:01,470
There's a connection between
them that can be exploited.

84
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,843
Marcus... not the House of Lychan.

85
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:09,111
The shortest distance between
Boone and Krista is through
theit shared experience.

86
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,650
I'll find Boone another way.

87
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,722
- He left a trail...
- That ends in the middle of Kansas!

88
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,931
I don't have time to humor
your sordid past!

89
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,682
Find Boone and use Krista!

90
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,080
What?

91
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,091
Charlotte's calling.

92
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,783
Tell her we'll find Boone.

93
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,633
I'm gonna tell her
you already have.

94
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:45,921
Hey!

95
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:53,623
Blade?

96
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,060
Blade?

97
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:58,221
Carlyle.

98
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,231
I'm here to negociate for
your release. You're okay?

99
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:05,983
Shut up and start negociating!

100
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,083
Things need killing.

101
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:14,932
Well, that's just it.

102
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm, I'm negotiating with you.

103
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,862
I'm with them, this was my idea.

104
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:24,340
Then I'll be killing you too!

105
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:29,971
Little help?

106
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:57,892
Heard you halfway down the hall.

107
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,730
Gained a little weight?

108
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,891
Time to clean up your mess.

109
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:05,593
Boone...

110
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:09,000
He's loose and
complicating matters.

111
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,143
That's impossible.

112
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,543
I killed him.

113
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,901
You turned him.

114
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,581
To kill him, you'd
have to drain him.

115
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,542
Being an amateur, you didn't.

116
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,590
Now you're gonna see how
the other half lives.

117
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,850
- Other half of what?
- Us.

118
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:23,342
Pack a bag.

119
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,203
- We're flying to Oregon.
- What's in Oregon?

120
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,301
The House of Lychan.

121
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,332
And they know where Boone is?

122
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,731
No, you do.

123
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,382
Lychan's just
going to take it out.

124
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,373
Wait a minute.

125
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,773
You mind telling me what
I'm walking into?

126
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:50,052
Sweetheart, walking in
is not a problem.

127
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,711
I bet you wonder why you're here.

128
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,570
I told you there was another
way to fight the war.

129
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,500
You weren't always the man you are now.

130
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:23,570
You still need a little redemption.

131
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,251
With the help of
a few old friends.

132
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,110
Just go ahead.

133
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:29,722
Say hello.

134
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,362
Remember him?

135
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,282
Remember your childhood.

136
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:47,613
Little man.

137
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,863
Steppin' Razor.

138
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,093
It's been a while.

139
00:11:56,326 --> 00:12:00,611
What you're going by now little man: Blade.

140
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:09,361
You got a deep rep,
you're big, bro!

141
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,510
Not too big though.

142
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,930
Welcome home, little man.

143
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,292
Blade?

144
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:37,678
Hello?

145
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,213
Blade's gone.

146
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,020
Taken off the street by
four masked vampires.

147
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,190
- Now what would you know about that?
- Shen...

148
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:58,230
Where is he?

149
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,312
- Marcus didn't do it.
- Bullshit.

150
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,711
You come here to
finish things off?

151
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,463
You don't believe me?

152
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,873
Shoot.

153
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:09,861
What are you doing here?

154
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:11,192
Boone's alive.

155
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,930
- The cop?
- He is turned.

156
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:15,073
No shit. That's what
happen when a vampire...

157
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,933
Shut up, and get the
gun out of my face!

158
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:24,263
Boone's going around
killing people and Chase

159
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:27,210
and I have been ordered
to eliminate him.

160
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:31,901
Shen?

161
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,300
I don't know what
happened to Blade.

162
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,653
Ok.

163
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,600
I got to torch
this place and go.

164
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:41,591
Wait a minute.

165
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:42,940
You're leaving?

166
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:44,571
That's the protocol.

167
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,063
What happens to me?

168
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,393
We all got problems.

169
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:56,262
Shen, what do you know about
the House of Lychan?

170
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,262
Lychan vampires have sworn off
killing, they drink clone blood.

171
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:02,980
I'm going there to find Boone.

172
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,201
He's there?

173
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:05,432
No.

174
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,132
Then why are you...

175
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:08,720
Oh, well...

176
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,343
What?

177
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:13,853
You can't go Krista.
They have this ritual.

178
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:17,620
You've ever heard sweat lodge the
native American thing where you see visions?

179
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,220
What, they want me to see Boone?

180
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:21,500
That's the idea,
except there's no sweat.

181
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,252
Just lots of blood.

182
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:25,833
How much blood?

183
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,952
You can't do it.

184
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:32,172
If it will stop Boone...
I'm doing it.

185
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:33,613
Hey!

186
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:35,523
Good luck with Blade.

187
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,332
I've got serum.

188
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:47,281
You're gonna need more.

189
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,881
And after it's done,

190
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:00,552
inject it, all of it.

191
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,683
First chance you get.

192
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,683
Ok, thanks.

193
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,493
Good luck to you too.

194
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:15,892
Jesus!

195
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:16,950
Blade? Blade???

196
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,350
*** this.

197
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,850
Damn straight.

198
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,491
What is that?

199
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,170
It's the last transmission.

200
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:25,782
Rewind it.

201
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,883
I can hear them.

202
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,453
It's static.

203
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,362
Shen, I can hear them.

204
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,720
I thought we were dating.

205
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,372
- It's taken off of context.
- Shh.

206
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,722
Blade? Blade???

207
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,221
*** this.

208
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,512
Damn straight.

209
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:50,022
What?

210
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:52,161
They're still talking.
Play it again.

211
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,161
He ain't so bad.

212
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,001
He used to be.

213
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:10,252
But he's no
Bad Blood anymore.

214
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,413
Bad Blood?

215
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,420
Bad Blood...

216
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:40,802
I guess you're pretty
thristy by now.

217
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,763
Probably want to get back
on that serum of yours.

218
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,623
Yeah, I know about that.

219
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,502
And I know what you
did on the streets.

220
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,430
After your father left.

221
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:53,753
Before Whistler found you,
such bad things to these poor boys.

222
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,421
They're weren't
exactly boyscouts.

223
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,493
But they took you
in off the streets.

224
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:01,303
And you took their souls
for it, you took their lives.

225
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,723
Cue the violins.

226
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:11,120
Because they were been turned by you,
they've been rejected by every House.

227
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:15,593
Forced to live on their own, to do
horrible things just to survive.

228
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,140
I can fix them.

229
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:21,412
I've gotten through to them.

230
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,092
They want stop feeding,
stop killing.

231
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,150
They just need your
serum to do it.

232
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,130
They don't want my serum.

233
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,353
They want me,

234
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,372
and now that they've got me,

235
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,691
you're nothing but their next meal.

236
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,623
Your real bleeding heart here...

237
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:01,073
I can't believe how much
you've changed little man.

238
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,121
I wish that I could tell
you that it's not too late

239
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,483
That you could come back.

240
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,810
Be a brother again.

241
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,942
But we got plans we need to execute.

242
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:20,410
Let me guess...

243
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,502
Comfort plan.

244
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:25,963
Yeah.

245
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,303
You're gonna help us, little man.

246
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,683
You're gonna change our life.

247
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,432
You're Agent Collins?

248
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,683
You're Detective Gibbs?

249
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:58,872
I'm, you're ready?

250
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,130
Yep.

251
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,270
How long were you
and Boone partners?

252
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,621
About two years.

253
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:08,951
The last six months, he was more
of a solo act.

254
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:10,871
Took a lot of personal time.

255
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,180
Any idea why?

256
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:13,750
We stopped talking,

257
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:17,112
I mean about anything other than
the number of girls he was banging.

258
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:19,403
Pretty long list
if you believe the stories.

259
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:20,791
Did you?

260
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,503
There was a lot of detail.

261
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,710
Any talk of
personal problems,

262
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,512
where he might have gone
if things got bad?

263
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,371
Like a beach in Bahi or something? No.

264
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:35,341
He talked about the future a lot,
what he'd like to live in a 100 years from now.

265
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:36,800
What like science-fiction?

266
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:40,180
No, not really, more like,
like standard vacation.

267
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,670
Yeah, I didn't get it either.

268
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:48,272
- You need a key?
- You got one?

269
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,483
He speaks German?

270
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:07,453
The only thing I ever saw him read
was a menu and he couldn't pronounce half of it.

271
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:11,922
You recognize this?

272
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,240
What's Armaya?

273
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,303
Look at you.

274
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:30,972
Playing vampire cop.

275
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:35,543
You won't think I'm playing
when I turn your ass up in smoke!

276
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:36,690
Yeah.

277
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,432
There's that look.

278
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:43,530
Are you trying to tell me you're
going to kill me?

279
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:49,661
Who taught you that look?

280
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:54,762
You were a kid,
lost and scared!

281
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,660
No place for nobody.

282
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,011
A scrowny ass, little blood sucker.

283
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,501
You fed, you killed.

284
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,963
Some you turned.

285
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,231
Remember that night
you turned us?

286
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,430
Bolt was joining us.

287
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:12,651
I was giving him his tats.

288
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:18,281
I was just wiping the fresh blood off the back of neck. You must have tasted in the air.

289
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,861
That's what brought you to us.

290
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,490
Back when we were just kids.

291
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:22,900
I was just a kid too!

292
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,432
No!

293
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,740
That night you were a killer.

294
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,491
You walk right into
this place here.

295
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:33,453
All shaking and crying
and saying you were hungry.

296
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:36,413
We offered you shelter and food.

297
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:39,031
We reached out to help you.

298
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,532
You bit us for it.

299
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,423
You turned us into addicts.

300
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,913
Gave us the thirst.

301
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,642
That pain so deep inside
that it never goes away.

302
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:54,553
Oh, yeah, you got the thirst
right now, don't you?

303
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,580
That's what you gave us.

304
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,552
But we ran with it.

305
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:01,393
And you ran with us.

306
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,583
Hell.

307
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:09,510
You were proud to wear our mark
and live under our protection.

308
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,513
But you were smaller
than the others.

309
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,713
Different.

310
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:14,671
A brother.

311
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,583
I would have done anything for you, Little Man.

312
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:21,420
And I did.

313
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:24,290
I killed a lot of people.

314
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:27,322
You were killing way before
I even met you.

315
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:30,132
And that's what will
be when this is over.

316
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,210
That's how we survive.

317
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,441
Damn!

318
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:39,912
You really don't know what you
did to us after you left.

319
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:44,033
You remember that night
Whistler came knocking ?

320
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:46,163
That old man killed Brick,

321
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:48,973
and cut off before
he drag you away.

322
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,882
We told he'd ash
your sorry ass!

323
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,403
About a decade later,

324
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:03,081
we started to hear rumors about
this vampire killer named Blade.

325
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:04,982
Big bad scary mother.

326
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:07,642
Tatoos crawling up the
back of his neck.

327
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,022
Sunlight don't burn him.

328
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:13,461
Guess Whistler gave you
a different thirst,

329
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:17,100
a thirst for killing us addicts.

330
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:20,741
Addicts that you turned
us too.

331
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,602
When you got your new rep,

332
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,422
as a daywalker,

333
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:28,692
all the Houses started ashing
every vampire you ever turned.

334
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,953
Every one that comes from your blood.

335
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:34,933
Bad Bloods had go underground.

336
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,650
Like goddamn rats!

337
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,560
While you traveled all over the world.

338
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,593
But you're home now.

339
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,293
Hell!

340
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,193
You even still
dress like a Bad Blood.

341
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:49,602
With the coat, the glasses.

342
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:51,713
You still got our mark.

343
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:55,080
But it wasn't you.

344
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,902
Rep says, uh,

345
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:02,761
without your serum,
you can't see straight.

346
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:05,801
Every minutes that goes pass,
you're more like us.

347
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:08,180
Feel the thirst, like us!

348
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,892
Hurt like us!

349
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:13,951
Bleed like us!

350
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,532
I will keep you alive.

351
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:28,033
I need you alive.

352
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:30,543
Nothing can take back
what happened.

353
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:31,890
No.

354
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,132
Nothing can.

355
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:37,490
But... you can help us, little man.

356
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:41,841
You can help us live our whole
long lives a whole lot better!

357
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,233
See, we're tired of hiding!

358
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:47,230
We want what we gave you!

359
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:48,591
A home.

360
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:50,541
Wherever you build it,

361
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm gonna burn it down!

362
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:09,512
Little man still thinks
he's gonna be a hero.

363
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,266
He's crazy but it's
good to have a dream.

364
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,493
Reality is always better.

365
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,263
Especially when we've got an ace in the hole.

366
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,680
Give me that.

367
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,803
You get something for that.

368
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:21,922
I'll get it.

369
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,781
You just be sure you save me some.

370
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:58,543
Gang violence on the rise.
Bad Bloods terrorize Krainze
Woods neighborhood.

371
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:12,760
Bad Bloods gang member
shot, paralysed.

372
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:32,113
Hello, Chase.

373
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:34,762
- A pleasure to see you again.
- Save the talk.

374
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,950
And you must be Krista.

375
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:41,522
I'm Doctor Berganza, we are
absolutely delighted to
have you here.

376
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,182
Everything's been prepared.

377
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,692
Let's go, ladies,
we have a lot to do.

378
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:55,281
If you'd like to leave
your bags here, somebody
will collect them.

379
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:59,130
It's not often that we get
visitors from other Houses

380
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,672
for the most part
they seem to stay away.

381
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,522
Possibly because
you're all bat shit.

382
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:07,050
If that assesment eases your 
discomfort in some way

383
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:10,451
then by all means you stick
to it as long as you require.

384
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:13,253
But the dialisys machines
are downstairs.

385
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:15,183
The what?

386
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:19,621
It's an essential step in the processing.
We keep things very clean here.

387
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:24,321
Yes, because according to
the freaks, we are dirty girls,
our blood must be cleansed.

388
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,171
Apparently it reaks of death.

389
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,560
It does.

390
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:30,782
Hello, Chase.

391
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:33,450
And how is life with Marcus?

392
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,353
Never a dull moment.

393
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,453
How nice for you.

394
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,082
Are you going to introduce me?

395
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,222
Krista, meet Frederick.

396
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,000
My ex-husband.

397
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:57,373
Why have you suddendly 
got ambition?

398
00:27:57,595 --> 00:27:58,893
Well you got to start somewhere.

399
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,772
Yes, yes you do.

400
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:03,763
Although, you unfortunately
started with Blade.

401
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,090
What does that mean?

402
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:06,833
That means he turned you.

403
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:11,013
And now I hear you and your
lost boys are looking for a home?

404
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:13,093
We just want in.

405
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,972
I'll be blunt.

406
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:18,963
My superiors will not
allow streets scum

407
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,883
tainted by the blood of the
Daywalker in the House of Chthon.

408
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:24,431
We'd not adopt polluted strays.

409
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:28,042
You must try the House of Sacara,
they're... less particular.

410
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,351
Yeah.

411
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:38,402
About that Daywalker...

412
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,733
And...

413
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:55,452
this means what to me?

414
00:28:55,885 --> 00:29:00,741
It means that I can deliver you Blade,
wrapped up and ready to die.

415
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:05,212
And for this gift you want
keys to my front door?

416
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,321
I think your superior
will make an exception.

417
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:10,183
What do you think?

418
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,683
I think you like risk.

419
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:15,997
Could pay off if it's worth it.

420
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,573
Sometimes you have to take
things to get things.

421
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,823
I'm sure you've taken plenty.

422
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:23,710
Things your superiors
know nothing about.

423
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,792
And you're planning on
taking more, don't you?

424
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:27,720
A lot more.

425
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:33,441
Ah, it's how men like you and me
get the respect that we deserve.

426
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,513
Oh, is that what you're doing?

427
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:37,920
Getting respect?

428
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:39,802
I'm giving you Blade!

429
00:29:40,036 --> 00:29:42,280
You're gonna kill him or not?

430
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:53,091
Welcome.

431
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,320
Now where do I find him?

432
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:39,522
Germaine Turner?

433
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,731
You got the wrong guy.

434
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:45,273
Mmh.

435
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,023
In case you're thirsty.

436
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:55,153
Who are you?

437
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:56,573
Doesn't matter.

438
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:59,043
After this, you'll
never see me again.

439
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:03,373
What?

440
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:04,980
Back in the seventies,

441
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,822
you used to be a member of a street
gang called the Bad Bloods?

442
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:22,181
After you were shot, what happened
to the rest of the gang?

443
00:31:22,408 --> 00:31:24,100
They disappear.

444
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:26,260
They all die.

445
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,362
How did they die?

446
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:30,352
Little man.

447
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:33,190
Little man? 
Who's...?

448
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,633
So I won't find the bodies
in a cemetary, will I?

449
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,462
Now you listen to me.

450
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,090
If you got anybody
that cares about you,

451
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:46,923
that loves you,

452
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,670
or depends on you for living,

453
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,972
you'll stop asking questions

454
00:31:52,198 --> 00:31:55,820
and stop looking for whatever
it is you're looking for.

455
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:57,523
Cause if you find it,

456
00:31:57,818 --> 00:32:00,592
you'll wish to God you didn't.

457
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:04,943
You see,

458
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,510
it's because somebody
depends on me for living,

459
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,130
that thing I'm looking for,

460
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:10,762
I'm gonna find it.

461
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,261
And that thing

462
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:16,853
is whatever you son of bitches
called a home.

463
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:23,280
Now tell me where I can
find the Bad Bloods?

464
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,701
How long is this gonna take?

465
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,022
That's up to you.

466
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:45,392
Listen to me, 
this isn't magic,

467
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:49,850
there's no pentagrams using,
chanting and essence burning.

468
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:51,253
When we kill,

469
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:54,900
what you've done or you wouldn't
be here, energy's released.

470
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,302
Which takes you into an after death
that experience.

471
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:59,011
Been there.

472
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:00,660
So has Boone.

473
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,250
Because of you, 
you're connected.

474
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,841
Now because of your
new metabolic chemistry,

475
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,841
your senses have been retuned,

476
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:09,873
calibrated higher.

477
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:13,860
What we do here is simply
turn up the dial even more.

478
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,972
If we can turn it 
high enough,

479
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,641
you can pick up the energy
of your first kill.

480
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:21,512
You'll be able to find
him wherever he is.

481
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:25,163
Now here is the rough part,

482
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:28,252
you're going to come out of
this incredibly thirsty.

483
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:29,982
You must be careful,

484
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:32,313
not to drink too much 
blood too fast.

485
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,783
Or what?

486
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:37,300
Or Boone's energy will take
root in your soul.

487
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:40,722
And whoever you were will
be gone forever.

488
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:44,742
I'm already gone.

489
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:50,653
Whoever you were,
still very strong in you.

490
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:52,360
I can see that.

491
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:56,701
And you'd better be careful
because Chase can see it too.

492
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,332
Now don't worry.

493
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,401
I'll be your guide.

494
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,352
I've got some experience on this.

495
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:05,933
With Chase?

496
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:11,490
You turned her?

497
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:14,852
Yes.

498
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,142
Sorry to break this up.

499
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:24,100
But can we please get this over with?

500
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,333
Let's find your problem,
child, shall we?

501
00:34:56,537 --> 00:34:59,011
You get us 
into this, little man.

502
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:01,573
You'll get us out.

503
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:11,490
Marcus Van Sciver exposed me that.

504
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,473
One more last thing
to do before we...

505
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:43,113
turn you over to our 
new family, Blade.

506
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:46,900
Let's take those tatoos back.

507
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,830
And cut that skin clean off.

508
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,463
That's it, little man.

509
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,761
Scream for me.

510
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,643
***

511
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:41,483
I used to be like you.

512
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,760
I used to be his friend.

513
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,080
But he screws us all over.

514
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,060
Everyone he touches, he hurts.

515
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,763
Mostly he just touches vampires.

516
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:54,400
And yeah, it hurts.

517
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,383
Another time, little man.

518
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,230
So much for the Cosby kids.

519
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:16,743
I swear to God, if you
say thank you I'm quitting.

520
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:19,032
Just give me a minute.

521
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:21,720
Where is Krista?

522
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,570
Oh that's a story.

523
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:36,763
Funny.

524
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,001
Suck me.

525
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,710
Collins? That's me Gibbs.

526
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,571
Brought you those files you asked for.

527
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,320
All of Boone's open cases.

528
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:15,171
Do me a favor, don't tell my Cap'.

529
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:16,521
I wanted the last three months.

530
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:17,890
That's what you got.

531
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,240
What can I say, Detroit is
a dangerous place to live.

532
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:29,182
Runaways, protistutes,
roll over pushers.

533
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,600
Boone's specialty.

534
00:40:30,836 --> 00:40:35,572
I guess you could say he had
a soft spot for lost souls.

535
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,201
What about this one?

536
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:38,522
What's the name?

537
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,231
Starr, Zach Starr?

538
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:43,171
Single GSW to the head,
no viable suspects,

539
00:40:43,405 --> 00:40:45,040
yes, that's one of Boone's
special projects.

540
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,920
- You heard of this?
- Yeah.

541
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:48,780
Case was never closed.

542
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:53,000
What about the soldier?

543
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:54,841
I assumed Boone
wanted to screw her.

544
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:56,511
- Did he?
- I don't know.

545
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,871
She went missing,

546
00:40:58,065 --> 00:40:59,630
if she turns up,
you can ask her.

547
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,571
If she's still alive...

548
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:49,763
Next time on Blade.

549
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:52,191
- What did you see?
- I know, I know!

550
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,451
His next stop, it's
a small town in Louisiana.

551
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:56,040
Just kill him and come home.

552
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:58,343
She's pregnant,
but the question is...

553
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,081
of what.

554
00:43:00,338 --> 00:43:03,200
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.

555
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,740
Dust 'em all!

556
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,063
Boone!

557
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:12,031
Ahh, you stay away from me!

558
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:19,802
