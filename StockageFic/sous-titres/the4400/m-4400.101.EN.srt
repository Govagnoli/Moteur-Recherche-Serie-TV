1
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:13,146
I don't think it's gonna clear up.

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,190
It won't last long.
It's not raining that hard.

3
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:20,194
- It was so nice this morning.
- Yeah. It'll clear up.

4
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,281
If it doesn't,
we'll just have a picnic in the car.

5
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,700
Daddy, I want to go outside and play.

6
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,952
You're gonna get all wet, sweetie.

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,164
- Maybe later.
- Please.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,418
It's a very light shower.
Please, I won't get wet.

9
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:41,466
OK. But for just a minute.

10
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:45,178
- And I want you to come right back.
- I promise.

11
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:50,975
- Have fun.
- I will.

12
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:50,368
We treated you as an equal.
That wasn't enough.

13
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,120
You had to cross the line.

14
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,166
I'd put in for a transfer if I were you.

15
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,741
- Where are you going for dinner?
- Chez Michael's.

16
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,451
That's gonna set you back.

17
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:37,206
Elizabeth has been married to me
for 35 years.

18
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:41,877
- She deserves a nice meal.
- Have a good evening, Orson.

19
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,952
You need to slow down. I'm not
driving into town for another six-pack.

20
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:18,789
You're afraid my Dad will kick your ass
if I smell like beer.

21
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:21,208
Evil cousin Shawn. That's me.

22
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,878
Corruptor of the innocent.

23
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,255
Your neighbour. What's her name?

24
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:29,967
- She seems ready for some corruption.
- You mean Nikki?

25
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,386
- She's 14, Kyle.
- 14?

26
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:33,888
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

27
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,140
Hmm.

28
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,447
Would it be fair
to say that this comet

29
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:55,117
is close in size to Haley's Comet,
or is it a little bigger?

30
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:59,497
As far as comets go,
this one's a little smaller than Haley's.

31
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:05,169
But what makes this interesting to us
is how close it will pass by Earth.

32
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:08,672
What are the projections
on how close it will get?

33
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,718
Hey, kiddo. You're missing the show.

34
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,722
It's a big comet.

35
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,353
NASA says we'll never see one closer
in our lifetime.

36
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,982
Yeah, I didn't think that would work.

37
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,073
Hi.

38
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,117
- How is he?
- Same.

39
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,161
Same as always.

40
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:42,832
Some of your mail's
still coming to the house.

41
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,210
I'll call the post office.

42
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:48,629
Hi, baby.

43
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,844
I haven't seen you for a few days.

44
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,015
I can't make it every day. Not any more.
Not after three years.

45
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,726
Are we supposed to just give up on him?

46
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,107
I better go.

47
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,402
Linda, just wait. Linda!

48
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:15,406
- Linda!
- It's not a competition, Tom!

49
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,742
It's not about who can
sit by his side the longest.

50
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,621
I still love him.
I just can't live here like you do.

51
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,207
I know. I wasn't accusing you.

52
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:34,466
You got a bill from Olympian
Investigations. More private detectives?

53
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,596
We were onto something.
Someone matching Shawn's description.

54
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,681
But it wasn't him, was it?

55
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,395
Shawn could be anywhere. Even if you
found him, it wouldn't wake Kyle up.

56
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:51,066
- At least I'd have some answers.
- I'm worried about you, Tom.

57
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:56,113
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son is my job.

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,741
How can you not know that?

59
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:01,744
You look tired.

60
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,539
Try and get some rest.

61
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:25,392
I thought we were watching the comet.

62
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,853
Oh, yeah, the comet.

63
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,649
Is it supposed to be that bright?

64
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:53,754
- Skouris.
- Get over here. Now.

65
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:07,059
This cannot be good.

66
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,686
Listen up, everyone. We're Defcon One.

67
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:12,356
These envelopes are orders
from HomeSec.

68
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:16,819
Our first priority is secure SeaTac
Airport, ground all the planes.

69
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,614
Gather up all the foreign dignitaries
in the area.

70
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:24,952
Get them, the local elected officials,
take them all to the shelters.

71
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,580
- Sid, bring me up to speed.
- The comet's not a flyby any more.

72
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,541
It's heading right at us.

73
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:33,418
Sir, it just changed course again.

74
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,046
- A comet can't change course.
- It has.

75
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,674
- Then it's not a comet.
- Velocity is...

76
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,969
- 3,000kms a second.
- How long do we have?

77
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:44,388
- Impact in 28 minutes.
- Sir.

78
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,266
Ryland.

79
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,603
Understood.

80
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,691
China just launched its missiles at it.
We're going next.

81
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,487
The US military has launched
a volley of 24 Titan Two missiles.

82
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,835
Danny, what's going on?

83
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,760
All right, our missiles are in the air.

84
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,346
- England launched.
- France. Russia.

85
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:30,601
The first flight of missiles will intercept
in 15 seconds.

86
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:40,527
Nine... eight... seven...

87
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:44,615
six... five... four...

88
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:48,535
...three... two... one...

89
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,669
We should get inside.

90
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,297
Multiple hits. I think they got it.

91
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:05,010
At least nine of the missiles have hit
their target. The comet has...

92
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,096
- It's still headed for us.
- How hard will it hit?

93
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,682
Something that big, that fast...

94
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,853
You don't want to know.

95
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,357
You don't want to know.

96
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,574
I'm scared.
I'm gonna go find my parents, OK?

97
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:35,082
Hey, Dad, if you're there,
can you pick up the phone?

98
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:39,002
It's Diana. You know, your daughter?

99
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:43,423
- Just tell my brother that I love him.
- Tell Mummy that I love her, OK?

100
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,635
Nancy, it's Dad.

101
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:49,096
I just wanted to tell you I love you.

102
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,431
Impact with Earth now appears...

103
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:53,934
Tom, it's Susan. What is going on?

104
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:01,024
Isn't there a shelter we can go to?
You still work for Homeland Security.

105
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:04,319
Susan, it doesn't matter.

106
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:08,240
Shelters aren't gonna make
a damn bit of difference. Just...

107
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,034
I'm sorry. I love you, sis.

108
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:14,037
Just hug Danny close
and pray for the best.

109
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,749
A British missile hit the object,
but it's still coming.

110
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,169
- It's entered the atmosphere.
- I got it on radar.

111
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,755
- It's slowing down.
- What?

112
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,299
It's at Mach seven. Mach two.

113
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:29,886
It's going subsonic.
It's continuing to lose speed.

114
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,181
It's as if it's coming in for a landing.

115
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:37,185
- What? Like a plane?
- No, more like the mother ship.

116
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:40,355
Give me some coordinates.
Where's it going?

117
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:45,819
47 north longitude,
122, maybe 123 west latitude.

118
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:49,030
That's by Mount Rainier.

119
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:51,366
That's our backyard.

120
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,852
Come on, get the shot!

121
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:47,964
We're at Mount Rainier.
The ball of light is massive.

122
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:52,260
100, 200 feet in diameter.
It's hard to tell. We'll try to get closer.

123
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:55,555
I can tell you that this is,
without a doubt,

124
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:59,309
one of the most incredible sights
I've ever seen.

125
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,615
We're looking for an official
from the government.

126
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:34,177
Jim? Jim, now, what's going on?

127
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,224
We're not sure what's just happened.

128
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:42,394
The ball of light is gone.

129
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:43,329
Thousands of people have just
suddenly appeared! This is amazing.

130
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,540
There are thousands of people.

131
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:49,210
- I think I just... I saw your brother!
- Shawn?

132
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,129
Yeah!

133
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:38,851
Pull me all the files
from the northern counties.

134
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,190
I want back in.

135
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:48,778
Tom, do you have any idea
what I'm wading through here?

136
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:53,741
Over 4,000 people stepped
out of a ball of light and landed in my lap.

137
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:58,204
Some have been gone 60 years, none
have any memory of what happened.

138
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,123
- And you want back in?
- I can help.

139
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,542
I needed help from you before.

140
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,670
When HomeSec asked me
who I wanted from the Bureau,

141
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,340
your name was at the top of the list.

142
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,801
- What did I get from you?
- Five months.

143
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,596
Five months.

144
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:20,768
Then an indefinite leave of absence.
You made fools of both of us.

145
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:23,437
I needed to know what happened
to my son.

146
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:28,150
And that's the reason you want back in.
Your nephew is one of the returnees.

147
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:32,112
I admit I have a personal stake in this.

148
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,658
That's why I'll come through for you.
I need answers, too.

149
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:49,088
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.

150
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:53,300
You'll be investigating
what happened to the returnees.

151
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,720
- Skouris. Ex-CDC, right?
- Yeah, I heard of you, too.

152
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,349
- You're kidding.
- Is there a problem?

153
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:03,477
He went MIA once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

154
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,813
Me.

155
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,734
Is this where you say,
"Be a good soldier"?

156
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:14,113
No, this is where I say
you're my best field scientist

157
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,365
and Tom is my best lead investigator,

158
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:19,076
and together
you're gonna make a good team.

159
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,209
Well, it should be interesting.

160
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:30,004
Huh. Nice to meet you, too.

161
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:35,259
Beautiful. The sooner we find out
what's going on, the better for us.

162
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,970
The better for them.

163
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,777
- What's your name?
- Julius.

164
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:56,155
- Anita.
- Amanda.

165
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,782
I wanna see my family.

166
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:05,247
Orson Bailey.

167
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:10,294
- It's not possible.
- Fine, it's 1979.

168
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:14,381
- So for them, no time has past.
- Last night was our anniversary.

169
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:17,634
So where do you think they've been?

170
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,889
I don't know. There had to be
some kind of intelligence behind it.

171
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,558
Is it the hand of God or little green men?

172
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:28,645
I'm not discounting anything.
Look. This is an interesting one.

173
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,858
- They're dead, aren't they?
- This is Maia Rutledge.

174
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:38,530
She was the first one to disappear.
She's eight, only she was born in 1938.

175
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:42,242
I'll be OK. Mostly.

176
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:47,247
She's a tough little kid.

177
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,503
There's a returnee
I'd like to interview myself.

178
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:57,216
Yeah, so I've been told. Returnee 2,117.

179
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:00,010
Shawn Farrell. He's all yours.

180
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:07,392
We just want access.
They deserve to see their families,

181
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,603
to receive representation.

182
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,315
- They've done nothing wrong.
- We don't know that.

183
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:20,239
These people could be walking
time bombs, disease vectors, spies.

184
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:23,033
She doesn't like us much.

185
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:26,787
The feeling's mutual.

186
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:41,426
- The secretary of state is coloured?
- Black. I'll take your word for it.

187
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:46,807
And the national security advisor, too.
The world sure has changed since '51.

188
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,396
You should try to relax.

189
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:56,483
You won't get out any quicker
by wearing a groove in the floor.

190
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,862
- Are you a jailhouse philosopher?
- Barracks philosopher.

191
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,199
I was a combat pilot in Korea.

192
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:09,580
- Nice tattoo. Who's Lily?
- A girl I used to know.

193
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,499
Shawn Farrell to interview room one.

194
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,169
See you.

195
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,975
- What's your name, sir?
- Orson Bailey.

196
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:33,770
I want to speak to someone in charge.
Why can't I make a call?

197
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,200
Uncle Tommy! Hi!

198
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,829
It's good to see you!

199
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:54,875
What's going on?
Nobody will tell us anything.

200
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,670
We'll let you know
as soon as we find out. I...

201
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:02,341
- I can't believe it's you.
- How do you think I feel?

202
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:07,888
Do you know how long they're gonna
keep us? I really want to go home.

203
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,689
Shawn, er...

204
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:23,737
Do you remember anything? Anything
at all about what happened that night?

205
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,575
Nothing.

206
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:32,204
Nothing.

207
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,082
One minute I'm sitting
with Kyle on the beach,

208
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:39,294
the next it's three years later
and I'm standing next to a mountain

209
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:42,672
with a couple thousand strangers
around me.

210
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,635
Listen, Uncle Tommy,

211
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:51,973
some people are saying that...
we were abducted by aliens.

212
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,270
We can't rule anything out yet.

213
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,606
Well, can you give me anything?

214
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:02,484
- How's my mum? How's Danny?
- Fine.

215
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,694
- They miss you.
- Great.

216
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:09,074
What about Kyle? He must have seen
something the night I disappeared.

217
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,661
Did he tell you anything?

218
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:18,875
- He hasn't said a word.
- He's OK, isn't he?

219
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:25,757
- Isn't he?
- Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

220
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,262
What are you talking about?

221
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:34,850
Kyle's lying on a bed being fed through
one tube and pissing out another,

222
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:38,311
and he's been like that
ever since the night you left.

223
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:48,822
He was fine.
We were having a couple of beers.

224
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:51,283
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

225
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:54,536
I've waited three years
to hear the truth from you

226
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:56,496
so please don't lie to me.

227
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,957
I just told you the truth.

228
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,461
Is that what you've been thinking
this whole time?

229
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:09,384
That I gave Kyle something
that messed him up and I just took off?

230
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:17,767
Screw you, Uncle Tommy.

231
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:21,271
I just told you everything I know.

232
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:26,318
Goddamn it!

233
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:52,552
You look as bored as I feel.

234
00:22:56,681 --> 00:23:00,060
I wish there were windows in this place.

235
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:03,229
I'd like to see the stars. Wouldn't you?

236
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,694
- Do I look that bad?
- No, it's...

237
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:12,697
You remind me of someone
I used to know.

238
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,950
- How long have you been gone?
- Since '51.

239
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,538
Wouldn't be me, then. '93.

240
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:26,127
- I'm Richard.
- Lily.

241
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:32,300
My friend. Her name was Lily, too.
Lily Bonham.

242
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,928
That's my grandmother's name.

243
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,394
- Lily Bonham from St Louis?
- You knew my grandmother.

244
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:49,109
- Is she still alive?
- I'm sorry.

245
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,361
She died before I was born.

246
00:23:57,408 --> 00:23:59,702
Are you all right?

247
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,918
Lily's dead and I'm sitting here
with her granddaughter.

248
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:10,463
Doesn't make any goddamn sense at all.

249
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,632
I know how you feel.

250
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,929
I keep thinking I'll wake up
and tell my husband all about this dream.

251
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,975
- You have a family?
- Yeah.

252
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:25,353
Brian and I and our daughter, Heidi.

253
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:28,815
She was six months when I...

254
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,363
So what was she like? My grandmother.

255
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,700
Everyone says I look a lot like her.

256
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:44,873
They were right.

257
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:51,504
- That's not possible right now.
- This is ridiculous.

258
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:55,425
You've got no right to hold us.
We haven't done anything wrong.

259
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,969
I'm sorry.

260
00:24:58,136 --> 00:25:00,930
This is for you.

261
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:29,485
We're letting them go? They've only
been back six weeks. It's too soon.

262
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:34,448
The court of appeal's upheld a lawsuit
by the ACLU on behalf of the families.

263
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:39,745
- We have no right to hold them.
- Some of them have no place to go.

264
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:44,333
Egypt and China won't repatriate
its citizens. India's on the fence.

265
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,670
Whoever wants to stay can stay.

266
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:50,673
American citizens who leave

267
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,468
will get the assistance required
to get their life on track -

268
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:58,973
Medicare, Unemployment,
rent vouchers, vocational training.

269
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:03,269
- We need to isolate these people.
- They're human beings not viruses.

270
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:06,772
The order's been given.
We're letting them go.

271
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:09,692
I wouldn't book your vacations just yet.

272
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,285
Each Homeland Security office

273
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:22,913
will be responsible for the returnees
in their region.

274
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,709
We'll be monitoring 79 people

275
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:31,338
plus another 135 who have chosen
to remain in quarantine for now.

276
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:35,217
Each returnee will check in once a week.

277
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:41,598
Any difficulties faced by our returnees
will be handled by this office.

278
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:45,144
Finally, we'll continue
with our investigation.

279
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:50,024
We'll all sleep better once we know
what the hell's going on. Thank you.

280
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,245
You look so lonely without an ID number.

281
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:07,583
I'm supposed to be 82 years old.
There's no one here waiting for me.

282
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,085
So what are you going to do?

283
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:14,214
Head back to the old neighbourhood,
I suppose. What about you?

284
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,761
Wait. Let me guess.

285
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:24,308
- Take your daughter to Woodland Park.
- We used to love that place.

286
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:30,981
Of course, Heidi was barely crawling
then, and now she's twelve.

287
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:35,235
Er...

288
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:39,239
You've been a good friend.

289
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,178
- They said there'd be a bus to the city.
- Right over there.

290
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:07,017
- Hey, Mum! Danny!
- Shawn!

291
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:17,361
Brian! Brian!

292
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:21,490
Sorry, I...

293
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:27,913
Let's go.

294
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:20,382
- Can I help you?
- Heidi?

295
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,510
- Yeah.
- Heidi, it's Mummy.

296
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,389
- Who?
- Heidi?

297
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:30,267
It's OK, sweetie. I got it.

298
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,979
Brian.

299
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:36,398
Lily.

300
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,657
Look at you. You haven't aged a day.

301
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:49,494
Why didn't you come and pick me up?
Didn't they contact you?

302
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,204
Yeah.

303
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:57,711
You have to understand. I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.

304
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,007
I'm married, Lily.

305
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:10,057
Carol has been a really good mother
to Heidi.

306
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,601
We have a son now, too. A little boy.

307
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:21,902
I'm sorry, Lil, I'm...

308
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,030
Lily...

309
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,574
Elizabeth.

310
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,128
Orson?

311
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,590
Where have you been?

312
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,135
I've been waiting for you.

313
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,016
I know.

314
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:41,189
Where's the car?

315
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,818
We're going to be late for dinner.

316
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:52,367
I'm sorry, hon.

317
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:57,789
Things got a little out of control.

318
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,878
But it won't happen again.

319
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:25,859
- Hey, Mum.
- It's good to see you!

320
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:28,445
Oh, hey, Joel. Good to see you.

321
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:34,326
Sorry your buddies couldn't show.
I guess they're away at college.

322
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:38,121
They're jealous I get to enjoy
two more years of high school.

323
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:41,750
High school's not that bad. Hey, Shawn.

324
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,295
- Remember me?
- Nikki?

325
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,714
No!

326
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,842
Last time I saw you
you were just a little kid.

327
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,554
- Lucky me, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

328
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,209
What the hell are you looking at?

329
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,630
- I used to live here.
- Yeah?

330
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:32,550
Well, I live here now.
Get the hell outta here.

331
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:45,355
- Why am I here?
- To put a human face on the returnees.

332
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,525
To remind you they're people,
not viruses.

333
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:54,280
- Tom. Who is your new friend?
- This is my partner. My work partner.

334
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:56,783
Diana Skouris, this is my wife Linda.

335
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,910
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

336
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:01,246
We're separated.

337
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,833
Call me. We need to talk.

338
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:12,048
- Well, that was awkward.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

339
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,637
Give me a second.

340
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:30,066
- You look thirsty.
- Thank you.

341
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:36,322
I just wanted you to know,
I really am glad you're back.

342
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,575
Whatever. You...

343
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:44,163
Jeez.

344
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,507
- Neck's broken.
- Reflection must have confused him.

345
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:58,970
Come back inside.
You're missing your own party.

346
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,431
It's just weird being in there...

347
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:08,021
- I guess he was just stunned.
- Yeah.

348
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:11,441
- Yeah, I guess so.
- See you in there.

349
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:27,591
I have to see the doctor every week?

350
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,095
It doesn't sound like much fun
to me either but...

351
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,847
you get to live with these lovely people.

352
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:38,310
And that beats a bunk in quarantine,
right?

353
00:35:38,477 --> 00:35:43,982
- There's nothing we can't handle, right?
- That would be nice.

354
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:46,819
We should get going. It's a bit of a drive.

355
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:50,155
Terrific. Good luck, Maia.

356
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:53,075
- You'll see me again.
- Yeah. Next week.

357
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:55,786
Sooner than that.

358
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:07,172
When we bought the building,
your mother said, "That old thing?"

359
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,300
- Can I get you anything?
- Water would be fine.

360
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,595
Mary, get Mr Bailey some water?
Just down here.

361
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:17,224
You look exactly the same
as the last time I saw you.

362
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:21,061
And you were 13. Your father asked me
to show you the ropes.

363
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,522
Looks like I succeeded.

364
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,607
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

365
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:29,445
So what can I do for you, Mr Bailey?

366
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:35,242
My old corner office for starters,
a secretary, some business cards.

367
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,203
I can start seeing clients in a week.

368
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,291
- You're looking for a job?
- This is still Kensington and Bailey.

369
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,127
I'm embarrassed.

370
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:49,339
Times are tight. I just had to lay off
three of my actuaries.

371
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:54,511
- I don't have any openings right now.
- "Openings"? I'm a partner here.

372
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:58,891
Your interest was bought out
when you were declared dead.

373
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:01,185
I'm not dead.

374
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,104
- It is all legal.
- Don't be too sure of that.

375
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:08,817
What happened to me,
there is no precedent.

376
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:12,404
But it might be years
until precedent is established.

377
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:17,201
Until that happens, all of you... returnees

378
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,204
will have to plead your case
in front of a judge.

379
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,041
- Do you have the...
- Have you seen where my wife is?

380
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,212
I have to get her out of there.
I need money. Now.

381
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:36,637
The living room.
There's the kitchen.

382
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:40,307
Do you want to see your room?
It's the one over here.

383
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,352
- Here.
- We just had it redone.

384
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:51,151
It's a very nice room.

385
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:55,405
I got you a few outfits. Tomorrow
you can pick out some more yourself.

386
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:57,157
OK.

387
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:03,413
Maia, honey.

388
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:08,627
We have a rule.
No shoes on the furniture.

389
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:12,422
- I don't want them to get wet.
- Wet?

390
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:15,217
Why would they get wet?

391
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,097
Why don't you get cleaned up?
We're gonna eat soon.

392
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:01,067
Anita?

393
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:16,124
Adam, it's Orson. Let me in.

394
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,001
I want to talk.

395
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,351
I know you can hear. Let me in!

396
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:38,813
You want me to wake
the whole neighbourhood?

397
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:52,109
- Tom.
- What are you doing here?

398
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:55,112
Your phone is off.
Ryland wants us to come in.

399
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,574
- What's up?
- There's been a murder.

400
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:01,952
The police are holding one of the 4400.

401
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:11,837
That's Orson Bailey.

402
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:14,757
Bailey. Some kind of businessman,
right?

403
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:17,509
- Life insurance.
- Disappeared in the '70s.

404
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:20,471
'79. Declared dead in '86.

405
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:24,892
Seattle police are holding him
in connection with a homicide.

406
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:28,687
- They know he's one of the 4400?
- Bailey told them.

407
00:44:28,854 --> 00:44:31,982
The returnees were told
not to discuss their status.

408
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:34,693
We counsel them to avoid it
if they can

409
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,072
but we were talking interviews
and applications.

410
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,950
There's no protocol for murder enquiries.

411
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:43,744
- You said holding not charging?
- Right.

412
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:47,039
There are conflicting reports
about what went on.

413
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,124
- We'll check it out.
- Quietly.

414
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:54,004
- I don't want to dodge microphones.
- Quietly it is.

415
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:56,382
Diana.

416
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:04,139
Hi, this is Linda. I can't take your call
right now but please leave a message.

417
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,809
Linda, it's me again.

418
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:10,354
You said we needed to talk
so pick up the phone.

419
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:14,233
Linda, come on.

420
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,652
All right, call me.

421
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:19,113
- Everything OK?
- Same old same old.

422
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:21,156
I wish she'd make up her mind.

423
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:24,159
- I had a boyfriend once. Every...
- Boyfriend?

424
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:27,496
Well, don't look so surprised.

425
00:45:27,663 --> 00:45:31,667
- Yeah, anyway. The thing about...
- You can stop.

426
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,086
I barely got started.

427
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:36,797
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.

428
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:41,427
It was more of an attempt at bonding
via a shared similar experience.

429
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:43,679
Can you open the door?

430
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:46,598
How long did you go out with this guy?

431
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:49,476
- Nine months.
- Nine months.

432
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:53,731
You're equating your nine months
with my 19 years.

433
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:57,192
You're right. OK. Forget it.
You want me to drive?

434
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,113
- What for?
- So you can brood.

435
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,908
Just get in.

436
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:40,194
Look who floated in on a ball of light.

437
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:44,907
- Remember me, Farrell?
- Rossi. Hi.

438
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:47,659
Looks like the steroids finally kicked in.

439
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:52,664
Funny, man. Always did appreciate
your sense of humour.

440
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:55,250
Like when you sold me those tickets.

441
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:58,378
To the Foo Fighters?
How was the show?

442
00:46:58,545 --> 00:47:01,215
Cops were waiting for me
when I showed up.

443
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,926
The tickets were stolen. I got arrested.

444
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:08,805
- You got arrested for stolen tickets?
- Yeah. I had five tabs of X on me.

445
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:12,184
I had to pee in a cup once a week
for two years.

446
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:15,145
- Stop it!
- Get off of him!

447
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:19,441
- It's between me and your brother.
- I say it's between you and me.

448
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:25,739
See you round, freak.

449
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:29,576
By the way, I like the new paint job
on your ride.

450
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:40,587
Are you OK?

451
00:47:40,754 --> 00:47:42,673
Fine.

452
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:46,969
The cameras caught everything.
He had a bug up his ass.

453
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:50,138
But he never went inside.

454
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:53,183
Kensington fell and impaled himself.

455
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,602
- You've seen all the footage?
- Yes.

456
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:59,523
- Bailey never made it past the gate.
- Hold on. Did you see that?

457
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:08,365
- That's glass.
- Yeah.

458
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:11,535
Something blew out the windows
from the inside.

459
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:13,620
We're trying to figure that out.

460
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:17,374
There was no seismic activity,
no bomb or gas leak.

461
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:21,253
- And Bailey's not talking?
- I've sent half a dozen guys in.

462
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,922
He hasn't given us anything.

463
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,175
I've been over and over this
with you people.

464
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:29,761
We're Homeland Security.

465
00:48:29,928 --> 00:48:34,307
Tell the bozos out there I had nothing
to do with what happened to Adam.

466
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:38,353
Let's go over your day.
You went to see Adam about a job.

467
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,607
Even though your name is still
on the letterhead, he brushed you off.

468
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:47,070
- I know how that'd make me feel.
- I admit I was angry.

469
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:50,282
I went to Adam's house to...

470
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:54,661
I don't know why I went.

471
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,997
But I didn't kill him.

472
00:48:57,164 --> 00:49:01,668
Let me read you an e-mail Kensington
sent his attorney after your visit.

473
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:03,086
It's not important.

474
00:49:03,253 --> 00:49:07,215
"Bailey is making claims
regarding his stake in the company.

475
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:12,721
"He threatened to sue. There will be
hundreds of law suits involving the 4400.

476
00:49:12,888 --> 00:49:18,935
"It'll take years. Poor bastard.
He really is rather a pathetic case."

477
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:31,156
I am not a lawyer
but I'm not an idiot either.

478
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:34,201
You've had me here for twelve hours.

479
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:38,747
Either you charge me with something...

480
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:42,584
...or let me go.

481
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,721
- We're gonna let him walk?
- Looks like it.

482
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:58,433
If I ever want to play good cop, bad cop,
I'll let you know.

483
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,977
- Which one am I?
- This isn't a joke.

484
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:04,564
There's a time to lean on a guy.
That wasn't it.

485
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:09,819
Look, I'm sorry. But Bailey admitted
he was angry with Kensington.

486
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:13,740
- He was at his house.
- I didn't say it was over, did I?

487
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,772
Do you think they thought about me?

488
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:49,359
Oh, sweetie! They were your parents!

489
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:52,696
I am sure that they thought about you
every day.

490
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,700
Thanks for bringing me here.

491
00:50:56,866 --> 00:51:00,954
This place used to be so nice.
Now the kids leave garbage everywhere.

492
00:51:01,121 --> 00:51:03,999
- It's a shame.
- You don't have to worry.

493
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:07,794
- Crown Ridge is nice.
- Crown Ridge Cemetery?

494
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,629
Yes.

495
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:15,051
- That's where you will be.
- Be? Be what?

496
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,556
Buried.

497
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:27,480
Kensington is a popular guy today.

498
00:51:27,647 --> 00:51:30,066
The whole staff's seen the post mortem.

499
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,068
Why is that?

500
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:38,116
He might have been a boring suit alive,
but in death, he's a rock star.

501
00:51:38,283 --> 00:51:41,453
God, look at that.
Those were his parietal bones?

502
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:44,497
We've seen terrible beating deaths.

503
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:49,627
One guy jumped off the Space Needle
and was brought to us in a garbage bag.

504
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:54,090
But I have never seen a skull
in this kind of shape before.

505
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:57,802
- Thousands of tiny bone fragments...
- He was impaled.

506
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:01,097
- That's not how he died?
- That would have killed him.

507
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:05,018
But he was already dead
from his shattered skull.

508
00:52:16,154 --> 00:52:19,282
- Hello.
- Hello, is Lily there?

509
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:21,826
- Who?
- Is this Heidi?

510
00:52:21,993 --> 00:52:23,828
Yes.

511
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:26,873
I'm Richard Tyler.
A friend of your mother's.

512
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,085
My mother's name is Carol.
Are you sure you have the right number?

513
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:33,463
This is the Moore residence, isn't it?

514
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,675
Yeah, but there's
no one named Lily here. Sorry.

515
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:57,570
I'm afraid I can't give you
any medicine for the nausea.

516
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:02,659
- Why not?
- Because it wouldn't work.

517
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:06,246
You're not sick, Lily, you're pregnant.

518
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:13,211
That's impossible. The quarantine
doctors would have told me.

519
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:16,839
They gave you a full screening
seven weeks ago.

520
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:20,051
If you'd just conceived
it wouldn't have shown.

521
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:23,263
Conceived? When?

522
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:26,224
I assume, right before you disappeared.

523
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,313
But there's no mistake.
You're definitely pregnant.

524
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:37,360
There's nothing to worry about.

525
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:42,532
But I'd like to see you again next week
when you're used to the information.

526
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,549
- Shawn.
- Hey.

527
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,470
- How are you doin'?
- Good.

528
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:04,225
- Did you get your car fixed?
- It'll be in the shop for a week.

529
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:09,396
Yeah? Danny and I are going to a party
tonight at Evie Chobin's house.

530
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:12,274
You should come.

531
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:15,110
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

532
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:18,656
They're gonna be listening to music
I've never heard,

533
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,450
talking about movies I've never seen.

534
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:24,912
School is bad enough.
Partying with runts from...

535
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,164
Is that how you saw me? A runt?

536
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,462
- You were 14, Nikki.
- And now?

537
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:42,763
I'm late for class.

538
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:11,834
Where's my wife?

539
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:18,340
- My wife. Where is she?
- You have our deepest condolences.

540
00:55:18,507 --> 00:55:21,343
- We called. There was no answer.
- Elizabeth?

541
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:25,097
It was a pulmonary embolism.
We tried to revive her.

542
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:28,058
- No!
- Please, calm down.

543
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,893
- She's dead?
- Mr Bailey!

544
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,563
- She's all I have.
- Let go of me!

545
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,566
- Let go of me! Please!
- No!

546
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:43,949
Get away from me!

547
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:13,353
So the dots are where the American
members of the 4400 originally lived.

548
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,610
- You mean the returnees.
- According to the press, it's "the 4400".

549
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:24,448
You have to admit it's a bit strange,
a nice round number like that.

550
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,242
I wonder if it has any significance.

551
00:56:27,409 --> 00:56:33,999
So if 3,781 people had shown up that
night it wouldn't have been as strange?

552
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:38,837
I'd say slightly less strange.
This, however, is downright weird.

553
00:56:39,755 --> 00:56:43,509
Here's where the 4400 are now,
two weeks after their release.

554
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:47,471
- 65% are still in Seattle.
- They're just not going home.

555
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:51,391
- And none of them can say why.
- You think it means something?

556
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:56,438
In the CDC we'd call this
a statistically significant disease cluster.

557
00:56:59,858 --> 00:57:02,194
In the FBI we'd call it a coincidence.

558
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:06,448
I don't believe in coincidences.
Disease clusters...

559
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:10,077
I believe in those.

560
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:14,665
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

561
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,669
When you disappeared
I'd been in New York for weeks.

562
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,213
I haven't been with anyone else.

563
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:27,469
- We're talking immaculate conception?
- I don't know. I wish I did.

564
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:37,980
You know, when you disappeared,
I'd have given anything to talk to you.

565
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:41,692
I'd have whole conversations with you
in my head.

566
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,944
I missed you so much, Lil.

567
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,203
But we can't do this.

568
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,790
I have another family now.
I know that's not fair but...

569
00:57:56,957 --> 00:58:00,585
I am part of your life
whether you want me to be or not.

570
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:04,256
You haven't been part of my life
for 11 years.

571
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:09,469
I want to see Heidi.

572
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:12,264
- That's impossible.
- She's my daughter.

573
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:16,059
She doesn't know that.
She thinks that Carol is her mother.

574
00:58:17,352 --> 00:58:20,397
- You never told her about me?
- She was a baby.

575
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,859
- We were babies.
- You can't stop me from seeing her.

576
00:58:24,026 --> 00:58:26,695
I already have.

577
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:35,370
- What is that?
- It's a temporary restraining order.

578
00:58:35,537 --> 00:58:38,999
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- I'm a lawyer.

579
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:43,545
I know how to work the system.
I will only use this if you force me to.

580
00:58:43,712 --> 00:58:47,674
- My priority is protecting my family.
- I am your family.

581
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:51,678
I wish you were.
But you're not. Not any more.

582
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:56,808
I'm sorry, Lil. I'm asking you,
please stay away from Heidi.

583
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:01,897
And from me.

584
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:09,946
I'm sorry, Lily.

585
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:23,668
At first I thought it was an earthquake.
Everything was shaking.

586
00:59:23,835 --> 00:59:26,713
Then... I can't believe
I'm going to say this...

587
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,675
Things started to fly around the room.
Paper. Chairs.

588
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:35,013
- What do you mean, "fly"?
- I mean, fly, like it was a tornado.

589
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,308
Except there was no wind.
Everybody was screaming.

590
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:42,687
My head felt like it was gonna burst.
Then suddenly it was over.

591
00:59:42,854 --> 00:59:46,483
- What about Bailey?
- He looked scared. Like the rest of us.

592
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,945
That's when he ran away. The staff...

593
00:59:50,111 --> 00:59:54,366
Everyone's saying
he's one of these people. The 4400.

594
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:57,786
- Is that true?
- Listen to me very carefully.

595
00:59:57,953 --> 01:00:01,414
You are not going to talk about this
to the press.

596
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:06,628
If I see this reported on the news,
we'll take an interest in this place.

597
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:10,840
- Things flying around the room?
- All the witnesses say the same.

598
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:16,054
Flying? I've got to do a briefing
for HomeSec DC and I'll tell him what?

599
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:18,765
"The incident is under investigation."

600
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:22,727
Bailey checked out of his hotel.
He could be on the run.

601
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:26,731
Find him. You bought us some time
but this story's gonna leak

602
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:30,902
and I want Bailey in our hands
before it does.

603
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:35,031
So is Calculus
everything you remember it to be?

604
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,909
You heard about Williams
and Miss Sinclair?

605
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:40,996
- No? They found them in the closet.
- What?

606
01:00:41,162 --> 01:00:43,790
- Making out, not dead.
- What?

607
01:00:43,957 --> 01:00:46,418
Everybody's been talking about it.

608
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:50,171
Yo, freak. Still hiding behind
your little brother?

609
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:55,593
You know what, Brad?
You need to shut it down.

610
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,555
You want to shut me down?

611
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:02,392
The only thing I'm shutting down
is you, bitch.

612
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:07,022
- You're starting to piss me off.
- Come on. Bring it.

613
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:09,399
Shut me down.

614
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,514
- Let him go!
- Shawn!

615
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:53,735
What did you do to him?

616
01:02:07,586 --> 01:02:11,507
- I don't want her here any more.
- Hey! She'll hear you.

617
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:16,387
It's bad enough she says we'll be buried
there, but then we get a brochure?

618
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:18,389
It's a coincidence.

619
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:23,185
Look, she's not what we expected,
so let's just talk to her.

620
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:26,856
Yeah.

621
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:37,199
Maia...

622
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:44,707
It's OK. I knew
I wasn't going to be here very long.

623
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:51,881
Come on. Come on, let's go.

624
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,011
Give me the ball.

625
01:02:57,178 --> 01:03:00,973
- Your shot, space boy.
- What is your problem?

626
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,226
- What is my problem?
- Yeah, what's your problem?

627
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:08,856
- What did you do to Brad?
- Not you, too. Come on.

628
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:11,400
The way he went down?
That's not normal.

629
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:14,278
You know it, I know it.
Everybody saw it.

630
01:03:14,445 --> 01:03:16,989
- What are you saying?
- You tell me.

631
01:03:17,156 --> 01:03:19,742
I didn't do anything to him, all right?

632
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:22,244
Not a thing.

633
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:28,876
Is this all that's left when you're done?

634
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:32,213
Poor Mrs Bailey. It's a box of trinkets.

635
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,924
They're not trinkets. They're memories.

636
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,427
The kind you leave behind,
for family, friends.

637
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:42,890
- I should get to work on that.
- I'm not going there.

638
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:46,018
Believe it or not,
some of us are happier alone.

639
01:03:46,185 --> 01:03:50,314
If anyone thinks they're happy alone,
they're kidding themselves.

640
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,942
I thought you weren't going there.

641
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:56,028
You see this? This looks promising.

642
01:03:59,448 --> 01:04:02,910
"Wyler Summer Cabin."
Wyler was Elizabeth's maiden name.

643
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:06,372
Orson's panicking,
he needs a place to run.

644
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:10,292
- There's no address.
- We'll have to find one.

645
01:04:18,676 --> 01:04:21,762
It's better this way. For everyone.

646
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:24,932
Everyone? Or just you?

647
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:36,110
Maia, honey. You know this isn't
about you. You are a wonderful girl.

648
01:04:36,277 --> 01:04:39,947
It's just... Kenneth and I...

649
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:43,784
We just made a mistake.
We're not ready to be parents yet.

650
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:47,997
- It's OK.
- No, it's not.

651
01:04:49,623 --> 01:04:52,876
But sweetie, those things you say.

652
01:04:53,043 --> 01:04:57,131
They can scare people if
you're not careful. Do you understand?

653
01:04:58,465 --> 01:05:00,217
Good.

654
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:09,601
For you.

655
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:12,271
Come on. Take it.

656
01:05:12,438 --> 01:05:14,523
- What is it?
- A CD I burned.

657
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,902
Think of it as a crash course
in all things new and cool.

658
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:24,408
- The bands you've never heard of.
- Thanks.

659
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:28,620
But Nikki, I could listen to all the music
and watch all the shows,

660
01:05:28,787 --> 01:05:31,290
but they'll still think I'm different.

661
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:33,834
But you'll be listening to good music.

662
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:40,466
I don't understand, see. Everybody has
been looking at me like I'm a monster.

663
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:43,844
But you...
Aren't you afraid to be seen with me?

664
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:47,556
No. What do I care
what those creeps think?

665
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:52,770
If you like the CD,
I'll burn you another one.

666
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:55,355
- Sounds great.
- All right. OK.

667
01:05:55,522 --> 01:05:57,941
- See you.
- Talk to you later.

668
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,375
OK. Bring up the satellite shots.

669
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:56,255
So we're looking for a small house
with a north-facing exposure

670
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:59,174
somewhere near Appleton Lake.

671
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:03,470
- If it's still standing.
- No structures in grids 1, 2, 3 and 9.

672
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,473
4 and 7 each have one
but they're the wrong shape.

673
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,436
- Eliminate all those.
- That leaves us with 5, 6 and 8.

674
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:14,440
That's too small.
That's the wrong orientation.

675
01:07:14,606 --> 01:07:18,360
That's too small. That's too big.
It's not there anymore.

676
01:07:18,527 --> 01:07:21,238
Hang on. Get a little tighter on this.

677
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:26,034
It looks like it could be a house.

678
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:29,329
These trees would be huge by now.

679
01:07:29,496 --> 01:07:31,790
Enlarge again.

680
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:39,298
- Bingo. There's your house.
- Bingo.

681
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,136
Appleton is what, about 70 miles?

682
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:47,723
Yeah. And look, when we get up there...

683
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:51,268
- I'll handle Bailey.
- All right.

684
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:53,645
- Are we leaning on him?
- No leaning.

685
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:56,857
- No problem.
- Excuse me, are you Tom Baldwin?

686
01:07:57,024 --> 01:07:59,401
Yeah. Who are you?

687
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:02,321
You've been served. Sorry, man.

688
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:07,743
You're getting sued?

689
01:08:11,997 --> 01:08:14,541
Linda's filed for divorce.

690
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:19,364
- Over this way.
- Get ready.

691
01:08:56,693 --> 01:08:59,779
- Lily.
- Richard!

692
01:08:59,946 --> 01:09:02,657
Richard!

693
01:09:07,036 --> 01:09:10,665
I don't understand.
I thought you went home.

694
01:09:10,832 --> 01:09:13,418
I did but there was nothing there for me.

695
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:17,839
How did you find me here?

696
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:22,176
Woodland Park, right?
This is where you used to bring Heidi.

697
01:09:24,053 --> 01:09:26,514
Richard, it was terrible.

698
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:33,062
Brian's married
and Heidi doesn't know I exist.

699
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:47,952
- Hello, Maia.
- Hello.

700
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:53,333
Oh, I like it out here.
It's much better than my stuffy office.

701
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:59,630
But you didn't bring me out here
to talk about the weather.

702
01:09:59,797 --> 01:10:02,800
- You're a very smart little girl.
- Thank you.

703
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:12,101
The thing is that the Griffins didn't give
a reason why they brought you back.

704
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:15,438
Maybe they didn't have a reason.

705
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:17,857
It could be.

706
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:21,277
- Were they mean to you?
- No.

707
01:10:22,612 --> 01:10:26,074
- Were you mean to them?
- No.

708
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:31,079
Why do you think you're back here?

709
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:33,581
I don't think they like kids much.

710
01:10:33,748 --> 01:10:36,250
Why do you say that?

711
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:39,379
They brought me back and I'm a kid.

712
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:46,135
You don't really want to tell me
the reason, do you?

713
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:51,933
It's OK.
Maybe you'll change your mind one day.

714
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,685
Maybe.

715
01:10:55,853 --> 01:11:01,442
Hi, this is Linda. I can't take your call
right now but please leave a message.

716
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,280
- She's still not answering?
- Nope.

717
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:10,868
- Can I ask you a question?
- No.

718
01:11:11,035 --> 01:11:13,621
I'm gonna ask you anyway.

719
01:11:13,788 --> 01:11:17,542
Your son.
How long has he been in a coma?

720
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:21,462
Three years.

721
01:11:21,629 --> 01:11:25,258
- That's a long time.
- You have no idea.

722
01:11:25,424 --> 01:11:28,261
Maybe you and your wife
can work things out.

723
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:36,102
One day Kyle will wake up and I'll have
to tell him his family's fallen apart.

724
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:40,857
I go to that hospital every day and I tell
myself that makes me a good father.

725
01:11:41,023 --> 01:11:45,319
You are a good father.
Kyle's lucky to have a dad like you.

726
01:11:45,486 --> 01:11:50,032
Not everyone does.
You can trust me cos I know.

727
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:57,540
A baby?

728
01:11:57,707 --> 01:11:59,876
Are you sure?

729
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:02,670
I had the doctors do the tests
three times.

730
01:12:02,837 --> 01:12:06,716
The thing is that Brian was out of town
when I disappeared

731
01:12:06,883 --> 01:12:11,012
and I haven't been with anyone
since I've been back.

732
01:12:11,178 --> 01:12:14,390
- I don't understand. How could you...
- I don't know.

733
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:22,648
I'm sorry to dump this on you.
It's not really fair.

734
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:25,151
It's OK. I...

735
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,571
I want to help.

736
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,451
There's some sort of connection
between us, isn't there?

737
01:12:33,618 --> 01:12:36,329
- I feel it.
- I can feel it, too.

738
01:12:37,663 --> 01:12:40,499
That's why I came back.

739
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:46,672
But it's more complicated than that.

740
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:51,177
Your grandmother and I...
We weren't just friends.

741
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:54,055
It was... It was more than that.

742
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:56,724
We were gonna start a family.

743
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:04,065
I think part of me already knew that.

744
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:09,612
The way you talk about her.
The look in your eye.

745
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:13,908
I thought I was playing it so safe.

746
01:13:16,452 --> 01:13:21,123
It must have been difficult. A white
woman and a black man in the '50s.

747
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,667
Hmm. "Black."

748
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:28,214
Back then I was "Negro"
or "coloured" or worse.

749
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:32,843
But we didn't care.

750
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:36,680
We figured after the war

751
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:43,979
we'd take off to some big city
like Chicago or New York or Paris.

752
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:49,485
- But you never made it home.
- No.

753
01:13:50,486 --> 01:13:52,571
I never did.

754
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:02,331
I'm glad you found me.

755
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:05,543
Me too.

756
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,663
Mr Bailey, it's Tom Baldwin,
Homeland Security.

757
01:15:32,254 --> 01:15:34,965
We met at the police station, remember?

758
01:15:35,132 --> 01:15:38,135
We're here to help.
You've got to talk to us.

759
01:15:38,302 --> 01:15:41,013
- Go away.
- We can't do that.

760
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,725
I just want to be left alone.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

761
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:47,227
Good cos we don't want
anyone else hurt.

762
01:15:47,394 --> 01:15:52,149
If you leave, I promise
no one will ever see me again.

763
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:55,527
I'll just stay here away from everyone.

764
01:15:55,694 --> 01:15:58,781
You know that's not going to work.
Open the door.

765
01:15:58,947 --> 01:16:01,867
We can figure this out.
I'm on your side.

766
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:04,620
No, you're not. No one is.

767
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:07,373
My nephew is one of the 4400
just like you.

768
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:11,502
It's hard for him. It's harder for you.

769
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:16,882
You don't know anything. My wife.
She was everything to me.

770
01:16:17,049 --> 01:16:19,885
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- I don't want any pity.

771
01:16:20,052 --> 01:16:24,390
Go away! I just want to be left alone.

772
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:31,355
- We can't do that.
- I said... get away from me.

773
01:16:41,156 --> 01:16:43,450
Stay away. Please.

774
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,092
Tom!

775
01:17:00,259 --> 01:17:02,719
Your nose!

776
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,542
I can't control it.

777
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:38,547
Whatever it is you're doing, stop it!

778
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:42,217
- I can't control it!
- Stop it! Now!

779
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,105
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

780
01:18:01,653 --> 01:18:04,615
- I'll call for an ambulance.
- OK.

781
01:18:13,165 --> 01:18:16,084
We're gonna get you some help,
Mr Bailey.

782
01:18:19,838 --> 01:18:22,758
Just don't die on me.

783
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:32,976
Well, he's alive, but he won't be
talking to us any time soon.

784
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:38,190
As far as the public's concerned,
we'll deny it ever happened.

785
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:42,027
But we know better.
The question is, will it happen again?

786
01:18:42,194 --> 01:18:45,697
You suggest we put them all
back in quarantine?

787
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:48,075
You saw what Bailey could do.

788
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:50,744
And you felt it, same as me.

789
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:55,791
Who knows what they rest of them
are capable of?

790
01:18:55,958 --> 01:19:00,671
I sure as hell don't.
But then again it's not my job to find out.

791
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:02,339
It's yours.

792
01:19:06,134 --> 01:19:08,595
Aren't you glad you wanted back in?

793
01:19:23,068 --> 01:19:26,196
I never thanked you for saving my life.

794
01:19:26,363 --> 01:19:29,157
You know, I never shot anyone before.

795
01:19:29,324 --> 01:19:32,577
- Seeing him lying there like that...
- Are you OK?

796
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:37,749
I'll get there. You know, I meant
what I said to Ryland back there.

797
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,544
Who knows where all this is going?

798
01:19:40,711 --> 01:19:44,464
We've got one case.
Maybe that's all we'll ever have.

799
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:48,385
You haven't noticed anything unusual
with Shawn?

800
01:19:48,552 --> 01:19:52,097
I just need to know
if you had you'd tell me.

801
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:59,271
There's nothing to tell.

802
01:20:07,195 --> 01:20:09,030
Look at this guy.

803
01:20:10,407 --> 01:20:14,369
There's three other sites
just like this one.

804
01:20:14,536 --> 01:20:17,247
- What are you guys doing?
- Research.

805
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:26,089
- On The 4400 Scoop. Com?
- It's just...

806
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:30,594
You know the Web.
There's a site for everything.

807
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:36,391
"The 4400 Menace?" I know this guy.
I was in quarantine with him.

808
01:20:36,558 --> 01:20:40,437
They're saying he killed someone
just by thinking about it.

809
01:20:44,733 --> 01:20:48,862
- So that makes me some kind of freak?
- No. No, we were just...

810
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:52,449
I want to know
how you took Brad down so fast.

811
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,620
- Come on, you saw it.
- Danny.

812
01:20:56,786 --> 01:21:00,123
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

813
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:06,796
Neither do you.

814
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:13,428
Shawn.

815
01:21:17,224 --> 01:21:20,393
What?
You were thinking the same thing.
