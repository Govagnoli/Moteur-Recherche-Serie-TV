1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,380
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,350
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,970
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,650
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,590
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,667
<i>We've not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>

9
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,834
The world
will have to deal with us.

10
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:45,867
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

11
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,034
you disappeared.

12
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,101
Do you have any idea
where you've been?

13
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:49,234
Everhere.

14
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:50,867
You won't feel anything.

15
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,967
I saw the catastrophe,

16
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:55,534
and i know what we have to do
to stop it.

17
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:58,634
My life... my future...
it's tied up with the 4400.

18
00:00:58,634 --> 00:00:59,634
<i>[Alana]: kyle's lving.</i>

19
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:01,201
Kyle,
what are you dng?

20
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,001
I got a job.

21
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,101
I'm going to travel

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,168
around the country
for a little while.

23
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,300
You're going to get married.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,101
Did you haen to see
who the lucky guy was?

25
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,834
Maia, this is my friend, ben.

26
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,534
I heard a lot about you,
young lady.

27
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,567
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

28
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,767
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,268
Are all these people
4400s?

30
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,934
Some are,
and some just wish thewere.

31
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,433
Good morning.
Welcome to the center.

32
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,700
Are you a 4400?

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,867
No, sweetie.

34
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,300
Are you here
to take our seminar?

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,234
No, we're here
to look at the school.

36
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,034
Are you sure
you want to do this?

37
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,934
I want to meet
kids like me.

38
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,067
Thomas...

39
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,401
what are you doing?

40
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,867
It's 2:00
in the morning.

41
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,134
Yeah, i couldn't sleep.

42
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,567
Kyle left this stuff
behind.

43
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,867
He wanted me
to throw it out.

44
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,668
I figured i'd...

45
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:59,067
look through it,

46
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,867
see if he might want
to kp any of it.

47
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,867
You know,
for when he comes home.

48
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,668
Sorry i woke you up.

49
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,334
Are you sure
you want tdo this?

50
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,567
Shawn...

51
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,200
devon asked for this.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
She's ready.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,367
Ever since

54
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,567
i first showed up
at the center,

55
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,900
this is what i've wanted.

56
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,833
This is why i came.

57
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,833
Besides,
if anything goes wrong,

58
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,668
you're here, rig?

59
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,668
<i>Um, i'm...</i>

60
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>i'm bringing you a message
about a better future.</i>

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,634
It's here. Now.

62
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:16,034
<i>This serum contains promicin.</i>

63
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:17,668
<i>Everyone knows what that is.</i>

64
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,000
<i>It's the neurotransmitter</i>

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>that gives the 4400
their abilities.</i>

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,434
<i>It's here, now,
within our grasp...</i>

67
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:24,668
this video went up
the internet

68
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:25,734
six hours ago.

69
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,167
We have tried to suppress it,

70
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,100
but it keeps showing up
on new servers.

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,534
<i>With these shots,</i>

72
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,701
<i>i'm going to train my body
to produce promicin.</i>

73
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,601
Doesn't that woman
work for your nephew?

74
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,067
<i>I am going to develop</i>

75
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,933
<i>a 4400 ability...</i>

76
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,768
<i>and so can you.</i>

77
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,334
An enormous government stockpile
of promicin goes missing,

78
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,768
and a day later,

79
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,034
an employee of the 4400 center
shows up on the internet

80
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,701
collier doesn't care
if we come for him.

81
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:47,833
Does he really think

82
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,967
people are goi to
inject this

83
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,067
into their bodies, though?

84
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,501
They're definitely curious.

85
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,933
This video's been downloaded
almost 100,000 times already.

86
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,701
By the end of the day,
it'll be 10 times that.

87
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,267
Collier might look
like some kind of prophet now,

88
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,034
but the businessman
inside him

89
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,701
iqn't totally dead.

90
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,000
The man still knows

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,701
how to create a market
for his product.

92
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,134
<i>These shots are going to be
available everywre...</i>

93
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,534
<i>soon.</i>

94
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:14,796
you've been
all through this place,

95
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,234
and i understand you've searched

96
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,334
my other real estate holdings
as well.

97
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,767
Yeah, the ones
we know about.

98
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,200
You haven't found
any pricin,

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,367
nor will you.

100
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,834
Your employees

101
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:26,267
don't seem to have any trouble
finding the stuff.

102
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:26,807
There's one on the internet
right now,

103
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,629
talking about the start
of a new era.

104
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:30,701
It's a bold idea.

105
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,801
I wish i'd thought of it.

106
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,133
Devon's
a courageous girl.

107
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,500
She's always aspired
to something higher.

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,434
I'm not surprised
she made it happen.

109
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:41,300
I'd congratulate her...

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,767
if i knew where she was.

111
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:47,034
This isn't just a plan.
It's a revolutio

112
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,701
you realize that,
don't you?

113
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,434
Handing out promicin
like candy

114
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,200
changes everything,
shawn.

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,901
Nobody will be able
to enforce the law.

116
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,167
It'll be chaos.

117
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,567
Nobody can predict
what's going to happen

118
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,001
once people everywhere
start developing abilities.

119
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,068
You need to tell us
where he's keeping this stuff.

120
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't get you guys.

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
All along, you've been saying
we're on the same side,

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,001
no matter
what our differences are,

123
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,500
that our goals are the same...

124
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
for things to change,
get better...

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,934
now a man is back from the dead
to show us how to get there,

126
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,701
and you two want to stop him.

127
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:17,500
You know what?
You can't.

128
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,734
Our phone lines
have been jammed up all morning.

129
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,034
People are dying to know

130
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,667
how they can get their hands
on the shot.

131
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,567
So, what do you
tell them?

132
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,767
I tell them

133
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,200
that we have nothing
to do with it,

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,534
and then i wish them good luck.

135
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,667
If he's the voice
of moderation,

136
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,200
we're in a lot
of trouble.

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,133
Tom, i need a minute.

138
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,701
There's something
i got to do.

139
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,767
And don't forget
about the decimal point.

140
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,367
You just bring that
above the division...

141
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,300
ms. Skouris. Can i help you?

142
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,801
Yeah, i need
my daughter.

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,667
What?

144
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,701
We're going.

145
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,601
<i>... the 4400 their abilities.</i>

146
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,034
<i>With these sts,</i>

147
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,167
<i>i'm going to
train my body</i>

148
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,233
<i>to produce promicin.</i>

149
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,767
<i>I am
going to develop...</i>

150
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,767
denn?

151
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,934
We need to move
against collier now.

152
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,834
<i>These shots
are going to be available...</i>

153
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,267
how are we supposed
to stop the 4400

154
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,367
if we just sit back

155
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,367
and let everyone
have a chance

156
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,834
to become one?

157
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,267
If collier
puts this promicin

158
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:20,834
out on the street...

159
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,267
he'll be doing our work
for us.

160
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:27,867
I'm not leaving school.

161
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:28,867
You can't make me.

162
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,167
I like it there.

163
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,300
I told you,
the center's involved

164
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,500
in some bad stuff,

165
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,634
and you're not
safe there.

166
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,034
I'm not safe anywhere.

167
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:36,434
At least i was happy there...

168
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,467
but you don't really care
about that,

169
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,634
do you?

170
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:41,167
Sweetie, i do care,

171
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,634
and we'll work something out.

172
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,801
We'll go back to home-schooling
for a while...

173
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,634
home-schooling sucks.

174
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,267
Excuse me?

175
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,834
We're not finished here,
young lady.

176
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,133
Ben.

177
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,367
I thought you were in london.

178
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,467
Yeah, i didn't go.

179
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,834
This whole "time to think" thing
isn't working for me.

180
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,601
I... needed to see you.

181
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:10,100
I'm kind of in the middle
of something her-

182
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,267
Guess that can wait.
Come on in.

183
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,100
Is april still here?

184
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,734
No, she left.

185
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,133
Stormed out,
i guess you could say.

186
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,267
But she only took
half her stuff.

187
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,601
Called her a few times,
no luck.

188
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,133
Ha.

189
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,367
I wouldn't call me back either.

190
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,400
Look, i'm sorry

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,367
that things are bad
with you guys.

192
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:44,534
Honestly,

193
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:45,968
i haven't had much time
to think about it.

194
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,567
Maia's not talking to me.

195
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,167
Everything's blowing up at work.

196
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,334
I have no idea
how all this is going to end.

197
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:55,233
How about it ends happy?

198
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,701
I have a job offer
in spain.

199
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,167
It's long.

200
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,968
Six months, maybe more.

201
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:04,767
I'm thinking
of taking it.

202
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,667
You're leaving.

203
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,233
Only if you come with me.

204
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:12,801
You and maia.

205
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,667
Think about it.

206
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,300
You've given
everything you've had

207
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
to this job for years.

208
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,667
It's time to let someone else
pick up the cause.

209
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,267
It'll be better for you.

210
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,834
It'lbe better for maia.

211
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,601
I have thought about leaving.

212
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,801
Just going qomeplace safe.

213
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,534
It just never seemed possie.

214
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,233
But it is.

215
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:43,034
You have an option
of walking away.

216
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,367
It's important
you remember that.

217
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,400
I've been working
on the video of devon moore

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,801
that's making the rounds
on the internet.

219
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,200
I isolated the audio,

220
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,667
played up
the background noise...

221
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,867
that noise you're hearing,

222
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,300
it's a garbage truck,
moving in reverse,

223
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,001
so wherever the tape was made,

224
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,434
there was the garbage truck
doing its rounds outside.

225
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,001
Okay, well, that
narrows it dow

226
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,167
i mean, a little.

227
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,634
But there must be doze
of neighborhoods

228
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:08,701
scheduled for
garbage collection

229
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:09,867
last night.

230
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,901
That is true, but...

231
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,400
<i>[ship's whistle blowing]</i>

232
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,867
That sounds like a boat whistle.

233
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,400
A ferry whistle,
to be exact.

234
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,934
So they're near the water.

235
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,400
They're somewhere
between edmonds and woodway.

236
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,133
I checked it out.

237
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,601
Those are the only blocks
near the waterfront

238
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,200
with garbage pickups
scheduled for last night.

239
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:31,567
I feel kind of weird.

240
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,467
Iq that normal?

241
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,467
Kevin went through
the same thing.

242
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:40,300
You're lucky, actually.

243
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,734
The promicin
from ryland's company

244
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,068
is pure.

245
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,434
It'll be easier for you.

246
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,100
I wonder what ability i'll get.

247
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm sure it'll be great.

248
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,367
Close your eyes, okay?

249
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:00,534
Rest.

250
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
How is she?

251
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,834
She's fine.

252
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,500
I think.

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,901
She's tired.

254
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,034
It's hard to believe
it's all starting, isn't it?

255
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,634
Everything we've worked for.

256
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,634
It's not hard for me.

257
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,100
I've believed in you
all along.

258
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,767
There was a reason
we were taken.

259
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,500
A reason they woke you up.

260
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:37,467
It's incredible.

261
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,467
You should be getting
the nobel prize.

262
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,400
Instead,
we're hiding like criminals.

263
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:47,233
It won't be like this forever.

264
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,701
Soon we'll be heroes.

265
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,567
Oh, my god!

266
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,233
Call shawn!

267
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,734
Wait... it's all right.

268
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,034
It's all right!

269
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,968
Tess, hurry!

270
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,567
This looks promising.

271
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,068
It's 3516 bay street,
two blocks west of woodway.

272
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,167
Municipal records indicate
it's unoccupied,

273
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,367
but some offshore company
pays the property tax.

274
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,634
Sounds like one of
collier's safe houses.

275
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:23,834
Look at this.

276
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,233
The utilities have
just been turned on.

277
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,567
Let's go ring the bell,
see who answers.

278
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,034
Kevin!

279
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:38,233
It's okay.

280
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,567
There's some men
coming up to the house.

281
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,901
They have guns.

282
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,100
We have to go.

283
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,167
Shh... shh...

284
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,068
shawn, we have to go.

285
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,233
No.

286
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,467
Shawn, ntac is right outside!

287
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,500
We have to leave! Now!

288
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
No! I am not leaving her!

289
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,901
It's okay. It's okay.

290
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,100
Devon, look at me,
okay?

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,200
Just keep looking at me.

292
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,200
Go!

293
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,367
[Shawn]: Devon!

294
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,467
Devon!

295
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,034
Shawn!

296
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,133
Shawn...

297
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,901
step away, shawn.

298
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:28,500
Keep your hands where everyone
can see them, okay?

299
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,500
I couldn't save her.

300
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,467
It's okay.

301
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,267
She's dead.

302
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,500
It's okay.

303
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,968
Come here. Come here.

304
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,734
How could this happen?

305
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,101
How could devon die?

306
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,500
It makes no sense.

307
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,301
Ryland's giving that stuff
to soldiers

308
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,600
and then parading them around

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,900
on national tv.

310
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,234
Well, her body
uldn't handle it.

311
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,301
She died of a massive aneurysm.

312
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,967
Shawn...

313
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,667
you're in a lot
of trouble here,

314
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,900
and the people i work with,

315
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,067
they believe you're involved

316
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,600
in a conspiracy
to distribute promicin,

317
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,633
so you need to talk to us.

318
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:24,500
What were you doing
at that safe house?

319
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,600
Who called you?

320
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,201
I'm sorry
about what happened to devon,

321
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,334
i am,

322
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,767
but...
i've got nothing to say.

323
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,633
Devon wasn't
the first sacrifice

324
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,134
the future has asked of us.

325
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,934
She won't be the last.

326
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,067
We will honor her memory.

327
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,401
We aan do that later.

328
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,767
Ntac has shawn.

329
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,201
It's only a matter of time
before they get

330
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,334
e location of
this place from him.

331
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,734
Need to destroy this stuff.

332
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,034
Cut and run.

333
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,368
Why?

334
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,434
If they want to come,
let them come.

335
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,967
That's why
you have us here, right?

336
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,134
I admire your bravery.

337
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:59,101
We may need it.

338
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:00,734
But not yet.

339
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,001
I tested shawn
to remind him of his loyalties.

340
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,201
He will not betray us.

341
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,667
His loyalties aren't the issue.

342
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,234
We've seen it before.

343
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,600
If the government
wants to know something,

344
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,101
they'll do whatever it takes
to get it.

345
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:12,134
He will be tested,
yes, richard,

346
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,034
but he'll endure...

347
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:16,500
long enough for us
to begin distribution.

348
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,934
"Begin distribution"?

349
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,334
Why would you want to do that?

350
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,500
This stuff killed devon.

351
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,834
A dosage problem.

352
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,767
It has to be.

353
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,567
The promicin from your daughter

354
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,900
is different
from what i've been using.

355
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,101
It's too pure.

356
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,567
Richard, look,

357
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,734
we need people
to develop abilities.

358
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,468
If we stop now,
they will paint us as murderers.

359
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,667
If we keep going,
we are murderers.

360
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,468
Jordan, this is over.

361
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,533
I'm ending this.

362
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,034
[Tess]: Mr. Tyler?

363
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,401
I don't think
you should do that.

364
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,734
We're alunder a lot of strain.

365
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,167
Maybe you should just sit down
for a while.

366
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,234
Let's get this
cleaned up.

367
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,368
We need to be ready
to leave.

368
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,368
Sweetie, do you want
to watch a movie?

369
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,934
You can pick.

370
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,334
April.

371
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,600
Hey.

372
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,101
Hey.

373
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,767
I came by to get my stuff.

374
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:50,700
I packed it up for you.

375
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,867
Oh.

376
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,101
Is that new?

377
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,667
Oh. Yeah.

378
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,533
Little gift myself.

379
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,567
I like it.

380
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,434
Di...

381
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,468
don't pretend, okay?

382
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,834
I did it
to remind myself

383
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,201
who i am.

384
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,967
I guess i wasn't meant
for that whole...

385
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,301
settled thing
i was going for with ben.

386
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,934
I brought you
something.

387
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,234
Oh, you're giving me a present?

388
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:23,734
Mom's engagement ring.

389
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,334
I gave that
to you, april.

390
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,034
I don't have
any use for it.

391
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,700
Besides,
i kind of owe you.

392
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,267
I mean, don't get me wrong,
i'm still pissed,

393
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,167
but you saved me

394
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,134
from being someone
that i'm not.

395
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,667
Thank you.

396
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,334
Just don't invite me over
for thanksging, okay?

397
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,667
Hey, just one thing.

398
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:00,334
When maia predicted
that you would end up with ben,

399
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:03,600
did you really fight against it?

400
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,867
As hard as you told me
that you did?

401
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,334
I thought so.

402
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,001
But to be honest,

403
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,201
now, i...

404
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,134
l-i'm just not so sure.

405
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,533
I'm not at all surprised
that girl died.

406
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,401
That's exactly why
we need to get this stuff

407
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,034
out of
collier's hands.

408
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,700
We need to know

409
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,234
about your promicin
supply, dennis.

410
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,134
Your people have been
working with it for months.

411
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:34,867
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

412
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,167
We've had some casualties
among the volunteers.

413
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,667
Casualties?

414
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,700
How many?

415
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,867
We recruited 20 men
for the ogram.

416
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:49,067
Half of them
rejected the promicin

417
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,667
within 48 hours
of their first shot.

418
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,700
"Rejected"?

419
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,834
You mean "died."

420
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,067
We knew there'd be risks, diana.

421
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,600
We explained it
to the volunteers

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,967
before they signed on.

423
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,533
Oh, my god.

424
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,001
You knew.

425
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,167
You knew what would happen
when people ok this?

426
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,434
Why didn't you tell us
when it was stolen?

427
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,967
We could have warned collier,

428
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,434
warned the public...

429
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,067
because gods
don't make mistakes.

430
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,201
What better way
to show the people

431
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,468
that collier
is not some sort of messiah

432
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:18,700
than have him
fall flat on his face in public?

433
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,533
You kept quiet
so you could discredit collier?

434
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,368
A woman is dead, dennis,

435
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,067
and you're just as responsible
as he is!

436
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,034
She shouldn't have been
injecting stolen promicin,

437
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,368
and anybody who
follows her lead

438
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,567
will have to live
with the consequences...

439
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,234
or not.

440
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,468
So this promicin
that collier's holding,

441
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,767
if you take it,

442
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,500
you have a 50% chance

443
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,934
of dying within 48 hours?

444
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,401
Or a 50% chance

445
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:46,567
of eventually developing
some kind of ability.

446
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,533
We need to hire more agents.

447
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,067
I don't know. 50-50.

448
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,301
Those aren't
very good odds.

449
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,633
For a chance to become
one of the 4400?

450
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:53,667
I think there's
a lot of people

451
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,167
who'd take them.

452
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:57,734
How did your nephew
react to the news?

453
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,101
He's still not talking.

454
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,334
He doesn't think
there's any way

455
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,267
collier will move ahead
with the plan.

456
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,834
Tom, we've been working on him
for almost a day.

457
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,468
We need to step up
the interrogation

458
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:08,533
a couple of notches.

459
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,334
What? No, no, no. No way.

460
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,567
Look, i'm not standing by
while someone tortures shawn.

461
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:16,800
Actually,
that's not what i had in mind.

462
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,934
You want me to help ntac
interrogate shawn?

463
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,201
I don't think so, thomas.

464
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,600
Alana, i wouldn't have
come to you

465
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,001
if i didn't think
it was a good idea.

466
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,334
It'll be just like
when you helped us

467
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,434
with collier.

468
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,867
You use your
ability on him,

469
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,434
and then, when is over,
you just...

470
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:32,700
you'd seen
everything he had.

471
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,900
We just need you to tell us
where the promicin is.

472
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,967
I know,

473
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,867
but when i agreed to help ntac,

474
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,101
i told you
i'd never do anything

475
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,401
to hurt the 4400.

476
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,900
You'd be helping shawn.

477
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,434
And if you don't do it,

478
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,834
ntac would consider that
backing out of your deal.

479
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,434
You'd be a fugitive again.

480
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:56,967
Look, honey...

481
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,167
they're going to get
the information anyway,

482
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,800
and it'll be a whole lot
tougher on shawn.

483
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,967
Hoabout
i call d.c. Myself,

484
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,067
confirm this
so-called "order"?

485
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,334
You do that, nina.

486
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,201
Find out how little authority
you have.

487
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,201
What's he doing here?

488
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:11,834
The u.s. Military

489
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,234
is taking over
the interrogation

490
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:14,633
of shawn farrell.

491
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,067
I'm here as a consultant.

492
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,500
We'll be done with shawn
in minutes.

493
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,767
Alana can get all
the information we need,

494
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,201
quickly and painlessly.

495
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,934
You expect us
to trust that woman?

496
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,934
No, we'll take it
from here, tom.

497
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,633
I have confidence
in my interrogator.

498
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Hi, shawn.

499
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,334
We can do this quickly,
you know.

500
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:45,667
Just tell me

501
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,300
where collier's keeping
the promicin.

502
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,901
No.

503
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:52,467
I'm curious.

504
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,701
The whole time
we were planning our wedding,

505
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,901
you were working with ryland.

506
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,734
Betraying me...

507
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:02,901
betraying your father...

508
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,068
why?

509
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,300
It was a balance of power thing.

510
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:17,867
I was sent
to eliminate the 4400.

511
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:22,133
I really didn't
want to do that.

512
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,367
I loved you, shawn.

513
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,200
But i had to do something,

514
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,834
so i thought if i joined ryland

515
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,968
and helped his side
learn how to create abilities,

516
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:41,901
there'd be a standoff.

517
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,901
If everyone
has the technology...

518
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,167
no one can use it.

519
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,534
Did you really think
that was going to work?

520
00:22:53,667 --> 00:23:07,934
Ryland's
going to use those soldiers

521
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:15,267
baby...

522
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:19,667
please...

523
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,801
where's the promicin?

524
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,400
Baby...

525
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,133
get your hands
off of me.

526
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,801
Now.

527
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:46,133
I wouldn't disturb her
right now, tom.

528
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,200
What are you guys
doing?

529
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,768
Shawn!

530
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,401
Let him go!

531
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,000
Is he alive?

532
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,434
His pulse is weak.

533
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,067
We're going to need
a medical team in here,

534
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:11,067
right now!

535
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,900
Go! Let's go!

536
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,000
Did you get
everything we need?

537
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,367
Newfield is
such a nice little town.

538
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:23,734
When this is over...

539
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,701
kevin's going to retire,

540
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,300
and we're going to
go back there to live.

541
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,401
That's never going to happen.

542
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,000
If people start dying
from that promicin,

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,834
they're going to
hunt us down.

544
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,200
We'll be leaving.

545
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,868
I'd really rather tess

546
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,234
not have to compel
your cooperation.

547
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,868
Give me your word you're aboard,

548
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,300
i'll have her let you go.

549
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,667
I can't do that.

550
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:51,501
I'm not a murderer,

551
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,367
and i'm not about to let you
make me into one.

552
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,967
Do you think
i want people to die?

553
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,334
Do you honestly believe
that's part of my plan?

554
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,734
We will not rce this

555
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,100
on anyone.

556
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,868
We'll make people aware
of the risks.

557
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,234
That's all we're doing.

558
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:12,801
Giving people a choice.

559
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:15,200
They're never going to take it.

560
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,933
How much sadness is out there,
richard?

561
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:22,401
How many people
trapped in dead-end lives?

562
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,367
These shots give them a chance
at the extraordinary.

563
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,501
There will be a demand.

564
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:32,134
And that's who you want
to give these abilities to?

565
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,567
The unhappy?

566
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,801
The lost?

567
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,967
They say the meek
shall inherit the earth.

568
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,868
I guess i just have
more faith in humanity

569
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:43,033
than you.

570
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,267
Yeah, he's stable,
that's the good news,

571
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:56,933
but he hasn't
regained consciousness.

572
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,234
They don't know when he will.

573
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,634
<i>Tom, are you there?</i>

574
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,667
Yeah, yeah, i'm here.

575
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,868
It never ends, does it?

576
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,334
Yeah, i've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

577
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,434
What do you mean?

578
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,033
Nothing.

579
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,000
Nothing i can talk about
right now, anyway.

580
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,334
I'll see you soon.

581
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,634
Thomas, you can't go
up against isabelle.

582
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:21,701
It's suicide.

583
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,000
I have to do it.

584
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Shhas to be stopped.

585
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,434
Shawn was her fiance.

586
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:27,701
If she's willing
to leave him like that,

587
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:30,900
she's willing
to do anything.

588
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,300
The future
trusted me to stop her,

589
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,534
and they gave me
a way to do it.

590
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,300
You'll never
get close enough.

591
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,367
Do you think she'll let you

592
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,634
walk up to her
and use that thing?

593
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:39,900
Look, they never would have
given me this

594
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,401
if they didn't think
i had a chance.

595
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,701
It's okay.

596
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,567
I have to go.

597
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,334
I'm sorry i'm late.

598
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,701
Is it okay
if i sit down?

599
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,933
Maia, i thought
you were going to be

600
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,467
away from school
for a while.

601
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,200
I didn't want to fall behind.

602
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,634
I think that'd be
a bad idea,

603
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:04,000
don't you?

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,033
Uh, sure.

605
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,868
We're in page 37
of your workbook.

606
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,567
Collier?

607
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,834
Hello, isabelle.

608
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,000
That stuff
you're standing in front of

609
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,300
is mine.

610
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,768
It came from me,
and i'm taking it back.

611
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:37,768
That won't change anything.

612
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,067
You can't stop what i've begun.

613
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,467
You know, you seem to be
banking on the idea

614
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:44,200
that i can't hurt you.

615
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,033
I just don't think that's true.

616
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,033
This is no good.

617
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:14,900
There's no promicin
in the substance at all.

618
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,567
I have a message
from jordan collier.

619
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
It's a new world,

620
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,534
and there's no place for you
in it.

621
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,601
We need to get
out of here now!

622
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:15,874
What happened in there?

623
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:19,140
It was all fake.

624
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,808
No promicin.

625
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:22,174
No collier.

626
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,240
What about my men?

627
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,973
They're all dead.

628
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,240
He thought he could kill me.

629
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,541
He was wrong.

630
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,073
Where are you going?

631
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:40,908
Where the hell
is the promicin?

632
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,808
Stop!

633
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:44,374
We have to find collier!

634
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:47,541
That's what i'm going to do.

635
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,841
I'm going to draw him out,
make him come to me.

636
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:53,441
How do you propose to do that?

637
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,340
I'm going
to the center.

638
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,641
I'm going to bring it down,

639
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,607
and everyone in it,
if i have to.

640
00:29:58,607 --> 00:29:59,908
No, you won't.

641
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,808
You work for
the united states government.

642
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,107
You don't walk in there

643
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,474
and just kill people
in broad daylight.

644
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,674
Each of you
will receive one bag.

645
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:14,774
Inside the b,

646
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:16,707
you'll find an envelope

647
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:17,940
with travel money

648
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,007
and the name
of your destination.

649
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,174
We don't have much time. Go.

650
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:23,874
These shots are free.

651
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,940
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

652
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,207
but be careful
to explain the risks.

653
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,140
Okay, come on.

654
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,374
Everybody take one.

655
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,874
That's it.

656
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,140
There you go.

657
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,307
Thank you all.

658
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:37,574
You're about to impact the world

659
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:40,140
in a way
that will never be forgotten.

660
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,774
Thank you.

661
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,674
Dennis!

662
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,207
What the hell
happened here?

663
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,307
Where is she?

664
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:56,707
She's too powerful.

665
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,874
I can't control her.

666
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:01,574
No one can.

667
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:02,674
Dennis!

668
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:03,940
Just tell us where she went.

669
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,841
It's the center.

670
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:20,207
You've got to let me
pick it up.

671
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:24,474
Richard tyler's line.

672
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:25,507
I'm sorry.

673
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:26,674
He's not here
right now.

674
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,040
Oh.

675
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,841
Your daughter's at the center.

676
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:39,140
They think she might
start killing people.

677
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:58,507
So...

678
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,007
who wants to go first?

679
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,574
Any volunteers?

680
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,808
Okay.

681
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:17,240
I'll pick.

682
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,541
What's your name?

683
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:32,140
Amy.

684
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,841
Amy...

685
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,474
i'm going to need you
to hold still, okay?

686
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:39,140
This is
going to be quick.

687
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:48,240
Would you like
to take her place?

688
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,674
No.

689
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:51,574
I just want
to tell you something.

690
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,374
What you're trying to do...

691
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,874
it's not going to work.

692
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,741
Oh, really.

693
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:05,641
I guess we'll see about that.

694
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,641
Everybody get down!

695
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,741
You shouldn't have done that.

696
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,808
Isabelle!

697
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:49,940
What?

698
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:53,474
What, are you going to
tell me to stop?

699
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,541
That it's still
not too late to save me?

700
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,973
It's past that now.

701
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:59,541
You made your choice,
but you're my daughter,

702
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,073
and if you quit this now,
i'll stand by you.

703
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,841
I'm sorry, daddy,

704
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,741
but this is the way
it's supposed to be.

705
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:30,908
Daddy?

706
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,707
Isabelle...

707
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:50,808
isabelle...

708
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,641
i'm sorry.

709
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:55,441
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,574
I wish you hadn't done that.

711
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,774
Isabelle...

712
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:15,940
don't bother.

713
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,107
Please...

714
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:35,107
what's the matter with me?

715
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,340
[Richard]: Hold on!

716
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,607
Her abilities, they're gone.

717
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:46,641
The girl's helpless.

718
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,774
Go ahead.

719
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:04,441
Finish it.

720
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,807
How is she?

721
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:24,573
Isabelle's out of surgery.

722
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,573
She'll be in recovery
for a good while,

723
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,308
but they expect she'll make it.

724
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,540
You know,
for a minute there,

725
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,774
i thought you were
going to put one

726
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:43,207
in her head.

727
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,207
So did i.

728
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:46,807
The shoulder wound
was a good idea.

729
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:47,941
It let us figure out

730
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,141
whether or not
the effects of that syringe

731
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,341
were permanent.

732
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,974
She had started
to heal herself...

733
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:54,440
i had nine more bullets
in my clip.

734
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,274
So, were they?

735
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:59,207
Permanent?

736
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:01,573
According to dr. Anapurn,
it looks that way.

737
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:03,507
There's not a trace
of promicin

738
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,974
in her system.

739
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,241
She's just a normal girl.

740
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,874
A normal girl who's
in a lot of trouble.

741
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:13,473
You both okay?

742
00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:16,807
Good...

743
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:18,607
because you're going to have
to rest up on the fly.

744
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,007
Collier's still in the wind.

745
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,707
So's his stash
of promicin.

746
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,674
The world's
about to change,

747
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,607
and our jobs just got
a whole lot more difficult.

748
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:36,107
More difficult?

749
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:38,274
You up for it?

750
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,308
To be honest...

751
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:44,007
i don't think so.

752
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,440
Make sure you send me emails
and take lots of pictures.

753
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,507
Don't worry.

754
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:59,507
I guarantee there'll be
plenty of pictures.

755
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:02,974
Six months
will go by fast.

756
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:04,607
We'll see each other soon.

757
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:08,141
No, we won't.

758
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,974
We'll be back...

759
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,274
but you won't be here.

760
00:38:15,174 --> 00:38:16,374
Do you hate me?

761
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,974
No.

762
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:21,408
No, it's just...

763
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,640
i don't know how
i'm going to do this job

764
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,674
without you.

765
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,707
I have to leave, tom.

766
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:29,141
If collier's right,

767
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,207
if moving into
this new world of his

768
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,640
means more upheaval
in the here and now,

769
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,074
i am opting out.

770
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:36,507
I'm going to
find myself a place

771
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:37,974
where i can live at peace
with my daughter

772
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:39,041
as long as i can...

773
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,473
diana...

774
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:43,573
you don't have to
justify your choice to me.

775
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:53,408
Do you ever think
about doing the same thing?

776
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:59,540
Yeah, sure.

777
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,174
This job...

778
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,074
this fight, it's...

779
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,007
It's cost me so much, but...

780
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,473
i'm in it till the end.

781
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:15,374
Lucky me, huh?

782
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:40,473
Bye, tom.

783
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:43,274
Bye.

784
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,141
[Engine turns over]

785
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:03,907
<i>[Collier]:
The end of one journey</i>

786
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,241
<i>is always the beginning
of another.</i>

787
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:24,707
<i>Change is painful
and always comes with a cost.</i>

788
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:38,807
<i>It hurts to bear those costs,</i>

789
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:42,041
<i>but we can't allow that
to sway us.</i>

790
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,574
<i>Tomorrow is a mystery,</i>

791
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:51,674
<i>and the only thing we can do
is face it with resolve.</i>

792
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:02,241
<i>We move forward,
always forward,</i>

793
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:04,974
<i>and into what's next.</i>

794
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:08,840
<i>We make a choice,</i>

795
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,641
<i>we act on that choice,</i>

796
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:17,608
<i>and all that's left
is to live in hope.</i>

797
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:20,608
[Kevin]: Jordan!

798
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,807
Jordan...

799
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:25,007
i got the tv working.

800
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:27,507
They're saying
there's a woman in el paso

801
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:28,608
who just checked
her father

802
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:30,341
out of a hoqpice.

803
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:32,341
He had alzheimer's...

804
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,840
until she visited him
this morning.

805
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,474
Come on.

806
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,107
They're talking
about us.

807
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:40,507
Let's go watch it happen.

808
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:45,341
Good luck.

809
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:46,907
Give it to a friend
if you don't use it,

810
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:47,940
but give them the warning.

811
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,207
Now, you understand

812
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,574
what you're about
to do, right?

813
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,074
There are no guarantees.

814
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:55,341
There never are.

815
00:42:00,374 --> 00:42:02,140
No guarantees, now.

816
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,241
How about you?

817
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,574
It's 50-50.

818
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:09,013
You want the shot?
