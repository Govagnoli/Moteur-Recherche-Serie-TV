1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
All right, listen up, everyone.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,499
We're at DEFCON 1.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,300
It's a comet.
It's not a flyby anymore.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,800
A comet cannot change course.

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,499
This one has.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,670
Then it's not a comet.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,660
We're not sure what's happened.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,000
There appears
to be something out there.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,430
The light is gone,

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,100
and-and thousands of people

11
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:22,699
have just suddenly appeared.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,500
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son-

13
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,499
that is my job.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,499
Diana Skouris,
Tom Baldwin.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,600
You two will be
one of the teams

16
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,499
that's responsible

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
for investigating
what happened to the returnees.

18
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,850
And what about my parents?

19
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,700
They're dead, aren't they?

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,330
This is Maia Rutledge.

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
She's eight years old,
only she was born

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,499
in 1938.

23
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
No time has ssed.

24
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,100
Returnee 2117: Shawn Frell.

25
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,300
Uncle mmy.

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,030
Hi.

27
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,130
He's all yours.

28
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,030
Hey, what about Kyle?

29
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,760
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

30
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,830
We're letting them go.

31
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
We're letting them go?

32
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:54,999
We don't have

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,100
a legal right to hold them.

34
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,030
Hey, Mom, Dad!
Shawn!

35
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,530
Hey, buddy.

36
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,530
Remember me?

37
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,859
Nikki?

38
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm Richard.

39
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,160
Lily.

40
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,800
Lily Bonham from St. Louis?

41
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,530
You knew my granother.

42
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
Some of these people
have no place to go,

43
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,930
no families left. What the
hell are you looking at?

44
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,260
I used to live here.

45
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,150
Heidi?

46
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah?

47
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,240
Heidi, it's Mommy.

48
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,800
It's, uh... it's okay,
sweetie, I got it.

49
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,035
Brian.

50
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,199
Lily.

51
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,700
But there's no mistake.

52
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,399
You're definitely pregnant.

53
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,220
It's a temporary
restraining order.

54
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,040
You can't stop me
from seeing her.

55
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
If Orson can do those things,

56
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,900
who knows
where all this is going.

57
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,270
So far we've got one case,

58
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,570
and maybe that's all
we'll ever have.

59
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,200
You haven't noticed
anything unusual with Shawn?

60
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,499
'Cause I just need

61
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,600
to know-
if you had, you'd tell me.

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
What looks good
today, Carl?

63
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,999
I have a whitefish

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,570
with your name on it,
Mrs. Martino.

65
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh.

66
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,299
When you were gone,
in 18 month,

67
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,300
I haven't got a decent piece
of fish.

68
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:02,630
You...

69
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,269
You take care of me.

70
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,830
You are such a sweetheart.

71
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,300
Aw, it's easy
being nice to you.

72
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,700
Tell me,

73
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,800
how does it feel
to be back?

74
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,270
It's okay.

75
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,800
It's good.

76
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,630
Carl.

77
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,370
It's like I never left.

78
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,770
What do you think
you're doing out there?

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,940
I was helping a customer.

80
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,999
Rosie

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,899
can help a customer.

82
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,130
Derek can help a customer.

83
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,100
I told you to stock
the display cases.

84
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,000
BuI-I...
I've known Mrs. Martino

85
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,799
since I was a kid.

86
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,270
And I'm supposed to care?

87
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,530
Now get that
flounder on ice.

88
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,730
Grace!

89
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
So how'd it go today?

90
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,130
It was slow, as usual.

91
00:02:58,131 --> 00:02:59,460
It's the neighborhood.

92
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,130
It's not like it used to be.

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,300
It's not that bad.

94
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,730
Ug It's gotten
a lot worse

95
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
since you were away.

96
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,199
I don't see it.

97
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,900
You don't want
see it.

98
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,299
Okay.

99
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,500
I admit it, it's not like
when we were kids.

100
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah, no one cares
about the place anymore.

101
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,499
There's no pride.

102
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,040
There's no sense
of community.

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I didn't know
you were so unhappy.

104
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm not unhappy.

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Hey, I got you
back, didn't I?

106
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,600
I gonothing to
complain about.

107
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,760
Yeah.

108
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,799
Oh...

109
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,770
Fish smell.

111
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,130
I don't mind.

112
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,700
I'll hop in the shower
as soon as we get back.

113
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,700
Hey, let's cut across the park.

114
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,499
The park?

115
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Nobody goes into
Bradley Park anymore.

116
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:44,000
No.

117
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah? Sure they do.

118
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,500
No.
How do you think I got here?

119
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,600
It's not safe.

120
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,599
There's nothing

121
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,870
but lowlifes
and junkies in there.

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,399
Grace, 15 years ago,

123
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
I proposed to you
in this park.

124
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,240
Aw...

125
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,070
15 years ago?
Yeah.

126
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,470
I was a size 2,

127
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,170
and you had your hair down
to your shoulders.

128
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,800
Things change.

129
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,799
From now on,
you take the long way around

130
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,130
You know, Grace, I just wish
that you'd, you know...

131
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,600
...stop worrying.

132
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,970
Marry me, Gracie.

133
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,600
Of course I will.

134
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,670
Yo, what are you doing
in our park, man?

135
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,600
Your park?

136
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,340
Ju give up your wallet.

137
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,399
You're mugging me?

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Now you're
catching on.

139
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,070
Seven bucks?

140
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,200
It's all I have.

141
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,140
* So long ago *

142
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,300
* Another life *

143
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,240
* I can feel your heartbeat *

144
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,170
* It's not a dream *

145
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,500
* Remember us *

146
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,670
* I can see it inour eyes *

147
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,940
* We'll find our place in time *

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,300
* Our place in time
beyond the sun *

149
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,370
* We'll find our place in time *

150
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,470
* Our place in time
to call our own *

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,699
So the complaints started

152
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,600
right after her foster parents
brought her back

153
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,899
to quarantine last week.

154
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,800
Well, what kind of complaints?

155
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,800
Well, for instance,

156
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,300
yesterday, Maia was talking
to an employee in the cafeteria.

157
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,970
She told her
her daughter would be

158
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
in the hospital soon,
but that she'd be okay.

159
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,640
The next day, the little girl
was in a car accident.

160
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,999
So you're saying what?

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,170
She-She's got some kind
of second sight?

162
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm saying I have five stories
just like that one.

163
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:10,699
Why disappear

164
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,240
a little girl
from the 1940s,

165
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,370
hold her for 60 years,
and then send her back

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
with the ability to
predict the future?

167
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,530
I mean, what were
they thinking?

168
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,400
"They"? We don't even know
if there is a "they."

169
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,100
He, she, it-
take your pick.

170
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,399
Somebody's behind this.
You know, let's leave that

171
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,399
for the team
in the theory room, huh?

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Yeah, when they're not
playing video games.

173
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, that's why they're
intimidated by you, Tom.

174
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,740
They feel your hostility.

175
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,870
Good.

176
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,470
I wouldn't worry too much
about the big brains.

177
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Just talk to that girl.

178
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,560
Thanks.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,700
I never meant
to scare anymore.

180
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,960
We know that, sweeti

181
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,315
But why did
you say those things

182
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,330
to Mrs. Krause
about her daughter?

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,030
Because they're true.

184
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,300
But how did you know?

185
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:05,000
I just do.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,930
If I asked you

187
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,800
whether it was going
to rain next Sunday,

188
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,130
would you know the answer?

189
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,930
Maybe.

190
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,570
I don't know.

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,160
What's going
to happen to me now?

192
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,730
The doctors here are going
to take another look at you.

193
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,770
Oh, don't worry.
It won't hurt.

194
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,940
I don't believe you.

195
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,370
It's going to hurt, isn't it?

196
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
You might be uncomfortable
some of the time,

197
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,600
but mostly, oh,
it's just going to be boring.

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Will you look in on me
every now and then?

199
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,199
Me?

200
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
To see that I'm all right?

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Sure.

202
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,199
It's expensive, though.

203
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
The rental vouchers
will cover it.

204
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,199
So... do you

205
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
have any questions?

206
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,599
Um,

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,740
the small bedroom-

208
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,870
do you think
it'll get too much light

209
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,570
for a nursery, I mean?

210
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,970
It's a northern exposure,

211
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,400
so you should be all right.

212
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,260
So, what do you think?

213
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,960
I like it.

214
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,230
Me, too.

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,170
Is this your first baby?

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,899
Oh, we're not actually
a couple.

217
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,630
Oh, uh, so, it's just you
and the baby?

218
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
No, it'll be the three of us.

219
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,600
Why not?

220
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
You can't stay
in that hotel forever.

221
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,700
We can share this place.

222
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,070
Unless you don't want to.

223
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,340
No.

224
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
No, I'd like that.

225
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:51,570
Great.

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,730
I'll go do the paperwork.

227
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,580
I hope I didn't barrass you.

228
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,400
No, it's... it's not that.

229
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,530
It's, uh...

230
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,460
It's just, I figure
he wouldn't rentou the place

231
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,060
if I was part the deal.

232
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,500
I know, I know.

233
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,260
It's not 1951 anymore.

234
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,530
Times have changed, but...

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,460
Sometimes I'm just surprised
at how much.

236
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,300
Good.

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,260
It's settled then?

238
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,859
Oh, God.

239
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,900
Lily? Lily, what is it?

240
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,700
No.

241
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh.

242
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:46,900
Lily.

243
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,240
No, I... I don't feel so good.

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,550
You need to sit down.

245
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,300
Should I call a doctor?

246
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,099
No, no.

247
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,100
No, I... I just have to leave.

248
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,100
And go where?

249
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,670
Anywhere but here.

250
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,100
Carl, where have you been?

251
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:07,799
I got mugged.

252
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh, God, are you all right?

253
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,499
Did they hurt you?

254
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
No, I didn't get hurt.
They got hurt.

255
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,399
Who did?

256
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,700
Grace, I learned
something tonight,

257
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,730
something important.

258
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm a different man.

259
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
Those aliens-
or whoever took me-

260
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,699
they did something.

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,330
They took me;
they changed me.

262
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,900
They made me better.

263
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,799
I think first thing
in the morning

264
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,700
you should call the counselor
and make an appointment.

265
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,100
What? No.
I don't have time for that.

266
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:30,900
I got things to do.

267
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,930
What kind of things?

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,999
The park, Gracie.

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,950
I want to make it
like it was before.

270
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,900
People will bring
their kids there again.

271
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,899
You and me-

272
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,030
we can have our picnics
at the old spot.

273
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,300
Carl, you're scaring me.

274
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,200
There's nothing to be scared of,
not anymore.

275
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,900
Linda, any idea

276
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,360
why Dr. Mayhew wants to see us?

277
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,000
He didn't say.

278
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,360
So how have you been?

279
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,160
Good.

280
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,800
My lawyer was asking if you'd
signed those divorce papers yet.

281
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,860
I thought maybe if
we had dinner some night,

282
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,460
you know, we could...
sign them together.

283
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,260
Oh, you mean make plans
that you'd cancel

284
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,400
at the last minute?

285
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,330
I'll bring the papers,

286
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,830
we'll have a good meal,

287
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,930
a couple glasses of wine...

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
And a good cry?

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,630
That, too.

290
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,930
Stefano's?

291
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,330
Where else?

292
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,300
Tom, Linda-
thanks for coming in.

293
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,200
I was reviewing
Carl's EEG readout,

294
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,000
and I noticed
something peculiar.

295
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,200
What now?

296
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,760
Well, it seems
last Thursday night

297
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,660
he had a momentary burst
of increased brain activity.

298
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,730
It was brief- no more
than a few seconds.

299
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,530
That's good, isn't it?

300
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,730
Technically, yes.

301
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,860
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

302
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm going to run some tests,

303
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,660
see if I can find
out what happened.

304
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,660
Tests- we've had

305
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,530
three years of tests.

306
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,260
I understand your frustration,
Linda,

307
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,130
but we really need
to look into this.

308
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,830
It's a roller coaster,
isn't it?

309
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,130
It never ends.

310
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,900
Linda...

311
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,930
So, Stefano's, right?

312
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How does Thursday
night sound? 70?

313
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,230
I'll be there.

314
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,900
Dorothy...
Yeah?

315
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,100
Did anyone visit my son
last Thursday night

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,430
besides his mother
and me?

317
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,260
Let me check.

318
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,200
Yes, he had one
other visitor:

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Your nephew Shawn.

320
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,330
Shawn!

321
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah, I went and s Kyle
on Thursday night.

322
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,230
He's my cousin.

323
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
I wanted to see him.

324
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,230
What about it?

325
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,430
And nothing happened
while you were there?

326
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Well, I was ly there
for a couple minutes.

327
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,300
So, you saw nothing,
did nothing?

328
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,330
What could I have done?

329
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,170
The day of your welcome home
party, a bird

330
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,730
smacked into the window,
remember?

331
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,870
Yeah, it was stunned.

332
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,000
at about it?

333
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,470
No, it wasore than that.

334
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,730
And then... you picked it up

335
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,470
and suddenly,
it was alive and well.

336
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,800
What the hell did you do
to Kyle?

337
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,130
I didn't do anything to him!

338
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Look, look, I really like

339
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,770
these little chats we have,
Uncle Tommy,

340
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,100
but I got to go to class.

341
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,970
Shawn.

342
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,130
We'll talk again.

343
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,930
Oh, I can't wait.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,430
A bunch of us are going to see

345
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,670
Fountains of Wayne
this weekend.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,870
Have fun.

347
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,930
You know, um, this whole
loner thing is so tired.

348
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Well, it works for me.

349
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,070
Fountains of Wayne!

350
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,400
Friday night!

351
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
What is with you?

352
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,630
Why do you keep
pushing him like that?

353
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,830
Someone has to.

354
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,600
I don't see you
doing anything.

355
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,300
Well, I'm giving him his space.

356
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,400
Let him figure things
out for himself.

357
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,030
You should try it sometime.

358
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,130
Oh...!

359
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,870
Marco.

360
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,100
Skouris- good.

361
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,200
I checked out your idea.

362
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,500
What idea?

363
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,530
So, am I a genius, or am I crazy?

364
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,630
We don't make that distinction
in here.

365
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,830
of disappearance sites on the
West Coast, like you suggested.

366
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,130
Turns out you were right.

367
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,870
The avity at those
sites is weaker.

368
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,600
But according to
the interferometer,

369
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,100
only by five parts per billion.

370
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,400
That's barely measurable.

371
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,100
Not to mention
barely understandable.

372
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,200
English, please.

373
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,630
The gravity is changed

374
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,830
at some of the places
where people disappeared.

375
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,870
The question is
did it change naturally,

376
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,700
or was it articially manipulated.

377
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,100
Now, if the gravity
was manipulated,

378
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,400
the question then becomes by who.

379
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,500
So we're back to

380
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,770
the possibility
of alien abductions.

381
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,500
I wouldn't rule out
little green men,

382
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,230
but obviously I'm going to need
to take more measurements.

383
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,400
So, in other words,
you've made no progress.

384
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,300
Uh, you explain it to him.

385
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,200
Oh, hold on.

386
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,030
You remember Adam Kensington?

387
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,900
The, uh, insurance guy
Orson Bailey killed?

388
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,400
Yeah, what about him?

389
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,330
Not one of the good guys,
as it turns out.

390
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
He was point man
in a huge insurance scheme

391
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,500
to defraud tens of thousands
of policyholders.

392
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,430
Orson Bailey
saved the State of Washington

393
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,870
like, a billion-dollar buyout.

394
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,770
Could've been Enron
all over again.

395
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,100
God, that's interesting,

396
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,270
'cause that brings up
all kinds of possibilities.

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,100
Well, uh, don't be a stranger.

398
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,770
Oh...

399
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,230
So, this thing about Bailey.

400
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,530
Are you trying to say
whoever sent him back

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,300
meant him to go
after Kensington?

402
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,700
It's a theory.

403
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,700
That's why they call it
"the theory room."

404
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,070
That's tight.

405
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,630
Oh, no, I suck.

406
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,300
Hey, if this is about
the, uh, concert thing...

407
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,370
No, no, no, it's got nothing
to do about that.

408
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,500
I just want to know

409
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,270
what's going on
with you and Nikki.

410
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,670
Me and Nikki what?

411
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,330
I just want to know
what's going on between you two.

412
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,270
Well,
what do you think's going on?

413
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,800
Something.

414
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,570
She's always talking about you.

415
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,830
Can't go anywhere or do anything

416
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,800
without her wanting
to bring you along.

417
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,130
How is that my problem, Danny?

418
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,600
Just do me a favor.

419
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,430
Leave her alone, okay?

420
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,070
Oh...

421
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,530
I thought
that's what I've been doing.

422
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Look, Danny, you got a problem
with your girlfriend,

423
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,430
go talk to her about it, okay?

424
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,700
Hey, uh...

425
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,300
we're the same age.

426
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm not your little brother
anymore.

427
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,830
Then stop ting
like a two-year-old.

428
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,470
You're my brother.

429
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,600
She's your girlfriend.

430
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,630
It's all good...

431
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,200
right?

432
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,770
Yeah, right.

433
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,130
Oh, Richard, I am so glad
we found this place.

434
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
And now that we got an apartment,

435
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,730
we can get you a computer.

436
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
Forget abouthe computer.

437
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,300
I still think we need
to get you to a doctor.

438
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,530
I'm fine.

439
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,400
I know this is going
to sound strange,

440
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,000
but that other place
we looked at-

441
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,830
the baby didn't like it.

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,230
Marnal instinct's
kicking in already, huh?

443
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,930
No, it's not that.

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,670
It's that somehow...
I know what the baby's thinking.

445
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,230
Lily, the baby's
barely two months along.

446
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,130
It's not thinking anything.

447
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,730
Look, I can't explain it
any more than you can explain...

448
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,200
where you've been
for the past 50 years

449
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,100
or, or what's happened
to any of us

450
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,930
during the time we've been gone.

451
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,030
I don't sound too strange, do I?

452
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Of course not.

453
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,030
Lily?

454
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,470
I used to rock Heidi like that
when she was a baby.

455
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,930
It feels like yesterday,
but it wasn't, was it?

456
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,470
No.

457
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,530
It was... what, 11 years ago?

458
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
I want to see Heidi.

459
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,600
I miss her.

460
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,230
Lily, give it some time.

461
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,600
Once Brian
is used to you being back,

462
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,470
he'll drop
the restraining order.

463
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,030
Shut up.
Just shut up!

464
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,930
Stop it! Cut it out!

465
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,100
It isn't funny!

466
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,800
Shut up! Just shut up!

467
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,230
Grab her legs, man.

468
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,700
Hey, guys.

469
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Why don't you leave her alone?

470
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,530
Get lost!

471
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,500
No.

472
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,830
You get lost.

473
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,100
Go get him, man. Come on.

474
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,400
Hey, Maia.

475
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,870
How long have they
left you like this?

476
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,400
A while.

477
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,630
I think they all wt
on their coffee break.

478
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,170
Well, you know...

479
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,400
that's pretty dumb
of them, isn't it?

480
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,300
Will you stay
until they come back?

481
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,100
Of course.

482
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,500
And when they show up,
your doctors and I,

483
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,470
we're going to have
a little talk.

484
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,830
And then can I go home?

485
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,430
Home?

486
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,330
With you.

487
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,100
I don't like being here alone.

488
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,100
You want to come and stay with me?

489
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,270
You don't like
being alone, either.

490
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,730
I can always come back

491
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,500
for my checkups.

492
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,430
Please.

493
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
Look, Maia...

494
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,530
I'm not even sure

495
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,270
I'm the kind of person
I want to live with.

496
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,000
No, I-I eat cold pizza
for breakfast and...

497
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,600
That sounds all right to me.

498
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,230
Yeah, you know, Maia...

499
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,800
Just let me think
about it, okay?

500
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,500
Where have you been?

501
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,530
I was looking in on Maia.

502
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,670
Really.

503
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,570
Well, I promised her,
didn't I?

504
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,030
So, what do you got?

505
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,030
Sid e-mailed the latest
rearch clippings to us.

506
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,970
I think I found something
worth checking out.

507
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,600
One guy taking on three attackers

508
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,830
doesn't sound that farfetched.

509
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,470
I know, but if you saw him

510
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,100
you'd think it was impossible.

511
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,730
He was, uh, 35, 40.

512
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,970
Maybe 5'6".

513
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,230
Wehed 150 pounds.

514
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
So not exactly The Rock, huh?

515
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,930
But it was the way
that he moved.

516
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,070
Could he have been on

517
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,830
some kind of drug, maybe PCP?

518
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,630
He didn't act
like he was on drugs.

519
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,130
You know,

520
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,170
most guys would have walked away,

521
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,000
or, uh, maybe called the cops,

522
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,070
later, after it was

523
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,270
too late, but, uh...

524
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,000
this guy- he saved me.

525
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,670
I'm sorry.

526
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,030
Baldwin.

527
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,700
Linda.

528
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,930
Dinner, yeah. No.

529
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,170
Linda, I'm so...

530
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,200
Don't hang up, Linda.

531
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,800
Just, just...

532
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,700
Is there anything else
you can remember?

533
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,570
There is one thing.

534
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This guy,

535
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,970
I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

536
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,600
but, uh, he smelled funny.

537
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,430
Like day-old fish.

538
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
So that was your
wife on the phone?

539
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,870
Excuse me... I don't
want to talk about it.

540
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,400
Fair enough.

541
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,470
So what, are we

542
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,200
in Orson Bailey territory here?

543
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,900
Well, I wouldn't rule it out.

544
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,130
Which would give us what?

545
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,070
A telekinetic insurance salesman,

546
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,430
a clairvoyant eight-year-old

547
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,870
and now some kind of
sad-sack super-vigilante.

548
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,200
Hell of a trio.

549
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,900
And those are only
the ones we know about.

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,870
Unless you can think
of anyone else.

551
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,630
Just take it one case at a time.

552
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,470
Heidi, do you remember
the formula

553
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,800
for an isosceles triangle?

554
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,030
Hey, buddy.

555
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,030
I saw that.

556
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,900
Richard...

557
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,770
Lily- Thank God.
Are you all right?

558
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,540
I been worried sick.
Where are you?

559
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,240
I've been arrested.

560
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,100
Carl...

561
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,270
I have my grandchildren
coming for dinner.

562
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,170
Uh, how 'bout
some nice swordfish?

563
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,700
You can't go wrong
with swordfish.

564
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,900
Carl!

565
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Uh, give me a second, Burt.

566
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,770
You got, like...

567
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,470
What did I tell you about

568
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,500
chatting with customers
when there's work to be done?

569
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,900
Stop with the finger.
Stop...

570
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,900
I asked you

571
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,300
not to do that.

572
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,400
Let go.

573
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,640
I mean it.

574
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,400
I show up on time.
I do my work.

575
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,800
Now just leave me alone, okay?

576
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,740
Okay, okay.

577
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,200
So, how much swordsh
are we talking here?

578
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm telling you, Tom,

579
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,740
there's a lot of chatter in DC

580
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,540
about putting the 4400
back in quarantine.

581
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Not that I agree.

582
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,900
I mean, if they're
so dangerous,

583
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,500
how is cramming th
all into one space

584
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,000
going to make us
any safer?

585
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,470
So I took my pistol
and I shot her in the forehead.

586
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,170
Shot who?

587
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,300
Do us a favor, Tom.

588
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,040
Sign the divorce papers.

589
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,670
Do me a far, Dennis.

590
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,040
Stay out of it.

591
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,300
I spoke to her.

592
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,540
What are you doing
talking to Linda?

593
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,740
I've known her for 20 years.

594
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
I danced with her at your wedding.

595
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,470
Now I'm not supposed
to talk to her.

596
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,140
I was in the middle
of an investigation.

597
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,700
Tom, you asked her for dinner,
and you stood her up.

598
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,570
It slipped my mind.

599
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,040
Maybe.

600
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,840
Maybe you just don't want to
admit the truth to yourself.

601
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,500
Brian Moore?

602
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,840
Yeah.

603
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm Richard Tyler,
a friend of Lily's.

604
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you another one
of those 4400?

605
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
Is that a problem?

606
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,670
Look,

607
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,400
I warned her;
I told her to stay away,

608
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,600
but she wouldn't listen.

609
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,770
I understand you're set,

610
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,500
but Lily's in jail.

611
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,870
You don't want that.

612
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,170
What I want is a normal life

613
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,270
for my daughter, for my family.

614
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,970
She made a mistake.
It won't happen again.

615
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,370
I'm just supposed to take
your word for it?

616
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,040
I promise, you drop the charges...

617
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,800
she'll never bother you
or Heidi ever again.

618
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,540
You used to love her once,
remember?

619
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, I remember.

620
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,640
I want you to stop.

621
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,900
I can't.

622
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,300
What do you mean, "can't"?

623
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,400
What you're doing

624
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,500
is dangerous,
not to mention illegal.

625
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,770
You can't just

626
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,340
go around beating people up.

627
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,500
I've been given an oppornity
here, Gracie,

628
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,800
and I'm going to take it.

629
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,700
I'm going to clean up that park,
and when I'm finished,

630
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm going to clean up
the whole neighborhood.

631
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,870
Oh, God.

632
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,340
You sound like a crazy man.

633
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,140
You promised me you'd
call your counselor.

634
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
I never said that.
You said that.

635
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,100
Come tomorrow, I'm
going to call him.

636
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,000
You'd call Homeland Security on me?

637
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,470
If that's what it takes.

638
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,640
The way you're acting,
can you blame me?

639
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,570
What I'm doing here
I'm doing for us, Grace.

640
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,700
This is where we live.

641
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,140
I just want us to be happy
and to not be afraid anymore,

642
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,100
and it starts with Bradley Park.

643
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,940
And I don't want it to end there.

644
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,870
It won't. I won't let it.

645
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,170
They can't hurt me.
No one can.

646
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,040
Oh...

647
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,340
You're just one man.

648
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,440
I lost you once,

649
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,170
and I don't want
to lose you again.

650
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,540
I can do it.

651
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,100
I can make this neighborhood
safe again.

652
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,670
For you, for Mrs. Martino...

653
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,070
even Burt.

654
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,570
So please, stop worrying.

655
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,240
This is what I was meant to do.

656
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,540
This is my destiny.

657
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,670
*...or is this your way *

658
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,940
* To hide a broken heart? *

659
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,440
* Many dreams *

660
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,870
* Have been brought
to your doorstep *

661
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,000
* They just lie there *

662
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,870
* And they die there *

663
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,270
* Are you warm, are you real *

664
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,940
* Mona Lisa... *

665
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
This was brand-new
when I disappeared.

666
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,000
And it's a...

667
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,770
What'd you call it, a...?

668
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,270
Golden oldie.

669
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,840
Oh.

670
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
I guess I'm a golden oldie, too.

671
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,900
No, not to me.

672
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,840
Lily, we have to talk about
what happened last night.

673
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,500
No, there's nothing
to talk about.

674
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,870
Do you know what I saw

675
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,800
when I looked
through Brian's window?

676
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,500
A happy family.

677
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,000
I realized Heidi doesn't need me.

678
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,700
Well, maybe one day she...

679
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,940
Yeah, I'll be there
r her, if she does.

680
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,500
But until then, I...

681
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,170
I'll stay away.

682
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,840
This is where I want to be now.

683
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,800
Here with you.

684
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,440
Where I'm happy,

685
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,340
and the baby's happy.

686
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,600
Well, that makes three
happy people then.

687
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,970
All you've done for me...

688
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,940
it's not because I remind you

689
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,070
of the other Lily, is it?

690
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,900
Maybe at first.

691
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,940
But now all I see is you.

692
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,570
* Mona Lisa *

693
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,040
* Mona Lisa. *

694
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,240
Danny's inside.

695
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm not here
to see Danny.

696
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,300
Cute. Could you turn it
back on, please?

697
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,970
Did Danny say something to you?

698
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,770
Is that why you're acting
like this?

699
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,840
Because our friendship

700
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,200
has nothing to do with him.

701
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,200
Nikki...

702
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,570
we don't have a friendship, okay?

703
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,870
Shawn, listen to me...

704
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,900
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

705
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,040
Let me see. Let me see.
Let me see what's going on.

706
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,500
It's okay. It's okay.
Let me see.

707
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,700
It's gone.

708
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,700
It doesn't hurt anymore.

709
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,040
Must not have been
that bad of a burn.

710
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,370
Yes, it was.

711
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,570
You did something
to it, didn't you?

712
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,100
*...And be the one who
catches all your tears *

713
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,170
* That's why I need you to hear *

714
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,940
* I've found out a reason for me *

715
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,740
* To change who I used to be *

716
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,340
* A reason to start over new *

717
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,940
* And the reason is you. *

718
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,040
Tom.

719
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,540
See, the thing about vigilantes

720
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,400
is that they're not very common,

721
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,400
except in Charles Bronson movies,

722
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,400
so I had to create my own profile.

723
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,070
Now, we know he's
a white male, slender,

724
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,700
somewhere between 30 and 50.

725
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,040
He probably works a blue-collar job,

726
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,270
suffers from low self-esteem,
lives in a high-crime area.

727
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I'm with you so far.

728
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,300
Right. So I cross-
checked my profile

729
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,640
with the members of the 4400

730
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,070
in and around the Seattle area,

731
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,070
and I came up with 37 names.

732
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,670
You're not going to take me
through all 37, are you?

733
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,570
Of those 37, I was able
to eliminate 24-

734
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm sure you don't care how-

735
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,240
and that left me with 13.

736
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm on the edge of my seat.

737
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,600
Here are my o favorites.

738
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,400
Robert Laurenzano
and Carl Morrissey.

739
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,000
They both fit the profile,

740
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,270
but Carl- he's our guy.

741
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,170
Check out his occupation.

742
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,870
Supermarket employee.

743
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,540
Yeah. I called the store.

744
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,900
Carl works in the seafood section.

745
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,540
And our guy smelled
like day-old fish.

746
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,500
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

747
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,400
Hey!

748
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,040
What the hell you doing?

749
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
I just cleaned that.

750
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,940
What?

751
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,000
Do you know

752
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,000
where your husband is?

753
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,100
We'd like to talk to him.

754
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,670
Why?

755
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,600
Any idea where he
was Tuesday night?

756
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,100
He was here.

757
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,140
You sure about that?

758
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,740
I just told you.

759
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,540
Have you heard of the Bradley
Park Vigilante?

760
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,540
Wh-What does that have to do
with Carl?

761
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,500
You tell us, Mrs. Morrissey.

762
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,270
You're not going to throw him
back into quarantine, are you?

763
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,570
We want to help him.

764
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,040
That's funny. That's all Carl
wants to do is help.

765
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,540
People grumble. They complain.
Nobody does anything.

766
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,870
Nobody tries to make
anything better except Carl.

767
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,640
Where is he, Mrs. Morrissey?

768
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,370
Carl.

769
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,670
Grace, I got rid
of all the graffiti.

770
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,800
Oh, my... oh, my God, Carl.

771
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,570
Oh, you should've seen it.

772
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,800
They, uh...

773
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,740
they were falling like bowling pins.

774
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
I didn't see the knife.

775
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,640
I don't know why
I didn't see the knife.

776
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,070
Get an ambulance!

777
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,840
It's a nice night.
No, no, no, stay here.

778
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,340
Just sit with me.
No...

779
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
I thought I could clean it up.

780
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,940
I thought I could clean the
whole neighborhood up myself.

781
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
I thought that's why
they sent me back here,

782
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,800
but I guess I was wrong, huh?

783
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,500
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah.

784
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,000
No, don't leave me,
Carl, please.

785
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,670
No, no!

786
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,040
No! I just want you.

787
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,840
I just... I just want you.

788
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,840
No, no!

789
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,170
No!

790
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,670
No...

791
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,700
Why take this guy,
give him enough extra juice

792
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,870
to think he can make
a difference, send him back...

793
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,370
Only to get himself killed.

794
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,870
What's the point?

795
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,170
I wish to hell I knew.

796
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,770
Grace Morrissey,

797
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,640
wife of slain Bradley Park
Vigilante Carl Morrissey,

798
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,470
revealed today that her
late husband was one of

799
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,170
the controversial 4400.

800
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
Mrs. Morrissey went on to state

801
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,640
that her husband was a true
neighborhood hero,

802
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,000
a sentiment echoed
by many area residents.

803
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,600
Local law enforcement officials,

804
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,940
as well as a spokesperson for

805
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
the National Threat
Assessment Command,

806
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,400
refused to confirm or deny
Mrs. Morrissey's statement.

807
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,740
Okay, I got the paperwork.

808
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,770
Okay, I need you to sign there...

809
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,240
and there...

810
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,770
and initial here...
Mm-hmm.

811
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,100
and sign there.

812
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,270
So that's it?

813
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,300
You got Mr. Ryland's
signed approval.

814
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,000
That simplifies things.

815
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,140
I thought you were
one of the doctors.

816
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,240
Yeah. I thought you were asleep...

817
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,570
so you sure fooled me.

818
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,900
How would you like
to get out of here?

819
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:25,940
Now?

820
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,940
Right now.

821
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,100
Look out, look out,
look out. Thanks.

822
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,000
Where'Kyle?

823
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,070
Surgery.

824
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,970
Dr. Mayhew said he's got

825
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,600
some kind of fluid
building up in his skull,

826
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,000
and they're going to try and
relieve some of the pressure.

827
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,970
What do they mean, try?
They said

828
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,770
the draining fluid
might not be enough,

829
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,840
that... that-that more
might build up,

830
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,040
and if it does, then Kyle

831
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,000
could suffer permanent
brain damage within a week.

832
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,770
Uncle Tommy...

833
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,940
Mom's on the way.
