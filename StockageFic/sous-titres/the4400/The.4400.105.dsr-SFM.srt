1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,660
Previously on The 4400:

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,130
We're not sure
what's just happened.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,330
There pears
to be something out there.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
The light is gone

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,800
and thousands of people have
just suddenly appeared.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,800
Diana Skouris,

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,700
Tom Baldwin.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,230
You two will be one
of the teams

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,600
that's responsible
for inveigating

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,850
what happened to the returnees.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,900
We're letting them go.

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,230
We're letting them go?

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,730
You don't ha
a legal right to hold them.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,670
Dennis Ryland,

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,070
I'm Warren Lytell.

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,500
I believe Home Sec
in D.C. mentioned I was coming.

17
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,330
I'm here to clean up your mess.

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,270
The hell you are.

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,190
Now, there's gonna be

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,230
a change around here.

21
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,430
You can either be part of it,

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,770
or you can get swept aside.

23
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,270
I intend to provide a safe haven

24
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,470
for any 4400 in this coury
who needs one.

25
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,230
You'll be our first
official residents.

26
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,530
You know I'm in love
with Richard, right?

27
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,200
Why would I try to break up
you and Richard?

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,230
long as you're on the job,
I feel safe,

29
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,930
and so does the baby.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,430
Two happy residents.
That's a start.

31
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,630
w 'bout Maia Rutledge, age eight,

32
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,170
disappeared in '46.

33
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,870
And there's all these reports of her

34
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,300
making predictions,
ones that come true.

35
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,600
Next thing you know, shs been removed

36
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,630
from quarantine
by one oour field agents.

37
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.

38
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,600
We have to consider the safety
of the other students.

39
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,770
It'll be okay.
No, it's not okay.

40
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,530
Somebody's coming who'll make
everything better.

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,430
Next case, Shawn Farrell, age 17.

42
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,370
Disappeared in April

43
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,770
of 2001.

44
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,770
It's a little thin.

45
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,370
Me breaking up with Danny

46
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,680
has nothing to do with you.

47
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,400
Okay.

48
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,770
I need to ask you a few questions

49
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,930
abt Kyle Baldwin.

50
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,130
I don't know what happened.

51
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
I put my hands on him, that's it.

52
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,500
He woke up.

53
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,830
Don't touch me!

54
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,500
You're my father.

55
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,670
I recognize you,
but I don'know who you are.

56
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,430
What are you doing, buddy?

57
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm looking.

58
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,700
For what?

59
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,070
For me.

60
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,100
I finally understand.

61
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,270
They're not the strangers.

62
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,070
I am.

63
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,830
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.

64
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,100
Kyle?

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,130
I'm not Kyle.

66
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,370
Well, then who are you?

67
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,500
I don't know.

68
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,830
I need more screens.

69
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,670
Okay.

70
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,200
Your son is experiencing

71
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,630
a severe dissociative disorder.

72
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,930
Now, it's not uncommon

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,770
for newly awakened coma patients.

74
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,830
He feels disconnected

75
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,270
from his memories, his personality.

76
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,430
Yeah, well, we knew
when he woke up

77
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,770
there'd be a period of adjustment,

78
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,370
but the kid doesn't even know
who he is.

79
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,200
I know this is frustrating
for you and Linda,

80
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,230
but you did the right thing
bringing him back here.

81
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,600
Yeah.

82
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,900
So what now? More tests?

83
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,300
We need to do another cranial MRI.

84
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,330
They'll be here in an hour
to take him back downstairs.

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,700
Look, I know this is difficult, Tom.

86
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,700
But Kyle's come this far.

87
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,100
We can't give up now.

88
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,730
I think I've got the exact change.

89
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,730
Here you go.

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,830
Hello, cutie.

91
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,170
Thanks.

92
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,200
How long have you known that man?

93
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,470
Tony? Oh, about two years.

94
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,030
He's nice.

95
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,600
He's very nice.

96
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,630
Why do you say that?

97
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,400
He's going to fall in love today.

98
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,400
Tony? My God, good for him.

99
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,730
It's not with me, is it?

100
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,730
Nope.

101
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,670
Yeah, I didn't think so.

102
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,300
Is there something else, Maia?

103
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,430
How long am I going
to be like this?

104
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,870
Like what?

105
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,900
I don't want to know things
before they happen.

106
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,800
I want to be normal,
like I used to be.

107
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,330
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,130
Besides, I mean, you know,
who's normal anyway?

109
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,730
You are.

110
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,100
Ha. You want to know a secret?

111
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,230
Normal people, like me...

112
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,870
they just wish
they were special like you.

113
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,570
The television, put it back on.

114
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,430
Kyle, when you came home,

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
you spent all that time
looking through your books.

116
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,600
Then the maps, now the TV.

117
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,830
Why don't you tell us what
you're looking for, huh?

118
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,800
Maybe we can help you look, too.

119
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,770
You should go home and get some rest.

120
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,870
I'm not aving him.

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,970
All right.
I'll go grab some stuff.

122
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll be back in a half hour, okay?

123
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:04,770
Mm-hmm.

124
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,170
What are you doing?

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Mrs. Baldwin...

126
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,500
You leave him alone!

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,900
Who are you people?

128
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm calling security.

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,670
That won't be necessary.

130
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,930
My name is Agent Warren Lytell.
I work with your husband.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,970
I don't give a damn
who you work with.

132
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,530
Leave him alone!

133
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,870
Tell Tom I figured iout.

134
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,030
I know where
I have to be.

135
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,270
Mrs. Baldwin, don't worry.

136
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,700
He's gonna be safe.

137
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,800
The government's gon be
supervising himedical care

138
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,030
from now on.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,300
* So long ago *

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,370
* Another life *

141
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,870
* I can feel your heartbeat *

142
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,030
* It's not a dream *

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,930
* Remember us *

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,700
* I can see it in your eyes *

145
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,070
* We'll find our place in time *

146
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,100
* Our place in time beyond the sun *

147
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,370
* We'll find our place in time *

148
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,230
* Our place in time to call our own... *

149
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,340
You snatched that kid from a hospital?

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
What were you thinking?!

151
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,140
He's the only witness to an abduction.

152
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,440
He could have some valuable information.

153
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,440
Kyle Baldwin

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,570
can't remember his own name.

155
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,870
Then we'll help him remeer.

156
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,400
His mother's upset. It's understandable.

157
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,570
The family's been through a lot.

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,940
But D.C. sent me here to get some resu...

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Tom!

160
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,140
Where's my son?

161
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,640
Whoa. Get your hands off me, Baldwin.

162
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,940
I swear to God.

163
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,240
I'll ask you one more time.

164
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Ryland, you want to give me some help?

165
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,540
It's a tough call.

166
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,750
Where's Kyle?!

167
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,800
All right, Tom.

168
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,140
You made your point. Put the gun away.

169
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,170
Dennis, Dennis.

170
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,840
Tom, put the gun away.

171
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,640
You should have let me pull the trigger.

172
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,870
Don't think I wasn't tempted

173
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,800
But shooting Lytell
is not gonna get Kyle back.

174
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,200
Maybe not,

175
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,270
but it'd make me feel
a hell of a lo better.

176
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,370
Damn it!

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,870
What I don't understand is why Kyle?

178
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,340
Why didn't they go after Shawn?

179
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440
Because our doctors
have been over Shawn

180
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,470
dozens of times.

181
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Kyle's new territory for 'em.

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,340
New territory?

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,900
That's my son
you're talking about.

184
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,000
You think I don't know that?

185
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,440
Can't you call D.C.?

186
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,100
What in the hell good would that do?

187
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,570
It was D.C. that put Lytell here
the first place.

188
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,240
They're backing his play.

189
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,070
So what then? We do nothing?

190
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,640
I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back.

191
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,000
When?

192
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,970
For Christ's sake, I don't know.

193
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,600
I just heard an hour ago.

194
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,740
I don't know where Lytell put him.

195
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,070
No, not good enough, Dennis.

196
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,440
No. I'm not gonna sit around

197
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,670
while you play phone tag

198
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,000
with some Beltway bureaucrat.

199
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,190
I'm getting my son.

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,870
Hey, Tom. Get your hands off me.

201
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,600
Tom!

202
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,740
We go back a long way.

203
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,170
If you try to go around me on this,

204
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,870
none of it matters.

205
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,870
I know.

206
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,070
Tom, what the hell happened
between you and Lytell?

207
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,200
Ask Ryland.

208
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,340
Tom.

209
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,540
Tom!

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,740
What?!

211
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,500
If you're in trouble, I need to know.

212
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,500
Why?

213
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,500
'Cause I might be able to help.

214
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,590
Diana, just stay

215
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,370
out of it, all right?

216
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Drive the car.

217
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,670
Blood work looks fine.

218
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,540
The Rh factor levels are normal,

219
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,870
and your calcium's okay.

220
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,900
So, how do you feel, Lily?

221
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,840
A little tired sometime

222
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,940
Well, that's to be expected.

223
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,870
Now, where was I?

224
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, right.

225
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm gonna have to draw
some more amniotic fluid.

226
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,870
Why?

227
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Is something wrong?

228
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,670
What kind of genetic anomaly?

229
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,870
All I know is she wants to grow

230
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,870
one of the baby's chromosomes
in the lab.

231
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,500
It'll be okay.

232
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,000
It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes.

233
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,540
Either of you play golf?

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,840
Oh, I'm afraid not.

235
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,400
at's too bad.

236
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,600
Listen,

237
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,000
Jordan, about that doctor
you sent us to.

238
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,970
Roxanne Kern.

239
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,740
She's the best OB-GYN
in the Pacific Northwest.

240
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
You're in good hands.

241
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,670
So, how'd that support group

242
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,140
meeting go the other night?

243
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah, it, it went well.
Thank you.

244
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Nobody complained about the catering?

245
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,490
I have to admit

246
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,940
the, um, lobster sushi was a great idea.

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,270
You see?
You just have to trust me.

248
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,270
This girlfriend of yours

249
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,070
has quite an imagination.

250
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,870
She actually thought I was trying

251
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,270
to steal her away from you.

252
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,640
You believe that?

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,940
Uh, not really.

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,300
I like your confidence.

255
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,300
You see?

256
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,440
You were worried about nothing.

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,540
I wasn't worried.

258
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,900
* Oh... yeah, three to one *

259
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,740
* Lights, camera, transaction... *

260
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,870
We've got to tell him.

261
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,640
I'll do it. It should be me.

262
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,000
When?

263
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,270
Soon. I can't take all
this sneaking around.

264
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,670
Besides, I miss seeing you.

265
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,370
I miss you, too.

266
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,840
* Come one, come all into 1984... *

267
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,370
Yeah, but you suspected
that Shawn had these abilities

268
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,170
from the day of his coming home party,

269
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,800
and you never told me.
I...

270
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,800
Thanks for sharing.
I never told Linda, either.

271
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,070
Yeah, but you're divorcing
Linda - I'm your partner.

272
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,740
Yeah, I know.

273
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,740
When we were first assigned to the 4400,

274
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
you we calling them
disease vectors and viruses.

275
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,040
I know what I was calling them,

276
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,840
but have you noticed
any change in me lately,

277
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,040
maybe because, I don't know,

278
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,970
I have one of them
living in my apartment?

279
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,670
All right, point taken.

280
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,100
Because if the situati
were reversed,

281
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,470
I would have told you.

282
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,770
I know. I heard you, all right?

283
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Can we continue the reprimand later?

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,940
Fine.
Fine.

285
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
Now, what are we gonna do about Kyle?

286
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,900
We?

287
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,900
Of course, we.

288
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,400
We are gonna go find him
and bring him home.

289
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,640
Then we'd better get to work.

290
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry Mr. Collier's not available right now.

291
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,960
I'll have him return your call

292
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,060
as soon as he gets in.

293
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,130
Thank you, Dr. Kern.

294
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,730
Dr. Kern, the OB-GYN?

295
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,760
Mm-hmm.

296
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,460
Jordan about to have a baby?

297
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,360
I wouldn't know.

298
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,260
Ah.

299
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,830
Here's the, uh, security logs
he asked to see.

300
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,200
I'll put them on his desk.

301
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,630
Can I see Jordan's phone logs
for the last couple of weeks?

302
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,660
What for?

303
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,430
He's been receiving
some threatening mail.

304
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,530
Uh, I want to cross check it
with all his incoming calls.

305
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,400
It doesn't leave this office.

306
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,960
Sorry, Mr. Tyler. She can't be disrbed.

307
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,560
Mr. Tyler, please.

308
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,100
This won't take long.

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,030
Dr. Kern...
I told him you were busy.

310
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Lily isn't scheduled for another
appointment today, is she?
No, she isn't.

311
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,730
I want to know why you call Jordan Collier

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,430
every time s comes see you.

313
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,400
My phone habits don't really
concern you, Mr. Tyler.

314
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,930
That's just it - I think they do.

315
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,300
And you're gonna tell me
what Jordan Collier knows

316
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,660
about Lily's baby that she doesn't.

317
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,360
Sickle-cell anemia?

318
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,860
How can my baby have the trait
for sickle-cell anemia?

319
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,060
Unless t father is black.

320
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,530
Maybe he is.

321
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
What are you saying, Richard?

322
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,960
Oh, I don't know.

323
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,730
Maybe whoever took us used me
as some kind of... donor.

324
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,460
The question is,

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,860
why would Jordan have Dr. Kern
keep this from us?

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,330
This baby's carrying
the sickle-cell trai..

327
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
that brings you and I closer together

328
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,460
Maybe he doesn't want that to happen.

329
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,400
Maybe.

330
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,900
I think it's time me
and him have a talk.

331
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,830
Michelle Hickock,

332
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,560
returnee number 938 -
she's coming in

333
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,860
this afternoon at 4:00
for a counseling session,

334
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,630
and I want to see her
afterwards, okay?

335
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,400
He's logged on.

336
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,360
Lytell's on the network.
You're good to go.

337
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,760
Tom really appreciates
your helping him.

338
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm not doing it for Tom.

339
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,700
Come on...

340
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,530
Hey.

341
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,460
So Kyle's being held
at the Quarantine Center,

342
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,800
building nine, subbasement three.

343
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,400
That's great. I owe you.

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,260
Okay, well...

345
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,160
Marco.

346
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,830
Thanks for your help.

347
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,000
No worries.

348
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,230
All right, you ready to roll?

349
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,560
I think we should wait
till after 5:00

350
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,860
when the night shift comes on.

351
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,460
That way, at least they're half staffed.

352
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,660
Okay, I'll pick
you up at 4:00. See you.

353
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,060
Here. This is the place.

354
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,160
It's just outside of the city
in West Bellevue.

355
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,400
How do you know the guy selling
it isn't gonna be there?

356
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,260
He's in Spain for three months.

357
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Another realtor told me.

358
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,530
It'll make a perfect safe house.

359
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,900
Okay, get it set up.

360
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,160
And make sure you're not
followed on the way there.

361
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,560
You think I'm being watched?

362
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,660
Well, if I was Lytell,
I'd keep an eye on you.

363
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,160
Just remember to check your
rearview mirror and stay cool.

364
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,660
I remember what you taught me.

365
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,730
I just never thought
I'd have to use it.

366
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,900
You'll do fine.

367
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,660
I'll get Kyle,

368
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,900
and I'll meet you out there.

369
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,900
I'll be waiting.

370
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,460
And be careful.
I will.

371
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,930
Nice, huh?

372
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,530
I remember how much you told me
you like moonstones.

373
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,430
I do.

374
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,530
But I-I can't accept these.

375
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,560
Why not?

376
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,160
I mean, I got them for you.

377
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,730
Come on, Nikki.

378
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,030
Look, I know I messed up.

379
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,300
Didn't Shawn talk to you?

380
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,860
Shawn. What does he have to do
with anything?

381
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,760
Come on. Nikki?

382
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,860
* It's been a while *

383
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,930
* Since I could call you... *

384
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,730
Hey, Dawn. Hey.

385
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
Maia ready?
Maia's over by the playground

386
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,730
talking with one of your colleagues.

387
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,760
Some of the clothes look funny,

388
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,360
and the cars.

389
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,760
But I don'know,
video games are kind of fun.

390
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,500
Did you like the video games in
the rec room at Quarantine?

391
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,630
There are so many people,

392
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,630
I hardly ever got a chance to play.

393
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,500
Lytell!

394
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,730
What are you doing here?

395
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,300
Just talking with Maia.

396
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,760
I'd heard so much about her,

397
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,430
I thought it was time we met.

398
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,460
Stay away from her.

399
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,600
That's not really your call,
now, is it?

400
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,500
Maia, it was nice talking with you.

401
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,300
We'll do it again soon.

402
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,630
I don't like him.

403
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,330
And he doesn't really like me, either.

404
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,330
Well, don't you worry about him.

405
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,130
Are you sure?

406
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,660
Oh... you listen to me, Maia.

407
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,160
I am absolutely sure.

408
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,860
I am not gonna let anything bad
happen to you, you hear me?

409
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,530
All right?

410
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,330
Okay.

411
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,260
Jordan, you have a minute?

412
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,260
I know why you're here.

413
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,000
Roxanne Kern called me

414
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,200
as soon as you left her office.

415
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,530
Look, Richard,

416
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I hope you and Lily
aren't blowing this up

417
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,660
into something bigger than it is

418
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,360
just 'cause some doctor's
trying to land

419
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,000
on the good side of my checkbook.

420
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,230
Lily and I appreciate everything
you've done for us,

421
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,560
from the house to my job.

422
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,560
Our lives have been a lot more
comfortable since we met.

423
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,500
You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you?

424
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,460
But we think it's time you back off

425
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,700
and let us run our own lives.

426
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,630
Whatever you want.

427
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,600
Tell Lily I said hi, will you?

428
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,030
I'll do that.

429
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,030
You good to go?

430
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,530
Just give me a sec.

431
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
Gloria, just remember what I told you.

432
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,360
Don't answer the door

433
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
to anyone you don't know, okay?

434
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,360
Cool.

435
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,400
You leaving now?
Yeah, but don't worry, sweetheart,

436
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,030
'cause I'll be back before
you wake up, all right?

437
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay.

438
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,200
All right.

439
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,430
There you go. Bye.

440
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,500
Diana.

441
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,730
Don't worry.

442
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,130
You'll find him.

443
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,560
Find who?

444
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,800
Your son, Kyle.

445
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,860
He's the answer.

446
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,900
The answer to what?

447
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,860
Everything.

448
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,070
I want to see, uh,
Kyle Baldwin, please.

449
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,640
You're not on the authorization list.

450
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,470
Oh, no, no, I'm just
a friend of the family,

451
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,200
and I want to know that he's all right.

452
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,040
'Cause he's not even one of the 4400,

453
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,540
and his father works with me at Intec,
and I don't know,

454
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,370
if you could just give me something
that I could tell him.

455
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,040
'Cause...

456
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,070
come on, we're both supposed to be
on the same side, right?

457
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,570
I'll see what I can find out.

458
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,470
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

459
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,870
That's great.

460
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,070
It's all right, you won't even have

461
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,340
a headache when you wa up, okay?

462
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
Oh, well, maybe a little headache.

463
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,940
Come on in.

464
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
Kyle, buddy.

465
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,070
It's me, buddy, okay, huh?

466
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,600
Huh?

467
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,790
Highland Beach.

468
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
Yeah, what about it?

469
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,170
That's where I have to go.

470
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,500
Highland Beach?

471
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,570
Let's get you out
of here first, okay?

472
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,530
Come on, up.
Okay?

473
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,600
We got him, Linda.

474
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,500
Yeah. No, he's sitting
right here next to me.

475
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,500
He's about the same.

476
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,870
No worse, anyway.

477
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,300
I'll see you in a little while.

478
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,830
How far away is the safe house?

479
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,330
It's about 30 miles.

480
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,900
Your mom's waiting for you, buddy.

481
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,800
No.

482
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,500
Highland Beach.

483
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey!

484
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,130
Kyle! No, let go.

485
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Kyle, Kyle, stop!

486
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,370
Highland Beach!

487
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,430
Kyle, let go, Kyle!

488
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,670
Back off! Calm down!

489
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,670
We have to go there.

490
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,830
We have to go there now.

491
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,130
What's at Highland Beach?

492
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,300
That's where Shawn disappeared.

493
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,770
I have to go back there.

494
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,770
Just, just

495
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,370
calm down, buddy.
Just...

496
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,000
If that's what you want,
we'll-we'll take you.

497
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,530
You sure about that?

498
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,570
Kyle's the answer, right?

499
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,530
Two of your agents are operating
outside of the tent.

500
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,630
I noticed.

501
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,000
Do you know why?

502
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,270
Because you pulled the Baldwin kid

503
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,530
out of the hospital.

504
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,730
Yeah, well, D.C.

505
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,270
wouldn't see it that way.

506
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,630
D.C. thought it was a good move
to send you here.

507
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,230
Well, you gonna bring him in or not?

508
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,070
Find him.

509
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,130
So, these are the
names of the people

510
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
who are coming to the next
support group meeting.

511
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,900
It's a little bigger
than the last one,

512
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,670
so we may need a couple more tables.

513
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,030
I'll take care of it.

514
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,170
Thank you.

515
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,500
Lily?

516
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,770
Can I e you for a minute?

517
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,100
Um, I-I have a few errands to run.

518
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,600
is won't take long.

519
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,670
Where'd you get this?

520
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,430
I've been doing security
checks on everyone

521
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,130
who's moved into the complex.

522
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,900
Well,

523
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,870
don't look shocked, Lily.

524
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,630
I mean, consider my position.

525
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,770
A lot of people, including half
my own board of directors

526
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,530
would love to see me
fall on my face here.

527
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,270
A scandal like this would give
them the last bit of leverage

528
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,900
they need to force me
out of the company

529
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,200
and put themselves back in power.

530
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,900
Richard would ver do anything
like this.

531
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,600
I'd have thought so, too.

532
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,270
I guess we were both wrong.

533
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,400
Do you really think

534
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,370
this is gonna change the way
I feel about him?

535
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,030
That's up to you.

536
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
But, Lily,

537
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,330
you really have to a yourself...

538
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,830
is this the man you
want raising your baby?

539
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,330
Aren't you gonna say something?

540
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,170
It was my 23rd birthday.

541
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,700
A bunch of guys from the barracks

542
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,670
invited me out
to a bar.

543
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,430
You don't drink.

544
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,770
Didn't then, either.

545
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,270
But these guys -

546
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,730
it was a big deal
they asking me to come along.

547
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,070
In those days,

548
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,600
Negroes and whites didn't do
much socializing.

549
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,370
So, I went.

550
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,130
It was kind of nice, you know.

551
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,430
Then this...

552
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,630
woman started coming on to me.

553
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,770
People started staring.

554
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,730
So...

555
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,800
I figured it was time
for me to get out of there.

556
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,700
She followed me outside

557
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,200
and asked me to go home with her.

558
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,730
I declined respectfuy.

559
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,930
That's when she started screaming.

560
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,270
That's it?

561
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,300
That's all that happened?

562
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,770
That's all it took in 1945.

563
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,500
Because the statement
the woman made to the police-

564
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
I mean, it's so detailed.

565
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,630
Lily, none

566
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,800
of it's true.

567
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,330
If I hadn't been completely
exonerated of those charges,

568
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,630
do-do-do you think

569
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,070
the Air Force would-would
have sent me

570
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,230
to flight school?

571
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,370
Made me an officer or a pilot?

572
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,330
The woman lied.

573
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,530
The charges got dropped.

574
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,830
Why would Jordan bring
any of this up?

575
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,700
He wants you to start doubting me...

576
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,200
doubting us.

577
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,770
Do you?

578
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,130
We got to pack
whatever we can in five minutes.

579
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,330
We're gettg out of here.

580
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,970
They're heading west

581
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,400
on Sandberg.

582
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,530
There are no freeways in that direction.

583
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,800
Highland Beach.

584
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,770
I bet that's where they're going.

585
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,500
Have my car brought around.
I'm coming.

586
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,970
I don't care what the hell you do.

587
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,170
Just keep your mouth shut
and stay out of my way.

588
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,200
Come on, Mom are you serious?

589
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,830
The movies-- like, you and me?

590
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,100
Is that so weird?

591
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,500
I mean, we used to g
to the movies all the time.

592
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,170
Well, when I was six.

593
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,030
Shawn!

594
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
You prick.

595
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,530
Get... Oh!

596
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,470
Danny.

597
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,500
Danny...

598
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,870
listen to me.

599
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,500
You goddamned freak...!

600
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,300
Danny, stop this!

601
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,000
Boys, please!

602
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,700
Danny

603
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,330
Shawn, stop! Please!

604
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Goddamn it,

605
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,100
stop blaming me for Nikki!

606
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,230
Don't you see it's over
between you two?!

607
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,700
That's enough!

608
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,100
Danny?!
Shawn, stop it! You're killing him!

609
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,470
What did you do?

610
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't know.
I didn't mean to do anything.

611
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,270
Danny?

612
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,430
Get away from him!

613
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,270
Shawn?

614
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,470
What happened?

615
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,700
I heard you guys shouting.

616
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,000
Don't touch me.

617
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,070
What?

618
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,470
Don't touch me.

619
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Ah. You're the only good thing
that's happened to me

620
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,200
since I've been back.

621
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,270
But I can't stay here,

622
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,370
and you can't come where I'm going.

623
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,470
Shawn.

624
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,270
I love you, Nikki.

625
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,300
I love you.

626
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,700
What are you doing?

627
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,370
Shawn?

628
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,630
What... No.

629
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,500
Stay here and talk about this.

630
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,070
Shawn?

631
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,830
Shawn, what are you doing?!

632
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,270
Shawn!

633
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,930
What's all this?

634
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,870
What's it look like?

635
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,600
Have you two thought
about what you're doing?

636
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,870
I mean, really thought about it?

637
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,070
Because let me remind you,

638
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,270
it is dangerous outside those gates.

639
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,600
We'll risk it.

640
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,230
Lily, think about the baby.

641
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
What does the baby have to do with this?

642
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,370
Everything.
That baby could be the key

643
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,630
to the future, and it has

644
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,430
to be protected, and I can do that,

645
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,000
better than Richard, better than anyone.

646
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,830
Lily, get in the car.

647
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,070
I'm afraid I can't

648
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,870
let you do that. Stay away from her.

649
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,130
Oh, God.

650
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,030
Oh, God, God...

651
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,500
Go ahead, run!

652
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,230
It won do you any good.

653
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,300
I will find you.

654
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,000
That baby belongs with me.

655
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,400
Kyle.

656
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,900
Damn it, Kyle, we've been
walking for ten minutes.

657
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,170
What are you looking for?

658
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,700
Maybe we can help you, Kyle.

659
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,300
This was where we found him.

660
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,400
We're running out of time.

661
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,740
Kyle, I brought you here like you asked.

662
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,470
But if there's something you need to do,

663
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,040
you better do it fast.

664
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,200
I belong here.

665
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,240
I tried really hard.

666
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,070
And no matter what I've done,

667
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,300
which way I've turned, it just...

668
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,370
It sucks.

669
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,870
I need to clear my head
and get away for a while.

670
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,840
I guess what I'm asking is

671
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
if I could stay here for a while.

672
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,600
Shawn, you're one of the 4400.

673
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,870
As far as I'm concerned,

674
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,700
you can stay here as long as you want.

675
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,270
That's great, man, thanks.

676
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,200
Thank you.

677
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,840
So, um, tell me a little more
about this ability of yours.

678
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,900
Any idea where we're headed?

679
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,340
I'll know it when I see it.

680
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,400
He's gonna come after us.

681
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,570
Baby likes that.

682
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,140
You know, it really
wouldn't be so bad, would it?

683
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,370
If you were the father?

684
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,340
No, it wouldn't be bad at all.

685
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,170
That's their car. Let's go.

686
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,570
Now listen, these are not criminals here.

687
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
These are two of our own.

688
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,000
I want you to keep your gun holstered.

689
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,070
There's no cause for anybody to get hurt.

690
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,800
Kyle, they're coming for you.

691
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,540
They're gonna want to take you away.

692
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,570
They're too late.

693
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,400
Kyle. Kyle!

694
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,840
Don't!

695
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,700
Kyle.

696
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,500
Tom.

697
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,070
You're not my son, are you?

698
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,340
No.

699
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,570
Kyle was meant to be a channel...

700
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,470
a way to communicate.

701
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,200
Communicate with who?

702
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,000
With you.

703
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,700
To guide you in your dealings

704
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,940
with the returnees.

705
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,670
But something went wrong.

706
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,800
Shawn interrupted the process.

707
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,770
That's what put him in a coma.

708
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,300
He was like that
for three years because of you.

709
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,000
Tom.

710
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,500
Tom.

711
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,300
Tom.

712
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,500
Who are you? What are you?

713
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm human.

714
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,300
Like you.

715
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,770
No, you're nothing like me.

716
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,200
I come from a different time.

717
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,840
That is all.

718
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,870
Your future.

719
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,140
Is that where you took them?

720
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,670
My nephew and, and all the others?

721
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,500
We needed them.

722
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,540
For what?

723
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,600
To survive.

724
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,070
Skouris.

725
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,900
Skouris.

726
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,740
In my time, humanity is dying out.

727
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,900
You mean, it's all going to end?

728
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,570
Everything?

729
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,900
What in the ll is going on?

730
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,900
I don't know.

731
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,040
Kyle brought us out here.

732
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,300
It's like he knew it was gonna happen.

733
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,500
Did you ever think

734
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,800
that maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin?

735
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,400
He kept claiming he wasn't.

736
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,140
Maybe he's telling the truth.

737
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,800
Hey, Tom.

738
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,640
Tom, are you all right?

739
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,740
We can't just stand around.

740
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,740
We got to do something.

741
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
He could take Baldwin with him

742
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,000
or kill him.

743
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,240
Hey, nobody is going to do anything

744
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,600
until we know what's going on in there.

745
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,770
Only those we took can prevent
the catastrophe from happening.

746
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,340
That's why they've

747
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,900
been altered and seeded
back into the timeline.

748
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,340
But why here? Why now?

749
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,370
'Cause history tells us this is where
the path to oblivion began.

750
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,270
And-and the people you took?

751
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
They're going to stop that from
happening - how?

752
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,240
They've already begun their work...

753
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,770
and you've begun yours.

754
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,440
Tom, come on.

755
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,040
Do something, Ryland, or I will.
That's it.

756
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,170
I need you out of there.

757
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,070
I don't understand.

758
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,570
What... what is their work?

759
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,170
What are we supposed to do?

760
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
You have to help them.

761
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,500
Help them? How?

762
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,640
How?

763
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,700
You're bleeding.

764
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,600
Oh, God. G-Get an ambulance. Now!

765
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,740
Kyle... Kyle, no, Kyle,

766
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,700
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

767
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,700
Stay-stay with me, stay with me, Kyle.

768
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,200
Stay with me. Just stay with me.

769
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,040
Look at me, look at me, look at me, Kyle.

770
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,570
Stay here, stay here.

771
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,770
No, no, no...

772
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,670
Kyle... Kyle...

773
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,100
Kyle, look at me, look at me.

774
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,240
Stay with me Kyle, stay with me.

775
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,740
Stay with me, come on.

776
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,070
Stay with me.
No.

777
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,670
Come on, come on.

778
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,540
No.

779
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,500
No...

780
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,000
No... no, no!

781
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,370
Tom.

782
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,500
Dad?

783
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,500
Kyle?

784
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,840
What are you doing here?

785
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,470
Where's - where's Shawn?
Kyle?

786
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,140
Oh, I-I can explain about the beer.

787
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,700
No.
I-I...

788
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,040
Oh, forget the beer.

789
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,200
You don't have to explain anything.

790
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,370
What's going on?

791
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,900
Tom.

792
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,870
Tom, what did you see?

793
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,900
I got you.

794
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,470
The baby.

795
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,000
It's time?

796
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,240
Mm.

797
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,000
I'll get the car.
