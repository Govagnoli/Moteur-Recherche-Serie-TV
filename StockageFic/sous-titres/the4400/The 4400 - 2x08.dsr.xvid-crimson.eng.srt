1
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:38,107
we are not a threat.
we are salvation.

2
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,408
the world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,009
previously on the 4400

4
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,510
remember me?

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,311
Nikki?

6
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,112
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.

7
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:49,513
Dan-- oh!

8
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,714
Danny!

9
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:51,623
Danny!

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,564
Stop blaming me for nikki!

11
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,816
Shawn, stop it.
You're killing him!

12
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,890
So this whole "see the future" thing.

13
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,859
it doesn't just apply to
earth-shattering events. huh?

14
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,006
Not always.
That one.

15
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:08,019
Baby girl, you are my new lucky charm.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,360
Do you know what I bet?

17
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,013
Try my mother's diamond engagement ring.

18
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:12,839
and now it's gone.

19
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,672
You said winning didn't matter.

20
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:16,014
You said you liked me.

21
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,522
This was all just a test...

22
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:18,723
and you failed.

23
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,024
This doesn't sound like me, lucy.

24
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,068
So change it.

25
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,060
You're the boss.

26
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:22,826
Matthew ross.

27
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:23,527
Yes.

28
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,536
Jordan made it clear that
in the event of his death.

29
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:27,755
I was to step up front and center to help you out.

30
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,827
The ground just shifted under your feet.

31
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,130
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,930
The fact is that everyone
alive today owes jordan collier.

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,631
He had a vision to save the future.

34
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,032
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.

35
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,437
I don't know how I got there.

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,697
Please. believe me.
I had another blackout last night.

37
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:02,534
Kyle?

38
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:04,835
Kyle!

39
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,936
Yeah, I'm in here.
Hold on a sec.

40
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,537
It's 10 after 8:00.
You taking the day off?

41
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,008
I guess my alarm didn't go off.

42
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,664
You'd better get moving.

43
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,599
Your first class is at 9:00 on tuesdays, right?

44
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,042
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,376
Want me to get you some smelling salts?
Come on, buddy. it's time to roll.

46
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,117
Let's go.

47
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,497
Alana called last night.

48
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,669
I forgot to tell you.

49
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:28,951
She's in barcelona, kyle.

50
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:31,812
There's only like a 20-minute
window when we're both awake.

51
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:32,913
Any message?

52
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:35,514
Yeah, She...she.uh.

53
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,961
she bought a couple of paintings for her gallery.

54
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,185
and she misses you.

55
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,116
Next time she calls and I'm not here-- yeah.

56
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,436
yeah. I'll try to remember.

57
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:43,575
I've got to get ready, Okay?

58
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,600
Right, Well, I can't wait.
You're going to have to grab the bus.

59
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,027
and don't leave your towel
on the bathroom floor again. okay?

60
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,719
Ben?

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,620
Tyler?

62
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,021
My god. You haven't changed.

63
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:29,222
50-year vacation will do that for you.

64
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:30,423
You look...

65
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:33,324
I look old.Especially next to you.

66
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,825
I had you beat by eight months.

67
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,426
Last time I saw you was...

68
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:40,427
in a tent, Outside of sinanju, Korea.

69
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,728
May 11th. 1951.

70
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:43,929
You remember the date.

71
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,669
Sometimes I have trouble
remembering my grandkid's birthday.

72
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,653
but that's a day that I'll never forget it.

73
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,331
I mean, lee hit you.
and you, uh...

74
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,532
I don't know, you disappeared.

75
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,433
So. what are you doing here, ben?

76
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:12,934
You remember milton weinberg,
your old wingman?

77
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,535
Milt was the first guy who invited me over
to sit at his table in the officers' mess.

78
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,336
He passed on.

79
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,537
Parkinson's disease.

80
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,738
I'm sorry.I knew you guys were close.

81
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,539
And I'm sure he would
want you at the funeral.

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,247
Is.uh...
lee going to be there?

83
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,042
We treated you as an equal.

84
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,206
but that wasn't good enough for you.

85
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,513
You had to cross the line.

86
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:44,844
None of us has spoken to lee in years.

87
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,545
I'll be there...

88
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,346
out of respect for milt.

89
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:04,347
Is he okay?

90
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,048
Better than okay.

91
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,097
Heart rate, respiration, reflexes...

92
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,568
all above average.

93
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,550
Say hello to your healthy child.

94
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:17,851
Edwin.I...

95
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,952
I can't even find the words.
We don't know how to thank you.

96
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:24,153
And he's going to know all about you.

97
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,554
the nurse who changed his life.

98
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:28,855
Enjoy your son, mr. And mrs. Ward.

99
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,756
Keep him safe.

100
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,658
Edwin.do you have a second?

101
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,459
I'm sorry. doctor.
I'm due in the nursery.

102
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,960
It can wait.

103
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,161
I want to know what
you did to the ward baby.

104
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:53,362
We did amnio in the first trimester.

105
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,573
That baby was diagnosed
with prader-willi syndrome.

106
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:57,474
Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests.

107
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,275
You saw those results, edwin.

108
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,022
The 15th chromosome was damaged.

109
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:03,639
That indicates severe
mental retardation at birth.

110
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,007
but their kid just scored
nine on the apgar test.

111
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,208
A miracle is traditionally cause
for celebration, not an inquisition.

112
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,109
This is the fourth time this
has happened in the last six months.

113
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,510
In every one of those cases.
edwin. you are the attending nurse.

114
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,011
And you're one of the 4400.

115
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,182
I'm not sure I see the connection.

116
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,248
Everyone's read about that
kid who's running the 4400 center now.

117
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:28,891
They say he's cured diseases like A.L.S..

118
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:31,885
Diseases no hospital in
the world can put a dent in.

119
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,885
He's a healer.

120
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,286
So are you.

121
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:42,787
For me, it only works in utero.

122
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:46,088
I can feel the damage
to their chromosomes.

123
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,189
I'm not sure exactly how it works.but,

124
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,000
somehow, I'm able to repair them.

125
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,301
That's incredible.

126
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:56,586
Dr.Hodler,
if it's all the same to you.

127
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:58,764
I'd prefer to work anonymously.

128
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:02,103
There are already rumors in
this hospital of miracle births, edwin.

129
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:04,204
and people talk.

130
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,205
I don't think you're
going to have that option.

131
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,957
<i>So long ago.</i>

132
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,465
<i>another life</i>

133
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:14,058
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>

134
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:19,141
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>

135
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:23,288
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

136
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:26,916
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

137
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:31,949
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>

138
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,362
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

139
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:41,428
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>

140
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:54,013
Wait a minute.

141
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:58,014
xxxx

142
00:08:58,315 --> 00:08:59,315
Maybe we missed something.

143
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:02,516
There were a thousand people at
the party where collier got assassinated.

144
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:06,417
Wouldn't you think that they could at least
send us a new set of completely useless files

145
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,218
Any hot leads in there?

146
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,619
I didn't think so.

147
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm pulling you off the collier case,
just for the moment.

148
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,821
Something important, I hope.

149
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,522
One of the files in the morning
research report caught my eye.

150
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,923
There's an internet chat
room for pregnant women.

151
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,759
Yesterday,someone
started a thread about some

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,304
unexplained reversals of
birth defects at mercy hospital.

153
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,825
So you're yanking us off collier
to check out internet chatter?

154
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,326
There's a 4400 who works at the hospital.

155
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,427
Bingo.

156
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:32,328
Edwin mayuya.
He was born in rwanda.

157
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,119
So this guy's some kind of healer?

158
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,920
According to the internet.
Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog.

159
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,244
It's not like I mind.

160
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,245
It's great if he is, of course.

161
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,522
We should invite him to the center.

162
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:44,323
At the very least,
I think mr.Mayuya merits a sitdown.

163
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,224
All right, set it up.
I'll be there.

164
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,825
Why don't you let me
handle the meet and greet?

165
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:50,626
I'll figure out if there's
anything to these stories.

166
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:52,720
In the meantime,

167
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,921
there's a move I'd like
you to consider making.

168
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,128
Call it the next phase in
your development as a leader.

169
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,729
Matthew, I told you,
I will read the art of war, okay?

170
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,430
I want you to call your mom.

171
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I know jordan counseled you
to distance yourself from your family.

172
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
Before jordan was telling me anything,

173
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,500
my family had already distanced themselves from me.

174
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Family dynamics are complex.

175
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
I don't think that a phone call

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
is going to lead straight into some kind of group hug.

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,100
Even if it leads to just dinner,

178
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
you're heading in the right direction.

179
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,200
But,matthew

180
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,200
what is it to you?

181
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Right now,every news desk in the country

182
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,200
is taking a long,hard look at you.

183
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,400
They're looking for a weakness.

184
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,100
And because I'm not speaking to my family,

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,300
that implies what?

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Everybody here is supposed to do likewise?

187
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
The press will spin it that way.

188
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
That's how they smear us with the "cult" label.

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
You want me to stir up all of this old business

190
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100
as a publicity ploy?

191
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,500
You can take care of it now,or wait

192
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
and see it splashed all over the newspapers.

193
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Here's your mom's phone number.

194
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,600
In case you forgot.

195
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
comes in and says,

196
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,600
"how do you think I rang the bell?"

197
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,000
We were just saying,what a nice ceremony this was,Old milt

198
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
he left a great family behind.

199
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
He had a lot of love to spread around.

200
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,000
We thought you got killed,

201
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,000
or captured, maybe.

202
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
There was some talk you went awol.

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
None of us put any stock in that.

204
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,200
Disappearing in a beam of light-- nobody thought of that,huh?

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,300
Hey,uh, you in town tonight?

206
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,500
Oh, good.We're going to have our own private wake for milt down at chauncey'S.

207
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,500
You know he loved his bud,

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,100
so we're going to hoist a few in his memory.

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,000
You should come.

210
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,900
We'll kick around old times.

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,100
"Old times" was hardly more than a year ago for me.

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,100
You can fill in the gaps,then.

213
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
There's a lot of stuff we don't remember anymore.

214
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers?

215
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,200
Wouldn't miss it.

216
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,900
Ntac has examined me several times already this year.

217
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,900
I don't think I'm due for another for?

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,700
three months,I believe.

219
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,700
You've never missed an appointment.

220
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
We appreciate that.

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,500
You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability.

222
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,300
It's a kind of earth-shaking one,I have to say.

223
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Forgive me,

224
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,400
but I don't see how submitting

225
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,800
to another round of tests helps anyone.

226
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,400
These mutations you can induce--

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,600
I believe they are not mutations,sir.

228
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,600
I believe they are repairs.

229
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Either way,our doctors need to take a look at you.

230
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,500
If they can figure out the way your ability works,

231
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,700
it could help a lot of people.

232
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,700
All right,then.

233
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,000
I will let your doctors poke and prod me to their hearts' content.

234
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
But I ask one thing--

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,500
that you allow me my privacy.

236
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I do not want to become a public figure.

237
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Well,that works for us.

238
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,200
I mean,whenever a new ability leaks to the press--

239
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,500
good,bad,or whatever--

240
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
it stirs a lot of people up.

241
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,200
Precisely what I hope to avoid.

242
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
I've seen firsthand the type of behavior

243
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,300
that irrational fears can provoke.

244
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,100
You left rwanda in april of 1994.

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,300
That was the beginning of the tutsis' genocide.

246
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,400
The beginning?

247
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,900
Believe me,I saw my fill of horrors during those two weeks.

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
If I hadn't been granted asylum here in america,

249
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
I'd be dead.

250
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,900
You were probably just getting used to the place when you got abducted,I'm sure.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,700
There were nights in kigali when I would have welcomed the chance

252
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,600
to disappear from the face of this earth.

253
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
So, uh,just let me get this straight--

254
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
you used maia's predictions so that you could gamble?

255
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,900
I didn't use her to gamble.

256
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,600
I used her to win.

257
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,000
You mean that you used her to cheat.

258
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,400
You exploited a nine-year-old girl who loves you.

259
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
She was having a good time.

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,600
We both were.

261
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,800
But only one of you is an adult.

262
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,800
I can't believe that you're standing there defending it.

263
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,800
Well, this part of it,

264
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,800
I can kind of mount a credible defense.

265
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,300
What,so you haven't got to the part that you're ashamed of yet?

266
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,900
These bets?

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
they were sure things?

268
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
but I needed money to make them.

269
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,300
You know mom's engagement ring?

270
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
You mean the one that she left to me?

271
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,200
The one I should have worn to my wedding.

272
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,500
I pawned it.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,600
I just can't believe that I let maia anywhere near you.

274
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,700
I want you out of here.

275
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,100
Lucy.

276
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
If I watch the news tonight,

277
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
am I going to be a happy man?

278
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,100
The stations I called all seemed very interested.

279
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,900
A 4400 who cures birth defects?

280
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,000
I'd cover it.

281
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,600
I suppose the tip was anonymous?

282
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,600
Believe me,I didn't want to leave my name.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
The center outing a 4400 to the media?

284
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
Seems wrong somehow.

285
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,600
Well,it's not business as usual,I grant you,

286
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,200
but we leak it,we control the story,

287
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,900
and it beats letting him rot in the basement at ntac.

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
Did shawn go upstairs for the night?

289
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,100
He went out.

290
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Personal business,he said.

291
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,800
Good night, lucy.

292
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Who is it?

293
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,000
Hello?

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,600
Mom,are you going to,uh, are you going to open the door,

295
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,900
or should i use my key?

296
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,100
Shawn!

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I would've-- I would've called ahead,but I?

298
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,600
?surprise.

299
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,400
Will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease?

300
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,400
That's the question on everyone's lips,

301
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
as it appears a member of the 4400

302
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,700
has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero.

303
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,300
Anonymous sources claim that edwin mayuya,

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,700
a 38-year-old nurse at mercy hospital?

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,900
murderer!

306
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,600
...Is responsible for a series of miraculous healings?

307
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:45,900
murderer!

308
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,400
over the past five months.

309
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Murderer!

310
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,300
Murderer!

311
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,500
but if these claims prove true--

312
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
that's the man,

313
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,900
the one who killed your parents!

314
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
There's more.

315
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm bouncing around in the shotgun seat.

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,100
and tyler here has got the gas
pedal all the way through the floor?

317
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
hey. we had 200 bucks on that race?

318
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,100
and davis is 30 feet behind me.

319
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
and I can barely hear him screaming--

320
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,200
not that way.

321
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,900
That's where the landmines are.

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
If I knew he was serious.

323
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
maybe I would have paid attention.

324
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.Yeah.

325
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,300
Well.no one was going to follow us that way.

326
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
so we came in two minutes before the pack.

327
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,600
and we split the money.

328
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,700
We bought like five kegs of
budweiser for the officers' club.

329
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Get a load of this.

330
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Looks just like it did back in the day.

331
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,600
Like you.tyler.

332
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,900
Hard to believe-- 50 years go by.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
we got the same guys.

334
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
same beer.

335
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,300
It's great to see you guys.

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,200
It's a shame it took milt
dying to make it happen.

337
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,700
It's hard to find excuses
to get the whole gang together.

338
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,600
It's not exactly the whole gang, is it?

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There's always lee.

340
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Which one of you guys
is going to tell me where he is?

341
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
Come on does it matter?

342
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Matters to me.

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Well.last I heard.he was in
a V.A.Hospital outside of bakersfield.

344
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
In bad shape for a long time.

345
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,200
Look.everyone here feels
terrible about what we did to you.

346
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
Huh? Isn't that enough?

347
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
You're not going to get
anything out of talking to lee. I mean.

348
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,000
do yourself a favor-- just let it go.

349
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,200
I don't give a damn.

350
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I don't care if he?

351
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,300
What's up?

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
You know your miracle healer?

353
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,600
Turns out his real name is edwin musinga.

354
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,900
All his papers have been forged.

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
He's been wanted by the
rwandan government since 1995.

356
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,200
Wanted for what?

357
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
Atrocities.

358
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,100
He was a doctor during the uprising.

359
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
He's killed a whole bunch of people.

360
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,900
I was a pediatrician at a clinic in kigali.

361
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,500
I am a hutu.

362
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,200
but most of my patients were tutsi.

363
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,700
Many of my friends as well.

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
That called my loyalty into
question when the killings began.

365
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Some men from the military came to my clinic.

366
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,800
and they said they wanted
to broadcast it as a safehouse.

367
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,600
a place tutsi could come
to be safe from the slaughter.

368
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,500
And they came?

369
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
By 3:00.the clinic was full.

370
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,300
Every room. every corridor.

371
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,300
all filled with frightened tutsi

372
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,100
looking to me as their protector.

373
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,200
The same soldiers came back?

374
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,100
with militia at their side.

375
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
It was a setup.

376
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Did you at least try to stop them?

377
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,000
The radio reports were claiming

378
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,900
the tutsis had killed our president.

379
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,900
The anger spread like virus.

380
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
I got infected. too.

381
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,000
So basically. you stood by and did nothing?

382
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
All over the city.it was organized murder.

383
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,700
We never would have made it to safety.

384
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
You could have tried.

385
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,700
Easy tom.

386
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Let the man finish his story.

387
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes.I could have tried.

388
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,300
That's true.I know that now.

389
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,500
They made me watch.

390
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
They killed them all.

391
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,000
I allowed them to turn
my clinic into a slaughterhouse.

392
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,500
But you didn't murder anyone personally.

393
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,600
True.

394
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,300
but not much of a distinction.

395
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,300
I knew what was going to happen.

396
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
I let it take place.

397
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm guilty.

398
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
My wife left me.

399
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,100
I have not seen her or my children since.

400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,500
Perhaps they will come to my execution.

401
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Your government's pushing for extradition.

402
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,400
You should be on a plane right now.

403
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
But your ability?

404
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,500
complicates things.

405
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
It would give me the
chance to make amends.

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,200
But I could save an infant
every day for the rest of my life.

407
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,100
and I'd still deserve
every one of my nightmares.

408
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
What was going on in there tom?

409
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,200
Because if you were looking to shut
him down before he got his story out.

410
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,500
all that glaring was a
great way to go about it.

411
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
That guy should be
on his way to a tribunal.

412
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Instead.we're serving
him lunch downstairs.

413
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh.what. would you
prefer it if we starved him?

414
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I don't believe you're defending him!

415
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,100
I would never defend what he did.

416
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,700
but I would make an
argument for what he can do now.

417
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,300
There's a reason the future
sent him back with this amazing ability.

418
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,300
But forgive me if I sound like?

419
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
I don't know.you?

420
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,700
No.No.not this time.

421
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,100
No.we're not talking about a criminal.

422
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
We're not even talking about a murderer.

423
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,600
We're talking about genocide, Dian

424
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,600
Maybe the future doesn't
have a problem with that.but I do.

425
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,700
So if I don't believe that the world is
better off with a bullet in this guy's head.

426
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,100
I'm advocating genocide?

427
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,100
No.

428
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
There are people in rwanda
right now who have lost mothers.

429
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,900
brothers. and children in that clinic.

430
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and he stood by.

431
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,000
and he let it happen.

432
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,400
That's just like our government.

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,700
just like governments all over the world.

434
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
They all knew what was happening. tom.

435
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
but nobody lifted a finger to stop it.

436
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,400
Yeah. and that was wrong. too.

437
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
and so is this.

438
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,200
We've been working on
blind faith for a year and a half.

439
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,900
assuming these people
knew what they were doing.

440
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
but enough is enough.

441
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Yeah.we're saving the future.

442
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,900
but we're leaving justice behind.

443
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,200
Is it something that you
want to be a part of. diana?

444
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,500
so shawn just shows out of nowhere,

445
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
and all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop all of my plans

446
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,800
and head to some peace dinner,

447
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,700
We both know why he's turned up now, right?

448
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,700
You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together,

449
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,100
His mentor daddy figure gets killed,

450
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
and he comes crawling back to mommy,

451
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,800
Danny,why don't you quit whining about shawn?

452
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
He's your brother,It's been a year,Let it go,

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and told me how brainwashed he is,

454
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,800
So if he's coming for dinner,

455
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,600
that's a good thing, right?

456
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,900
At least pretend it is,

457
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,100
for your mom's sake,

458
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
What's with the attitude, man?

459
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,600
I just don't want to hear you bitch anymore, okay?

460
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,500
I don't understand,

461
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Why do you have to go?

462
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
Can't you just say you're sorry?

463
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,200
It doesn't always work that way with grown-ups,

464
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,800
Sometimes things gets so messed up

465
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,700
that "sorry" doesn't cut it,

466
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,000
Happens a lot when I'm involved,actually,

467
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
But if you only just leave,

468
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
nothing gets better,

469
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,000
Sweetie...

470
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm sorry,

471
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,700
I used you,

472
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,500
It was wrong,

473
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
But I forgive you,

474
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,900
I still have to go,

475
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
Well,I know I cooked all day

476
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,900
but is my lasagna really that great?

477
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,300
You're both just stunned into silence?

478
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I haven't had this stuff in,

479
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
like a year,

480
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Good,You said something,

481
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,900
Danny, why don't you give it a try?

482
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,400
All right,you know what?

483
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,800
That's it, Danny,

484
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,400
this entire night is about you and me,

485
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,700
That's why mom did this,

486
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,900
you know?What do you want me to do,

487
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,300
say we're all fine and dandy?

488
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,100
It's not that easy,

489
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't expect it to be,

490
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,700
but you and I obviously have some stuff we need to get into the open

491
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
Okay,so you're going to apologize to me now,

492
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,500
is that it?

493
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,000
Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend?

494
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,300
The thing with nikki,

495
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
I wish it wouldn't have happened that way,

496
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,900
What about almost stopping my heart,

497
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,900
or whatever it is that you did?

498
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,100
You feel bad about that, too?

499
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,600
You know what?

500
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
You want to hate me forever?

501
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,400
You be my guest,

502
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,000
But you're my brother,

503
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,000
and I came here to make things right by you,

504
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,000
What do you want me to do?

505
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,600
You need to punch me in the face or something?I mean

506
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,600
be my guest

507
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,600
Danny, don't you dare,

508
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,400
Just one shot, ma,

509
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,400
He deserves it,

510
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Look,he's even asking for it,

511
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,000
Are we okay?Are we done?

512
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,100
We're letting him walk?

513
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,700
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths,

514
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
His degree of culpability is not for us to determine,

515
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,300
Okay,look,I can't ship him off to rwanda,

516
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,900
Not yet,anyway,

517
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,900
In the meantime,his 48-hour hold is up,

518
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,100
and the 4400 center has hired lawyers who are pressing for his release,

519
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
The press are all over this story,

520
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Will he even be safe on the streets?

521
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah, a war criminal's safety,

522
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,800
that's my big concern,

523
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,800
Oh, it had better be,

524
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
In exchange for protection,

525
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,600
edwin musinga has agreed to continue coming into our labs,

526
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,500
We're babysitting him?

527
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
In exchange for a chance to study what he can do,

528
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,100
This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years,

529
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
It sounds like a fair trade to me,

530
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Mm-hmm,

531
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
How long have you been feeling faint?

532
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,600
On and off,perhaps a month,

533
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
You should have told your doctors,

534
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,900
You forget,miss skouris,I am a doctor,

535
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
I have been anemic since I was 15,

536
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,900
I'm certain--

537
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,200
you okay?

538
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,700
Yeah,

539
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,700
Stay with him,I'm going out,

540
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Stay down,Stay down,stay down,

541
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,900
Take these people out of here,

542
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,600
I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes,

543
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Help!

544
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
Someone call an ambulance!

545
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,100
I think she's having a heart attack,

546
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,700
He did this to her,

547
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Why are you protecting him?

548
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
He's a murderer!

549
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,500
How did this become public?

550
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,400
Well,I assure you,

551
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,400
it wasn't ntac,

552
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them,

553
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
this could have been avoided,

554
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,300
Oh, yeah,that would have calmed them down,

555
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
They could have torn you apart,

556
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I think I have already demonstrated the lengths

557
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,700
I'm willing to go in order to live,

558
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,700
You can add another victim to your list,

559
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,700
That woman is dead,

560
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,600
Okay,tom,why don't you just go back outside?

561
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,600
Take a walk around the block,

562
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,100
You know why she was out there?

563
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,700
Huh?

564
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
Because this son of a bitch

565
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,700
let her son,her daughter-in-law,and about eight of her nephews and nieces die,

566
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,300
Huh?

567
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Isn't that right, doctor?

568
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Tom, stop!

569
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,500
Isn't that right?

570
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,300
stop!

571
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,700
I regret her death,

572
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,900
same as I regret them all,

573
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah,well, I'm sorry you feel bad,

574
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,200
but it doesn't change anything,does it?

575
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,900
Tom, enough,

576
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Let him go,

577
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,800
Now!

578
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
Let him go,

579
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,700
Look, benjamin,

580
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,300
I don't see what the problem is,

581
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,300
Edwin musinga never killed anybody,

582
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
Not personally,anyway,

583
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,200
I already told you which senators to call,

584
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,200
Get face time if you can,

585
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,500
Do I have to fly out there and do this myself?

586
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,500
I thought not,

587
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,100
Blackberry me when things start to tip,

588
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,300
Full-court press is on?

589
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,900
I kind of wish I was out there,

590
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Cash in a few favors,

591
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,400
watch the hill fall in line...

592
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,100
do we really want to be cashing in favors for this guy?

593
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,700
He says himself he's dirty,

594
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
Oh, he's worse than dirty,

595
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,700
He's practically a mass murderer,

596
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
So why are we wasting our time with him?

597
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
Somebody might come along who actually deserves our help, matthew,

598
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,800
He's a 4400,

599
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,700
Guilty or not,he's a part of what we're doing,

600
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,500
They gave him that ability for a reason,

601
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,200
and I doubt it has anything to do with being executed in rwanda,

602
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,600
So let's say he didn't come back with an ability,

603
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,600
Would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf?

604
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,800
You're the boss,

605
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,500
You tell me,

606
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,800
Breakfast is ready,

607
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,500
You know you're going to start talking to me eventually,right?

608
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,300
I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18,

609
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
She used you,maia,

610
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,400
She said she was sorry,

611
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Well,there--there still has to be consequences,

612
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
your ability is a gift,

613
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
but it makes you a target, too,

614
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,200
and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you,

615
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,600
Besides,

616
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,600
you're not the only one your aunt april hurt this week,

617
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,500
But I showed her the ring,

618
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,700
She wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for me,

619
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,400
Well, you should never have been playing with it,

620
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,000
which is why you don't get any tv this week,

621
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,400
What your aunt did was completely different,

622
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
and she knows it,

623
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,700
She made a bad mistake,

624
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,100
Isn't that what having a family's about?

625
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,400
Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake?

626
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,600
It doesn't matter if I forgive her,

627
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,900
I...

628
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,700
I just can't have her around you,

629
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
But we don't have such a big family,

630
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
We can't just kick someone out--

631
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,900
even if they mess up,

632
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh, maia,

633
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,700
you've got to-- do me a favor,

634
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Stop being more grown-up than your mom,

635
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,500
Now, just come on,

636
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,100
Come on,Your cereal's getting mushy,

637
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,900
let's go,

638
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,400
I am not kidding you,

639
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
It was,like,the most intense wrist-burn I think I've ever given,

640
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,100
He took it like a man,I'll give him that,

641
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,700
After that,we ate,

642
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
we talked a little bit,

643
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,500
I was surprised-- it was pretty much okay,

644
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,600
Good to hear,

645
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,600
I was glad I went,

646
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Well, you know what that makes you?

647
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Right,

648
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,600
Yeah,I'm a genius,

649
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't get it,kyle,

650
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,600
Look,you're pissed at me when I tell you I don't want to see shawn,

651
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,800
and then I do it,and I tell you it went pretty good,

652
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,700
and I get a big shrug,

653
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,400
Nobody asked you to sit here, man,

654
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,400
What's going on,kyle?

655
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
What,are you blacking out again?

656
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,300
Just forget it,

657
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on,

658
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,600
I'll talk to your dad,

659
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,600
I am not blacking out,all right?

660
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,800
I feel fine,You're not saying a word to my dad,

661
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,400
Yeah?

662
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,300
Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie,

663
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,800
I can remember now,

664
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Some of the things I was doing during those blackouts,I can remember,

665
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
Like what?

666
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm in trouble,that's all I can tell you,

667
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm in big trouble,

668
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,200
Is there anything I can do?

669
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,200
Help yourself,

670
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Stay away from me,

671
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,200
Got a cigarette?

672
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,800
You have emphysema,

673
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,300
I know I have emphysema,

674
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,000
What I don't have is a cigarette,

675
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
Do you know who I am?

676
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,700
For a second,I thought you were the angel of death,

677
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,900
Richard tyler,

678
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
How was weinberg's funeral?

679
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,200
Simple,

680
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,900
Dignified,Kind of like milt,

681
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Never did like his politics much,

682
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,900
You know,after you disappeared,he blamed me,

683
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,100
Fought me once or twice,

684
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
Of course,he was wrong,

685
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,600
So what are you here for?

686
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
Going to slap me around a little bit?

687
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,700
Shut off my oxygen tank?

688
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Uh...

689
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,900
you don't make a very appealing target these days,lee,

690
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,800
What,then?Looking for an apology?

691
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,100
When I first got back,

692
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you,

693
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,800
All the things I would do to you if I ever saw you again,

694
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,100
Oh,

695
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,200
You want vengeance,

696
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,900
Well,

697
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,600
sorry to disappoint you,That's not going to work out either,

698
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could,

699
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,900
Time kicks everybody's ass,lee,

700
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,700
Get you too,eventually,

701
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Caught up with old milt,didn't it,for sure,

702
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
At the funeral,

703
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,700
those guys were tripping over each other to say sorry,

704
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,700
But you've had 50 years to dwell on what you did...

705
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,300
I didn't like hitting a fellow officer,

706
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,900
but you gave me cause,

707
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,500
I ate beside you,I fought beside you,

708
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,900
but when you took up with a white woman,

709
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
you crossed the line,

710
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,800
That's what you said back then,

711
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm saying it again now,

712
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,200
The world's changed,lee,or haven't you noticed?

713
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,900
The world,maybe,Not me,

714
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,100
And how's that working out for you?

715
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,500
I stopped by your room,

716
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,800
No cards,

717
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,200
No flowers,

718
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,500
The lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor,

719
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
You know,

720
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,400
I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes,

721
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,200
You always did stick to your habits,lee...

722
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,600
even after they started to kill you,

723
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,700
So long,

724
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
They're not just statistics,diana,

725
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,300
He let that happen,

726
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,100
I know what he did,

727
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,700
and I don't need you to rub my nose in it,

728
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,500
It's worth putting the faces to the numbers,

729
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,400
We've got a problem,

730
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
The state department has decided to fight extradition,

731
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,000
They're going to argue special circumstances,

732
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,400
So edwin gets a pass?

733
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
And who knows how many kids get a shot at a normal life?

734
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400
No, not as many as we'd hoped,

735
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works,

736
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,700
forget about replicating it,

737
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,400
And I just got his med eval,

738
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,600
It turns out he's in bad shape,

739
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Well, he told me he's anemic,

740
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,500
and he couldn't sleep,

741
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
No,no,it's worse than that,

742
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,000
This ability,every time he rearranges a fetal chromosome,

743
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
he's damaging his own,

744
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
So if he keeps healing...

745
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,000
it's going to kill him,

746
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,800
Listen, if you don't want to talk about what you did,

747
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm not going to try to force you to,

748
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,500
But I guarantee you,whatever it is,

749
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
there's a way out of it,

750
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
That's easy to say,You don't know what it is,

751
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,500
So tell us,

752
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
How can we help you if we don't know what's going on?

753
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,600
I didn't ask for help,

754
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
In fact,I told you not to mention it to anyone, danny,

755
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,600
And I'm not "anyone",

756
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm your friend,

757
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,400
Stop saying that, okay?

758
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,300
I know you two mean well,

759
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about,

760
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,200
I have to deal with this on my own,

761
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,400
We get it,

762
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,800
On your own,Absolutely,

763
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,100
And we're going to help you do that,

764
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,900
I think what he's trying to say

765
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,700
is if you need some time to clear your head and get away from everything so you can figure stuff out,

766
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,200
I can make that happen,

767
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,800
Come to the center with me, kyle,

768
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,500
You're turning this into a recruiting drive?

769
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,700
That's not what I'm talking about,

770
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,100
You will have the space you need,

771
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
No one will bother you,

772
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,500
Kyle,if you ever get to the point where you feel like you want to talk to somebody,

773
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,900
we have counselors,

774
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,300
therapists, lawyers,

775
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,800
It was worth a try, man,

776
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,400
because whatever you're doing right now,it's not working,

777
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,200
My car is outside,

778
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
You can come with me right now,if you want,

779
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Okay,

780
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,100
Just let me... I got a couple of things to take care of...

781
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,500
get a leave of absence from school,stuff like that,

782
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll meet you there tonight,

783
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,600
And I'll be waiting,

784
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Okay,

785
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,100
Thank you, guys,

786
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,100
How much time do I have left?

787
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,700
Well,that's difficult to say,

788
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,000
I mean,your genes are mutating every time you heal a fetus,

789
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,300
There's an indication of heart disease developing,

790
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,800
You have spinal irregularities on your mri,

791
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,500
If you keep healing,maybe a year, maybe less,

792
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,800
And if I stop?

793
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,700
Oh,well,I mean, if you stop healing,

794
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,200
then there's no reason for the state department to fight the extradition,

795
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
You'll be handed back to the rwandan government,

796
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Who will have me tried and sentenced with all dispatch,

797
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,900
So...

798
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,200
either choice that I make leads to my death,

799
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes,that's right,

800
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,100
It would seem my abductors have quite a perverse sense of humor,

801
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,500
I will,of course,continue to heal

802
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,100
for as long as my body allows,

803
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,100
At least then,my death will have a purpose other than vengeance,

804
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in,

805
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,000
They'll try and slow your decline,

806
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,500
but you really should come with us,

807
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,500
because we have some of the best physicians in the world on payroll,

808
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
Miss skouris,if you're offering me a bed at ntac,

809
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,100
I'm afraid I have to refuse,

810
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,100
I did not pass up one prison so I can die in another,

811
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,600
There is one place you could go,

812
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,400
Ntac medical's going to need him five days a week,

813
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,100
so I'll get you the schedule,

814
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,600
We'll make sure he's there on time, every time,

815
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,600
Edwin musinga,this is shawn farrell,

816
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,100
He runs the center,

817
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,000
and you two have a lot in common,

818
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,700
Not a lot,

819
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,000
Just one thing,

820
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,700
One very important thing,

821
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,500
Did you tell him?

822
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Yeah,He's going to keep healing,

823
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,800
Not that that surprises me,

824
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,400
I took him over to the 4400 center,

825
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,600
I think he's probably better off there than he is at home,

826
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,700
How does it feel, tom?

827
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Some babies'll get saved,

828
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,500
and you'll get your pound of flesh,

829
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,700
You really want to know?

830
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
I asked you, didn't I?

831
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,400
It feels like justice,

832
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,600
Hi

833
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,600
How'd you find me?

834
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,100
Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things,

835
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,700
What's in berkeley?

836
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,700
A tattoo shop that likes my work,

837
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,900
Oh, Some friends I can force myself on for a while,

838
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,600
Listen,di...

839
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,200
I said this to maia,but...

840
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm so sorry,

841
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,000
Well, it's nice to hear,

842
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,200
but it doesn't change anything,

843
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,900
You are so deceitful,and you're completely untrustworthy,and--

844
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,400
well,you're not seeing maia until you've proven otherwise,

845
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,000
I wish I knew how to make things right,

846
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,800
Yeah,I wish I did, too,

847
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,800
And I do know it's going to take a long time,

848
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,300
But you're still my sister,

849
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,000
and you're the only one I've got,

850
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,800
and I'm, uh...

851
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,200
well, I'm not giving up on you,

852
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,000
You bought it back from the pawn shop,

853
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,400
I know you always felt that mom should have left it to you,

854
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,100
and tell you the truth,

855
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,400
I thought she only gave it to me because she...

856
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,200
well, she figured that was the only way I was ever going to get one of those things,

857
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,100
Hmm, That's a whole othertherapy session,

858
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,800
Di, I don't deserve this,

859
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,200
No,you don't,

860
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
but you're going to take it anyway,

861
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,600
One day...

862
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,000
maia's going to wear that ring to her wedding...

863
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
and I hope--

864
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,000
well,

865
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,500
I hope you know each other again by then,

866
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,600
Yeah,

867
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,200
Kyle?

868
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Dad,

869
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,700
I had to leave,

870
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm sorry,

871
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,800
Kyle?Hey,it's me,

872
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,400
Uh, where are you, man?

873
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,900
It's 2:00 A,M,

874
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,700
You're not here yet,

875
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,200
Listen, just-- when you get this,

876
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,600
call me,or just show up,

877
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,600
Okay?Show up,

878
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,800
All right,

879
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,400
Yeah,I know you two mean well,

880
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about,

881
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,700
I have to deal with this on my own
