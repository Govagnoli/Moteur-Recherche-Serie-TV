1
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,202
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,570
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,979
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,911
You're so sWeet,

5
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,347
I wish I could take you with me
when I go, but I can't.

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,420
So yesterday, a few patients
were compelled to work on this thing.

7
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,920
And today, it's the entire hospital.

8
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,390
If we get Tess out of here,
do you think this compulsion will fade?

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,122
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

10
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,166
I Will have taught my body
hoW to produce promicin,

11
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:14,568
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

12
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,455
Enough running, Dr. Burkhoff.
You need to come with us now.

13
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,593
No. Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,097
That's very reassuring.

15
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,197
We'll keep that in mind.

16
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,396
No! No! No!

17
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,741
Mr. Tyler.

18
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,716
Come in. What can I do for you?

19
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,823
I wanted to ask you about your work
with the students here.

20
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,016
Sure. I teach three classes.

21
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,526
- History, arts and--
- I'm not talking about your teaching.

22
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,658
I was talking about the counseling
that you do.

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,926
I understand you use your ability
with the kids.

24
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,100
That's right.

25
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,967
My ability is to help them focus
their abilities.

26
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,109
It's pretty much what I've been doing
ever since I came back.

27
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,735
If a student has a talent,
like all of our kids here do,

28
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,848
I help them learn how to use it.

29
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,608
Gain control of it.
Build their confidence.

30
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,217
Does it work with adults?

31
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:11,085
It didn't use to, but I haven't tried it
since I've been off the inhibitor. Why?

32
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,796
I developed this ability
a few months ago.

33
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,374
Telekinesis.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,037
What a word. I can't even say it
with a straight face.

35
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,148
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- I've just been pretending it isn't there.

36
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,742
I mean, I know a little bit about it.

37
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,580
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects.

38
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,551
Little stuff.

39
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,718
And when I'm mad or excited,
I can do a lot more with it.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,159
And you're looking
to control it when you're calm?

41
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,892
Yeah. That's why I'm here, I guess.

42
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,327
How many times do I have
to go over this with you people?

43
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:04,340
I have not been injecting promicin
into anyone but myself.

44
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,670
You're certain of that?

45
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,238
You're a world-class scientist.

46
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,939
I find it difficult to believe
you wouldn't build a redundancy plan

47
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,141
into your experiment.

48
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,650
This isn't your basic sleep study.

49
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,812
I mean, look at me.

50
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,188
Do you think I'd have an easy time
finding volunteers?

51
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,660
No, I do not.

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,674
You look like you're in quite a bit
of discomfort to me.

53
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,142
Yes.

54
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,947
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- Well, you can relax now.

55
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,777
The experiment's over.

56
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,713
This will only hurt a minute.

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,688
Bag him.

58
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,833
We'll take him back for the autopsy.

59
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,443
Get Dr. Burkhoff up there quickly.
We promised results by the morning.

60
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,705
Mommy?

61
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,777
Mommy? Mom? Are you okay?

62
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,737
Of course, sweetie. I'm fine.

63
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,246
Why wouldn't I be?

64
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,012
I had a bad dream. You were in it.

65
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,918
Well, why don't you get in
and tell me about it?

66
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,428
You turned into a monster.

67
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,827
It was horrible.

68
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,493
It seemed so real.

69
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,697
It was you, but you were different.

70
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,774
What kind of a monster?

71
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,875
Nice. Something
for the refrigerator door?

72
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,343
You don't think
there's anything to this?

73
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,247
It's not a prediction, right?
Just a bad dream.

74
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,354
Well, I hope so.
But when your daughter is a precog,

75
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,548
you don't want her giving you
a picture like this.

76
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,956
Hello, this is Skouris.

77
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,694
Well, thank you for calling me back.

78
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,664
- Let me know if you see him, all right?
- Everything okay?

79
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,235
Maybe. I'm not sure.

80
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,269
I mean, that was the 4400 Center.

81
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,168
I was hoping maybe they'd seen
Dr. Burkhoff.

82
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,037
I stopped by his apartment yesterday,
and he wasn't home.

83
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,671
Diana, why would you be stopping
by Dr. Burkhoff's apartment?

84
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,974
You actually saw the wound
in Kevin's hand heal over?

85
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,918
Yes. He pulled the scalpel out,
and it was gone within seconds.

86
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,584
He's developing an ability.
I mean, he's close to it anyway.

87
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,193
He says it comes and goes.

88
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,022
What?

89
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,723
Anyone else developing a 4400 ability
I should know about?

90
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,864
- I should have told you earlier.
- You're damn right you should have.

91
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,396
Gotta hand it to you, Diana.

92
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,403
Some people play racquetball
in their spare time,

93
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,905
maybe collect old records, but you,

94
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,737
you play lgor to the one man who...

95
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,845
Well, if he has developed an ability
like you say,

96
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,416
maybe he really is the father
of 4400 technology.

97
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,450
Just like the future predicted.

98
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,013
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?

99
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,551
I thought we were.

100
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,024
And now I'm not so sure.

101
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,193
And that's what I'm worried about.

102
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,264
Tom, what if someone else finds out
what he's up to?

103
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,422
Well, if he succeeds,

104
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,695
we could be talking about the mass
marketing of 4400 abilities.

105
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,635
I'm sure a lot of people would like
to keep that genie in the bottle.

106
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,571
Make our jobs even easier.
Are you--? Are you okay?

107
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,440
Yeah, it's just my allergies.
They're acting up.

108
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,544
I've already spoken to his family. They
haven't heard from him in months.

109
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,877
Okay, so who else is he close to?

110
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,981
"'l didn't know that Cheshire cats
always grinned.

111
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:22,253
In fact, I didn't know cats could grin,"
said Alice very politely.

112
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,020
"'You don't know much,"
said the duchess.

113
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,295
"And that's a fact."

114
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,961
We'll finish this chapter tomorrow.

115
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,198
I hope you all can make it.

116
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,343
I've been living in a halfway house
for about three months.

117
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,071
And I got this job here
two weeks ago.

118
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,236
Well, that's great, Tess.

119
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,440
So they found a medication
that works for you?

120
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,745
Well, so far, so good.

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,583
I still have my disease.
Schizophrenia never goes away.

122
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,454
But I haven't had any symptoms
for a while.

123
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,653
Hopefully, I won't.

124
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,024
So these kids you're reading to,

125
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,032
they're not going to try and build
a tower to contact the future, are they?

126
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,195
I don't think so.

127
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,069
I can barely remember all that now.

128
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,836
I'm still not sure how I could
compel people to work

129
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,176
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.

130
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,582
I'm glad it made Kevin better.

131
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,721
But it was still so weird.

132
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,288
That's actually why we're here.

133
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,050
Have you been in touch
with Kevin lately?

134
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,494
No. I called him when I first got out
of the institution, but...

135
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,895
We met for coffee...

136
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,201
I haven't seen him in months.
Is he okay?

137
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,497
Well, we're not sure,
but we'd like to talk to him.

138
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,641
So if he contacts you,
would you let us know?

139
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,968
Of course.

140
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,907
When you find him,
will you have him call me?

141
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,309
Sure. It's nice to see you again, Tess.

142
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,179
- Bye.
- Bye.

143
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,247
I just spoke with the program
coordinator.

144
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,084
She says the first segment
will be interviews

145
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,782
with some of the people you've healed.

146
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,757
And then they'll bring you out
after the break.

147
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,294
She says the emotional stuff
also plays well with her audience,

148
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,433
so feel free to cry or...

149
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,201
We'll see about that.

150
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,132
They're also kind of curious
about the wedding.

151
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,067
She'd love it if you answered
some questions.

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,401
Let's keep the private life
private, okay?

153
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,169
Nick! Nick, please wake up!

154
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,644
Nick! Nick, please wake up!

155
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,046
Jesus, that's Nick Crowley.

156
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,716
Oh, my God. You're that 4400.

157
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,449
The one with the hands.
Help him, please! Nick!

158
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,217
Nick, wake up, please.

159
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,473
- Is he all right?
- If you're okay, say something.

160
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,350
Well, Jim Morrison says hello.

161
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,019
Easy, easy, boys, easy.

162
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,624
Coming up...

163
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,220
You just saved Nick Crowley.

164
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,523
On behalf of millions of rock 'n' roll
burnouts all over the world,

165
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,166
allow me to thank you.

166
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,935
Any time you wanna lay these on me,
you just let me know.

167
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,571
It was a little bit big,
so I just had it resized.

168
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,679
It's perfect now.

169
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,343
I think Mom would be really happy,
don't you?

170
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,687
Lily gave you that ring.

171
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,617
I guess you can do
what you want with it.

172
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,052
I think it's perfect.

173
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,492
So have you thought about what
you're going to say at the wedding?

174
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,569
Usually, the father of the bride
gives a toast.

175
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,073
Well, it's all been so sudden.

176
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,041
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.

177
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,806
That's okay. I have a few thoughts.

178
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,284
There's an article in this magazine
on toasts.

179
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,711
Read it.

180
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,882
I think I can handle that on my own.

181
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,824
Dad, I want you to read it. Tonight.

182
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,911
Hi.

183
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,286
I bought some food.

184
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,692
Let me help you with that.

185
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,626
Thank you. My joints are a little stiff.

186
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,393
Kevin, why did you put your hood up
when I came in?

187
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,771
You shouldn't have to look at me
like this.

188
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,143
Like what?

189
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,356
Diana Skouris and Tom Baldwin
came by the bookstore today.

190
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,753
They were asking about you.

191
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,763
I figured Diana would be worried.
How did she look?

192
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,094
Okay, I guess.

193
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,098
A little sick.

194
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,765
Kevin, I felt bad seeing her.

195
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,431
I don't like what we're doing to her.

196
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,976
- What I'm doing to her.
- I don't like it much either.

197
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,512
But we are on the cusp

198
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,379
of changing the world for the better.

199
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,147
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.

200
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,120
Kevin, it's already ugly.
Someone shot you yesterday.

201
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,884
I know.

202
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,759
But the experiment is worth the risk.

203
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,661
They woke me up to do this.

204
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,735
You woke me up to do this.

205
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,034
I have to move forward.

206
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,134
And to do that, I need Diana.

207
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,979
And I need you.

208
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,769
Is Shawn Farrell around?
I have something for him.

209
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,139
I played that when we were recording
my first album.

210
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,111
I've been holding on to it for years.

211
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,910
You're really giving this to me?

212
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,780
You saved my life.

213
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,013
Seems like a fair trade to me.

214
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,727
So this ability of yours.

215
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,866
It works every time out of the gate?

216
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,959
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, my God.

217
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,400
I wish they'd brought you back
1 5 years ago.

218
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,633
Career in rock 'n' roll...

219
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,836
Sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.

220
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,341
You lose a lot of people along the way.

221
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,176
One day you look up,
and you're the last man standing.

222
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:33,185
You should take better care
of yourself. I'm not always around.

223
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,953
I feel like I owe you
more than a guitar.

224
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,723
We're playing tomorrow night,
and I wanted to invite you backstage.

225
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,995
You can hang out,
watch the show from the wings.

226
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,658
- Really?
- Sure.

227
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,101
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.

228
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,399
If I keel over,
you can always come out

229
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,408
and do your hands of God thing
for an encore.

230
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,625
It's cold.

231
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,964
You should bring your jacket.

232
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,338
She didn't say anything
on the way over?

233
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:33,417
Of course not, Kevin.
She hardly ever does.

234
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,553
You're so brave.

235
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,153
I always wanted to give it to you first.

236
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,090
I thought you deserved an ability.

237
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,822
I'm sorry it has to happen
without your permission.

238
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,566
Can we get this started?

239
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,636
Give Dr. Burkhoff your hand.

240
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,420
Mommy, I'm gonna be late for school
if we don't leave soon.

241
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,750
I'm sorry, baby.
I slept through my alarm.

242
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,790
I'll be ready in a few--

243
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,657
Mommy, are you okay?

244
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,890
I'm fine. I just broke a nail is all.

245
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,605
Hi.

246
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,612
Hey, Marco.

247
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,546
What are you doing down here?

248
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,155
Tom asked me to check out
Dr. Burkhoff's computers.

249
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,513
Are you okay?

250
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,557
- I heard you had the flu.
- No.

251
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,354
Hey, I thought you were taking
a sick day.

252
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,020
Everyone, please, stop treating me
like a plague patient.

253
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,426
I'm fine.

254
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,760
Have we learned anything here?

255
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,370
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean. Like, completely clean.

256
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,507
I mean, there's no saved files,
no records of anything.

257
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,232
It's like someone took out
his hard drives

258
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,740
and swapped them for new ones.

259
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,641
- So either he took them somewhere...
- Or someone else has them.

260
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,247
Diana...

261
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,741
...Iook at this.

262
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,843
Is that Kevin?

263
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,211
Yeah.

264
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,551
My God, these are the side effects
of the injections?

265
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,193
I haven't seen him in a couple
of weeks.

266
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,589
I had no idea he'd gotten so bad.

267
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,593
So who drew this?
You think it's a self-portrait?

268
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,359
No way. Kevin's hands weren't
steady enough to make coffee.

269
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,265
Didn't Tess like to draw?

270
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,945
I feel like I'm in a staring contest.

271
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,246
It's okay.

272
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,390
I know it can be
a little awkward at first.

273
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,121
So sometimes when I'm having trouble
getting started with a student,

274
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,093
I'll take their hand.

275
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,193
It helps everything get rolling.

276
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,896
You up for it?

277
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,333
Yeah. I guess.

278
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,307
Just relax, okay?

279
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,661
I'm sorry, l...

280
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,562
To be honest,
I felt a little awkward.

281
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,699
I haven't had someone touch me
like that since...

282
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,809
...my wife passed.

283
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,576
It's okay.

284
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,514
Sometimes it takes more
than one session to make headway.

285
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,252
Diana?

286
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,085
Diana?

287
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,094
Should I just call you a cab?
I can handle this if you want.

288
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,291
No, I'm okay.

289
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,628
Any sign of Tess?

290
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,599
No, she hasn't come out yet.

291
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,331
Look, Tom, I made an appointment
with the doctor tomorrow morning.

292
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,806
But for now,
I'd just like to stick with it, okay?

293
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,005
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.

294
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,548
It's like I'm dragging myself around.

295
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,511
Here she is.

296
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,327
Come in.

297
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,529
Hey.

298
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,966
What?

299
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,427
Different look for you.

300
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,332
New look?

301
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,339
I dressed like this for ten years.

302
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,568
Hey, you're not here to ask
about the wedding, are you?

303
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,043
I am officially taking the night off
from all planning.

304
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,282
This has nothing to do
with the wedding,

305
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,476
unless Nick Crowley's invited.

306
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,745
He's downstairs.

307
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,212
Really? I'm getting ready
for his show.

308
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,654
Maybe he wants to give me a ride
or something.

309
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,657
I don't think that's it.

310
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,429
Well, what?

311
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,824
I never get enough refills.

312
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,230
I mean, look at me.

313
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,568
- Where is he staying...?
- What's he saying?

314
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,937
Nick has a prescription
for Antabuse.

315
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:30,070
They're these pills that are supposed
to help him cut back on his drinking.

316
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,513
He finally tried some.

317
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,049
I guess he overdid it, huh?

318
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,119
It's the same thing he does
with everything.

319
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,382
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.

320
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,555
Continue medicine for me.

321
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,991
Do your worst.

322
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,324
Please?

323
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:58,374
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy.

324
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,306
Lay down. Lay down.

325
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,477
You're my little lifeline.

326
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,388
Kevin.

327
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,290
Dr. Burkhoff,
I've been worried about you.

328
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,296
What are you doing hiding up here?

329
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,934
My God, look at you.

330
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,163
Dr. Burkhoff,
you need to come with us.

331
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,734
We're gonna get you some help.

332
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,138
I can't do that.
People are trying to kill me.

333
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,005
What people?
Who's trying to kill you?

334
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,806
I think they work for the government.

335
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,504
No, they don't work for NTAC.

336
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,513
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm not.

337
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,652
Listen, Kevin, you know us.

338
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,414
If you come in, we'll protect you.

339
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,316
Besides, I'm not taking no
for an answer. Come on.

340
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,461
Actually, I think
you're going to have to.

341
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,724
- Diana, what the hell are you doing?
- I don't know, Tom. I'm sorry.

342
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,060
Diana is not quite herself right now.

343
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,567
She'll do whatever Tess tells her to.

344
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,570
Tess, would you get his gun, please?

345
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,450
Please. I am so close to finishing.

346
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,822
Stop trying to find me.

347
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,057
I have no desire to hurt you.

348
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,602
Diana.

349
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,504
Are you okay? You all right?

350
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,977
I don't know. What happened?

351
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,375
You pulled your gun on me.

352
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,016
- Tess.
- Yeah.

353
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,119
- Oh, God.
- What?

354
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,682
Something's wrong.

355
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,790
I feel weird.

356
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,222
Oh, my God. What are those?

357
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,494
They're lesions.

358
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,463
They're just like the ones Kevin had
when he started taking promicin.

359
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,932
We need to get you to NTAC medical.

360
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,944
We want him brought in unharmed.

361
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,842
If there's anything at all
to these experiments

362
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,346
Dr. Burkhoff has been conducting,

363
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,848
a lot of people in D.C. are gonna
want to look over his notes.

364
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,783
These pictures have already been
circulated to local law enforcement.

365
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,855
We're gonna distribute them
around the neighborhood

366
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,116
near Dr. Burkhoff's apartment

367
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,123
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.

368
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,852
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- So, what?

369
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,156
We tell people there's some kind of
monster on the loose?

370
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,891
No, if anyone asks, we tell them
Dr. Burkhoff has Werner's syndrome.

371
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,160
- It's a rare wasting disease.
- Okay.

372
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,770
You think we're gonna be able
to bring this guy in safe and sound?

373
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,032
I mean, some cowboy cop
sees this stumbling towards him,

374
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,505
you don't think he might shoot first
and ask questions later?

375
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,611
That's why we have to get to him first.

376
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,740
Whatever Dr. Burkhoff is guilty of,

377
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,280
he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.

378
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,917
Look, the good thing
about his condition

379
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,246
is it shouldn't make him
too hard to spot.

380
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,245
I don't know.

381
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,618
They're nice hands,

382
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,090
but they don't look magical
or anything.

383
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,420
Making friends already?

384
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,157
- Hey.
- Oh, you've chosen wisely.

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,433
I speak from experience.

386
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,661
The show was amazing.

387
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,328
- Thank you so much for having me.
- What are you thanking me for?

388
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,804
The show would have been canceled
if not for you.

389
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,569
Listen, I just had the best idea
during the encore.

390
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,771
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?

391
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,840
And do what?

392
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:04,778
Well, you could start with Mischa,
and work your way onward from there.

393
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,450
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,

394
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,459
but I kind of have a lot on my plate
here in Seattle, you know?

395
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,221
I'm supposed to be
getting married soon.

396
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,058
Well, in that case,
you have to come with us.

397
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,396
It'll be like an extended bachelor party.
He'll take good care of you. Promise.

398
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,232
And a promise from Mischa
is money in the bank.

399
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,135
Besides, I like
having you along with us.

400
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,471
You keep me limber.

401
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,011
- You mean upright.
- Oh, yeah, that too.

402
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,846
I don't...

403
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,711
I'm not your personal physician,
you know?

404
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,283
Of course you're not.

405
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,818
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor I've ever met.

406
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,863
Think about it, but not too long.

407
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,503
What's to think about?

408
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,536
Who could say no to all of this?

409
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,752
So, what can I get you
this morning?

410
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,162
Could I have the steak and eggs?

411
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,957
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?

412
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:32,932
Thanks.

413
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,875
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner
in Beacon Hill. He's there right now.

414
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,982
Bring him in quietly if you can,
but bring him in.

415
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,735
Diana, wake up.

416
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,238
Dr. Anapurn.

417
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,004
I thought I was supposed to sleep.

418
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,942
You gave me drugs.

419
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,846
You're being discharged.
You need to come with me.

420
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,153
I don't know. I guess he left
about 1 5 minutes ago.

421
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,523
Did he say where he was headed?

422
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,257
No. I mean, he didn't even touch
the food he ordered, right?

423
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,765
He just left in a hurry.

424
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,428
He left a good tip though.

425
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,644
Where are we going?

426
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,378
Thank you.

427
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,212
You can go back to your office now.

428
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,690
- Tess, don't do this.
- I'm sorry.

429
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,124
I wish it didn't have to be you,
but there's no one else.

430
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,132
We better go.
He'll be waiting for us.

431
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,342
How could I have done that?
I don't remember any of it.

432
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,308
Diana doesn't remember going
to Kevin's apartment at night either.

433
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,380
If Dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,

434
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,040
he must be getting desperate.
Feels like he's running out of time.

435
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,446
He has to complete
the experiment.

436
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,087
He's gonna up her dosage.
If we don't find Diana soon,

437
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,917
she's gonna wind up
in the same shape as Kevin.

438
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,058
I think it's the silence
that's messing us up.

439
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,356
It's too awkward.

440
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,763
So instead of us just staring
at each other, I thought we'll talk.

441
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,527
Okay.

442
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,873
Something specific
you want to talk about?

443
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,108
No. You pick.

444
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,605
Well, I've been thinking
about my parents a lot lately.

445
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,841
What they'd think of all this.

446
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,148
This place.

447
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,847
Me.

448
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,388
Sitting here trying to figure out
how to use my...

449
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,850
Telekinetic ability?

450
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,453
You know, you can say it out loud.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

451
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,399
Yeah, you can say that,

452
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,731
but when I first got back,
I was a 4400,

453
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,964
but I didn't have an ability.

454
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,903
I felt normal.

455
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,610
It was something I could hold onto.

456
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,940
Now you have to get used to the idea
that you're special.

457
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,017
Is that what my parents would think
if they were here?

458
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,154
Or would they just think
that their son had become a freak?

459
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,256
Richard, when you got taken,

460
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,694
you were one of the first black pilots
in all of the military.

461
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,265
You were at the vanguard.

462
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,333
Now you're part of a different
vanguard.

463
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,568
There's a reason they picked you.

464
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,473
I think your parents would be proud.

465
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,178
Yeah?

466
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,971
Maybe that's true.

467
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,413
Richard?

468
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,863
Well, I guess that worked, huh?

469
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,787
This will be fine.
We can work here for a while.

470
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,016
Tell him he can go home.

471
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,559
Please, you gotta help me.
Say something.

472
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,026
Don't bother.

473
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,098
He's not going to remember
any of this.

474
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,536
Thank you. You can go home now.

475
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,305
Kevin, can I get you some water?

476
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,132
No.

477
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,269
- I'm fine.
- Kevin, you're dying.

478
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,475
You're killing yourself,
and now you're gonna kill me too.

479
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,280
No.

480
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,086
You will not die.

481
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,156
My work is valid.

482
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,626
Are you sure?

483
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,061
Look at yourself.

484
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,930
If it isn't working in me,
the fault isn't with the experiment.

485
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,537
It's with me.

486
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:32,233
All those years of shock treatments,
the fistfuls of medications.

487
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,708
They must have changed me.

488
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,038
I'm not a good subject.

489
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,046
There is no good subject.

490
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,243
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.

491
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,954
You failed, and you're not thinking
clearly enough to see that.

492
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,756
My mind is not compromised.

493
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,922
We are at a point, Diana,

494
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,331
where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.

495
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,597
We have to be braver than that.

496
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,539
And if necessary...

497
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,380
... I'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.

498
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,367
Working on a song?

499
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,561
The end of one. Can't nail it though.

500
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,299
Inspiration.

501
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,475
What? Are you shocked
I'm drinking my lunch?

502
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,117
- I didn't say anything.
- Good.

503
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,048
- Because--
- Listen--

504
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,484
This here is called
maintaining a base level.

505
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,496
It's kind of scary, actually.

506
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,192
Shawn, don't worry.

507
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,497
I've made a solemn vow
not to overindulge,

508
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,538
unless, of course, you're around.

509
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,474
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.

510
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,575
You're not going to be around,
is that it?

511
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,344
You're not coming on the road?

512
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,254
I wanted to. It's just...

513
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,150
I mean, even if
it was for a little while.

514
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:35,390
This gift I have, though,
it's kind of a responsibility, you know?

515
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,429
And I don't mean to be harsh, man,

516
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,867
but I don't think it was meant
to be used

517
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,031
as a rock star's personal safety net.

518
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,520
You don't know that.

519
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,525
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive

520
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,527
so I could finish my album.

521
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,764
Nick, if you go down again...

522
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,997
... I can't be there for you.

523
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,605
There's still time, you know.

524
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,746
We can save him.

525
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,440
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in Kevin.

526
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,312
He can do this.

527
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,750
He's special,
that's why they had me wake him up.

528
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:08,949
Tess, I packed an adrenaline shot
when we left the cabin.

529
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,253
- Have you seen it?
- No.

530
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,960
I need it.

531
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,330
It has to be here in case I slip under.

532
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,092
Kevin?

533
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,436
I think I got stung by a bee.

534
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,978
What is this?

535
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,314
Don't move, Dr. Burkhoff!

536
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,649
- Tess.
- There's nowhere to go.

537
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,655
We've got this place surrounded.

538
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,119
Nobody fires.

539
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,730
He's not going anywhere.

540
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,058
Hey, Diana. Are you all right?

541
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,325
Tom.

542
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,804
Hold still, Burkhoff.

543
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,944
Put your hands up.

544
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,352
Burkhoff!!

545
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,289
They won't be able to hide for long.

546
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,688
Tess will run out of meds.

547
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,329
Dr. Burkhoff's not exactly
inconspicuous.

548
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,590
They'll show themselves,
we'll find them.

549
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,064
You mean we'll find Tess.

550
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,800
Doesn't sound like Dr. Burkhoff's
gonna live out the week.

551
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,960
I don't get it.

552
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,073
He was supposed to be the father
of 4400 technology.

553
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,401
That's why they woke him up.

554
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,373
Well, that's just our theory.

555
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,706
Maybe you're putting too much faith
in the future.

556
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,085
Diana's okay?

557
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,188
Yeah, she'll get there.

558
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,756
She's down in NTAC medical.

559
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,623
You got us a ride.

560
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,101
Someone let me borrow them.

561
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,716
Mr. Ryland wants a status report
on the promicin.

562
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,153
We're good. Great, actually.

563
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,125
We have enough of a stockpile
to last us for almost two years.
