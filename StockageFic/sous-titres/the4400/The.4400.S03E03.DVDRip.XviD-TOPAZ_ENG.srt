1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,268
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,568
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,011
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,704
Lily, are you all right?

5
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,580
- Where's my wife?
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,847
Mr. Tyler, when your wife fainted this
morning, she was a young woman.

7
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,956
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

8
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,490
she was 50 years older?

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,888
Are you my mother?

10
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,790
Richard, I'm dying.

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,228
I understand there was
an incident this morning.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,231
You attempted to harm yourself.

13
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,035
You had no right to do that!

14
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,264
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?

15
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,104
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,078
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

17
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:27,447
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,349
That was T.J. Kim
running from the courthouse.

19
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,616
When she hit, T.J. drove every man
in the building into a homicidal rage.

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,384
Ever since we took them
off the inhibitor,

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,085
they're either developing
new abilities

22
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,196
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.

23
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,831
So they are getting more dangerous.

24
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,092
You saved my life. I owe you.

25
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,529
You sold us out.

26
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,298
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.

27
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,907
This is a message
from the Nova Group,

28
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,839
We are the defensive Wing
of the 4400,

29
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,706
Today, the World has seen
What happens

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,643
to those Who try to harm us,

31
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,010
A neW era daWns,

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,365
Hi.

33
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,833
I'll need your auxiliary rounds as well,
Agent Baldwin.

34
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,043
Of course. I forgot again.

36
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,374
- Thanks. You can go in.
- Great.

37
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,548
Hi, T.J.

38
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,191
What do you want?

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,800
Dr. Burkhoff?

40
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,736
I have your prescriptions.

41
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,634
Hello?

42
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,708
Say something if you're here.

43
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,071
No, don't.

44
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,074
Please.

45
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,549
I've been having migraines.

46
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,384
How severe?

47
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,250
Bad enough.

48
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,947
Don't worry. They're just headaches.

49
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,717
I've been getting them for years.

50
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,226
Seven forty-five.

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,337
You're just in time
for my wake-up call.

52
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,069
These promicin shots,
how many a day are you up to now?

53
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,871
Six.

54
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,414
You've doubled your dosage?

55
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,882
I thought you weren't gonna do that
without talking to me.

56
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,418
We're talking now.

57
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:46,355
Look, I'm training my body
to produce a new neurotransmitter.

58
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,994
And I guarantee you,
I'm not the only one trying.

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,957
The moment the first 4400
manifested an ability,

60
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,328
an arms race began.

61
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,868
Someone is going to produce
a promicin serum

62
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,702
that will cause non-4400s
to develop extraordinary abilities.

63
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,070
It will happen.

64
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,872
And the only questions are:

65
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,641
who's going to do it?
And who's going to control it?

66
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,981
Hopefully, someone with a highly
developed sense of responsibility.

67
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,582
And some judgment.

68
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,916
Let me ask you,

69
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,719
do you meet many people like that
in your day-to-day affairs?

70
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,952
Do a lot of them
hold high-ranking government posts

71
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,621
or sit on the board
of giant pharmaceutical companies?

72
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,929
Dr. Burkhoff, I knew
that you had some personality quirks,

73
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,265
but I never pegged you for a cynic.

74
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,506
I can't afford to have a charitable view
of human nature.

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,272
There's too much at stake here.

76
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,611
If these experiments
cost me some headaches,

77
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,275
some sores,

78
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,853
I'd say that's a price worth paying.

79
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,217
Wouldn't you?

80
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,319
I'm here, right?

81
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,510
Holy mother!

82
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,619
Why are we doing this?

83
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,697
Everything I'm telling you,
it's all in my file.

84
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,629
You know it already.

85
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,325
Relax, T.J.

86
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,902
I just think it's important we review

87
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,766
everything you told
the government so far.

88
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,272
- Have we?
- Yes.

89
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,536
I keep telling you, yes.
That's everything I know.

90
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,637
Okay.

91
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,407
Thanks for your cooperation.

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,487
We're just trying
to consolidate information.

93
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,592
You'd be amazed how hard
that can be in a bureaucracy.

94
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,491
Yeah, well, I hope you don't expect
me to say, "You're welcome."

95
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,829
What are you doing?

96
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,596
What, this?

97
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,064
It's nothing.
I'm just wrapping up the interview.

98
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,654
Get geared up.
We're leaving in two minutes.

99
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,763
What for? What's going on?

100
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,465
Your partner registered
to see T.J. Kim this morning.

101
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,431
When Tom left the interview room,
T.J. was dead.

102
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,468
- What?
- Two gunshot wounds to the head.

103
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,471
Apparently, Tom snuck a small firearm
into the interrogation room.

104
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,939
By the time the guard went in
and found T.J.'s body,

105
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,668
Tom had already left the building.

106
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,710
- I'm going to pick him up now.
- Oh, wait, wait.

107
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,873
This is Tom we're talking about, here.
There's gotta be some explanation.

108
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,211
Now, maybe T.J.
used her ability on him.

109
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,116
No, she had concentrated promicin
inhibitor pumping through her veins.

110
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,450
We tried to contact Tom,
but he hasn't been picking up.

111
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,616
We need to get him in
and figure out what happened.

112
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,591
Okay, well just let me talk to him first.
He trusts me.

113
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,288
Look, this is Tom.

114
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,832
Come on, we owe him that much.

115
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,099
Yeah, okay.

116
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,807
I wasn't trying to drown myself.

117
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,408
I don't even know if I could.

118
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,079
Okay.

119
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,707
Isabelle, I just thought that after
everything that happened with Lily--

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,377
Shawn, this has nothing to do
with my mother.

121
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,724
I was teaching myself to swim.

122
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,359
In your clothes?

123
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,965
I never wore a bathing suit before.

124
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,034
I didn't know what to get.

125
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,971
And I'm too old to ask for help.

126
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,198
It's embarrassing
not knowing how to swim.

127
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,241
Everybody's got to learn sometime,
lsabelle.

128
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,778
I learned when I was a kid.

129
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,471
But I never was a kid.

130
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,014
That's why I never learned
how to swim or how to drive.

131
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,550
Or ever went out on a date.

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,315
I keep reading
about all these rites of passage.

133
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,118
Like stuff everyone goes through
before they grow up, yeah?

134
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,193
Yeah, but I am grown up.

135
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,626
And I missed out on all of it.

136
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,795
It's not fair.

137
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,194
- I've got to catch up, so I made a list.
- A list?

138
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,396
That's pretty organized.

139
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,338
Well, lsabelle,
there is a pool at the Center.

140
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,444
I could probably teach you
the basics.

141
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,046
Really?

142
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,346
Thanks, Shawn.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,667
Dad?

144
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,762
How old were you
when you learned how to swim?

145
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,203
Oh, about 1 1, I guess.

146
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,608
Why? You want me to teach you?

147
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,248
That's okay. Shawn said he'd do it.

148
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,875
Oh, he did, did he?

149
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,681
Well,

150
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,186
make sure he doesn't throw you
in the deep end right away.

151
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,086
That's what my grandmother
did to me.

152
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,360
Look, lsabelle.
I'm gonna be gone overnight.

153
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,692
- If you need anything, go see Shawn.
- Where are you going?

154
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,759
I'm gonna take your mother home.

155
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,066
I'm putting her to rest.

156
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,062
Well, can I come with you?

157
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,232
I don't think so.

158
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,876
I'm flying

159
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,011
and to tell you the truth,

160
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,050
I don't think you're ready to be away
from the Center yet.

161
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,349
You want to be alone with her
when you say goodbye, don't you?

162
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,992
Yeah. I guess I do.

163
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,593
- Tom.
- Oh, God!

164
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,569
You scared the hell out of me, Diana.
What are you doing here?

165
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,040
Why is your gun out?
What the hell is going on?

166
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,268
Jarvis is on her way over,
she's got everyone with her.

167
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,877
You need to come in.

168
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,579
- Why? What are you talking about?
- You shot T.J. Kim this morning.

169
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,714
- What?
- You don't remember?

170
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,352
Don't remember?
I didn't shoot anybody.

171
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,011
- I've been here all morning.
- Can someone confirm that?

172
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,018
No, no, I was supposed to have
a conference call with Kyle's attorneys.

173
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,718
They cancelled, though.

174
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,255
Look, I took a half a personal day,
Diana.

175
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,026
I went jogging. I wasn't at work.

176
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,728
You gotta stop saying that because
two dozen people saw you there.

177
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,806
Look, I don't know
what's going on. I--

178
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,842
Maybe you're blacking out
like Kyle did.

179
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,139
Maybe it's something else.
Maybe it's like some 4400 ability.

180
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,511
I mean, I don't know,
but you gotta come in.

181
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,341
And what happens if I do?

182
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,045
- I get arrested for murder?
- You know, we'll figure it out, okay?

183
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,884
Everyone wants to help you.
You just have to come in.

184
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,960
- You mind if I get dressed first?
- Oh, sure.

185
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,564
Are you sure you remember everything
you did this morning?

186
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,435
Like there's no time gaps
or anything?

187
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,542
You didn't take a nap?

188
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,575
Because, Tom...

189
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,606
Tom?

190
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,578
Damn it!

191
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,659
Yeah, hi, it's me. He got away.

192
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,561
I don't know how.
They only sent one agent after him.

193
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,669
Look, sorry. He got away.

194
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,930
What? No way. He's an NTAC agent.
He'll be expecting that.

195
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,274
Okay.

196
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,675
You're right. This has to happen.

197
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,314
I'll do it.

198
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,813
I was letting him get dressed.

199
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,418
I didn't think he would jump
from a second story window.

200
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,112
Well, obviously you underestimated
your partner's resolve.

201
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,621
- Does he still seem blameless to you?
- I don't know.

202
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,659
Look, it was a really bad call
and I take full responsibility.

203
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,489
I've alerted local law enforcement,
the FBl.

204
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,661
I've told them that Tom
is wanted for questioning

205
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,392
in connection with a murder.
He's a fugitive now.

206
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,866
Oh, don't give me that look, Diana.
I had no choice.

207
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,071
Sorry.

208
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,469
- It's Tom.
- Yeah.

209
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,471
Tom.

210
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,009
I'm sorry I ran out on you,

211
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,511
- Where are you?
- I didn't kill T.J. I didn't kill anyone.

212
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,479
I believe you. But you have to come in,
we can figure out what's going on.

213
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,142
- No, I'm not going to jail,
- No one's gonna put you in prison.

214
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,787
They did it to my son, Diana,

215
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,084
Was it really him that pulled the trigger
the day Jordan Collier died?

216
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,386
No, it wasn't, was it?
It was that thing inside of him.

217
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,791
- And where's Kyle? He's incarcerated.
- You're a fugitive,

218
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,363
Every police department
in Washington is looking for you.

219
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,625
NoW, some local cop
Wants to be a hero, spots you,

220
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,098
you know how these things can end.

221
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,397
No, it's gonna end with me
proving I didn't do this.

222
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,898
Look, dig around, Diana,

223
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,905
There's got to be some evidence
that'll clear me.

224
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,409
Just help me find it.

225
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,207
Did he give you a location?

226
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,184
Marco, help me out here.

227
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,495
If you were trying to prove
that your partner didn't commit a crime

228
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,293
that the whole world thinks he did,

229
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,298
where would you start?

230
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:42,006
Well, I guess I'd start by pretending
that my partner wasn't involved.

231
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,202
Okay, just think of it
like any other case.

232
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,039
What's the first thing you do
when you start?

233
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,680
Well, look at the evidence.

234
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,313
I mean, there's a dead body.
There's the gun that Tom left behind.

235
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,510
And there's a bunch of people
that saw him here.

236
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,349
Well, they've got security cameras
down in the detention ward, right?

237
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,922
You're serious?

238
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,290
You're really asking me
for all that footage?

239
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,591
Of course I'm serious.
Is that a problem?

240
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,324
Well, it's just...

241
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,263
I gave all the tapes to him,
like, an hour ago.

242
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,667
What are you talking about?
I haven't been up here all day.

243
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,844
What is this, a joke?

244
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,074
Marco, come on.
You were just here.

245
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,739
You signed for all the footage
from the detention ward.

246
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,855
- This isn't so hard.
- That's because I haven't let go yet.

247
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,890
All right, I'm gonna move my hands.
Are you ready?

248
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,824
No, not yet.
I'm kind of comfortable.

249
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,225
You're kind of comfortable?

250
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,099
I'm freezing.
I don't know what's going on.

251
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,861
- This pool is supposed to be heated.
- Want me to make it warmer?

252
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,640
- Oh, you can do that?
- I think so. Hold on.

253
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,872
How do you do that?

254
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,109
I don't know. How do you heal?

255
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,645
It's not the same, lsabelle.
Healing's one thing.

256
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,518
That's what we can all do, one thing.

257
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,252
Not me. I guess I'm different.

258
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,495
Shawn? I'm sorry to barge in.

259
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,896
We're scheduled to brief
the board of directors.

260
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,732
- That's starting now?
- Five minutes ago. They're on hold.

261
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,656
Alana.

262
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,094
Thomas. What are you doing here?

263
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,629
I'm in trouble. My bosses at NTAC,
they think I did something.

264
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,795
- I need you to come.
- What are you talking about?

265
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,236
- I don't have time to explain. Just--
- Thomas!

266
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,777
- Hello?
- Alana,

267
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,472
I'm right down the street.
I need you to come meet me.

268
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,775
Honey, I'm in trouble,
Everyone thinks I killed somebody,

269
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,252
- Who is this? I know it's not Thomas.
- What are you talking about?

270
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,948
I'm looking at Thomas right noW,

271
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,793
Honey, listen. That's not me.

272
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,691
The man you're looking at,
he can impersonate me somehow.

273
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,422
I don't believe you.

274
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,829
He Walked into NTAC
and he shot someone this morning,

275
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,496
Alana, he's dangerous,
get away from him.

276
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,299
Alana, listen to me, Your mother's
middle name is Madeleine,

277
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,034
You wanted a dog when you were
a kid, your parents gave you a bird.

278
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,939
A parakeet named Charlie.

279
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,808
Listen, we made love last night.
There were two candles burning.

280
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,471
Just hold on. I'll be right there.

281
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,979
- Did I have a dog?
- I don't have time for this.

282
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,817
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- What's going on, Tom?

283
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,627
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

284
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,562
- Where is he?
- He just ran through the back.

285
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,403
Hey!

286
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,233
Did you see a guy come down
this alley? He looked exactly like me.

287
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,005
- I didn't see anybody.
- You sure?

288
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,161
He's gone. He's gone.

289
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,854
What do you mean?
He just ran out a few seconds ago.

290
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,865
There was no one here.
Just some kid...

291
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,339
It was him. It had to be.

292
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,036
I had him. I had him.

293
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,644
Had who?
What kid are you talking about?

294
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,780
The one who's impersonating me.

295
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,582
The guy who's framing me
for murder.

296
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,723
He looked like you,
he sounded like you.

297
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,859
He was standing
as close as you are to me right now.

298
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,585
And he had me completely fooled.

299
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,424
Don't feel bad.
He fooled everyone at NTAC too.

300
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,625
At least we know
what's going on now.

301
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,291
- He's a 4400, isn't he?
- Yeah.

302
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,369
Somehow he can
pass himself off as you.

303
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,562
Yeah, I'm not sure how.

304
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,033
I mean, maybe he's got
some kind of optical camouflage.

305
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,236
He convinces your brain you're talking
to whoever he wants you to see.

306
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,677
He's a boy.
Why would he want to kill anyone?

307
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,839
Not just anybody. T.J. Kim.

308
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,417
The one member
of the Nova Group we had in custody.

309
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,647
I mean, think about it.
It's a good plan.

310
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,381
You get rid of the one member
of your cell

311
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,889
who could testify against you.

312
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,425
You compromise
a government agent.

313
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,122
And NTAC, the one agency
that's trying to hunt you down,

314
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,266
is wasting their time
chasing one of their own.

315
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,130
Alana.
You might want to get in here.

316
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,601
There's all kind of people
flashing badges everywhere.

317
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,467
They say they're NTAC agents.

318
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,541
Look, stall them.
I want you to go home.

319
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,768
I want you to lock the doors

320
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,276
and don't open it
until this is all cleared up.

321
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,507
If I need to get ahold of you,
I'll use a password.

322
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,514
How about Death in Venice?

323
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,086
Your favorite book.
It's a good choice.

324
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,693
Listen, Shawn,
thanks for letting me come in here.

325
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,763
I know it puts you at risk.
I just didn't know where else to go.

326
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,534
Look, you guys must have a database
of 4400s here, right?

327
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,964
- Yeah.
- I need to get a look

328
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,263
and find out who this kid is.

329
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,373
Here, I can pull it up
on my laptop for you.

330
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,938
This might take a while,
you mind if I let myself out?

331
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,076
No, that's fine.

332
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,179
There you go. You know,

333
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,682
Uncle Tommy,
you can stay here if you want.

334
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,518
- I might take you up on it.
- All right.

335
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,316
But, hey, you get the couch.

336
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,257
Okay.

337
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,463
Kidneys, huh?

338
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,568
That explains the blood in the urine.

339
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,136
Kevin, we had a deal.
I was gonna help you through this

340
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,206
as long as it wasn't compromising
your health.

341
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,968
Well, guess what?
I'm calling the hospital.

342
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,535
But they won't let me take my shots.

343
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,806
Oh, no. You're done with your shots.

344
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,881
I know we had an agreement.
And I'll honor it.

345
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,147
Just let me show you something
before you call.

346
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,019
What happened to your fingernails?

347
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,061
They fell off.
Dissolved, I guess you'd say.

348
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,668
God, if you're trying to change my
mind, you're not doing a very good job.

349
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,899
Kevin, what the hell did you just do?

350
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,824
Your tissue is healing itself
from trauma that quickly?

351
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,753
Kevin, you've developed
a 4400 ability.

352
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,288
It's getting there.

353
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,727
It doesn't always work.

354
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,495
Doesn't always work?
You just put a scalpel

355
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,137
- through the back of your hand.
- I know.

356
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,738
I was nervous about that.

357
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:12,316
- These are fun to drive fast.
- Yeah.

358
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,987
You know, all that information
about compression rates

359
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,721
and gear ratios
just seems completely irrelevant.

360
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,333
Well, you're not driving home.
Get out of there.

361
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,063
You're lucky you didn't wrap my car
around a pole.

362
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,729
Is there anything on this list of yours
that involves, you know,

363
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,167
a little less risk of bodily harm?

364
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,103
We could have sex.
Come on, you have a big bed.

365
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,579
Isabelle. Hey, hey.

366
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,586
- No.
- Why? It's on my list.

367
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,785
It's an important rite of passage
into adulthood.

368
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,527
It'll be fun. I was good at driving.

369
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,029
I'm sure you'd catch on real quick.

370
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,966
I don't know.

371
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,227
For one thing,
your dad would kill me.

372
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,768
Why? I'm an adult.

373
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,270
Well, you are
and you aren't, lsabelle.

374
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,932
Let's just say he has a right
to have an opinion on the matter.

375
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,841
I don't know, lsabelle. I feel like
I'd be taking advantage of you.

376
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,038
But I want to.

377
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,112
I'm flattered. I really am.

378
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,447
But I just don't think you're ready
to make that decision.

379
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,111
We barely know each other.

380
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,691
I know you better
than I know anyone else in the world.

381
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,888
That may be true.
It's still not gonna happen.

382
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,297
Lessons with lsabelle going well?

383
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,467
Not lessons
and it's completely innocent.

384
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,637
Do me a favor and
don't ask about them again.

385
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,318
- This is Skouris.
- His name is Boyd Gelder, Diana.

386
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,189
He's a 4400. I know where he lives.

387
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,457
Where who lives?
Who's Boyd Gelder?

388
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,258
The kid Who's doing this,

389
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,732
He can imitate me somehow.
And not just imitate. He can be me.

390
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,497
At least make you think he's me.

391
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,266
He lives with his mom. I'm in
Schenley Park. It's right by his house.

392
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,273
Well, can you wait for me?
I'll be 1 5 minutes.

393
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,277
I'll wait. But, Diana, just you.

394
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,108
Just me.

395
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,448
We just got here.
Where are you going?

396
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,052
Schenley Park. I think
we caught a break on Tom's case.

397
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,030
Tom!

398
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,035
Tom!

399
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,706
I didn't tell anyone, Tom.

400
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,809
Just Marco.

401
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,811
At least I thought it was Marco.

402
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,946
I looked across the park,
you were standing there.

403
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,051
It was you.

404
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,952
- But it wasn't.
- Listen, tell me about it.

405
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,026
You weren't the one actually
chasing yourself across the park.

406
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,824
I mean, I don't really run like that,
do l?

407
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,468
It's an amazing ability.

408
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,467
Marco's gonna have a field day
over this.

409
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,798
Good. Get him working on it.

410
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,999
We'll need a way to handle this guy
when we get him into custody.

411
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,268
Well, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,139
No, you don't need
to skulk around anymore.

413
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,711
You can come in with me now.

414
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,541
I'm still on the hook
for murder, Diana.

415
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,082
No, you're not. Boyd posed as you.

416
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,242
He shot T.J. Kim.
You're not responsible.

417
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,321
Listen, I just saw his abilities
with my own eyes.

418
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,957
That's proof of something,
right there.

419
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,786
I will back you up
on everything you say.

420
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,894
Which means exactly nothing.

421
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,654
Thank you, Diana,
but you're my partner.

422
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,731
Everyone expects you
to stand up for me.

423
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,760
There's only one way to prove
I didn't kill T.J. Kim.

424
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,235
- I have to get Boyd Gelder.
- Okay, let's go.

425
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,373
Are you sure you want to come?

426
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,974
I'm your partner.

427
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,168
Everyone expects
that I'll stand up for you.

428
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,984
I should be back by tonight.

429
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,121
I've been taking my time,

430
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,223
stopping off at all the places
your mother liked.

431
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,823
Everything okay? You been going
to your doctor's appointments?

432
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,988
- Most of them.
- Isabelle,

433
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,500
- We'll need to keep monitoring you.
- I'm fine,

434
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,135
Shawn's been taking good care of me
just like you asked.

435
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,431
He's doing a really good job.

436
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,402
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,

437
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,703
He taught me the back stroke.
He let me drive his car.

438
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,440
And then I asked him
to have sex with me, but he said no.

439
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,675
He said you'd be angry
if we did. Is that true?

440
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,378
Isabelle,

441
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,724
you're too young
to be thinking about

442
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,121
- that.
- I am?

443
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,661
But I thought I was almost 20.
What--?

444
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,696
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?

445
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,326
It was--

446
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,199
Things were a bit different in my day.
It's not the same.

447
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,773
It's not?

448
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,905
Why?

449
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,204
You know what, lsabelle?

450
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,216
I'm not having this conversation
with you over the phone.

451
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,087
So, Shawn was right. You are mad.

452
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,885
I don't understand.

453
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,186
What does NTAC wanna talk
to my son for, anyway?

454
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,295
Look, he's in some trouble
we can't discuss.

455
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,227
We just needed to talk to him.

456
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,162
Well, he's not here.

457
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,063
He went away on a ski-trip
with some friends

458
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,430
and won't be back till tomorrow.

459
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,798
Ma'am,

460
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,939
your son is not on a ski-trip
and this is serious.

461
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,769
Is there any way
you can contact him?

462
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,073
First, tell me what's going on.

463
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,441
I mean, what is it
you think my son did?

464
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,748
Mrs. Gelder, there are a lot of agents
looking for Boyd.

465
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,909
Situations like this
can get very chaotic.

466
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,817
People get hurt. The sooner we get
to your son, the safer he'll be.

467
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,650
So why don't you call him
and convince him you need to see him.

468
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,770
Boyd's late.
I wonder if he'll even show.

469
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,409
Let's just give him
another few minutes.

470
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,113
Nice mom. Nice house.
It makes you wonder.

471
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,445
If the Nova Group can turn this kid,
who else have they gotten to?

472
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,520
Everyone keeps telling the 4400
they're here to save the world.

473
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,417
- Whatever that means.
- Exactly.

474
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,559
I mean, say what you like about Nova,
they do seem to have a game plan.

475
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,389
I'm sure that helps
their recruiting pitch.

476
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,566
Well, I'm just guessing,
but I don't think that's Boyd.

477
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,897
How the hell did NTAC get here?

478
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,234
Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap
and tipped them off.

479
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,287
- Thomas.
- Alana, open up.

480
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,793
What are you doing here?
NTAC agents are watching the house.

481
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,022
They just drove away.

482
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,191
They must be changing shifts
or something. Come on, let me in.

483
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,702
Death in Venice, okay? Open up.

484
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,236
I don't want anyone to see me
standing out here. Come on.

485
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,436
What did you do with your key?

486
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,742
I lost it. I must have lost it
while I was running around.

487
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,714
Come on, it's me, Tom, Alana.
I gave you the password.

488
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,627
Please don't make me.
I don't have anything against you.

489
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,897
Tom, it says it's your house.

490
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,428
- Alana?
- I Wrote a letter on your computer,

491
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,073
You need to come sign it.

492
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,803
- Boyd?
- It's a confession,

493
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,672
It says you cracked under the strain

494
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,279
of the murder charges
against your son.

495
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,144
You shot T.J.
and now you can't live with it.

496
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,150
- So you decided to kill yourself.
- Where is Alana? What did you do?

497
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,080
It's my get-out-of-jail-free card.

498
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,885
See, you're the only one
who can identify me.

499
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,459
Everyone else,
they've just been seeing double.

500
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,723
- They'll sound crazy.
- I'm not signing a suicide note, Boyd,

501
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,493
- Put Alana on the phone.
- Oh, you'll sign,

502
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,101
Because either I shoot you

503
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,098
or I shoot her.

504
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,036
It's a trade.

505
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,879
Your life for hers.

506
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,412
You know what?

507
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,020
I don't think I can let you do this, Tom.
We need to call Jarvis.

508
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,748
We need to block off the street.
We need to surround your house.

509
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,792
- He has Alana.
- Tom, he wants to kill you.

510
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,395
The least we can do
is make it a little bit difficult for him.

511
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,497
If it was Maia in there,

512
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,725
would you call Jarvis?

513
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,671
Do you like it?

514
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,210
Why did you bring this to me?

515
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,042
You're a young woman.

516
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,979
A young woman
should have a nice dress.

517
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,387
This is gonna look good on you.
See for yourself.

518
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,693
Thank you.

519
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,138
I see you've been
spending a lot of time with Shawn.

520
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,772
So?

521
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,802
Well, I think it's wonderful.

522
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,773
Shawn's a very isolated young man.

523
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,471
He doesn't get to spend much time
around people his own age.

524
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,774
I think

525
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,912
you should get
as close to him as you can.

526
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,114
Matthew?

527
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,061
Shawn's nice.

528
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,822
And what I'm doing with him
is not for you

529
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,126
and it's not because
I'm trying to use him.

530
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,633
Of course not.

531
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,101
But eventually, lsabelle,

532
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,967
you and Shawn
are gonna be on opposite sides

533
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,575
of a very large ideological divide.

534
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,778
So enjoy your friendship.

535
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,745
But don't let your emotions
run too deep.

536
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,352
If you do,

537
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,180
it'll make things more difficult later.

538
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,248
- What things?
- You'll know.

539
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,856
It doesn't match your eyes.

540
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,261
You should take care of that.

541
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,818
You were a beautiful woman.

542
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,956
Both of you.

543
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,667
You looked exactly alike.

544
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,673
I never could figure out why.

545
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,769
But one way or the other,
I've had a Lily in my life

546
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,380
for over 50 years.

547
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,814
That's all gone now.

548
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,214
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

549
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,498
But it makes me feel better
knowing the two of you are together.

550
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,367
Forever.

551
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,968
This is it for you, you know.

552
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,972
I don't know what kind of fairy tale
the Nova Group sold you,

553
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,407
but it doesn't matter
what happens to me or Tom.

554
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,376
Your life is over.
They sent you on a suicide mission.

555
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,106
I volunteered.

556
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,480
And I don't think you're in any spot
to be giving me advice.

557
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,853
You're a 4400.

558
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,888
You're special.

559
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,026
You're supposed to be
changing things.

560
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,028
Instead you live
with an NTAC agent.

561
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,165
And what are you going to change,
Boyd?

562
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
You killed a girl.

563
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,897
How does that
make the world better?

564
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,230
T.J. Kim was a soldier.

565
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,841
She would rather have me
put a bullet in her head than betray us.

566
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,737
Everyone talks
about saving the world.

567
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,908
Meanwhile, for the past 50 years,
everything's been turning bad.

568
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,711
One disaster after another.

569
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,486
But we're gonna show the world
a new way.

570
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,529
We're gonna take them down
a new path.

571
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,798
By force if we have to.

572
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,430
I mean, can't you see?

573
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:49,130
The real catastrophe
is to sit back and do nothing.

574
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,574
Did you hear that?

575
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,698
Stop it.

576
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,310
- Stop it, both of you. Stop or I'll shoot.
- Nice work, Alana. We got him.

577
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,504
Shut up!

578
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,650
- Alana, Death in Venice,
- Yeah, that's the password.

579
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,787
Come on, Alana. Give me the gun.
We'll call NTAC. It's over.

580
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,095
Alana, it's me, Tom.
Ask me a question. Anything--

581
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,135
Wait, don't fall for it.
He's probably read my file.

582
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,169
He knows everything about us.
Don't listen to him.

583
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,738
Ask me something about us.

584
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,034
Something only I would know.
Anything about us.

585
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,837
Shut up, both of you.

586
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,346
Baby, I am so proud of you.
Billy would have been proud.

587
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,580
- You know about Billy?
- Yeah.

588
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,689
That was your son.
He died in a car accident.

589
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,190
Alana, he did research.
Anyone could find that out.

590
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,193
Give me the gun.
Just give me the gun.

591
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,990
Alana, give me the gun.

592
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,202
- No.
- Alana, give me the gun.

593
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,000
- Come on.
- Get down on the ground.

594
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,041
What? No, no.
You've got the wrong one.

595
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,806
- Think about this.
- I said get down.

596
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,351
Hold still, Boyd.

597
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,055
Don't move.

598
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,561
You're just a boy.

599
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,830
I'm a soldier.

600
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,529
- And there are more of us every day.
- Let's go, soldier.

601
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,444
Hey, welcome back.

602
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,747
- Yeah, thanks.
- Did everything go okay?

603
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,788
Yeah, thank you.

604
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,153
And thank you
for keeping an eye on lsabelle.

605
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,760
Oh, well.

606
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,727
It's not a problem.
I didn't really do much.

607
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,295
Yeah, well, thank you, anyway.

608
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,967
I worry about her.

609
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,429
Well, you don't really need to.

610
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,768
She seems to be getting along
really well.

611
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,236
I'm her father. It's my job.

612
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,483
And it's harder with lsabelle.

613
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,222
People see her, they see a woman.

614
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,582
A beautiful woman.

615
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:01,261
And they might forget
that inside she's just a little girl.

616
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,969
Still,

617
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,904
I'm glad she has you around,

618
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,873
to be a friend.

619
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,330
Shawn.

620
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,734
- How'd you get in here?
- I can do stuff, remember?

621
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,077
Yeah.

622
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,338
So, what's up? What do you need?

623
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,313
Just one thing.

624
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,422
It's on my list.

625
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,038
First kiss.

626
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,668
This isn't smart, lsabelle.

627
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,507
Okay.
