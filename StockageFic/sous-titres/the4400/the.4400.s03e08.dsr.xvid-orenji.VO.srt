1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,200
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,140
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,140
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,730
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,310
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,690
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,170
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,500
We're not a threat.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,020
We're salvation.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,420
The world will have to deal with us.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,750
Previously on the 4400...

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,090
I need you to talk to shawn.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,800
Tell him he can't break up with me.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,710
It would be a mistake.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,190
Isabelle's not giving up,not without a fight.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,010
I don't want this relationship to end...

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,510
so it's not going to.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,940
I know I haven't always been there for you,kyle,

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,990
but I thought we had a pretty good relationship.

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,010
We do. It's just...

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,060
growing up with a dad who works for the fbi,ntac...

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,220
it can be pretty intense,you know?

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,560
You're supposed to say,"I wanted to."

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,770
Don't push your luck.

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,700
I told you what we were doing,and you used it to betray me.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,910
Ryland is responsible for the death of 28 4400s,

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,940
28 people that might've changed the world for the better were they allowed to live.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,180
Alana will be prosecuted like any other member of the nova group.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,130
You're one of the only good men left in this fight.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,100
I'll find a way to bring you back.I promise.

31
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,750
Hi,erika.

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,500
Stay away.

33
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,930
I'm not going to hurt you,erika.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,500
I just want to talk.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,480
That's what you always said.

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,370
That's how you used to get me up into your room.

37
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,560
I mean it now.

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,580
I swear.

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,690
This time I'm for real.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,810
I'm not going to let you touch me!

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,990
It's okay.

42
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,020
Uncle patrick's here.

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,730
Tom baldwin?

44
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,450
I need your initial by the X.

45
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,740
What is it?

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,130
Sorry,man. Not a psychic.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,570
"These are not dinner.Hang in there. Diana."

48
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,020
Baldwin.

49
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,660
Jarvis said this is a suicide.

50
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,380
Any idea why we got called?

51
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,470
Not really.

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,970
She said there's a D.E.A. Agent at the scene.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,180
Apparently,he requested an ntac presence.

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,930
Hey,by the way,thanks for the cookies.

55
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,060
That was really thoughtful.

56
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,440
Cookies?

57
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,460
Yeah. The basket full of cookies.The ones you sent.

58
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,710
I didn't send you anything,tom.

60
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,390
In fact,I was going to thank you.

61
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,630
Thank me? For what?

62
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,330
I got a basket of cookies,too,maybe an hour ago,from you.

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,190
At least,that's what the card said.

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,810
I didn't send you anything either.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,420
You two from ntac?

66
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,320
Yes.

67
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,540
Matt ruddy.

68
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,830
I'm with the D.E.A.

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,990
Come on in.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,080
I guarantee you'll find this interesting.

71
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,380
Her name's erika lundgren.

72
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,660
She's our third suicide in the past two weeks.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,970
Why is the D.E.A. Investigating suicides?

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,710
Because we think they're all connected.

75
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,750
For the past six weeks or so,

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,730
we've been hearing about a new recreational drug hitting the streets.

77
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,040
It's called "blink."

78
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,890
We got a small sample off a dealer we arrested.

79
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,380
But why call us? It's hardly our area of expertise.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,710
We had the sample analyzed.

81
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,620
One of the components our laboratory guys isolated was like nothing he'd even seen before,

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,900
so they did some more checking.

83
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,910
It's similar to what they found in the 4400s.

84
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,720
What do you call it?Promicin?

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,300
What,so,this drug "blink,"you think a 4400 is synthesizing it?

86
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,800
That's why I called you guys.

87
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,470
If there's a 4400 involved in this,

88
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,030
I figure you could help track him down.

89
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,230
Absolutely.

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,030
It'd help if we knew more about this drug.

91
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,020
We don't know much about it,

92
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,500
except it seems to be a powerful hallucinogen.

93
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,010
Well,how do you know erika lundgren was on blink when she jumped?

94
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,700
Her roommate told us.

95
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,770
Erika took blink this morning.

96
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,740
Pretty soon after that,

97
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,270
she started telling me she was seeing her uncle.

98
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,020
She was really freaked out.

99
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,190
I mean,the guy's in some prison for 12 or more years.

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
Do you know where she got the drug?

101
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,960
When erika wanted to get high,

102
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,720
she'd go see this guy she went to school with.

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,390
I guess he deals now.

104
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,350
I mean,I don't know if that's where she got it from,

105
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,390
but his name's greg.

106
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,870
He usually hangs out in cowen park.

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,190
He always wears this old high school varsity jacket.

108
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,660
Erika said he used to be a track star or something.

109
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,650
Tony.

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Take care of her.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
Thank you.

112
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,270
We should probably head to cowen park,

113
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,310
find out where this guy greg gets his blink.

114
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,560
Hello,tommy.

115
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,500
Dad?

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,810
Hey,tommy,you're standing in the middle of the street.

117
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,670
Better be careful.
Tom?

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,600
Tom,what are you doing?

119
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,910
Come on.Off the road.

120
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,770
What's going on?

121
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,590
Diana,that D.E.A. Guy,

122
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,590
h-he said blink causes hallucinations,right?

123
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,420
Of course. Why?

124
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,210
Because I think I just saw my father.

125
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,430
He was right over there.

126
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,240
Tom,your father's been dead nine years.

127
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,220
Exactly.

It was the cookies.It had to be.

131
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,130
Tom,slow down.

132
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,100
Why would anyone want to slip you blink?

133
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,110
I don't know. Maybe it's some bitter 4400,someone who hates ntac.

134
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,590
Yeah,maybe,but I ate a cookie too.

135
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm not seeing a dead relative.I feel fine.

136
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,200
Tom,you've been under a lot of stress lately.

137
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,080
All this talk of hallucinations--

138
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,170
your mind just decided to play tricks on you.

139
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,250
Yeah. Maybe.

140
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,510
Still,though,I think I should probably drive.

141
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,680
Well,what do you want to talk about?

142
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,260
Diana,do you see him?

143
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,320
See who?

144
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,820
My father. He's right there.

145
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,320
Tom,I don't see anything.

146
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,770
Nobody else can see me,pal.

147
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,150
I'm just here for you.

148
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,480
Just be quiet.You're not real.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,740
Listen to me,tom.There's no one there.

150
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,840
Real or not real,I'm here,

151
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,950
and you're going to have to deal with me.

152
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,170
What do you want,dad?

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,680
It's not what I want.It's what you want.

154
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,560
You're the one who brought me here.

155
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,510
Must be something you want to say to me.

156
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,650
I've got nothing to say to you.

157
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,980
Tom,listen to me.There is no one back there.

158
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,640
You just have to try and calm down.

159
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,140
Yes,there is,diana.He's right--

160
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,230
he's gone.

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,280
He was right there,diana.I swear.

162
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,130
Tom,I'm going to take you into ntac medical,all right?

163
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,430
It's going to be fine.

164
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,540
That was nice.

165
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,550
See? It all still works between us.

166
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,210
I'm glad you came back.

167
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,310
Isabelle,not right now,okay?

168
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,580
I've got stuff I should do.

169
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Let it wait.

170
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,490
Isabelle...

171
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,270
this time,if you want,

172
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,140
I could make you think I'm someone else.

173
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,510
Anyone you've ever had a fantasy about?

174
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,580
I can make the earth move for us.

175
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,860
Literally.

176
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,720
Isabelle,you don't need to use your abilities to tempt me.

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,680
Believe me,you're just fine on your own.

178
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
I've just got to go.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,590
You never used to leave right after.

180
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,360
We've lost something,haven't we?

181
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,320
I mean,we still fit together and everything,

182
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,550
but it's not the same,is it?

183
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,700
No,it's not.

184
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,590
And we keep pretending everything's the same way it used to be.

185
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,600
I still keep pretending.

186
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,960
How's it working for you?

187
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,220
Not well.

188
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,560
I think I know what we need to do.

189
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,480
Good.

190
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,980
I'm glad you realize it too.

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,210
We have to get married.

192
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,710
It's the only way we can be sure we'll never lose each other.

193
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,980
Isabelle--

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,080
you go do your stuff.

195
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,660
I'll start thinking about a guest list.

196
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,490
Your cat scan came back fine,

197
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,600
but your blood pressure is still a little elevated.

198
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,170
Aside from that,your vitals are holding steady.

199
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,790
What about his labs?Any drugs in his system?

200
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,350
The toxscreen is negative,but that's not surprising,

201
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,760
because we don't know a lot about testing blink.

202
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,030
We've given you a mild sedative,

203
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,860
but that's all we can do for the moment.

204
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,170
So I can go home,right?

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,420
I haven't seen my dad in,what,six hours.

206
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,570
Well,typically,it takes about 48 hours for a psychotropic drug to leave your system.

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,900
We don't know much about blink.

208
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,620
So it's impossible to say how long the effects will last.

209
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,770
Or how severe they'll be.

210
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,360
Hallucinogens tend to affect everyone differently.

211
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,150
It depends what kind issues you're carrying in your subconscious.

212
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,560
All right,I'll have garrity give you both a ride home.

213
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,110
You two are taking a couple of days off.

214
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't need a couple of days.I feel fine.

215
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,030
Yeah,but you ate the cookies,too.

216
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,370
And until we're sure the drugs are out of your system,

217
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,120
you're both on medical leave.

218
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,420
I spoke to your dad about our conversation.

219
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,800
We wanted to talk to you together.

220
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,450
I don't know if you're serious about this whole proposal thing,

221
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,660
but we need to nip it in the bud right now.

222
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,220
You and me getting married is not a good idea.

223
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,220
You're both too young,

224
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,800
and neither of you are ready for that kind of commitment.

225
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,240
I can't allow it.

226
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,350
I'm your father,

227
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,260
and I'm telling you this is not going to happen.

228
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,530
Your father speaks for both of us.

229
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm not going along with this.

230
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,250
I get what the both of you are saying.

231
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,040
There are millions of reasons why we shouldn't get married.

232
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,830
There are just more reasons why we should.

233
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,590
Did either of you ever think that maybe this relationship was meant to happen?

234
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,230
That shawn and I were set up to meet,fall in love?

235
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,910
Isabelle,I don't love you.

236
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,210
Shawn,you and i are the two most powerful people on the planet.

237
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,740
We're supposed to be together.Who else is good enough for you?

238
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,730
Isabelle,the man just told you straight up--

239
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,350
he doesn't want to marry you.How much clearer does he have to be?

240
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,590
You have to accept that.

241
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,970
No.

242
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,310
I don'T.

243
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,250
Actually,you two need to change the way you're thinking.

244
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,160
Maybe it would help if you thought about it like an arranged marriage.

245
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,010
The future wants us to be together.

246
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,170
We're going to be together.

247
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,150
I'll make sure of it.

248
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,790
Are you sure you're going to be okay alone?

249
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,370
Because I can stay with you if you'd like.

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,580
No,I'm fine.

251
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,400
With any luck,that stuff's worn off already.

252
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,190
Well,call if you need anything.

253
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,430
I will.

254
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,800
Good night.
Good night.

255
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,990
Okay,garrity,you can take me home now.

256
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,430
Hey,diana.

257
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,980
Josh?

258
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,220
It's good to see you.

259
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,400
You look...different.

260
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,050
You look exactly the same.

261
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,190
What are you doing here?

262
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,580
There's some stuff that we need to talk about.

263
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't think so.

264
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,050
I mean,we haven't spoken in,what,11 years?

265
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,090
I don't see any reason to change that.

266
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,760
That's a bit harsh,don't you think?

267
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,130
We've been through a lot together.

268
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,680
No,you put me through a lot.

269
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,470
There's a difference.

270
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,830
You all right?

271
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,690
It looked like you were just talking to yourself.

272
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,230
No. I'm not okay.

273
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,150
I think I got slipped a dose of blink,too.

274
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,070
Really.

275
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,130
Who'd you see?

276
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,650
No one.

277
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,250
Just some guy I used to know.

278
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,110
You were engaged?

279
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,420
Yeah. In grad school.

280
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,790
I had to take a physics course.

281
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,630
Josh sandler was the teaching assistant,

282
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,220
and we dated for three years.

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,470
I'm sorry. I know it's a lot to spring on you.

284
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,640
Yeah,well,you never said anything.

285
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,800
Well,it's not something I particularly like to talk T.

286
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,520
Uh,I don't want to sound jealous of a hallucination,

287
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,180
but...you must think about this guy a lot,huh?

288
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,480
Tom's seeing his dad.

289
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,710
You know,that makes sense.

290
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,270
Every kid's father is buried deep in their psyche.

291
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,690
Erika lundgren saw her uncle.

292
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,090
Who knows what kind of history they had.

293
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,400
Look,I can't answer for her,

294
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,230
but I can tell you that josh and i have plenty of our own history,

295
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,550
and most of it bad.

296
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,030
We had a fight about 10 days before the wedding,broke the engagement.

297
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,770
It was ugly.

298
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,900
Do you want to talk about it?

299
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,010
No.

300
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,630
The last thing I want to do is talk about josh sandler.

301
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,050
Listen,I'm exhausted,

302
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,860
and I just want to take a shower and get into bed.

303
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,780
Want some company?

304
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,180
No,not tonight.

305
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,430
I'll call you in the morning.

306
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,520
Okay.

307
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,040
You got the place to yourself now,huh?

308
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,500
A lot of room for one guy.

309
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,490
You know,now that alana's gone,

310
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,470
you ought to think about selling the place,

311
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,600
get some kind of an apartment.

312
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,840
Than for the suggestion,dad.

313
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,640
I like it fine here.

314
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,990
Still holding out for your son to come home,huh?

315
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,050
I've got to tell you,buddy,

316
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,260
I don't think that's going to happen.

317
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,470
Hey,don't get mad.

318
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,100
Trying to have a conversation here,

319
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
except you're not saying anything.

320
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,100
I wouldn't even know where to start.

321
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,210
Pick a topic.

322
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,910
Fine.Let's talk about when I was a kid.

323
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,610
I used to hate coming home when I knew you were going to be there.

324
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,340
You were nasty to mom.You drank.

325
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,970
You hated being a beat cop so much that you did everything you could to keep me out of law enforcement.

326
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,240
When I did get into the fbi,you never called.

327
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,680
Never said congratulations.

328
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,580
Too busy being jealous of your own damn kid.

329
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,790
Okay.I'm officially talking to myself now.

330
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,910
Feeling better?

331
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,750
Come on,tommy,you're a grownup.

332
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,770
I never figured you'd still be carrying so much anger toward me.

333
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,660
Being a father,you know how complicated it gets.

334
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,580
Look at you and kyle.The kid's in jail.

335
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,660
He won't even talk to you,let alone see you.

336
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,480
Kyle needs some time,and I'm giving it to him.

337
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,450
That's called respect.

338
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,300
I have always been there for him,good times and bad.

339
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,520
I didn't learn that from you.

340
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,890
I know I wasn't much of a father.

341
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,950
I tried to be there for you and susan.

342
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,220
Look for understanding someplace else.

343
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,730
In fact,why don't you do us both a favor and just go away?

344
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,030
That's not going to happen.

345
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,480
Fine. Then I will.

346
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,200
You can't just walk away,pal.

347
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
It ain't going to be that easy to get rid of me.

348
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,940
If you won't go away,I'll make you go away.

349
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,110
I'm going to find the 4400 who's doing this to me,and I'm going to force him to stop it.

350
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,220
You're going back on the case?

351
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,330
I'll come with you.

352
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,180
No,no.

353
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm not working an investigation with my dead father.

354
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,790
I don't think you've got much of a choice,tom.

355
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,020
Either I come along for the ride...

356
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,340
or you and me go back inside and talk some more.

357
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,380
Fine.

358
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,900
Just don't show up when I'm in the middle of talking to somebody,okay?

359
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,460
No problem.

360
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,230
It's been a long time since I worked a case.

361
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,790
It's going to be fun.

362
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,900
You still make those late night bowls of ben & jerry's,huh?

363
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,980
Josh,I want you to go away.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,340
Just stop showing up in my life.

365
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,520
You know,it's funny,

366
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,310
but you'd only make yourself ice cream after everybody else had gone to bed.

367
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,800
I used to wonder what that said about you.

368
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,760
You know,you're going to have to talk to me eventually.

369
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,280
No.

370
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,150
You see,you're a hallucination,

371
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,810
so I just have to make a conscious choice to ignore you,

372
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,560
and eventually,you'll be gone.

373
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,810
That's a good plan.

374
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,300
I just don't think it's going to work.

375
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,230
See,there's a reason I'm here,diana.There has to be.

376
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,410
You're random,just a mental hiccup.

377
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,310
Josh sandler isn't even dead.

378
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,770
I googled him tonight.

379
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,180
He teaches astronomy at pomona college.

380
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,510
So?That's the present-day josh sandler.

381
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,860
Your issues are with me,the guy you were engaged to.

382
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,930
I don't have any issues!

383
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,560
Mommy?

384
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,220
Are you okay?

385
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,630
I heard noises.

386
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm fine,sweetie.

387
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,380
I'm just...practicing something for work.

388
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,000
Come on.

389
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,060
Let's get you to bed.

390
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,230
You were engaged?

391
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,160
Why does everyone have such a hard time believing that?

392
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,830
Well,it's not a hard time believing it.

393
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,330
Just... well,you never told me.

394
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,260
It was a long time ago.

395
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,000
It didn't work out.

396
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,510
Listen,I'm glad you called.

397
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,930
I don't like the idea of a drug in my system that caused three suicides.

398
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,210
These hallucinations we're having--

399
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,940
so far,it doesn't seem like the same thing erika lundgren went through.

400
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,120
All my dad wants to do is talk.

401
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,310
I know. Josh hasn't threatened me either.

402
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,400
As long as it stays that way,

403
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,820
there's no reason we can't use our "free time" to look into this case.

404
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,980
There's that delivery service.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,470
If we can track down the source of those cookies,

406
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,840
maybe we can find the 4400 who's behind all of this.

407
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,910
And there's cowen park.

408
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,190
That dealer doesn't know anyone's looking for him.

409
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,380
I'll take the park,you take the delivery service.

410
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,230
Sounds good.

411
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,330
Anything but waiting around for my ex to show up...

412
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,890
devon,all of these messages are from this morning?

413
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah,well,everyone wants to congratulate you on your engagement.

414
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,680
Don't you want to start returning?

415
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,190
No,I don't want to talk to anyone.

416
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,950
Not even your mother?I have her on hold.

417
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah. Thank you,devon.

418
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,370
Mom. Hey.

419
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
No--

420
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,130
mom--

421
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,950
mom,who told you I got engaged?

422
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,820
No. I'm coming right over.

423
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,790
Mom,where are you?

424
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,660
A little mischievous one,wasn't he?

425
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,070
So cute.
Look at those eyes.

426
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,670
Look at that little butt!

427
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,540
Somebody tell me what's going on here?

428
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,090
If it isn't mr. Secretive.

429
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,730
I'm just showing your fiancee your baby pictures.

430
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,820
Consider it punishment for not making me the first phone call.

431
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,870
Come on,sit.

432
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,200
I'd love to,but isabelle and i have to actually get going.

433
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,480
We have a lot to talk about.

434
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,420
You bet we do.

435
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,650
My oldest boy is getting married,and I'm going to help plan the wedding.

436
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,390
I promise we won't make any decisions without you,

437
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,810
but isabelle,we need to go now.

438
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,850
Shawn,you're being rude.

439
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,860
I don't mean to be,but we really need to go.

440
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,360
Now.

441
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,600
It was really nice seeing you again.

442
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,130
You too.

443
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,140
I love your son very much.

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,500
We should probably be heading in the other direction.

445
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,710
Great. You're back.

446
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,880
We're going to covington,right?

447
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,780
You shouldn't backseat drive,josh.

448
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,920
You know,it was always one of your least flattering qualities.

449
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,250
Could you speak up a bit,ma'am?I didn't catch that.

450
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,070
I wasn't talking to you.

451
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,460
I was j--

452
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,220
sorry.

453
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,460
I don't mean to be annoying.

454
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,220
I'm sorry for everything,actually--

455
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,390
the way things worked out with us.

456
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,490
I-- I just had to say that out loud.

457
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,500
Apology not accepted.Do you mind just being quiet?

458
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,510
You know,I have to admit,

459
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,690
this is not how I pictured you at all.

460
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,220
I mean,working for the government,you're carrying a gun...

461
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,790
the whole thing with us,the wedding--

462
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,390
it really must have changed you.

463
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,270
As usual,josh,you're placing yourself at the center of everything.

464
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,760
Maybe I have changed,but it's got nothing to do with you.

465
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,350
In fact,until you showed up yesterday,

466
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,830
I hadn't even thought about you in...five years?

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,960
What?

468
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,710
It's just that your left eye still does that little twitching thing when you lie.

469
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,850
Yeah,I remember you.The gift basket.

470
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,330
Right.Well,there were cookies inside,

471
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,230
and we have reason to believe that they were laced with an illegal drug.

472
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,920
Hey,I don't know anything about that.

473
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,690
I just pick stuff up and deliver it.

474
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,720
Well,you delivered it to me.

475
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,320
Where'd you pick it up?

476
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,040
That's supposed to be confidential.

477
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
I guess it's okay this one time.

478
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,660
It was an old building downtown.

479
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,460
Here it is.156 liberty avenue.

480
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,580
Look at these people.

481
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,060
They don't even try to hide what they're doing.

482
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,690
I tell you,things have changed since I was walking the beat.

483
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
Yeah. I know.

484
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,800
You would have won the war on drugs singlehanded.

485
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,490
You've become a really angry guy,you know that?

486
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,060
I'm not trying to pick a fight here.

487
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,680
I know I'm not perfect.

488
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,770
You're not even alive.

489
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,020
All right,fair enough.

490
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,230
I wasn't perfect.

491
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,710
I blame most of that on the job.

492
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,870
You get burned out dealing with this crap.

493
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,960
Violence,ugliness...

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,030
it got inside my head.

495
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,910
I couldn't switch it off when I got home.

496
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,350
That's why I drank.

497
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,690
That's why I got nasty sometimes with you,your mother.

498
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm not making excuses for myself.

499
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,690
You seem to need some kind of an explanation for what I did.

500
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,110
That's the best one I can give you.

501
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,980
Okay.

502
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:03,050
It's not anything I didn't already know,but...okay.

503
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,160
That dealer we're looking for?

504
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,760
Didn't you say he wears some kind of a high school varsity jacket?

505
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,680
Yeah. Why?

506
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,530
I don't know what you're so worked up about.

507
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,500
You won't find anything.

508
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,530
This wouldn't happen to be blink,would it?

509
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,850
So what if it is?

510
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,120
Blink's brand new,man.

511
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,180
Feds haven't even had time to make it illegal yet.

512
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,640
Yeah,we'll find time.

513
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,700
That's what we do when people start dying.

514
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,340
So who's supplying you with this?

515
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,570
You think I'd tell you that?

516
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,860
Baldwin.

517
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,390
Did jarvis say what this is about?

518
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,520
No,just that there'd been some break in the case.

519
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,570
These are the agents that were affected?

520
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,900
This is tom baldwin,diana skouris.

521
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,460
They were compromised yesterday.

522
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,830
I am so sorry about all of this.

523
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,170
You were drugged against your will,

524
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,250
and those young people committing suicide--

525
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,450
it's all so terrible.

526
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,470
Uh,ma'am,who are you?

527
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,970
My name is naomi bonderman.

528
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,750
It's my ability that did this to you.

529
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,450
I caused all of this.

530
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,500
one day about 3 months ago

531
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,060
I woke up with what I thought were sweaty palms.

532
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,250
Then I realized it wasn't sweat.

533
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,070
It was some kind of...

534
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,290
oil,I suppose you'd call it.

535
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,740
And that's when I first saw my sister.

536
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,120
This sister of yours,you hadn't seen her for a while?

537
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,210
Ruth's been dead for 30 years.

538
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,650
And there she was,standing at the foot of my bed.

539
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,220
We were never close.

540
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,410
But once I realized I hadn't gone completely batty,

541
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,420
we had a very nice visit.

542
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,280
Finally,after all these years,

543
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,930
we worked things out between us.

544
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,300
In the morning,she was gone.

545
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,420
And then I touched gordon's hand.

546
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,260
Gordon?Is that your husband?

547
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,050
No,my mailman.

548
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,520
And that night,he was visited by some army buddy of his who was wounded in the first gulf war.

549
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,620
That's when I started wearing my gloves.

550
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,690
Mrs. Bonderman,have you any idea how your ability came to be sold on the streets?

551
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
At first,I had no idea,

552
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,160
but now,I think it had something to do with my fried chicken.

553
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,980
I use a lot of herbs in my cooking.

554
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,320
I grow them myself.

555
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,760
That's the only place I don't wear my gloves,

556
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,230
when I'm working in the garden.

557
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,930
And the herbs absorbed the oil from your hands.

558
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,490
My family had come over for sunday dinner,

559
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,770
and that night,they all started having their own encounters.

560
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,940
It was very emotional for everyone,

561
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,810
but it all seemed to work out for the best.

562
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,240
No one died or anything.

563
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,280
Could someone have gotten ahold of these herbs,

564
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,540
used them to make this drug?

565
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,020
Well,that must have been what happened.

566
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,460
The tuesday after the dinner,I went out to water,

567
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,790
and all of my plants were gone.

568
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,670
Pulled out.

569
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,620
Someone stole the herbs from your garden...

570
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,550
someone who knew the effect they could have.

571
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,980
I had hoped one day my ability might be used as a kind of therapy,to help people,

572
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,870
but now it's being sold on the street and people are dying.

573
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,830
It's just horrible.

574
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,760
Mrs. Bonderman,have you any sense of how long these visions usually last?

575
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,580
Sometimes the visitors stay for days,weeks,even.

576
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,330
I know one thing,though.

577
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,790
The more you ignore them,the longer they stay and the more insistent they become.

578
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,230
I know we're officially on medical leave,

579
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,780
but I thought I might check out that address we got from the delivery company,

580
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,210
try and find who sent the cookies.

581
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,140
You want to come along?

582
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,550
Actually,I was going to stop by mrs. Bonderman's house,

583
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,250
go over the guest list from that dinner one more time.

584
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,220
She seemed a little vague about who was there.

585
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,930
You think one of them might've gone into business with grandma's recipe?

586
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,840
It's a place to start.

587
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,480
Isabelle,this has to stop.

588
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,070
You can't force me to marry you.

589
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,300
You've got cold feet.

590
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,320
I've read about this.

591
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,120
No,it's not cold feet.

592
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,960
I want you to understand this not going to happen.

593
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,170
I'm not going to marry you,

594
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
and if you can't accept that,

595
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,690
if you want to hurt me for rejecting you,

596
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,980
you go ahead and do it.

597
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,530
I'm right here.

598
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,860
Let's get it over with.

599
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,540
I would never hurt you,shawn.

600
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,500
That's good to hear.

601
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,180
Okay,we're clear,right?

602
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,530
It's over between the two of us?

603
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,010
You told me once that good and evil was a choice,

604
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,100
one you get to make.

605
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,800
Well,right now,I'm at a place where I have to make that choice,

606
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,710
and I'm afraid if I lose you,I'm going to make the wrong one.

607
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,400
Who will you threaten this time? My mom?

608
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,910
Shawn,I'm not threatening anyone.

609
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,550
I'm asking for your help.
My help?

610
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,600
There are things I was sent here to do,brutal things.

611
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,860
Your mother and millions of other people could die because of me.

612
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,120
I don't know how you could know that,

613
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,800
but it doesn't have to happen that way.

614
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,530
You can fight it.

615
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,190
That's what I'm trying to do.

616
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,160
That's why you and me,we need to be together,

617
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,930
because I think you're the only one who can stop me.

618
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,520
Are you sure this is the place?

619
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah. I stood right here.

620
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,660
Guy came out from the back,handed me the cookies,that was it.

621
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,390
The management company said this office has been vacant for eight months.

622
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,400
You said these guys are drug dealers,right?

623
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,530
I mean,maybe they move around a lot.

624
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,620
Maybe they operate out of a whole bunch of different places.

625
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,020
And the man who gave you the cookies,

626
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,600
you don't remember anything about him?

627
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,550
I wasn't really paying attention.If I saw him again,maybe.

628
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,480
Look,since no one's here,can I go?

629
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
I've got to get back to work.

630
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,310
Yeah,sure.

631
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,520
Thanks for trying.

632
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,010
Call me if something comes to you.

633
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,940
Sure.

634
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,890
Is that a clue?

635
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,230
I'm trying to work here.

636
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,890
You know what,this isn't fun for me either.

637
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,780
I've got my job,too.

638
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,070
There must be something you want to say to me,talk about old times--

639
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,250
old times?

640
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,480
You cheated on me,two weeks before the wedding.

641
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,960
Who does something like that?

642
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,280
I figured you'd still be still mad about that.

643
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,570
It took me forever to get over what you did.

644
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,640
The hurt,the betrayal--but I did it.

645
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,990
I put you behind me,I moved on,

646
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,180
I'm not interested in a single thing you have to say.

647
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,560
Josh?

648
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,980
Are we done?

649
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,610
Anybody could get over that fence.

650
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,270
Thanks for pointing that out.

651
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,410
Remember when you were a kid,you used to help me mow the lawn?

652
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,730
I remember you yelling at me for missing spots.

653
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,460
I wanted you to do a good job,

654
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,350
take pride in your work,be a man.

655
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,260
Yeah,well,it worked.

656
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,160
No matter what the situation,

657
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,470
I just think about what you would do,and I do the opposite.

658
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,890
Never failed.

659
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,090
That's my tommy.He's got all the answers,huh?

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,070
When it comes to you,I do.

661
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,820
All right,then,answer me this.

662
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,300
The last time I went in the hospital,

663
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,370
the time I didn't make it out,

664
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,100
why didn't you come see me?

665
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,540
It's a simple question,tom.

666
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,130
Agent baldwin?

667
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,630
Would you like some iced tea?

668
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,420
Let's see,there were barry,kathleen,and the twins--

669
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,680
oh,they cried all through dinner--

670
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,990
philip and his new girlfriend.

671
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,360
I'm afraid I don't remember her name.

672
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,600
Uh,roger and julie.

673
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm sorry,julie was sick that day.

674
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,870
A sinus headache.She gets them all the time.

675
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,630
That's my grandson,randy.

676
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,420
He works for door-to-door delivery?

677
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,500
He's still finding himself.

678
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,760
Does he know about your ability?

679
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,170
Oh,of course he does.

680
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,860
He was here at that dinner.

681
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,950
He had two helpings of chicken.

682
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,260
Neighbor says randy left a few hours ago.

683
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,080
No idea where he went.

684
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,010
We know he's not at work.

685
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,620
I'll check the bedroom,see if I can find an address book.

686
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,290
Don't you guys ever stop for lunch?

687
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,550
I thought I'd gotten rid of you.

688
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,300
No,no,we still have some ground to cover.

689
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,560
You know that thing that you said about how you moved on,

690
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
that you put me behind you?

691
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,340
I'm not really sure I'm buying it.

692
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,430
I don't care.

693
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,850
Well,maybe not.

694
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,760
But if you're so over me,

695
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,260
how come you haven't had a single serious relationship since we broke up?

696
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,950
I have had plenty of serious relationships,

697
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,370
ones that were a lot more respectful and successful than the one I had with you.

698
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,200
You want to name one?

699
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,310
What do you call marco?

700
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,860
I'd call him a very sweet guy who would do anything for you.

701
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,240
You could learn something from him.

702
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,690
Still,it's a relationship with no future,and you know it.

703
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,120
That's why you're with him.

704
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,670
I have no idea what kind of future I've got with marco.

705
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,080
We haven't been going out that long.

706
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,680
You'll go out for a couple of months,

707
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,690
and then when he pushes you for a commitment,

708
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,640
you'll finally tell him the truth,

709
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,780
that there isn't any chemistry,

710
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,010
that you're really not right for each other--

711
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,480
all things you already know.

712
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,970
Is that really the way I treat the guys I date?

713
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,700
Di...

714
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,270
you're an amazing woman,and I blew it.

715
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,390
What I did to you was cruel,

716
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,350
but you can't keep protecting yourself forever.

717
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,000
It's not fair to you,and it's not fair to marco.

718
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,020
Offhand,I'd say somebody's been doing some baking.

719
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,570
Yeah,but where did all of the cookies go?

720
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,960
Look,buddy,I know you're busy,but you never answered my question.

721
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,860
Why didn't you come see me when I was dying?

722
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,750
Dad,I really can't talk about this now.

723
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,990
Hey,it's not my favorite memory either.

724
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,410
So let's get it over and done with.

725
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,200
Then I'll leave you alone.

726
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,250
You mean if I tell you,that's it?

727
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,500
We're done,you're gone?

728
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,100
It would be a step in the right direction.

729
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,690
I was in baltimore,working on a case for the bureau.

730
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,630
When I got the call from mom,I booked a flight home.

731
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,880
I was all set to go,but then the case heated up and I missed my plane.

732
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,910
By the time I could get another one,it was too late.

733
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,370
I asked you for the truth,tommy.

734
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,650
You're just giving me excuses.

735
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,230
You want the truth?

736
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,700
I stayed away as a favor to you.

737
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,330
You didn't want me there,dad.

738
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,580
Whatever I'd say,whatever I'd do,

739
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,270
it would only piss you off,like always.

740
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,610
I figured my not being there would make it easier for you.

741
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,650
I let you die in peace.

742
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,880
I wanted to see you one last time.

743
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,100
You're my son,tommy.I love you.

744
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,470
Well,that's nice to hear,but it's a little too late.

745
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,720
I know.

746
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,320
That was my fault.I'm sorry.

747
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,960
But I did want you there,tommy.

748
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,830
You were wrong about me,about how I felt.

749
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,940
Maybe you're wrong about some other things.

750
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,000
I hope you're going to show me a kitchen filled with cookies.

751
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,900
I wish.

752
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,080
I think he took them with him.

753
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,460
Better take a look at that.I found it wedged behind the dresser.

754
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,710
It's like he kept a record of everyone he dosed.

755
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,450
You think it's some kind of enemies list?He's trying to get back at all these people?

756
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,390
Diana...

757
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,710
that's the food fair.It starts today.

758
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,680
Now we know where he took the cookies.

759
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,010
Tom...

760
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,190
stop!

761
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,980
Get up.

762
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,700
Where are the rest of the cookies?

763
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,110
There aren't any more,I swear.

764
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,430
He just opened the box.Looks like we made it just in time.

765
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,770
Nice work,you two.

766
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,150
Ntac medical will be busy for some time.

767
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,920
Yeah,we'll keep them under observation,get them counseling.

768
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,140
I take it you both have been too busy ignoring your medical leave to deal with your own situations.

769
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,590
We figured first things first.

770
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,060
Yeah,if my dad showed up,I'd be spending a lot of time at work,too.

771
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,680
But now,I want you both to go home and deal with this thing.

772
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,370
If you feel you can't,

773
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,870
we'll book you adjoining suites at ntac medical.

774
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,350
Okay?

775
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,990
I just want you to know I never meant to hurt anyone.

776
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,400
Well,tell that to erika lundgren and the others who died.

777
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,490
I'm really sorry about that.

778
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,730
Honestly.

779
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,340
But all I did was give them a chance to deal with their problems,

780
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,870
you know,face to face.

781
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,030
I just wanted to share the enlightenment.

782
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,660
I guess they couldn't handle it.

783
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,470
Well,I don't get the connection.Why send the cookies to us?

784
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,430
What are you talking about?

785
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
You guys exposed the promicin scandal.

786
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,330
You saved my grandmother's life.

787
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:21,000
It was a gift,my way of saying thank you.

788
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,810
"Thank you"?

789
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,140
I guess no good deed ever goes unpunished,huh?

790
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
All this stuff isabelle told you,

791
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,650
you sure she wasn't making it up,scaring you,trying to keep you close?

792
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,310
Because I'm telling you,shawn,

793
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,570
this sounds crazy.

794
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,930
I can heal people.You can move things with your mind.

795
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,530
We live in a crazy world.

796
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,230
When she was a baby,

797
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,140
even younger,when she was in her mother's womb,

798
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,570
I knew she was different,dangerous.

799
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,380
Richard,if I believed that staying with isabelle would save all those lives,

800
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,860
I would marry her tomorrow.

801
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,930
But what happens a month from now,or a year?

802
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,770
What happens if she gets tired of me or I make her angry?

803
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,870
I get it. Marrying her is not the answer.

804
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
We've got to find another way to stop her.

805
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,900
She's my daughter,shawn.

806
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,800
What would you have me do?

807
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,630
Hey,I was out with some of the guys.

808
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,920
I came right over as soon as I got your voicemail.

809
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,930
You okay?

810
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,850
I picked up some italian on the way here.

811
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,510
Don't be nice to me.

812
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,550
Uh,I don't like the sound of that.

813
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,830
I know this isn't pleasant,but you're doing the right thing.

814
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,200
Does this mean we can say goodbye?

815
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,640
As a matter of fact,it does.

816
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,240
Try not to miss me,di.

817
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,200
I won'T.

818
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,160
Goodbye? You mean you're leaving?

819
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,660
All I've been doing is making you miserable.

820
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,200
I figure I did enough of that when you were a kid growing up.

821
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,650
Yeah,we're done here.

822
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,410
We've made about as much progress as we can make,huh?

823
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,490
You take care.

824
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,660
I'd shake your hand,but it doesn't work that way.

825
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,540
Dad?

826
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,410
You know what I said before about my missing that flight home as a favor to you?

827
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,070
That wasn't true.

828
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,540
I never thought it was.

829
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,080
I did it for me.

830
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,090
It was just the idea of standing around that hospital room,watching you die...

831
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,490
with all of that anger still between us,

832
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,180
knowing that we'd never work it out,

833
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,960
that we'D...

834
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,720
we'd never be as close as I wanted us to be.I couldn't do it.

835
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,300
It's okay,tommy. I...

836
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,040
I didn't deserve to have you there.

837
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,010
I should've been there anyway.I'm sorry.

838
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,860
The clock just ran out on us,huh?

839
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,490
Well,I guess there's no clock now,is there?

840
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,130
I've got all the time in the world,

841
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,940
not that we have to use it.

842
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,280
Why don't you come and sit down?

843
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,480
Tommy,we don't have to do this.

844
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,030
I know.Why don't you,uh...

845
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,840
why don't you just come back in the kitchen and park it,okay?

846
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,270
I never liked eating alone.

847
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,080
Nothing worse.

848
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,440
So...what do you want to talk about?

849
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,020
Happy now?

850
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,760
You tried.

851
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,360
It didn't work.

852
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,810
You can't kill me,shawn.

853
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,640
I guess we're going to get married after all.
