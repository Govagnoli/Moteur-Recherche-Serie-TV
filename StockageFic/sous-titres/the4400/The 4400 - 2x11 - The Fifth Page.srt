1
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,267
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

2
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,468
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,934
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...

4
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,667
this is where
i give you the speech

5
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,600
about how you're
my best field scientist

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,034
and tom is my best
lead investigator,

7
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,267
and how together,

8
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,900
you're going to make
a good team.

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,434
Let me see
if i've got this straight...

10
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,267
you two met,
fell in love,

11
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,667
and spent eight years together

12
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,167
in some kind
of alternate reality.

13
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,301
Yeah.

14
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,334
What time is the flight?

15
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,301
Uh, noon.

16
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,734
Say goodbye to mom for me.

17
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,834
They arrested a suspect
40 minutes ago.

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,067
Claim he's our guy.

19
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,967
[Jarvis]: Roy keith marsden.

20
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,533
Forget about the flight.
Bring kyle home.

21
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,434
They just arrested a suspect
in the collier killing.

22
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,867
It's going to feel
a little weird,

23
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,067
but when we're done,

24
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,134
you'll be able
to see again.

25
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:20,301
When does it start?

26
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,267
When do i see again?

27
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:22,967
Just give me one moment, okay?

28
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,767
Kevin's a genius, you know.

29
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,334
You're saying that burkhoff

30
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,734
is the father
of the 4400 technology.

31
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,101
I can think again, too.

32
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,001
You've got
a real fever,

33
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,967
young lady.

34
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,034
I worked at the c.d.c.
For seven years,

35
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,101
and i never saw
anything like it.

36
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,201
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.

37
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,167
Marks? Bruises?

38
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,301
No. Like irritations.

39
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,800
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,700
What did i just tell you?

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,167
[Jarvis]: You're in charge
until i'm released.

42
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,567
Pool whatever manpower
is still up walking.

43
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,867
Start picking up the pieces.

44
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:57,468
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,368
[Tom]:
Okay, seriously,

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,500
my back is about
to call it a day.

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,368
Just come on...

48
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,934
you're not helping.

49
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,101
Where's this going?

50
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:10,234
Right there.

51
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,401
Please say
that was the last box.

52
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,500
That's it.

53
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,267
We're officially
living in sin.

54
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,633
Oh, really.

55
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:19,967
Well, i prefer to call it

56
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,301
"resuming
our eight-year marriage."

57
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,334
Call it whatever you want.

58
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,334
Just don't kiss
in front of me again, okay?

59
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:26,867
That's disgusting.

60
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,401
Oh, your father thinks
this is so romantic,

61
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,800
but what
he doesn't know

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,101
is the reason
i'm moving in

63
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,101
is to take down
his tacky golf stuff.

64
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,301
[Tom]: What?

65
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,500
And replace it
with what?

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,967
Oh, oh,
paint splatters?

67
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,934
Maybe a picture
of a triangle

68
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,034
kids!
It's art.

69
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,600
Work out
these decorating issues

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
amongst yourselves,

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,533
but i'm dead serious

72
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,667
about this kissing rule, okay?

73
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,001
It's non-negotiable.

74
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,234
Oh, kyle,

75
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:59,001
my allergies are
bothering me again.

76
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,567
Could you write me
another prescription

77
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,500
before you go?

78
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,134
Uh, alana...

79
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,167
kyle's only a doctor
in the world you created for me,

80
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,633
remember?

81
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,067
I had a brain freeze.

83
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,267
Right.

84
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,734
Trying to decipher
my handwriting?

85
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,500
I was just on the verge
of giving up, actually.

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,533
Good.

87
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,767
Bad penmanship
is the best way

88
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,434
for a doctor to keep
his mystique.

89
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:42,633
There's a page missing
in there.

90
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,334
It goes from page four
to page six.

91
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,800
Sorry.
I'm breaking in a new nurse.

92
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,834
So listen, i think
we finally know

93
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,734
what's wrong
with your daughter.

94
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,201
Maia's suffering
from a type of pneumonia

95
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,001
called pneumocystis jiroveci.

96
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,700
It's "p.j.p."
For short.

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,800
I've never heard of it.

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,001
It's rare,

99
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,567
but we can treat it...

100
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,734
well, thank god.

101
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,301
But this kind
of pneumonia

102
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,301
could be a symptom
for something more serious.

103
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,533
We've tested her
for every virus...

104
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,767
all negative.

105
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,134
So where is it coming from?

106
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,967
We don't know,
but we're running more tests.

107
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,368
We'll figure it out.

108
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,401
It's not that big
of a deal.

109
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,600
You know, i've just...

110
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,533
i've been working
real hard lately.

111
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,468
I think i got the flu
or something.

112
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,001
Everybody gets that,
right?

113
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,368
Sure. It's just...

114
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,368
shawn...

115
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,201
you can't heal.

116
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:40,167
For now.

117
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,700
I think you should
get it checked out.

118
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,368
If i can't kick it
in a day or two, i will,

119
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,934
but, uh...

120
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,201
until then,
can you reschedule

121
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,700
all my foundation
appointments?

122
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,500
Tell them that it's temporary.

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,468
Make sure they know that.

124
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,700
Lily...

125
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,334
don't tell anyone
i can't heal.

126
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,167
Sure.

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,067
Thank you.

128
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,767
Lily...

129
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,301
i mean it. Nobody.

130
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:33,101
Oh, god.

131
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,001
Ah...

132
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,234
[Speaking german]

133
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,867
[Tom]: How many
are sick?

134
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,267
300... that we know of.

135
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,867
Medical says
more calls keep coming in.

136
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,468
So, what is it?

137
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,368
Well, it's some kind
of immune system disorder,

138
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:26,134
and it's leaving the 4400
vulnerable

139
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:28,533
to all kinds of diseases.

140
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,101
His plane landed
at seatac

141
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:31,234
on schedule.

142
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:32,567
Chopper should be here
any minute.

143
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,267
What's that?

144
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:37,734
They told me
he likes green tea.

145
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:38,767
Is it contagious?

146
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,167
We don't know.

147
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,368
Were they infected
while they were gone?

148
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,633
Maybe they brought this
back with them.

149
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,834
Well, maybe.
We just don't know.

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,067
The situation is fluid,

151
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,500
but here's a summary
of what we know so far.

152
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,800
Uh, sir?

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,834
They told me
you'd want this.

154
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,767
The numbers just keep
getting bigger.

155
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,800
So we're recovering

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,500
from an attack
on this building...

157
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,600
the division commander's
still in the hospital...

158
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,767
what are we
supposed to do?

159
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,234
We take to the field.

160
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,334
Ryland?
Where did he
come from?

161
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,368
We're going to have
every 4400 in this jurisdiction

162
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,500
tested
for this sickness

163
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,034
by day's end.

164
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,301
Dennis, is it good to see you.

165
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,533
Tom.

166
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,867
Diana.

167
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,401
What brings you
to seattle, ryland?

168
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,767
I'm assuming temporary command
of this division.

169
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,134
My orders are to do something

170
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,267
about the spread
of this epidemic.

171
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:37,967
I'm going to figure out a way
to do just that.

172
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:53,500
* so long ago, another life *

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,434
* i can feel your heart beat *

174
00:07:57,434 --> 00:08:02,900
* it's not a dream
remember us *

175
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,234
* i can see it in your eyes *

176
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:10,434
* we'll find our place in time *

177
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:16,067
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

178
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,700
* we'll find our place in time *

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,101
* our place in time
to call our own *

180
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,334
You might want
to move that,

181
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:42,900
unless you want people
calling you "nina."

182
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,134
How's jarvis doing?

183
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,667
They set her collarbone.

184
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,001
Doctors said
she'll be back in two weeks.

185
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,167
My guess?

186
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,368
She makes it in one.

187
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,800
Yeah.

188
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,167
So how's d.c.?

189
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,533
Oh, it's a lot of networking.

190
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,001
Lots of dinner parties.

191
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,267
Patty loves it.

192
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,468
And you?

193
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:03,201
The pacific northwest
is the flashpoint.

194
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,834
I kind of feel

195
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,700
like i was promoted
out of the game.

196
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,034
A lot of guys here
would trade places with you.

197
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,500
I wouldn't blame them.

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,334
A woman releases plague
into the air?

199
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:16,334
A terrorist attack
on the building?

200
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,767
Some people i work for

201
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,101
think you're
in the middle of a war.

202
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,734
I'm sure
it looks that way on paper.

203
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,201
Don't get defensive.

204
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,934
I'm still preaching the gospel
of highland beach.

205
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,700
I still believe

206
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,900
the 4400 came back here
to change things for the better.

207
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,001
Yeah, and the people
you work for?

208
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,134
Don't worry
about them.

209
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,667
One day, this'll be over,

210
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,267
we'll go out for a beer,

211
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,600
we'll kick back,
we'll trade war stories.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,201
Yeah.

213
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,567
[Ruth]: She was a little cranky
this morning.

214
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,700
I think
she's cutting another tooth.

215
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,001
They're
coming in fast, huh?

216
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,533
She's that age.

217
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,401
Bye, bye, sweetie.

218
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,934
We'll see you tomorrow.

219
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,567
Thank you, ruth.

220
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,067
Lily, what are you doing?

221
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,134
I thought we agreed

222
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,934
nobody was doing
science experiments on our baby.

223
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,567
Just making sure.

224
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,468
Shawn, we need to rearrange
your healing schedule.

225
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:08,967
There's something going on,

226
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,633
some sort of illness
spreading among the 4400.

227
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,234
I know all about it.

228
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,767
You.

229
00:10:58,767 --> 00:10:59,934
Did you do this?

230
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,334
No, no. It wasn't me.

231
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,500
Then what are you doing here?

232
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,234
I read about this place
in the paper.

233
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,700
I just... i was curious.

234
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,767
Yeah?

235
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, go be curious
somewhere else,

236
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,067
because people
still live here, okay?

237
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,500
Do you need some help?

238
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,234
What, are you
a mechanic now?

239
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,867
I can change a tire.

240
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,167
There's probably a jack
in the trunk, right?

241
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,700
Yeah.

242
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,700
I'm sorry i snapped at you.

243
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,134
I just... i'm in a hurry, and...

244
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,800
my boyfriend's little brother

245
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,368
is in the principal's office
again,

246
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,434
and he's... not here...

247
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,633
again.

248
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:51,401
I guess he's in
a lot of trouble, huh?

249
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,267
Yeah.

250
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,667
Yeah, you could say that.

251
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,401
Well, i mean,
it's none of my business.

252
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:05,134
I can just change the tire
and go.

253
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,500
Please.

254
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,533
Hi there.

255
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,633
Welcome to the center.

256
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,633
Are you here to take the tour?

257
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,834
This is wrong.

258
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,401
It's all wrong.

259
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:24,667
Excuse me?

260
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,468
This is
the collier museum.

261
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,934
Where are
all the paintings?

262
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,067
Thomas.

263
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,633
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

264
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,533
I have a board of directors
meeting,

265
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,167
and they won't let me
go upstairs.

266
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:45,667
Yeah, yeah.
They called me.

267
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:46,767
They said you were
a little mixed up.

268
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,234
Alana...

269
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,734
this isn't
the collier museum.

270
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:55,067
It's...
it's the 4400 center.

271
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,967
What are you
talking about?

272
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,401
I come here
all the time.

273
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,468
Look at me. Look...

274
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,001
alana...

275
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,267
the place
you're thinking of,

276
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,600
it's somewhere else.

277
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,734
No. No!

278
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,800
Why are you
confusing me?

279
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,067
Just calm down!
No!

280
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,667
It's okay.
It's all right.

281
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,201
[Ryland]:
The infection rate is 18%.

282
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,633
One in five of them

283
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,767
are already sick?

284
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,101
One in five today.
Tomorrow...

285
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,368
the national
institute of health

286
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:34,201
is worried that this illness,
whatever it is,

287
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,234
can mutate

288
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:36,301
and cross over

289
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,633
into the general
population.

290
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,700
Would it even
have to mutate?

291
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,934
There's
no guarantee

292
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,700
that this is going to
stay exclusive to 4400s

293
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,067
and meanwhile,

294
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,001
we've got two dozen sick ones
right downstairs.

295
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,001
They're not going to
be there long.

296
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,001
Why?

297
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,468
What are we doing with them?

298
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:52,201
D.c. Wants to put all the 4400
back in quarantine

299
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:53,834
and keep them there

300
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,633
for the rest
of the crisis.

301
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,700
I know it's a big move, people,

302
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,533
but it's the best one we've got
at the moment.

303
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,700
Can we do that?

304
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,567
According to emergency
quarantine order 74,

305
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,667
we can.

306
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,800
But wait,
you're just talking

307
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,633
about the sick ones here,
right?

308
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,034
No. All of them.

309
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,633
Every 4400
in the country

310
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,700
is subject to this order.

311
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,001
Okay,

312
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:14,934
but that's only half of them.

313
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,234
This thing's worldwide, right?

314
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,667
England and france
are passing similar legislation.

315
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,567
We expect
other countries to follow.

316
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,834
But why are you forcing them all
to come in?

317
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,600
Because the disease seems to be
showing up at random.

318
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,334
Until we understand
how it's transmitted,

319
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,533
we have to assume

320
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,101
that every 4400
is a potential vector.

321
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,134
How much time
are we giving them?

322
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,167
We'll make
the announcement

323
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,101
in the morning.

324
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,034
They'll have 12 hours

325
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,800
to get to a local
ntac branch,

326
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
then they'll be
transferred

327
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,767
to camp dekker

328
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,267
and the quarantine facility.

329
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,067
What if they don't report?

330
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,368
Then it'll be our job
to bring them in.

331
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:52,401
You're not hearing me...

332
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,800
it's temporary.

333
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,934
Can you be sure?

334
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,201
You already told me
people in washington

335
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,633
think we're
fighting a war.

336
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,201
Washington is
full of opinions.

337
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,434
The town runs on them.

338
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,734
The 4400

339
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,067
aren't just names
in some report...

340
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,934
and they're definitely
not enemy combatants.

341
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,434
You're talking
about my daughter,

342
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,500
tom's nephew...

343
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,600
the woman i love.

344
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,234
I was going to tell you
over that beer.

345
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,167
[Diana]: Now,
what assurances

346
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,134
can you give us

347
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,500
that these people

348
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,167
aren't just being
thrown down some hole

349
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,301
permanently?

350
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,301
You have my assurance,

351
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,001
and that should be
enough.

352
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,301
I was the one who pushed
to let them out

353
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,900
in the first place,
you remember?

354
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,734
We're not trying
to second-guess you, dennis,

355
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:30,001
but people we love are sick.

356
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,201
I get it,

357
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,067
but getting them all
together in one place

358
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,900
is going to make it
a lot easier

359
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,767
to find out
what the hell this is.

360
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,533
When it's over,
everybody goes home.

361
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,434
We know you'll
fight the good fight, dennis.

362
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:44,800
I just hope you can win.

363
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:02,101
Mommy?

364
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,600
You're awake.

365
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
How are you, baby?

366
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm tired of being sick.

367
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,134
When can i go home?

368
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,434
Why don't you tell me?

369
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:19,101
I was kind of hoping
you'd had a vision,

370
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,800
about how all this
will be over soon.

371
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,301
They're not coming
anymore.

372
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:30,468
I'm not seeing things.

373
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,234
My favorite patient
is awake.

374
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,434
More awake than you look.

375
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,034
Mm.

376
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,301
Open wide.

377
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,867
I do my best work

378
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,334
when i eliminate sleep
altogether.

379
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,700
Well, if you need someone

380
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,967
to splash cold water
on your face,

381
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,334
you just let me know.

382
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:48,001
Thanks.

383
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,567
Do you mind?

384
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,633
I noticed that missing page
made its way back in.

385
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,600
Oh. Yeah.

386
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,001
I told you it'd be back.

387
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,533
What are those two lines
blacked out for?

388
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,967
Well, looks like
we duplicated a test.

389
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,201
They cross it out

390
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,034
so we don't read
the same results twice.

391
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Okay, let's see
how that rash is doing.

392
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,734
[Lily]: I'm fine, brian.

393
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,334
Tell heidi not to worry.

394
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,567
Richard's fine.

395
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,134
Isabelle's fine.

396
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:20,301
Well, the news
is making it sound

397
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,867
like everybody's sick.

398
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,500
People are terrified,

399
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,468
and if normal people
start getting sick...

400
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:26,834
"normal people"?

401
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,533
Okay, that
came out wrong,

402
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,567
but you know
what i mean.

403
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,567
And listen, lily,

404
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,667
heidi's not the only one
that's worried about you.

405
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,368
I am, too.

406
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,734
A year and a half ago,

407
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,267
you welcomed me home
with a restraining order.

408
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:45,900
I know.

409
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,767
I panicked when you got back.

410
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,834
Don't think i haven't lost sleep
over what i did.

411
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,301
I just want you
to know now

412
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,900
that i'm there for you.

413
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,201
You, richard, isabelle.

414
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,001
You need anything...

415
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,101
just call.

416
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,034
"Quarantine."

417
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,800
That's an evocative word
these days.

418
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,700
Conjures up images
of secret prisons and...

419
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,234
what's the euphemism
you're using now?

420
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,533
"Coercion tactics"?

421
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:14,767
[Tom]: Let me
ask you something...

422
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,301
you have some doctors
on staff here, right?

423
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:17,401
Yes.

424
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,434
They having any luck

425
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:19,468
getting to the bottom
of this thing?

426
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:20,567
Not yet.

427
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,767
Then get off
your soapbox.

428
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,934
You want an image
to hold on to?

429
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,167
Try this one...
4400s dying in droves.

430
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,600
I think what my partner
means to say

431
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,967
is that our
two organizations

432
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,167
need each other.

433
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,234
We should cooperate.

434
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,633
And how exactly
do we do that?

435
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,234
We want you to issue
a public statement.

436
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,167
If the center
counsels the 4400s

437
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,434
to go along
with this order,

438
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:39,101
things will go
much more smoothly.

439
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,267
And if we don't?

440
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,434
Why are we talking
to you, anyway?

441
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:42,533
Where's shawn?

442
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,434
Is he all right?

443
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,834
Mr. Farrell
is handling urgent business.

444
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,167
This situation requires
his full attention.

445
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,334
Look, i'll have to
run it by him,

446
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,567
but i don't see a problem
advising any ill 4400s

447
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,167
to seek medical care
from ntac.

448
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,234
Well, that's a start.

449
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,401
What about the ones

450
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,134
who aren't
showing symptoms?

451
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,134
That issue's going to require
a little more thought.

452
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:04,934
Great.
You have 12 hours.

453
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,201
[Teenage boy]:
What's the point

454
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:15,167
of painting it over,
anyway?

455
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,567
They're just gonna
do it again.

456
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,001
We don't know that.

457
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,800
Look, sam,

458
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,533
kyle has been nice enough
to come over here

459
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,834
and help us out,

460
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,167
so the least that you can do
is pitch in.

461
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,834
Oh, yes, very good...

462
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,034
picasso.

463
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm going to make sandwiches.

464
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,867
Okay, seriously,
what's your story?

465
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:40,900
Why are you helping us,

466
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,201
kyle whoever-you-are?

467
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,434
My last name's bingham...

468
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,468
and i don't know.

469
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:49,567
I was just walking by here
yesterday.

470
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,567
Alison looked
like she could use a hand...

471
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,867
yeah, well,

472
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,301
if you were thinking
about hooking up with her,

473
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,834
forget it.

474
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,034
Alison's gonna
marry my brother

475
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,934
as soon as he gets out of jail.

476
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,134
I know. I know.
She told me.

477
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:01,134
You should listen to her.

478
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,067
Roy didn't kill
this collier guy.

479
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,633
I believe you.

480
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,067
Yeah?

481
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,567
Well, you're the only one.

482
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,900
You and me.

483
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,667
When he does get out,

484
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,500
i don't think
you want him coming home

485
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,167
and seeing "murderer"
written all over his door,

486
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,401
do you?

487
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,167
Richard...

488
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,867
you ready for a promotion?

489
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,867
Me?

490
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,234
A promotion to what?

491
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:39,967
I'm trying here, man.

492
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,401
I want to lead us all
through this,

493
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,767
but i can't do that right now.

494
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:46,667
Thank you.

495
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,734
I know i'm a 4400,
but after that,

496
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,600
my qualifications
are a little thin.

497
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,567
They didn't even give me
an ability.

498
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,500
To be honest with you,
i'm not sure how long

499
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,101
lily and i were planning
on staying here.

500
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,034
So it's not a perfect fit,

501
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,600
but you're articulate,

502
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,468
and a war hero,

503
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,533
and you have
the gravitas

504
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,667
of a leader.

505
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,034
I think
it's a good idea.

506
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:15,234
I haven't given an order
since 1951.

507
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,234
I was in high school
a year and a half ago.

508
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,633
I managed.

509
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:21,734
So will you.

510
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,468
But it's only temporary, right?

511
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,800
As soon as you get better,

512
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,134
i can go right back
to being camera-shy.

513
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,934
Yeah.

514
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,633
Temporary.

515
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,633
What are you going to do?

516
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:44,267
What i have to.

517
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,934
Has everyone frightened,

518
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,800
and that's understandable.

519
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,401
But no one's more frightened
than we are.

520
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,134
And that's because,

521
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:53,301
in spite of all the rumors
that you hear flying around,

522
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:56,267
only 4400s
are getting sick,

523
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,601
and now the government

524
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:00,100
wants us to head
into quarantine.

525
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,334
They say cooperation
is essential.

526
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:05,967
Well, here's
the best we can do...

527
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,833
<i>if you're sick,</i>

528
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,568
<i>the responsible thing</i>
<i>is to report to ntac.</i>

529
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,833
<i>Our best wishes</i>
<i>and prayers</i>

530
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,401
<i>go with you.</i>

531
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,467
But if you're well,

532
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,234
if you're showing no symptoms,

533
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:23,867
we ask you to consider this...

534
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:27,534
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,

535
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:30,134
but walking out...

536
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,000
that might be
considerably more difficult.

537
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:39,467
<i>Thank you.</i>

538
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:41,000
Don't they get it?

539
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
We're trying
to help these people.

540
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,067
All they hear is
"quarantine," dennis.

541
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,534
You can't blame them
for being scared.

542
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:48,934
Maybe if we give them
another day,

543
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,800
half a day, even.

544
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,034
Does it look to you

545
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,167
like they haven't
made up their minds?

546
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:57,034
We tried
being reasonable.

547
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,434
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.

548
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,201
Hi.

549
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,267
Hey.

550
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,733
I know who you are.

551
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,301
You're the one
who fixes people.

552
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:16,601
Yeah. Shawn.

553
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,134
How come you're in here?

554
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:21,267
Why don't you just
make yourself better?

555
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,367
I wish i could.

556
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,267
They're broken.

557
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:28,267
Kind of like
the rest of me.

558
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,100
I used to see things.

559
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,367
Stuff that was
gonna happen.

560
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,634
That's gone now too.

561
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,867
It's funny, huh?

562
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,934
When i found out
i was different,

563
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:43,934
all i wanted to do
was be normal again.

564
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,334
Me too.

565
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,700
But you
get used to it.

566
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,668
Now that it's gone,
i feel like i'm missing an arm.

567
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:53,401
It'll come back.

568
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:55,434
Once we get better.

569
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:57,601
Any idea when that's gonna be?

570
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:59,634
Not exactly,

571
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,134
but my mom told me
everything's gonna be fine,

572
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,100
and i believe what she says.

573
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,467
That must be a nice feeling.

574
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,568
Don't you have someone
to believe in?

575
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,467
I used to...

576
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,867
but now i guess

577
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:22,234
i'm just going to have to
believe in you.

578
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,568
You're the one
i attacked

579
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,034
at the hospital.

580
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:41,167
We didn't think
you'd remember us.

581
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,134
I remember.

582
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,000
I was...

583
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,267
very sick back then.

584
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:49,534
I'm better now.

585
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,501
Diana, you wanted
to see me?

586
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,000
Kevin burkhoff.

587
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,167
I've been doing
neurological research

588
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,134
on the 4400.

589
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:58,767
Oh, i've heard of you.

590
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,067
Everybody here has.

591
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:01,367
Here.

592
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,934
There's some very
interesting data

593
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:04,934
on the blood work
i've been doing.

594
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:06,000
Have a look.

595
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,201
See if it helps you figure out

596
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:08,301
what's going on
with this disease.

597
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,700
Well, thank you.

598
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,367
I'll comb
through this.

599
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,767
Good,

600
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:15,733
and i can expect
to see your work... when?

601
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,201
I showed you mine.

602
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:22,167
You show me yours.

603
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,334
That is the way
it works,

604
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,000
isn't it?

605
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,167
Usually,

606
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,367
but the research we do here
is classified.

607
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:30,467
[Diana]: Max...

608
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,501
max, if ever
there was a time

609
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,668
to bend the rules
a little,

610
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:34,800
i think
it might be now.

611
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,134
Well, it's not
a wink-and-a-nudge situation.

612
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,934
I give over
classified documents,

613
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,201
i go to jail.

614
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,134
Yeah, and if you don't,
people might die.

615
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,900
Are you implying we're not doing
everything we can?

616
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,000
We've got dozens
of doctors

617
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,501
working
around the clock

618
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:47,000
to try to solve this thing.

619
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,634
Now, i will look over
everything that you've given me.

620
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:53,967
If i find anything
that can help you,

621
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,334
i'll give you a call.

622
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,668
That's the best i can do.

623
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:01,833
I am so sorry...

624
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:02,900
i'm not interested
in apologies.

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,367
I want to see
that information.

626
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,867
Or is ntac not interested
in curing these people?

627
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:13,934
I know you guys
are kind of cavalier

628
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,234
about putting your own careers
on the line,

629
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,867
but do me a favor...

630
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,867
stop asking me
to join in the fun, okay?

631
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,067
I like what i do here.

632
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,467
They're medical records, marco.

633
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,733
Not national secrets.

634
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:24,967
Wrong.

635
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:26,534
They're medical records
and national secrets.

636
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,067
That is why they keep them
in a database

637
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,668
you need six passwords
to get into,

638
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:32,034
and that's why sport-o
wouldn't give them to you.

639
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:34,467
Let's just leave max
out of this.

640
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,833
He's under a lot of pressure.

641
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,201
And he wants
to keep his job.

642
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,467
I don't blame him.

643
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,167
You know, i just
opened a 401(k).

644
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,334
Yeah, pretty sure

645
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,733
the government stops
matching donations

646
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:44,100
once you commit treason.

647
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,234
The government

648
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:46,434
just turned down
an offer of help

649
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:47,601
from kevin burkhoff.

650
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:48,867
Remember him?

651
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,967
Yeah, the future
built a giant tower

652
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,100
to wake him up.

653
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,634
I guess they think he matters.

654
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:54,000
If anyone in washington
read my report,

655
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
they know
he matters, too.

656
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,767
You know, it's weird.

657
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,100
Hundreds of people are sick.

658
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,134
You'd think they'd want
any help they could get.

659
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,634
Well, they're going to
get his help.

660
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:05,034
Yeah, whether they want it
or not.

661
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,134
Gotcha.

662
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:12,501
Yeah.

663
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,467
Is isabelle ready
to go for her walk?

664
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,867
Okay, let's go have some fun.

665
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:34,301
How long has she
been in there?

666
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:35,501
I don't know.
Five minutes.

667
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,967
I came and got you
as soon as i saw.

668
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,867
What are they
doing to her in there?

669
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,634
Step back.

670
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,967
[Matthew]: Would you
excuse us, please?

671
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,833
How long has this been going on?

672
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,167
Richard, your daughter

673
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,634
has never been
in any kind of danger.

674
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:00,833
He asked you a question.

675
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,301
Jordan was going to
initiate these tests

676
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,034
as soon as he convinced you
to come back into the fold...

677
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,267
what tests?
What have you been doing to her?

678
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,767
All we're doing
is what you should have done

679
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,167
a long time ago...

680
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,833
trying to figure out who,
or what, isabelle is.

681
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:11,900
She's our daughter.

682
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,167
That's all you
or anyone else

683
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,867
your daughter
is the rosetta stone

684
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:17,234
for understanding
what happened to the 4400,

685
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:19,167
yet you both cling
to the illusion

686
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,767
that she's going to go
to preschool,

687
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,267
first communion, the prom...

688
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:23,534
she's not communal property.

689
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,501
We're her parents. We decide.

690
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:26,401
Parents?

691
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,800
You are the stewards
of the future,

692
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,967
and forgive me for saying so,

693
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,700
but you're doing
a piss-poor job of it.

694
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,833
We have given up
everything we have

695
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,501
for that child,

696
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,634
any chance we had
of living a normal life,

697
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,367
to protect her
from people like you.

698
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:40,334
Look, richard, this is no time
for this conversation.

699
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:41,668
In two hours,

700
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:42,967
the government is
coming through the front door.

701
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,467
Yeah, well,
you won't use my daughter

702
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,034
as some kind of weapon
against them.

703
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,733
That was never my intention.

704
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,067
You'll never have the chance.
We're leaving right now.

705
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,034
That's your choice,
but if you do,

706
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,334
if we splinter now,

707
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,334
they will round up the 4400
one by one,

708
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,268
Hey.

709
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,467
Hey, thomas.

710
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,534
Hey.

711
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,300
They said
you've been asking for me.

712
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,600
Shouldn't you be in bed?

713
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
They'll take me back
soon enough.

714
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,067
I wanted to see you.

715
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:29,534
How do you feel, baby?

716
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,433
They can't get the fever down,
but...

717
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:37,600
the worst part is my head.

718
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
Everything's so mixed up.

719
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,268
This illness,

720
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:44,734
it affects people's abilities.

721
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,934
Maia can't see things, and...

722
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:49,001
and shawn, shawn can't heal,

723
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,234
and for you, honey,

724
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,201
i think the boundaries

725
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,234
between this world
and the one you created

726
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:56,467
are breaking down.

727
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:59,034
It's so confusing.

728
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:02,467
I don't know
what's real anymore.

729
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,333
I know it's scary.

730
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,433
You just have to hang on.

731
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,867
They'll get this fixed.

732
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,934
What if they're too late?

733
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,333
What if they can
make my body right,

734
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,700
but not my mind?

735
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,300
I don't want to live like that,
thomas.

736
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
You're not
going to have to.

737
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,734
You're going to get better.

738
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,700
You have to believe that, alana.

739
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,867
Thomas...

740
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:29,001
yeah?

741
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,333
I love you so much.

742
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,234
I wanted us to get married
for real,

743
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,901
in this world.

744
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:48,300
That's all i wanted to tell you,
before...

745
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,600
before my mind goes...

746
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,734
because...

747
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,934
i don't know
if it will be good again.

748
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,201
So you're sure i can't get you
a beer or something?

749
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,234
No, no,
that's okay.

750
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,700
I don't drink.

751
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,333
Okay.

752
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,667
You know, this isn't
really necessary.

753
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,634
I just did
a couple of chores.

754
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,667
Maybe it's not a big deal
to you,

755
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,400
but i just haven't seen
a friendly face

756
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,734
in a while,

757
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:24,700
not since... roy went away.

758
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:30,834
no offense, but, um...

759
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,834
the papers make him sound

760
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,967
like the second coming
of lee harvey oswald.

761
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,734
Yeah.

762
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,700
Well, i wouldn't exactly call it
"fair and balanced coverage."

763
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,801
But he did have
some monstrous gun collection,

764
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:42,801
right?

765
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,767
Look, i'm not saying

766
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,367
that he was a candidate
for higher office,

767
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,234
and...

768
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,467
he sure as hell

769
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:51,667
wasn't the world's
greatest boyfriend.

770
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,201
But taking out
two ntac agents

771
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,300
and shooting jordan collier?

772
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,534
Come on.

773
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,101
Yeah.

774
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,734
Yeah.

775
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:01,234
Eat up.

776
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:03,667
Sam!

777
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,667
Sam, come on!
We're starting.

778
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,201
I'll be right there.

779
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:27,467
Hey.

780
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,901
Okay.

781
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,201
Are you marco?

782
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,500
Thanks.

783
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,101
Don't thank me.
Hire me.

784
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:42,801
I'm gonna need a job.

785
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,567
Where have you been?

786
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,101
Talking to matthew.

787
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,333
Lily...

788
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,534
he's got an idea

789
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:51,534
on how to handle
this roundup.

790
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:52,767
I think it might work.

791
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,734
I'm sure
he's full of clever ideas.

792
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,333
We will deal with
what matthew did,

793
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,967
but not now.

794
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,268
The government is about
to declare martial law

795
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,433
we don't have time to squabble.

796
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:02,867
All i want to hear

797
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:04,667
is that you're done
with this place for good.

798
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,934
It's not that simple.

799
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,433
We can't just go off
and hide in the woods somewhere.

800
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,767
It's not going to work
this time.

801
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,667
The center betrayed us.
They betrayed our daughter.

802
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:12,867
And they learned
about her,

803
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,067
more than we did
in almost a year.

804
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,101
Lily, stop.

805
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,433
Did you know

806
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,934
isabelle has connections

807
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,168
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain

808
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,067
that have never been
seen before?

809
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:26,834
Even if that's true, richard...

810
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,134
it's not that they studied her.

811
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,834
It's how they did it.

812
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:32,201
Do you trust
the government?

813
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,901
Because
if we go into quarantine,

814
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:35,467
isabelle will end up
right here,

815
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,901
or with them,

816
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:39,534
and if they find out
what she can do...

817
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:42,234
we'll lose her forever.

818
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,400
[Ryland]: That's it.

819
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,667
That's the deadline.

820
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,101
Where do we start?

821
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,867
I want everybody
to holster their pistols.

822
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:45,034
My goal is to do this quietly,
peacefully,

823
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:46,801
and without incident.

824
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,634
What if they want
an incident?

825
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:52,867
Then we'll give them one.

826
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,867
Is everybody ready?

827
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:56,300
<i>Affirmative, sir.</i>

828
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,801
<i>We're in position.</i>

829
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,367
Let's go.

830
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,967
Moving in now.

831
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,168
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They're on the move.</i>

832
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,034
They're
spreading out

833
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:14,500
and letting us
through.

834
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:34,333
Welcome to the center.

835
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,734
Did you come for the tour?

836
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:38,400
You know damn well
why we're here.

837
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,300
Out hunting, i'd guess.

838
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,834
Well, i'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

839
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,001
You are welcome to look around,

840
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:48,001
????????

841
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,400
?????
I have no idea

842
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,667
where they went.

843
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,767
You had 1204400s
taking shelter at your center.

844
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,467
That sounds about right.

845
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:04,801
I don't have an exact figure.

846
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,101
You just came
downstairs,

847
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,134
and they were gone?

848
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,134
Until 7:00 this evening,

849
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,201
they were free citizens.

850
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,300
I had no reason

851
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,333
to track
their movements,

852
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,667
and since i've broken no laws,

853
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,901
unless you want to talk about
lifting this quarantine order,

854
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,234
we have nothing left to discuss.

855
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,134
We'll talk again.

856
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,134
I suspect your job
is going to get rather ugly

857
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,201
from here on out,

858
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:29,101
kicking in doors
and such.

859
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,600
If i worked at ntac,

860
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,433
i might spend a little less time
trying to find missing 4400s,

861
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:36,268
and a little more
trying to cure the ones i had.

862
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,901
So tell me,
have we got a list

863
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,001
yeah.

864
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,333
All the sick ones we know of
are in.

865
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,433
As for the rest,
we had about 75% compliance.

866
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,767
Nationwide,

867
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,734
there's about 5204400s
unaccounted for.

868
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,134
Well, that's not a few holdouts.

869
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:53,300
That's an insurgency.

870
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:56,500
So this is it, huh?

871
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,567
Us against them.

872
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,901
You know, it feels
kind of like the war

873
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,400
jordan collier always predicted.

874
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,500
Predicted or provoked?

875
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,867
We declared martial law on them.

876
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,834
We had no option.

877
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:08,934
I'm going to pursue

878
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,367
a policy of non-aggression

879
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,867
as long as i can,

880
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,867
but if it comes down
to a choice

881
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,767
between the safety
of the american people

882
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,433
and the welfare
of the 4400,

883
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,300
tom...

884
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,134
that's no choice at all.

885
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,734
[Richard]: Collier left behind
37 safe houses

886
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,168
throughout the country.

887
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:31,634
We liquidated the center's
emergency slush fund

888
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:34,067
should last for awhile.

889
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,234
Any 4400

890
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,567
who contacts the center
for help

891
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,101
will be given
an email address.

892
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:39,700
If we're satisfied
they're legitimate,

893
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,168
they'll be told
where to go.

894
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:43,467
Our goal is to get
every 4400 who wants shelter

895
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:45,134
to safety.

896
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,700
And then what?

897
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,567
Matthew will try

898
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,034
to continue
to end this peacefully,

899
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,734
but if we have to
protect our own...

900
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,934
we'll be ready.

901
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,201
Excuse me.

902
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,867
Excuse me.
Sorry.

903
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,201
Lily...

904
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,234
you make a good speech,

905
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:10,834
but this isn't korea,

906
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,134
and those
aren't soldiers,

907
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,433
and your daughter

908
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:15,901
could get caught
in the crossfire.

909
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:17,300
You don't think
i'm worried about her?

910
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,433
And you too?

911
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,700
Lily, i'm not looking
for a fight,

912
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,767
but right now,
we don't have another option.

913
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,168
Hey. Sam said he liked comics...

914
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,234
you son of a bitch!

915
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,001
You lied to me.

916
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,333
What?

917
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,600
Wait a minute.
It wasn't like that.

918
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,734
Oh, really,
"kyle bingham"?

919
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,734
Your last name
is baldwin,

920
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,634
and your dad works
for ntac.

921
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,001
So, what are you?
His little spy? Huh?

922
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,567
Did you think you were going to
sleep with me?

923
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,367
I was going to tell you
all about roy?

924
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,300
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.

925
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,734
I know that.

926
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,667
I was just trying to help you.

927
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,667
Why?

928
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,433
You come off like you're
this really great guy,

929
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:06,967
and all you were trying to do
was use me.

930
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:08,134
You're a lying prick.

931
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,634
Okay.

932
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:22,667
Okay.

933
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,134
This thing that's
killing them,

934
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,801
it's not a disease.

935
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,467
It's a side-effect.

936
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,700
Dr. Burkhoff,
just calm down.

937
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,867
What are you
talking about?

938
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,001
A side-effect of what?

939
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,201
I don't know exactly,

940
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,001
but i do know this...

941
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,567
there's a synthetic substance

942
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,600
present in the blood
of every 4400,

943
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,801
all the ones i tested,

944
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:42,634
every medical report
you gave me,

945
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:44,534
sick ones, well ones,

946
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,867
doesn't matter.
They all have it.

947
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,134
They even gave it a name.

948
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:50,801
They call it
"promicin inhibitor."

949
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,201
Promicin?
What's promicin?

950
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,634
I have no idea,

951
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,734
and i don't know why anyone

952
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:55,901
would want to inhibit it,
either.

953
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,268
But whatever it is,

954
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:59,534
it's gathering
in their lymph nodes,

955
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:00,734
compromising
their immune systems...

956
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,300
it's what's making them sick.

957
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,467
But ntac's been
studying the 4400

958
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,067
ever since
they got back.

959
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:06,400
They should have
known about this.
They do know.

960
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,168
It's all in here. They know.

961
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:09,667
So why haven't they
told anyone?

962
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,600
That's a very good question.

963
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,101
When you find out,

964
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:14,467
why don't you tell me?

965
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,967
[Car idling]

966
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,034
Are you sure
you want to do this?

967
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,600
Just get me and isabelle
someplace safe.

968
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,500
"P.i. Dosage"...

969
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,234
it's on memos,
in every 4400 medical report.

970
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,834
It's on the fifth page
of every report.

971
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:48,934
That's what hudson
had crossed out

972
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:50,333
when i went to see maia.

973
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,134
"P.i."

974
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:54,667
"Promicin inhibitor."

975
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:57,234
Alana was getting it too,
and shawn.

976
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:58,801
Everyone was getting it.

977
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:01,101
Every time
they came to ntac medical.

978
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,101
Every checkup.

979
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,034
We did it to them, tom.

980
00:42:05,034 --> 00:42:07,201
We made them sick.
