1
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,267
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,569
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,304
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,474
Okay, we're clear, right?
It's over between the two of us.

5
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,246
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice.

6
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,858
And I'm afraid if I lose you,
I'm going to make the Wrong one,

7
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,686
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,385
Hi, I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.

9
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,129
Learning anything new?

10
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,160
Yeah, she's incredible.

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,561
In a week, we've made discoveries

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,499
we thought it would take years
to get to.

13
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,263
Isabelle, I don't love you.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,307
Shawn, you and I are the two
most powerful people on the planet.

15
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,598
We have to get married.

16
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,107
I kneW she Was different,
Dangerous,

17
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,909
You can't kill me, Shawn.

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,179
Richard, if I believe
that staying with lsabelle

19
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,413
would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow.

20
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,486
But what happens
if she gets tired of me

21
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,717
or I make her angry?

22
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,418
There are things I was
sent here to do. Brutal things.

23
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,087
I don't knoW hoW you knoW that,
but it doesn't have to happen,

24
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,823
We need to be together,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,332
because I think you're the only one
who can stop me.

26
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,819
Looking for a date?

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,791
Not you.

28
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,132
Him.

29
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,832
Tim, you got a customer.

30
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,160
So it's 40 bucks
if you want to get started.

31
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,355
I just wanna look at you
for a second.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,105
Do you have any idea
how special you are?

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,740
You don't, do you?

34
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,207
Look, we can talk if you want to,
but it's still 40 bucks.

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,110
Timothy Winters McCarren.

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,716
You're going to change the world.

37
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,317
How'd you know my name?

38
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,580
It's true.

39
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,518
You're gonna change everything.

40
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,556
Unless I stop you.

41
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,053
That's it, I'm out of here.

42
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,295
Come on, man, let me out.
I'm serious.

43
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,733
I rolled that myself.

44
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,903
It's my way of saying thank you
for inviting me to your wedding.

45
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,404
Thank you.

46
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,619
But you didn't have to.
Isabelle and I invited every 4400.

47
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,546
I wouldn't have missed it.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,884
I'm quite excited.

49
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,222
You must be too.
The ceremony's so close.

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,352
Four days.

51
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,499
I have to offer you a word of caution.

52
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:59,571
This cigar, when you smoke it,
you might be surprised by its effects.

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,833
Oh, I'm not gonna get arrested
for having this, am l?

54
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,237
Of course not.

55
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,637
About a year after we returned,
I learned I have an ability.

56
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,745
When I come in contact
with a person,

57
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,909
they sometimes see a vision
of their future.

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,851
I see nothing, understand.
Only those I touch.

59
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,850
But I'm told it can be quite accurate.

60
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,618
Kind of a nice talent.

61
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,783
Thank you.

62
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,962
I grew this tobacco myself.
It's been in contact with my hands.

63
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,965
And so it contains my ability.

64
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,606
Wait, so, what you're saying is,
if I smoke this cigar,

65
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,935
I'm gonna see the future?

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,705
Your future.
A possible one, anyway.

67
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,044
As I said, use with caution.
You might not like what you see.

68
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,654
But it seems an appropriate gift
for a man on his wedding day.

69
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,688
Well, it is better than a toaster oven.
Thank you, Claudio.

70
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,019
My congratulations to you.

71
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,369
The centerpieces are amazing.
You should take a look.

72
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,631
Yeah, sure,

73
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,332
after we're done with these
meet-and-greets though, okay?

74
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,475
Oh, you're taking up smoking?

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,846
This is Edwin Garrett
and his wife Denise.

76
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,347
They came from
Edinburgh to be here.

77
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,381
Thank you so much for coming.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,954
The guy's name was Tim McCarren.

79
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,117
He was a hustler.

80
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,264
Worked an area of the park
not far from here.

81
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,627
I found his body just after sunrise.

82
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,462
Now, I've already interviewed
his colleagues,

83
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,127
and they say he got into a pickup truck
with a man in his 20s

84
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,499
at about 1 :30 last night.

85
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,005
One of the other working boys
got a decent look at the driver.

86
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,167
You could probably sit him down
with a sketch artist.

87
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,711
We could, but you do realize
we're not homicide cops, right?

88
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,077
We're from NTAC.
So why'd you call us?

89
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,451
That's why.

90
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,596
My best guess?
This body was completely oxidized.

91
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,792
It's a chemical reaction.
Cells change at the molecular level.

92
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,335
Well, oxidizing, that's what happens
when metal rusts.

93
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,097
Exactly.

94
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,343
Well, almost exactly.
Rusting is a slow process.

95
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,001
There's nothing gradual about
what happened to Tim McCarren.

96
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,011
One minute he was alive, the next...

97
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,082
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

98
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,515
No. There's no documented disease
that affects the human body this way.

99
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,986
- Meaning a 4400 ability did this.
- That's for you to figure out.

100
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,488
All I can tell you is

101
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,822
there's no earthly explanation
about what happened to this guy.

102
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,628
Thanks.

103
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,803
So nothing even close?

104
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,601
Okay, thanks, Brian.
That was the lab.

105
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,403
They ran the composite sketch
of the driver

106
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,409
against their database of 4400s.

107
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,605
- No matches.
- Anything from forensics?

108
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,512
No. Well, they pulled a couple
of partial prints off the safety pin

109
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,346
that held the note to the kid's jacket.

110
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,817
But nothing we can
make an lD from.

111
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,012
Okay, what about the note?

112
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,123
It's a deliberate message
to whoever found the body.

113
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,918
That's typical
of a serial-killer pathology.

114
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,082
Yeah, but it says 27.

115
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,786
There can't be 26 other corpses
like Tim McCarren's out there.

116
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,397
Even one would make it
onto our radar.

117
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,328
So we'll talk
to McCarren's friends, families.

118
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,900
Maybe he's got
a connection to a 4400.

119
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,095
Diana, there is one other thing
I wanna talk to you about.

120
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,364
You got plans on Sunday?

121
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,037
You want me to go
to Shawn's wedding with you?

122
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,612
It's not a date, okay?
I figured you might be interested.

123
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,840
Almost a thousand 4400s
are coming.

124
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,780
Oh, so it's a professional courtesy.

125
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,015
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

126
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,921
Look, to be honest,

127
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,285
I'd rather not be the only one
sitting at the NTAC table.

128
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,393
You'd have a hard time
finding a dance partner.

129
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,321
Look, you know, Maia begged me
to go, and I told her no.

130
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,195
All those 4400s in one place,
we have no idea what could happen.

131
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,805
Diana, it's Shawn and lsabelle,
nobody's gonna cause any trouble.

132
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,963
I mean, would you wanna be
on the bride's bad side?

133
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,769
I can't imagine you're eager
to welcome that girl into the family.

134
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,036
I'm not.

135
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,203
This all happened
a little too quickly for my liking.

136
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,147
But Shawn won't talk to me about it.
I must have left him 20 messages.

137
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,649
I was thinking about going to see him
after we finish work today.

138
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,313
Just make sure Bridezilla
is out of earshot.

139
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,923
- I have to.
- Have to?

140
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,496
You're about to get married, Shawn.
You should want to.

141
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,930
- What's going on? Is she pregnant?
- No. No, nothing like that.

142
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,161
Is she forcing you?

143
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,430
Look, Shawn,
if you're feeling trapped,

144
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,268
if you're looking
for a way out of this,

145
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,500
just tell me, I can help.

146
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,612
Help? Uncle Tommy,
I'm not in front of a firing squad.

147
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,771
I'm getting married.
People do it all the time.

148
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,917
Come on, Shawn.
You're marrying lsabelle.

149
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,177
She's a very dangerous girl.
I happen to know that.

150
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,911
Okay, I know all about her too.

151
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,646
So don't think
you're gonna surprise me.

152
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,189
I appreciate you coming down here.
I know you mean well.

153
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,259
This marriage, it is the right thing.

154
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,759
The right thing for who?

155
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,453
For everybody.

156
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,434
Man, they just cannot keep anything
working around here.

157
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,601
This always happens
when I work late.

158
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,508
You know, I don't even know
where the stairs are in this place.

159
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,479
Oh, right down here.
Come on, I'll show you.

160
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,917
So do you always work past 8?

161
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,181
Most nights, yeah.
Trying to get ahead, you know?

162
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,955
Dedication, I like that.
You could accomplish great things.

163
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,397
Her name was Paula Nakata.

164
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,297
She was a lawyer at a firm
in the building.

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,064
My God, the poor woman.

166
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,605
That's two bodies
in less than 24 hours.

167
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,040
It doesn't make any sense.
Most spree killers, they have a type.

168
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,737
But Tim McCarren and Paula Nakata
could hardly be more different.

169
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,575
A prostitute
and a corporate attorney.

170
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,183
Why would someone
target these two?

171
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,545
And why is she labeled 1 1?

172
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,710
The numbers on the bodies
are working backwards.

173
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,688
It looks like we might have
a partial print on the wedding band.

174
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,892
It's probably from the victim,
but you never know.

175
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,052
Let's hope whoever did this
slipped up.

176
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,290
Because I don't think he's anywhere
close to finished yet.

177
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,009
We were so close.

178
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,013
We were gonna save everything.

179
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,025
Isabelle changed you.

180
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,135
You don't even know
who you are anymore.

181
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,495
She didn't change me.

182
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,233
She showed me who I am.

183
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,435
I know myself better than ever.

184
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,807
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.

185
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,279
Don't do this.

186
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,478
Shawn.

187
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,636
Marco? Did you go home last night?

188
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,982
No, I was working on your case.
It got late.

189
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,882
- Cold.
- We got a message

190
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,387
you wanted to talk to us?

191
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,788
Yeah, the print that they pulled

192
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,451
from Paula Nakata's wedding band
wasn't hers.

193
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,723
Does it match the one we found
on Tim McCarren's body?

194
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,233
It does indeed. The print belongs
to a man named Darren Piersahl.

195
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,201
Piersahl? I've never heard of him.

196
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm not surprised.
See, he is not a 4400.

197
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,978
Well, then he's not the murderer.
Marco, you saw both bodies.

198
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,842
A 4400 killed these people.

199
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,507
It certainly looks that way.

200
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,353
The fingerprint match
wasn't from our database.

201
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,489
It was from U.S. military records.

202
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,887
Piersahl was an Army Ranger
for seven years.

203
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,391
- Was? What's he doing now?
- Not much.

204
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,157
According to Army records,
Darren Piersahl is dead.

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,324
He was killed in action
in lraq in 2005.

206
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,730
I'm wondering,

207
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,737
how could an Army sergeant
who's supposedly been dead for a year

208
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,707
be using a 4400 ability
to kill people in present-day Seattle?

209
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,083
Darren always wanted to be
a Ranger.

210
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,091
It was his dream,
ever since he was old enough to read.

211
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,789
I encouraged it.
I spent 20 years in the service myself.

212
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:33,098
So when Darren signed up it was like
carrying on the family legacy.

213
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,740
Why is NTAC so interested
in my son's death anyway?

214
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,071
It's part of an ongoing investigation,
Mr. Piersahl.

215
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,076
Please, anything you could tell us
would help.

216
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,112
Not long before he died,
I got a letter from Darren.

217
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,713
He was excited.

218
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,879
Said he'd been accepted
into this elite training unit.

219
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,514
He couldn't tell me much about it, just
that it meant he was being transferred

220
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,161
off the frontlines
and out of harm's way.

221
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,422
And he was killed in action
soon after that?

222
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,463
Two weeks later.

223
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,703
The Army told me
he'd been flying a recon mission

224
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,806
in an OH-58 helicopter.

225
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,168
Got hit by an RPG.

226
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,545
They never did find his remains.

227
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,805
I'm so sorry, Mr. Piersahl.

228
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,007
But you said the Army told you
he was flying a recon mission.

229
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,981
Did you have any reason
to doubt that?

230
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,620
Well, I thought
the timing was peculiar.

231
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,450
I mean, I'd just got this letter from him
saying he was done fighting.

232
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,085
So I did some checking.

233
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,956
There were six soldiers reported dead
in the crash that killed my son.

234
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,961
And why is that unusual?

235
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,692
Because an OH-58
flies with a crew of four.

236
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,961
It can't hold six people.

237
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,733
A secret training program?

238
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,670
A death
under suspicious circumstances?

239
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,969
There's something off here.
Even the kid's dad knows it.

240
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,476
It's weird, I'm not denying it.

241
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,944
But let's just take our time
with this, okay?

242
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,640
There are other explanations
that don't involve cover-up.

243
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,480
Someone could've planted Piersahl's
fingerprints at the crime scene.

244
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,780
Who knows? It could be a 4400,

245
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,890
someone who can mimic
other people's fingerprints.

246
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,686
Maybe, but if you're trying to frame
someone, why pick a dead man?

247
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,761
Baldwin. Where?

248
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,889
We'll be right in.
They just found another body.

249
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,566
I'll let you all in
on a little family secret.

250
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,802
My brother and l
haven't always seen eye to eye.

251
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,073
So we didn't talk for a while.
I went to college,

252
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,682
he became the most famous person
in the world.

253
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,413
But it's all good,
because he's a great guy.

254
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,547
And I'm really proud of him.
I think we all are.

255
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,885
So congratulations, man.

256
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,552
I couldn't be happier
to see you walk the plank.

257
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,823
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

258
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,694
Cheers.

259
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,040
Is there anything
you'd like to say, Daddy?

260
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,708
Toast. The father of the bride
wants to speak.

261
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,754
Shawn, lsabelle.

262
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,016
I have to say, I had my doubts.

263
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,386
But my daughter
has managed to overcome them.

264
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,960
She was determined
to make this marriage happen,

265
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,961
and here we all are.

266
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,999
Shawn, she couldn't have picked
a better partner.

267
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,434
I'm proud to call you my son.

268
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,138
Cheers.

269
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,707
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

270
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,574
So where are you guys going
on your honeymoon?

271
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,342
You know, we haven't really
figured that out yet.

272
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,113
If you'll all please excuse me.

273
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,552
Stay.

274
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,991
You keep charming the in-laws,
I'll see what's up.

275
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,288
Isabelle?

276
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,624
You saW me die? You're sure?

277
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,927
I killed you.

278
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,570
And, Richard, I swear to God,
it looked like I was enjoying it.

279
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,434
The whole reason I'm marrying lsabelle
is to keep her attached, normal.

280
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,631
That's not what happens.

281
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,243
I don't make her more human,
she makes me less human.

282
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,969
I have to try something. I have to go,

283
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,579
I have to see if it changes anything.

284
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,841
- Gonna walk out on the wedding?
- Maybe, I don't know.

285
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,383
I'm getting out of here,
and then I'm gonna see what happens.

286
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,283
If you leave now, it's not gonna
make lsabelle very happy.

287
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,822
- It might not be easy to come back.
- I know that.

288
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,618
But I have to do it.

289
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,455
Just tell them I'm sick or something.

290
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm sorry.
Just tell them something, okay?

291
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,399
Her name was Holly Martins.
She was a housewife in Madison Park.

292
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,633
- The pool man found her body.
- Was there a note?

293
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,478
Ninety-two?

294
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,171
How many people
is this guy targeting?

295
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,076
Guys, I figured out what
all these corpses have in common.

296
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,887
All the victims
had the same mutation?

297
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,889
We did a genetic workup
on all three corpses.

298
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,120
Every one of them has a slight
alteration of the 1 1 th chromosome.

299
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,524
It's called the Starzl Mutation.

300
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,824
That could be a coincidence.

301
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,968
Not likely.
The Starzl Mutation's extremely rare.

302
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,003
The only documented cases
are in the Seattle area.

303
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,140
You see,
there's two kinds of mutations.

304
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,899
Some occur naturally.

305
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,476
You know, something goes wrong
when the body's building itself.

306
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,703
Others are induced.

307
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,144
The genes are changed
by external factors.

308
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,306
- And the Starzl Mutation is induced.
- That's right.

309
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,351
Starting in 1 969,
Seattle Presbyterian Hospital

310
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,887
used a flawed radiation machine
to treat their cancer patients.

311
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,087
You know, the microswitches that
controlled the thing weren't working.

312
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
The dosages were all off.

313
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,425
- How long did this go on?
- Under five years.

314
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,496
Once the hospital figured out
what they were doing,

315
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,190
they tested everyone
who had ever been exposed to it.

316
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,303
In some cases,
the radiation induced a small mutation.

317
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,529
The Starzl Mutation.

318
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,697
Yeah, they named it after the company
that made the bad machine.

319
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,274
And the mutation's replicable.

320
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,673
You know, people who got it
passed it on to their kids,

321
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,337
which includes our three victims.

322
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,380
They were living normal lives.
They were healthy.

323
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,520
Hey, just like most mutations,
you can have it and not even know.

324
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,849
After everything went public,
the lawyers came out to play.

325
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,514
There was a class-action lawsuit.

326
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,557
Seattle Presbyterian paid
a huge settlement

327
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,558
to everyone who was affected
by the machine.

328
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,923
They almost went bankrupt.

329
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,362
So Darren Piersahl,
who's supposed to be dead,

330
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,593
is targeting carriers
of the Starzl Mutation,

331
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,067
which only occurs around Seattle,

332
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,139
and has absolutely no effect
on its carriers.

333
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,434
Okay, but why?

334
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,270
Excellent question.

335
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,207
When you find out,
make sure you tell me.

336
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,370
If there was a lawsuit,
there's a paper trail.

337
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,642
I'll bet you that hospital keeps
a master list of everyone they paid.

338
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,185
- You okay? You okay?
- Shawn, you should stop healing me.

339
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,914
No, you're gonna make it,
Uncle Tom.

340
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,581
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.

341
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,122
This is all my fault.

342
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,423
I should never have
talked you out of marrying lsabelle.

343
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,032
No, that was my decision, not yours.

344
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,901
I can't help thinking that
it didn't have to end this way.

345
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,472
Everyone we love is dead.

346
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,443
I'm sorry. The catastrophe's here.

347
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,876
Hey, no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

348
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,913
Hold on, hold on.

349
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,850
No, let me go.
Let me go, let me go.

350
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,487
Save as many as you can, Shawn.

351
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,834
You're lucky. Until six weeks ago,
I hadn't pulled that file in years.

352
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,801
If you'd asked me then,
it would've taken me hours.

353
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,439
What happened six weeks ago?

354
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,007
Oh, some guy in a suit showed up.
Had a document with him

355
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,409
saying that the military needed the file
for research in the war on terror.

356
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,946
Yeah, there we go.

357
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,085
There it is. That's the master list
of everyone we paid in the Starzl case.

358
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,879
This man, can you tell me his name?

359
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,578
Yeah.

360
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,682
Miles Enright.
Why, you know him?

361
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,219
Not yet.

362
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,761
There's 1 23 people here.

363
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,923
A hundred and twenty-three
we know have the mutation.

364
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,762
Numbers we've been finding
on the dead bodies

365
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,597
correspond to where
they appear on the list.

366
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,263
Number 27, Timothy McCarren.
Number 1 1, Paula Nakata.

367
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,772
And Holly Martin's 92.

368
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,241
So Darren Piersahl,
if he's the killer,

369
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,039
is working from the same list
we're holding.

370
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,943
But the order seems so random.

371
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,085
I mean, is he just killing them
as the opportunity arises

372
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,651
or is there some method?

373
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,310
I'll try and find a pattern.

374
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,156
Hey, how's Maia been?

375
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,853
She's okay.

376
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,491
She asks about you a lot.

377
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,331
Yeah?

378
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,128
I just checked out Miles Enright.

379
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,759
He's the vice president of Research
and Development at Haspel Corp.

380
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,371
Dennis.

381
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,773
You've been ignoring our calls.

382
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,274
I'm busy, Tom.

383
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,072
Why don't you go
through my assistant?

384
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,239
- Maybe we can talk next week or so.
- It's important, Ryland.

385
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,977
It's about Darren Piersahl
and your company's program

386
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,951
to create a division of the U.S. military
with 4400 abilities.

387
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,101
I don't know, Tom. I've been
working here less than three months.

388
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,331
I still don't know
where the supply closets are,

389
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,203
and now you've got me
heading up a covert program

390
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,143
where I'm injecting promicin
into United States soldiers?

391
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,249
Six weeks ago, the vice president
of Research and Development

392
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,409
acquired a list of everyone
with the Starzl Mutation.

393
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,647
- Miles Enright. Maybe you know him?
- Sorry, it's a big building.

394
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,157
- I haven't shaken everybody's hand.
- Three people are dead.

395
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,818
Now, you need to tell us everything
you know about Darren Piersahl

396
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,226
so we can bring him in
before he kills anyone else.

397
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,264
I've never heard of him.

398
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,925
And I've certainly never heard of this,
what do you call it?

399
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,297
Starzl Mutation?

400
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,202
This is your last chance to cooperate
before we find Piersahl.

401
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,707
If you help us now, we'll make it look
better for your company later, Dennis.

402
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,904
Well, how can I help you when I have
no idea what you're talking about?

403
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,379
Now, if this program existed--

404
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:52,683
And please, understand
I'm not saying it does.

405
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,090
--you seem to think
that people would be shocked

406
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,693
to know that it's out there.

407
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,329
Me, I think they'd be grateful.

408
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,931
I think any good citizen
would be thankful

409
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,329
that his government
was working on this.

410
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,402
Because you can be damned sure
our enemies are.

411
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,134
If everyone would be so happy,
why not just tell us about it?

412
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,708
As usual, you have no idea
of what the stakes are.

413
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,438
Whoever controls promicin
has a strategic advantage

414
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,047
over the rest of the world.

415
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,581
This is another
Manhattan Project, Tom.

416
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,843
And they didn't close it down

417
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,886
because a couple of technicians
got radiation poisoning.

418
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,819
They kept on working,
and they were right to do that.

419
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,584
It's made the world a better place.

420
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,357
Not that you're admitting
that the program exists, right?

421
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,534
What program?

422
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,912
So if I go through with it,
if I marry lsabelle,

423
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,051
you and I become enemies,
I kill you.

424
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,881
If I don't do it, Richard,
things are even worse.

425
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,716
They're-- People are dead.
A lot of people.

426
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,552
In the second vision, your uncle said
the catastrophe was here, right?

427
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,718
That place looked like a war zone.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

428
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,558
Look, you can only deal
with the information you have.

429
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,364
In one future, I die.

430
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,560
In another,
it sounds like thousands of people,

431
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,864
maybe millions, are at risk.

432
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,742
- That's no choice at all.
- We're talking about your life.

433
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,841
The guy said each vision
was one possible future.

434
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:26,245
If you do marry lsabelle, at least
we go into it with our eyes open.

435
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,979
Now that we know what could happen,
we can change things.

436
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,514
Nothing's inevitable, right?

437
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,851
Let's hope not.

438
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,524
Because believe me...

439
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,764
... I don't wanna die.

440
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,438
Meet Staff Sergeant John Shaffner.

441
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,438
Okay, so why are we meeting him?

442
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,271
He was one of six fatalities
in the helicopter crash

443
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,470
that "killed" Darren Piersahl.

444
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,740
- A helicopter that seated only four.
- Right.

445
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,909
It turns out John Shaffner's family
never received his remains either.

446
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,579
You know, there was really
a helicopter crash that day in lraq,

447
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,691
but four families got
their kids' bodies back, two didn't.

448
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,918
Here's what I'm thinking--

449
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,791
Piersahl and Shaffner were recruited
into Haspel Corp's training program

450
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,397
at the same time.

451
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,397
So they used the crash
to fake two deaths.

452
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,297
So that Piersahl and Shaffner

453
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,200
could disappear into the program
with impunity.

454
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,933
So we have a second member of
Haspel Corp's program, which is great.

455
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,043
But it doesn't get us
any closer to Darren Piersahl.

456
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,473
Good point. It doesn't, really.

457
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:32,777
Not until...you look
at Shaffner's dog tags.

458
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,351
This is Shaffner's
military serial number.

459
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,112
Look familiar?

460
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,755
Should it?

461
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,292
Twenty-seven. That's what the note
we found on Tim McCarren said.

462
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,792
That's also where
we found his name

463
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,523
on the list of people
with Starzl Mutation.

464
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,099
Eleven.
That was Paula Nakata's number.

465
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,634
And Holly Martins was 92 on the list.
There is a pattern.

466
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,965
He's picking the order
based on his buddy's serial number.

467
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,539
Okay, but why?

468
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,506
Maybe it's a message.
Maybe they're doing it together.

469
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:04,138
But if he's consistent, the next victim
will be number 38 on the Starzl list.

470
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,373
Alex Messina.

471
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,951
I already checked him out.
He manages a bike store in Madrona.

472
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,885
Yeah. Yeah, I recognize him.

473
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,389
He was in here earlier today.

474
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,959
- Did he say anything to you?
- It was kind of weird, actually.

475
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,062
He asked me
if my name was Alex Messina.

476
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,198
And he said it like that.
You know, the full name.

477
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,126
He wanted to know if I could
come out and take a look at his bike.

478
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,898
He needed to replace a part,
and I told him just to bring it in.

479
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,542
He said he'd come back
when we were less busy.

480
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,649
Send a tactical team over right away.
Thanks.

481
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,308
If Piersahl makes a move,
we'll be ready.

482
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,252
Tom.

483
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,256
Must be from Piersahl.

484
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,068
Hey.

485
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,773
Do you like this color?

486
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,609
This place needs to be a little
more girlie if I'm gonna be living here.

487
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,137
Yeah, it looks great.

488
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,010
I think so too.

489
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,047
I'm glad you're back.

490
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,856
If Piersahl knows we're onto him
he'll change his pattern of attack.

491
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,396
There's a dozen people
we can't find.

492
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,261
Hope we get to them
before Piersahl does.

493
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,868
Tom Baldwin?

494
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,931
Yeah, who's asking?

495
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,137
My name is John. John Shaffner.

496
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,609
I was a volunteer in the same program
Darren Piersahl was in.

497
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,978
- The one that drove him crazy.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

498
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,278
- And we know about the program.
- Good.

499
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,822
Then you're ready to hear
what I have to say.

500
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,766
We were volunteers, all of us.

501
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,763
I still remember the sales pitch.

502
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,428
We'd be the elite,
a new type of soldier.

503
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,801
We had to give up our lives,
forfeit our identities.

504
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,201
They said it was the only way.

505
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,902
The program had to operate
in complete secrecy.

506
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,671
When did you start
getting the injections?

507
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,442
Right away. Started slow,
but about three weeks ago,

508
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,016
they started upping our dosages.

509
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,553
- That's when guys started to lose it.
- Where did they get the promicin?

510
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,122
I don't know, but they seem
to have plenty of it though.

511
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,283
Darren was the first one
who could do stuff, you know?

512
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,950
An ability.

513
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,756
He killed one of the instructors
by mistake.

514
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,990
- It freaked him out.
- You two escaped together?

515
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,225
Once we got out, we pretty much
went our separate ways.

516
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,427
I had no idea he was gonna do this.

517
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,662
So he's AWOL?

518
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,397
These murders
aren't sanctioned by anyone?

519
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,734
No, Darren's freelancing.

520
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,900
That's why they want him back so bad.
He's compromising the program.

521
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,410
Our C.O.s, they told us
about the Starzl Mutation.

522
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,607
They told us it could be a threat,
but they never told us to kill anybody.

523
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,808
Then what is it?

524
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,180
Why does Darren
want them dead so badly?

525
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,914
Got something to do with babies.

526
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,116
So far, any time a 4400
has a kid with a member

527
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,023
of the regular population,
their babies are normal.

528
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,130
They don't make promicin,
they don't have abilities.

529
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,765
We know,
we've been tracking the births.

530
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,867
But the Starzl Mutation
changes all that.

531
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,266
If a 4400 has a kid
with someone who has the mutation,

532
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,498
the baby would be promicin-positive.

533
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,272
- They'd have abilities.
- How would the military know that?

534
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,809
- Have they tried it?
- I don't know,

535
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,742
but they seem
pretty goddamn sure it's true.

536
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,880
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but Darren is a victim here too.

537
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,712
They gave us so many stimulants.

538
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,946
They amped us up to kill,
and he snapped.

539
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,181
Don't know if he thinks
he's on a mission or something,

540
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,586
but I know he needs
to be stopped.

541
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,984
I'll do whatever I can
to help you find him.

542
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,295
So, What do you think you knoW?

543
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,900
Everything.
Including the Starzl Mutation.

544
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,864
And I have to give you credit.

545
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,503
If what you say is right,

546
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,129
it would explain why the 4400
were sent back in 2004.

547
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,071
Why they were all brought
to Seattle.

548
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,076
This is the only place the 4400 can
reproduce and have kids with abilities.

549
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,474
Any of this sound familiar?

550
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,276
I think I read the same theory
in a supermarket tabloid once.

551
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,443
We know about your enhanced
soldier program, Dennis.

552
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,815
We have one of your people.

553
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,788
John Shaffner been showing up
for many roll calls lately?

554
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,630
Well, as soon as we have Piersahl,
we're going public with this,

555
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,427
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

556
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,198
All you can do is make yourself
and this company look slightly better

557
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,773
by cooperating with our efforts
to bring him in.

558
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,106
We want Piersahl's personnel file.
Everything you have.

559
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,372
If it's not in my hands
in 90 seconds,

560
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,779
John Shaffner will be standing in front
of a bank of cameras before lunch.

561
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,654
This could be something. Maybe.

562
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,657
It reads like some kind
of personal statement.

563
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,126
An essay by Piersahl.

564
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,026
Yeah, we had to do those
to get in the program.

565
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,133
They wanted us to write
about some goal we achieved,

566
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,495
something we were proud of.

567
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,694
This is all about a volunteer program
that he did.

568
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,738
There was a patch of forest
that got cleared by a fire.

569
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,139
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a--

570
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,245
Darren Piersahl
was an Eagle Scout?

571
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,847
Yeah, he used to talk
about those woods all the time.

572
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,574
When we were in the middle
of the program,

573
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,150
whenever things got really bad,

574
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,446
he used to tell me
that's where he'd go in his head.

575
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,714
He'd imagine himself there,
it calmed him down.

576
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,051
This patch of forest,
any chance you know where it is?

577
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,696
Maybe you could put your arm
around her, Mr. Tyler.

578
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,201
That's great.

579
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,070
The magazine wants to get
a shot of the bride and groom.

580
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,403
Has anyone seen the groom?

581
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,411
Who gave you the key?

582
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,171
Your own bodyguard.

583
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,916
You started a war, Richard.

584
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,051
You turned the 4400 into an army,

585
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,881
and you launched an attack
for no reason!

586
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,717
We didn't have a choice.

587
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,451
It had to be a preemptive strike.

588
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,596
No choice. Look what you're doing.

589
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,358
Look at it. It has to stop.

590
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,699
Isabelle changed you.

591
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,866
You don't even know
who you are anymore.

592
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,175
She didn't change me.

593
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,444
She showed me who I am.

594
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,608
I know myself better than ever.

595
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,913
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.

596
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,284
Don't do this.

597
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,257
Shawn...

598
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,366
Shawn.

599
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,378
Sorry to barge in on you, it's just...

600
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,909
They need you down in the garden.
Pictures.

601
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,919
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

602
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,024
I'm just...

603
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,386
...a little overwhelmed.

604
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,297
Darren?

605
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,292
Darren.

606
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,371
Darren, you out here?

607
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,410
What are you doing here?

608
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,251
Darren, relax, man.
It's me, Shaffner.

609
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,791
John, we're friends, remember?

610
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,756
Shaff.

611
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,900
You came. That's good.

612
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,065
That's good, I need your help.

613
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,471
I'm never gonna make it
all the way through this list on my own.

614
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,401
Darren, you don't have to finish the list.
It's someone else's agenda.

615
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,738
You got it all mixed up in your head.
Come on with me,

616
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,972
there's people I want you to talk to.
They can help us.

617
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,048
They? Who are they?

618
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,242
It's gotta stop, man. Please.

619
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,353
Come with me.

620
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,259
- No. No.
- Wait.

621
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,065
We got people covering
the access road, we'll pin him down.

622
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,766
Fan out!

623
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,557
Oh, Jesus. Tom!

624
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,110
I can't see anything.

625
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,118
Tom.

626
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,258
Tom!

627
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,425
Tom?

628
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,247
We lost Shaffner, Piersahl's dead.

629
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,790
He was on his way out
before we even started fighting.

630
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,326
Piersahl had a stab wound
in his stomach.

631
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,862
I guess Shaffner didn't go down
without a fight.

632
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,932
Yeah. Well, they're both gone.

633
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,034
And there's no one left
to talk about the program.

634
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,294
We still have evidence.

635
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,199
We can go after Haspel Corp.
Expose everything.

636
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,239
Yeah, but it would have been nice
to have a face to put out there.

637
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,502
Now all we have are accusations
and a paper trail.

638
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,236
And five dead bodies.

639
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,846
Hey, you guys gotta see this.

640
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,874
We are proud
to announce the existence

641
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,022
of this enhanced-soldier program
to all the World,

642
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,822
but it should not, in any Way,
be seen as an offensive maneuver,

643
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,622
We have evidence suggesting that
other countries have similar programs.

644
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,059
This is merely a response,

645
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,866
The young men I'm about to introduce
to you have been Working in secret,

646
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,627
and We've made
numerous advances,

647
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,405
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s

648
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,236
to develop extra-human abilities,
and they'll use them

649
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,571
in the defense of the United States,

650
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,143
NoW I'd like to introduce
eight heroic young men,

651
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,581
all of Whom have given
so much of themselves

652
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,584
to make this breakthrough possible,

653
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,017
Ryland's preempting us.

654
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,023
Trotting them out there on-stage
like they're the first astronauts.

655
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,254
Major Jeremy ElWood,
First Lieutenant Raymond Garcia,

656
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,890
First Lieutenant Jeff Rice,
First Lieutenant Brian DaWson,

657
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,367
Second Lieutenant James Noland,

658
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,306
Second Lieutenant Dirk Danoff,

659
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,945
The press conference
was a clever move, Dennis.

660
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,207
I have to give credit where it's due.

661
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,648
But this company
has five bodies on its hands.

662
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,379
And I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows it.

663
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,922
Knows what?
We're not denying anything.

664
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,889
It's unfortunate that one of my men
went AWOL,

665
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,029
but he was clearly deranged.

666
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,757
And I've got a whole team of doctors
standing by to testify to that effect.

667
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,400
You created an assassin.

668
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,899
It's a tragedy.

669
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,731
And it's news, I'll admit that.

670
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,667
But tomorrow morning,
the Piersahl case

671
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,637
will be below the fold
on every newspaper.

672
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,640
And all the headlines
will be about our program.

673
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,439
That's the way I see it, anyway.

674
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,308
Wait, who's feeding you
your information?

675
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,314
You knew about the Starzl Mutation
before we did.

676
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,282
You have a source
of promicin for your program.

677
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,978
Who is it?

678
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,748
You give me too much credit, Tom.

679
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,587
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.

680
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,861
The soldiers you're creating,

681
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,631
are you really gonna use them
to defend the country?

682
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,502
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?

683
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,972
Is there a difference?

684
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,780
Enjoy your nephew's wedding.

685
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,909
You sure you're ready for this?

686
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,078
Come on, you look ready.

687
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,311
Let's do this.

688
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,989
Hello there.

689
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,529
Thanks for coming.
Thanks, kids.

690
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,165
Thank you for coming so much.
Thank you for being here.

691
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,500
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you.

692
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,541
Thank you for coming so far.
Thank you.

693
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,345
I appreciate your coming all this way.
Thank you so much.

694
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,146
Shawn. Shawn Farrell.

695
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,891
Do you know who I am?
