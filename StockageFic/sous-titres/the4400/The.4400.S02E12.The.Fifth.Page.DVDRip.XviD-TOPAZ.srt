1
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,267
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

2
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,468
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,934
Previously on the 4400...

4
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,667
This is where
I give you the speech

5
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,600
about how you're
my best field scientist

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,034
and Tom is my best
lead investigator,

7
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,267
and how together,

8
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:55,900
you're going to make
a good team.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,434
Let me see
if I've got this straight...

10
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,267
you two met,
fell in love,

11
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,667
and spent eight years together

12
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,167
in some kind
of alternate reality.

13
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,301
Yeah.

14
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,334
What time is the flight?

15
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:05,301
Uh, noon.

16
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,734
Say goodbye to mom for me.

17
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,834
They arrested a suspect
40 minutes ago.

18
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,067
Claim he's our guy.

19
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,967
Roy Keith Marsden.

20
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,533
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

21
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,434
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.

22
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,867
It's going to feel
a little weird,

23
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,067
but when we're done,

24
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:19,134
you'll be able
to see again.

25
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:21,301
When does it start?

26
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,267
When do I see again?

27
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:23,967
Just give me one moment, okay?

28
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,767
Kevin's a genius, you know.

29
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,334
You're saying that Burkhoff

30
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:30,734
is the father
of the 4400 technology.

31
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:33,101
I can think again, too.

32
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,001
You've got
a real fever,

33
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:34,967
young lady.

34
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,034
I worked at the CDC
for seven years,

35
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,101
and I never saw
anything like it.

36
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:42,201
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.

37
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,167
Marks? Bruises?

38
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,301
No. Like irritations.

39
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,800
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,700
What did I just tell you?

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,167
You're in charge
until I'm released.

42
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,567
Pool whatever manpower
is still up walking.

43
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,867
Start picking up the pieces.

44
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,468
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,968
Okay, seriously,

46
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,100
my back is about
to call it a day.

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,968
Just come on...

48
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,534
You're not helping.

49
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:10,701
Where's this going?

50
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:11,834
Right there.

51
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,001
Please say
that was the last box.

52
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,100
That's it.

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,867
We're officially
living in sin.

54
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,233
Oh, really.

55
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,567
Well, I prefer to call it

56
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,901
"resuming
our eight-year marriage".

57
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,934
Call it whatever you want.

58
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,934
Just don't kiss
in front of me again, okay?

59
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,467
That's disgusting.

60
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,001
Oh, your father thinks
this is so romantic,

61
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,400
but what
he doesn't know

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,701
is the reason
I'm moving in

63
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,701
is to take down
his tacky golf stuff.

64
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,901
What?

65
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,100
And replace it
with what?

66
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,567
Oh, oh,
paint splatters?

67
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,534
Maybe a picture
of a triangle...

68
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,634
- Kids!
- It's art.

69
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,200
Work out
these decorating issues

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
amongst yourselves,

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,133
but I'm dead serious

72
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,267
about this kissing rule, okay?

73
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,601
It's non-negotiable.

74
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:58,834
Oh, Kyle,

75
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,601
my allergies are
bothering me again.

76
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:02,167
Could you write me
another prescription

77
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,100
before you go?

78
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,734
Uh, Alana...

79
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,767
Kyle's only a doctor
in the world you created for me,

80
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,233
remember?

81
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,500
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,667
I had a brain freeze.

83
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,867
Right.

84
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,334
Trying to decipher
my handwriting?

85
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,100
I was just on the verge
of giving up, actually.

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,133
Good.

87
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,367
Bad penmanship
is the best way

88
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,034
for a doctor to keep
his mystique.

89
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,233
There's a page missing
in there.

90
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,934
It goes from page four
to page six.

91
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,400
Sorry.
I'm breaking in a new nurse.

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,434
So listen, I think
we finally know

93
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,334
what's wrong
with your daughter.

94
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,801
Maia's suffering
from a type of pneumonia

95
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,601
called "Pneumocystis Jiroveci".

96
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,300
It's "P.J.P." for short.

97
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,400
I've never heard of it.

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,601
It's rare,

99
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,167
but we can treat it...

100
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,334
Well, thank god.

101
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,901
But this kind
of pneumonia

102
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,901
could be a symptom
for something more serious.

103
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,133
We've tested her
for every virus...

104
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,367
all negative.

105
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,734
So where is it coming from?

106
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,567
We don't know,
but we're running more tests.

107
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,968
We'll figure it out.

108
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,001
It's not that big
of a deal.

109
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,200
You know, I've just...

110
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,133
I've been working
real hard lately.

111
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,068
I think I got the flu
or something.

112
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,601
Everybody gets that,
right?

113
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,968
Sure. It's just...

114
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,968
Shawn...

115
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,801
you can't heal.

116
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,767
For now.

117
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,300
I think you should
get it checked out.

118
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,968
If I can't kick it
in a day or two, I will,

119
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,534
but, uh...

120
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,801
until then,
can you reschedule

121
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,300
all my foundation
appointments?

122
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
Tell them that it's temporary.

123
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,068
Make sure they know that.

124
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,300
Lily...

125
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,934
don't tell anyone
I can't heal.

126
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,767
Sure.

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,667
Thank you.

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,367
Lily...

129
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,901
I mean it. Nobody.

130
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:34,701
Oh, god.

131
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,601
Ah...

132
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,467
How many are sick?

133
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:20,867
300... that we know of.

134
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,467
Medical says
more calls keep coming in.

135
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,068
So, what is it?

136
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:25,968
Well, it's some kind
of immune system disorder,

137
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,734
and it's leaving the 4400
vulnerable

138
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,133
to all kinds of diseases.

139
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,701
His plane landed
at SEATAC

140
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:32,834
on schedule.

141
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,167
Chopper should be here
any minute.

142
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,867
What's that?

143
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,334
They told me
he likes green tea.

144
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:40,367
Is it contagious?

145
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,767
We don't know.

146
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,968
Were they infected
while they were gone?

147
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,233
Maybe they brought this
back with them.

148
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,434
Well, maybe.
We just don't know.

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,667
The situation is fluid,

150
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:54,100
but here's a summary
of what we know so far.

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,400
Uh, sir?

152
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,434
They told me
you'd want this.

153
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,367
The numbers just keep
getting bigger.

154
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,400
So we're recovering...

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,100
... from an attack
on this building...

156
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,200
... the division commander's
still in the hospital...

157
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,367
... what are we
supposed to do?

158
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,834
We take to the field.

159
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,934
Ryland?
Where did he
come from?

160
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,968
We're going to have
every 4400 in this jurisdiction

161
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,100
tested
for this sickness

162
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,634
by day's end.

163
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:24,901
Dennis, is it good to see you.

164
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,133
Tom.

165
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,467
Diana.

166
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,001
What brings you
to Seattle, Ryland?

167
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,367
I'm assuming temporary command
of this division.

168
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,734
My orders are to do something

169
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,867
about the spread
of this epidemic.

170
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:39,567
I'm going to figure out a way
to do just that.

171
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,234
You might want
to move that,

172
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:46,800
unless you want people
calling you "Nina".

173
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,034
How's Jarvis doing?

174
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,567
They set her collarbone.

175
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,901
Doctors said
she'll be back in two weeks.

176
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,067
My guess?

177
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,268
She makes it in one.

178
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah.

179
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,067
So how's D.C.?

180
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,433
Oh, it's a lot of networking.

181
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:01,901
Lots of dinner parties.

182
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,167
Patty loves it.

183
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,368
And you?

184
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,101
The pacific northwest
is the flashpoint.

185
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,734
I kind of feel

186
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,600
like I was promoted
out of the game.

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,934
A lot of guys here
would trade places with you.

188
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,400
I wouldn't blame them.

189
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,234
A woman releases plague
into the air?

190
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,234
A terrorist attack
on the building?

191
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:21,667
Some people I work for

192
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,001
think you're
in the middle of a war.

193
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,634
I'm sure
it looks that way on paper.

194
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:26,101
Don't get defensive.

195
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,834
I'm still preaching the gospel
of Highland Beach.

196
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,600
I still believe

197
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,800
the 4400 came back here
to change things for the better.

198
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,901
Yeah, and the people
you work for?

199
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:35,034
Don't worry
about them.

200
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,567
One day, this'll be over,

201
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,167
we'll go out for a beer,

202
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,500
we'll kick back,
we'll trade war stories.

203
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,101
Yeah.

204
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,467
She was a little cranky
this morning.

205
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:46,600
I think
she's cutting another tooth.

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,901
They're
coming in fast, huh?

207
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,433
She's that age.

208
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,301
Bye, bye, sweetie.

209
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,834
We'll see you tomorrow.

210
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,467
Thank you, ruth.

211
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,967
Lily, what are you doing?

212
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,034
I thought we agreed

213
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,834
nobody was doing
science experiments on our baby.

214
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,467
Just making sure.

215
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,368
Shawn, we need to rearrange
your healing schedule.

216
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,867
There's something going on,

217
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:15,533
some sort of illness
spreading among the 4400.

218
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,134
I know all about it.

219
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,667
You.

220
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,834
Did you do this?

221
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,234
No, no. It wasn't me.

222
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,400
Then what are you doing here?

223
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,134
I read about this place
in the paper.

224
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,600
I just... I was curious.

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,667
Yeah?

226
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:12,700
Well, go be curious
somewhere else,

227
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,967
because people
still live here, okay?

228
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,400
Do you need some help?

229
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,134
What, are you
a mechanic now?

230
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,767
I can change a tire.

231
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,067
There's probably a jack
in the trunk, right?

232
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,600
Yeah.

233
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

234
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,034
I just... I'm in a hurry, and...

235
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,700
my boyfriend's little brother

236
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,268
is in the principal's office
again,

237
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,334
and he's... not here...

238
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,533
again.

239
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,301
I guess he's in
a lot of trouble, huh?

240
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,167
Yeah.

241
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,567
Yeah, you could say that.

242
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,301
Well, I mean,
it's none of my business.

243
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,034
I can just change the tire
and go.

244
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,400
Please.

245
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,433
Hi there.

246
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,533
Welcome to the center.

247
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,533
Are you here to take the tour?

248
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,734
This is wrong.

249
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,301
It's all wrong.

250
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,567
Excuse me?

251
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,368
This is
the Collier museum.

252
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,834
Where are
all the paintings?

253
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,967
Thomas.

254
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,533
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

255
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,433
I have a board of directors
meeting,

256
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,067
and they won't let me
go upstairs.

257
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,567
Yeah, yeah.
They called me.

258
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:50,667
They said you were
a little mixed up.

259
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:54,134
Alana...

260
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:56,634
this isn't
the Collier museum.

261
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,967
It's...
it's the 4400 center.

262
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,867
What are you
talking about?

263
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,301
I come here
all the time.

264
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:04,368
Look at me. Look...

265
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,901
Alana...

266
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:08,167
the place
you're thinking of,

267
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,500
it's somewhere else.

268
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,634
No. No!

269
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:15,700
Why are you
confusing me?

270
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,967
Just calm down!
No!

271
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,567
It's okay.
It's all right.

272
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,101
The infection rate is 18%.

273
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,533
One in five of them

274
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:31,667
are already sick?

275
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,001
One in five today.
Tomorrow...

276
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,268
the national
institute of health

277
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:38,101
is worried that this illness,
whatever it is,

278
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,134
can mutate

279
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,201
and cross over

280
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:41,533
into the general
population.

281
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,600
Would it even
have to mutate?

282
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,834
There's
no guarantee

283
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,600
that this is going to
stay exclusive to 4400s

284
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,967
and meanwhile,

285
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,901
we've got two dozen sick ones
right downstairs.

286
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:50,901
They're not going to
be there long.

287
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:51,901
Why?

288
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,368
What are we doing with them?

289
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:56,101
D.C. wants to put all the 4400
back in quarantine

290
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,734
and keep them there

291
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,533
for the rest
of the crisis.

292
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,600
I know it's a big move, people,

293
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,433
but it's the best one we've got
at the moment.

294
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,600
Can we do that?

295
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,467
According to emergency
quarantine order 74,

296
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,567
we can.

297
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,700
But wait,
you're just talking

298
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,533
about the sick ones here,
right?

299
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,934
No. All of them.

300
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,533
Every 4400
in the country

301
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,600
is subject to this order.

302
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,901
Okay,

303
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:18,834
but that's only half of them.

304
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,134
This thing's worldwide, right?

305
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:22,567
England and France
are passing similar legislation.

306
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,467
We expect
other countries to follow.

307
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,734
But why are you forcing them all
to come in?

308
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,500
Because the disease seems to be
showing up at random.

309
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,234
Until we understand
how it's transmitted,

310
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,433
we have to assume

311
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,001
that every 4400
is a potential vector.

312
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,034
How much time
are we giving them?

313
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,067
We'll make
the announcement

314
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,001
in the morning.

315
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:40,934
They'll have 12 hours

316
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,700
to get to a local
NTAC branch,

317
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
then they'll be
transferred

318
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,667
to Camp Dekker

319
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,167
and the quarantine facility.

320
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,967
What if they don't report?

321
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,268
Then it'll be our job
to bring them in.

322
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,301
You're not hearing me...

323
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,700
it's temporary.

324
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,834
Can you be sure?

325
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,101
You already told me
people in Washington

326
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,533
think we're
fighting a war.

327
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,101
Washington is
full of opinions.

328
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,334
The town runs on them.

329
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,634
The 4400

330
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:11,967
aren't just names
in some report...

331
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,834
and they're definitely
not enemy combatants.

332
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,334
You're talking
about my daughter,

333
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,400
Tom's nephew...

334
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,500
the woman I love.

335
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,134
I was going to tell you
over that beer.

336
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,067
Now, what assurances

337
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,034
can you give us

338
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,400
that these people

339
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,067
aren't just being
thrown down some hole

340
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,201
permanently?

341
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,201
You have my assurance,

342
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:30,901
and that should be
enough.

343
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,201
I was the one who pushed
to let them out

344
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,800
in the first place,
you remember?

345
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,634
We're not trying
to second-guess you, Dennis,

346
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,901
but people we love are sick.

347
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,101
I get it,

348
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,967
but getting them all
together in one place

349
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,800
is going to make it
a lot easier

350
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,667
to find out
what the hell this is.

351
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,433
When it's over,
everybody goes home.

352
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,334
We know you'll
fight the good fight, Dennis.

353
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:52,700
I just hope you can win.

354
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,001
Mommy?

355
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,500
You're awake.

356
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,700
How are you, baby?

357
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,500
I'm tired of being sick.

358
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,034
When can I go home?

359
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,334
Why don't you tell me?

360
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:27,001
I was kind of hoping
you'd had a vision,

361
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:30,700
about how all this
will be over soon.

362
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,201
They're not coming
anymore.

363
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,368
I'm not seeing things.

364
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,134
My favorite patient
is awake.

365
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:42,334
More awake than you look.

366
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,934
Mm.

367
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,201
Open wide.

368
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,767
I do my best work

369
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,234
when I eliminate sleep
altogether.

370
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,600
Well, if you need someone

371
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,867
to splash cold water
on your face,

372
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,234
you just let me know.

373
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,901
Thanks.

374
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,467
Do you mind?

375
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,533
I noticed that missing page
made its way back in.

376
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,500
Oh. Yeah.

377
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,901
I told you it'd be back.

378
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,433
What are those two lines
blacked out for?

379
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,867
Well, looks like
we duplicated a test.

380
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,101
They cross it out

381
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,934
so we don't read
the same results twice.

382
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Okay, let's see
how that rash is doing.

383
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,634
I'm fine, Brian.

384
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,234
Tell Heidi not to worry.

385
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:25,467
Richard's fine.

386
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,034
Isabelle's fine.

387
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,201
Well, the news
is making it sound

388
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:29,767
like everybody's sick.

389
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,400
People are terrified,

390
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,368
and if normal people
start getting sick...

391
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,734
"Normal people"?

392
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,433
Okay, that
came out wrong,

393
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,467
but you know
what I mean.

394
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,467
And listen, Lily,

395
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:43,567
heidI's not the only one
that's worried about you.

396
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,268
I am, too.

397
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,634
A year and a half ago,

398
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,167
you welcomed me home
with a restraining order.

399
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:53,800
I know.

400
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,667
I panicked when you got back.

401
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,734
Don't think I haven't lost sleep
over what I did.

402
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,201
I just want you
to know now

403
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,800
that I'm there for you.

404
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,101
You, Richard, Isabelle...

405
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,901
You need anything...

406
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,001
just call.

407
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,934
"Quarantine".

408
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,700
That's an evocative word
these days.

409
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
Conjures up images
of secret prisons and...

410
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,134
what's the euphemism
you're using now?

411
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,433
"Coercion tactics"?

412
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,667
Let me ask you something...

413
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,201
you have some doctors
on staff here, right?

414
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,301
Yes.

415
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:26,334
They having any luck

416
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:27,368
getting to the bottom
of this thing?

417
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,467
Not yet.

418
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,667
Then get off
your soapbox.

419
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:30,834
You want an image
to hold on to?

420
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,067
Try this one...
4400s dying in droves.

421
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,500
I think what my partner
means to say

422
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,867
is that our
two organizations

423
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,067
need each other.

424
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,134
We should cooperate.

425
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,533
And how exactly
do we do that?

426
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,134
We want you to issue
a public statement.

427
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:43,067
If the center
counsels the 4400s

428
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,334
to go along
with this order,

429
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:47,001
things will go
much more smoothly.

430
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,167
And if we don't?

431
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,334
Why are we talking
to you, anyway?

432
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,433
Where's Shawn?

433
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,334
Is he all right?

434
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,734
Mr. Farrell
is handling urgent business.

435
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,067
This situation requires
his full attention.

436
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,234
Look, I'll have to
run it by him,

437
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,467
but I don't see a problem
advising any ill 4400s

438
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:04,067
to seek medical care
from NTAC.

439
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,134
Well, that's a start.

440
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:07,301
What about the ones

441
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,034
who aren't
showing symptoms?

442
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:11,034
That issue's going to require
a little more thought.

443
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,834
Great.
You have 12 hours.

444
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,101
What's the point

445
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,067
of painting it over,
anyway?

446
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:24,467
They're just gonna
do it again.

447
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,901
We don't know that.

448
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,700
Look, Sam,

449
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,433
Kyle has been nice enough
to come over here

450
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,734
and help us out,

451
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:34,067
so the least that you can do
is pitch in.

452
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,734
Oh, yes, very good...

453
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:37,934
... Picasso.

454
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,700
I'm going to make sandwiches.

455
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,767
Okay, seriously,
what's your story?

456
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:48,800
Why are you helping us,

457
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,101
Kyle whoever-you-are?

458
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,334
My last name's Bingham...

459
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:55,368
... and I don't know.

460
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,467
I was just walking by here
yesterday.

461
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,467
Alison looked
like she could use a hand...

462
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,767
Yeah, well,

463
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,201
if you were thinking
about hooking up with her,

464
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,734
forget it.

465
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:04,934
Alison's gonna
marry my brother

466
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,834
as soon as he gets out of jail.

467
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,034
I know. I know.
She told me.

468
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,034
You should listen to her.

469
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,967
Roy didn't kill
this Collier guy.

470
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,533
I believe you.

471
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,967
Yeah?

472
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,467
Well, you're the only one.

473
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:21,800
You and me.

474
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,567
When he does get out,

475
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,400
I don't think
you want him coming home

476
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,067
and seeing "murderer"
written all over his door,

477
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,301
do you?

478
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,067
Richard...

479
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,767
you ready for a promotion?

480
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,767
Me?

481
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,134
A promotion to what?

482
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,867
I'm trying here, man.

483
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,301
I want to lead us all
through this,

484
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,667
but I can't do that right now.

485
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,567
Thank you.

486
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,634
I know I'm a 4400,
but after that,

487
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,500
my qualifications
are a little thin.

488
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,467
They didn't even give me
an ability.

489
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,400
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure how long

490
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,001
Lily and I were planning
on staying here.

491
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,934
So it's not a perfect fit,

492
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,500
but you're articulate,

493
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,368
and a war hero,

494
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,433
and you have
the gravitas

495
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,567
of a leader.

496
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,934
I think
it's a good idea.

497
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:23,134
I haven't given an order
since 1951.

498
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,134
I was in high school
a year and a half ago.

499
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,533
I managed.

500
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,634
So will you.

501
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,368
But it's only temporary, right?

502
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:35,700
As soon as you get better,

503
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,034
I can go right back
to being camera-shy.

504
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,834
Yeah.

505
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,533
Temporary.

506
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:46,533
What are you going to do?

507
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:52,167
What I have to.

508
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,634
Desease has everyone frightened,

509
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,500
and that's understandable.

510
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,101
But no one's more frightened
than we are.

511
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:58,834
And that's because,

512
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:03,001
in spite of all the rumors
that you hear flying around,

513
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:05,967
only 4400s
are getting sick,

514
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,301
and now the government

515
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:09,800
wants us to head
into quarantine.

516
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,034
They say cooperation
is essential.

517
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:15,667
Well, here's
the best we can do...

518
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,533
If you're sick,

519
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:21,268
the responsible thing
is to report to NTAC.

520
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,533
Our best wishes
and prayers

521
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,101
go with you.

522
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,167
But if you're well,

523
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:28,934
if you're showing no symptoms,

524
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:33,567
we ask you to consider this...

525
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:37,234
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,

526
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,834
but walking out...

527
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
that might be
considerably more difficult.

528
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:49,167
Thank you.

529
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,700
Don't they get it?

530
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,500
We're trying
to help these people.

531
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,767
All they hear is
"quarantine", Dennis.

532
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,234
You can't blame them
for being scared.

533
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,634
Maybe if we give them
another day,

534
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:00,500
half a day, even.

535
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,734
Does it look to you

536
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:02,867
like they haven't
made up their minds?

537
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:06,734
We tried
being reasonable.

538
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,134
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.

539
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,901
Hi.

540
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,967
Hey.

541
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,433
I know who you are.

542
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,001
You're the one
who fixes people.

543
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:26,301
Yeah. Shawn.

544
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,834
How come you're in here?

545
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,967
Why don't you just
make yourself better?

546
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,067
I wish I could.

547
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,967
They're broken.

548
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,967
Kind of like
the rest of me.

549
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,800
I used to see things.

550
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,067
Stuff that was
gonna happen.

551
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:45,334
That's gone now too.

552
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:48,567
It's funny, huh?

553
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,634
When I found out
I was different,

554
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:53,634
all I wanted to do
was be normal again.

555
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,034
Me too.

556
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,400
But you
get used to it.

557
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,368
Now that it's gone,
I feel like I'm missing an arm.

558
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:03,101
It'll come back.

559
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,134
Once we get better.

560
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,301
Any idea when that's gonna be?

561
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:09,334
Not exactly,

562
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,834
but my mom told me
everything's gonna be fine,

563
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,800
and I believe what she says.

564
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,167
That must be a nice feeling.

565
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,268
Don't you have someone
to believe in?

566
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,167
I used to...

567
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,567
but now I guess

568
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,934
I'm just going to have to
believe in you.

569
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,268
You're the one
I attacked

570
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:49,734
at the hospital.

571
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:50,867
We didn't think
you'd remember us.

572
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:51,834
I remember.

573
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,700
I was...

574
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,967
very sick back then.

575
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,234
I'm better now.

576
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:02,201
Diana, you wanted
to see me?

577
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,700
Kevin Burkhoff.

578
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,867
I've been doing
neurological research

579
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:06,834
on the 4400.

580
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,467
Oh, I've heard of you.

581
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,767
Everybody here has.

582
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,067
Here.

583
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,634
There's some very
interesting data

584
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:14,634
on the blood work
I've been doing.

585
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:15,700
Have a look.

586
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,901
See if it helps you figure out

587
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,001
what's going on
with this disease.

588
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,400
Well, thank you.

589
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,067
I'll comb
through this.

590
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,467
Good,

591
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:25,433
and I can expect
to see your work... when?

592
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,901
I showed you mine.

593
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,867
You show me yours.

594
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:34,034
That is the way
it works,

595
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,700
isn't it?

596
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,867
Usually,

597
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:39,067
but the research we do here
is classified.

598
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,167
Max...

599
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,201
Max, if ever
there was a time

600
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,368
to bend the rules
a little,

601
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,500
I think
it might be now.

602
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,834
Well, it's not
a wink-and-a-nudge situation.

603
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,634
I give over
classified documents,

604
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:48,901
I go to jail.

605
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,834
Yeah, and if you don't,
people might die.

606
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,600
Are you implying we're not doing
everything we can?

607
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,700
We've got dozens
of doctors

608
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,201
working
around the clock

609
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,700
to try to solve this thing.

610
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,334
Now, I will look over
everything that you've given me.

611
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,667
If I find anything
that can help you,

612
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,034
I'll give you a call.

613
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,368
That's the best I can do.

614
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:11,533
I am so sorry...

615
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm not interested
in apologies.

616
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,067
I want to see
that information.

617
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,567
Or is NTAC not interested
in curing these people?

618
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,634
I know you guys
are kind of cavalier

619
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:24,934
about putting your own careers
on the line,

620
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,567
but do me a favor...

621
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,567
stop asking me
to join in the fun, okay?

622
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,767
I like what I do here.

623
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,167
They're medical records, Marco.

624
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,433
Not national secrets.

625
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,667
Wrong.

626
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,234
They're medical records
and national secrets.

627
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,767
That is why they keep them
in a database

628
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,368
you need six passwords
to get into,

629
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,734
and that's why sport-o
wouldn't give them to you.

630
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:44,167
Let's just leave Max
out of this.

631
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,533
He's under a lot of pressure.

632
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,901
And he wants
to keep his job.

633
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,167
I don't blame him.

634
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,867
You know, I just
opened a 401(k).

635
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,034
Yeah, pretty sure

636
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,433
the government stops
matching donations

637
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:53,800
once you commit treason.

638
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,934
The government

639
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,134
just turned down
an offer of help

640
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,301
from Kevin Burkhoff.

641
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,567
Remember him?

642
00:27:58,567 --> 00:27:59,667
Yeah, the future
built a giant tower

643
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,800
to wake him up.

644
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,334
I guess they think he matters.

645
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,700
If anyone in Washington
read my report,

646
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,500
they know
he matters, too.

647
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,467
You know, it's weird.

648
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:08,800
Hundreds of people are sick.

649
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,834
You'd think they'd want
any help they could get.

650
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,334
Well, they're going to
get his help.

651
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,734
Yeah, whether they want it
or not.

652
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:18,834
Gotcha.

653
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,201
Yeah.

654
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,167
Is Isabelle ready
to go for her walk?

655
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,567
Okay, let's go have some fun.

656
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:44,001
How long has she
been in there?

657
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,201
I don't know.
Five minutes.

658
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,667
I came and got you
as soon as I saw.

659
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,567
What are they
doing to her in there?

660
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,334
Step back.

661
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,667
Would you excuse us, please?

662
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,533
How long has this been going on?

663
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,867
Richard, your daughter

664
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,334
has never been
in any kind of danger.

665
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,533
He asked you a question.

666
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,001
Jordan was going to
initiate these tests

667
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,734
as soon as he convinced you
to come back into the fold...

668
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,967
What tests?
What have you been doing to her?

669
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,467
All we're doing
is what you should have done

670
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,867
a long time ago...

671
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,533
trying to figure out who,
or what, Isabelle is.

672
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:21,600
She's our daughter.

673
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,867
That's all you
or anyone else

674
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:25,567
your daughter
is the Rosetta Stone

675
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:26,934
for understanding
what happened to the 4400,

676
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,867
yet you both cling
to the illusion

677
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,467
that she's going to go
to preschool,

678
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:31,967
first communion, the prom...

679
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,234
She's not communal property.

680
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,201
We're her parents. We decide.

681
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:36,101
Parents?

682
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:38,500
You are the stewards
of the future,

683
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,667
and forgive me for saying so,

684
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,400
but you're doing
a piss-poor job of it.

685
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,533
We have given up
everything we have

686
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,201
for that child,

687
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,334
any chance we had
of living a normal life...

688
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,067
To protect her
from people like you.

689
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,034
Look, Richard, this is no time
for this conversation.

690
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:51,368
In two hours,

691
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:52,667
the government is
coming through the front door.

692
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,167
Yeah, well,
you won't use my daughter

693
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,734
as some kind of weapon
against them.

694
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,433
That was never my intention.

695
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:58,767
You'll never have the chance.
We're leaving right now.

696
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,734
That's your choice,
but if you do,

697
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,034
if we splinter now,

698
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,034
they will round up the 4400 one by one,
and this movement is over.

699
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:25,768
Hey.

700
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:27,967
Hey, Thomas.

701
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,034
Hey.

702
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,800
They said
you've been asking for me.

703
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,100
Shouldn't you be in bed?

704
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,900
They'll take me back
soon enough.

705
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,567
I wanted to see you.

706
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:42,034
How do you feel, baby?

707
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,933
They can't get the fever down,
but...

708
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:50,100
the worst part is my head.

709
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,900
Everything's so mixed up.

710
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,768
This illness,

711
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:57,234
it affects people's abilities.

712
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:59,434
Maia can't see things, and...

713
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,501
and Shawn, Shawn can't heal,

714
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:02,734
and for you, honey,

715
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:04,701
I think the boundaries

716
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,734
between this world
and the one you created

717
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,967
are breaking down.

718
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,534
It's so confusing.

719
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,967
I don't know
what's real anymore.

720
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,833
I know it's scary.

721
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,933
You just have to hang on.

722
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:20,367
They'll get this fixed.

723
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,434
What if they're too late?

724
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:25,833
What if they can
make my body right,

725
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,200
but not my mind?

726
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
I don't want to live like that,
Thomas.

727
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,100
You're not
going to have to.

728
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,234
You're going to get better.

729
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:33,200
You have to believe that, Alana.

730
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,367
Thomas...

731
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,501
Yeah?

732
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,833
I love you so much.

733
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,734
I wanted us to get married
for real,

734
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,401
in this world.

735
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,800
That's all I wanted to tell you,
before...

736
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:06,100
before my mind goes...

737
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,234
because...

738
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,434
I don't know
if it will be good again.

739
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,701
So you're sure I can't get you
a beer or something?

740
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:18,734
No, no,
that's okay.

741
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:20,200
I don't drink.

742
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,833
Okay.

743
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,167
You know, this isn't
really necessary.

744
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,134
I just did
a couple of chores.

745
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:30,167
Maybe it's not a big deal
to you,

746
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,900
but I just haven't seen
a friendly face

747
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,234
in a while,

748
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:37,200
not since... Roy went away.

749
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:43,334
No offense, but, um...

750
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,334
the papers make him sound

751
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,467
like the second coming
of Lee Harvey Oswald.

752
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,234
Yeah.

753
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,200
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it
"fair and balanced coverage".

754
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,301
But he did have
some monstrous gun collection,

755
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,301
right?

756
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,267
Look, I'm not saying

757
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,867
that he was a candidate
for higher office,

758
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,734
and...

759
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:02,967
he sure as hell

760
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,167
wasn't the world's
greatest boyfriend.

761
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,701
But taking out
two NTAC agents

762
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:06,800
and shooting Jordan Collier?

763
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,034
Come on.

764
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,601
Yeah.

765
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,234
Yeah.

766
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,734
Eat up.

767
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:16,167
Sam!

768
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:18,167
Sam, come on!
We're starting.

769
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,701
I'll be right there.

770
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:39,967
Hey.

771
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,401
Okay.

772
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,701
Are you Marco?

773
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,000
Thanks.

774
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,601
Don't thank me.
Hire me.

775
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,301
I'm gonna need a job.

776
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,067
Where have you been?

777
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,601
Talking to Matthew.

778
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,833
Lily...

779
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,034
he's got an idea

780
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,034
on how to handle
this roundup.

781
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,267
I think it might work.

782
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,234
I'm sure
he's full of clever ideas.

783
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:08,833
We will deal with
what Matthew did,

784
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,467
but not now.

785
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,768
The government is about
to declare martial law

786
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:13,933
we don't have time to squabble.

787
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,367
All I want to hear

788
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,167
is that you're done
with this place for good.

789
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,434
It's not that simple.

790
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:19,933
We can't just go off
and hide in the woods somewhere.

791
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,267
It's not going to work
this time.

792
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,167
The center betrayed us.
They betrayed our daughter.

793
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,367
And they learned
about her,

794
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,567
more than we did
in almost a year.

795
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,601
Lily, stop.

796
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,933
Did you know

797
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,434
Isabelle has connections

798
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:33,668
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain

799
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,567
that have never been
seen before?

800
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:39,334
Even if that's true, Richard...

801
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,634
it's not that they studied her.

802
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:43,334
It's how they did it.

803
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,701
Do you trust
the government?

804
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,401
Because
if we go into quarantine,

805
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,967
Isabelle will end up
right here,

806
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,401
or with them,

807
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:52,034
and if they find out
what she can do...

808
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:54,734
we'll lose her forever.

809
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
That's it.

810
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,167
That's the deadline.

811
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,601
Where do we start?

812
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,367
I want everybody
to holster their pistols.

813
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,534
My goal is to do this quietly,
peacefully,

814
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,301
and without incident.

815
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,134
What if they want
an incident?

816
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:05,367
Then we'll give them one.

817
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,367
Is everybody ready?

818
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,800
Affirmative, sir.

819
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,301
We're in position.

820
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,867
Let's go.

821
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,467
Moving in now.

822
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,668
Copy that.
They're on the move.

823
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,534
They're
spreading out

824
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:27,000
and letting us
through.

825
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,833
Welcome to the center.

826
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,234
Did you come for the tour?

827
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:50,900
You know damn well
why we're here.

828
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Out hunting, I'd guess.

829
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,334
Well, I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

830
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,501
You are welcome to look around,

831
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:00,501
but there are no 4400 here.

832
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,200
I have no idea

833
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,467
where they went.

834
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:16,567
You had 120 4400s
taking shelter at your center.

835
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,267
That sounds about right.

836
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,601
I don't have an exact figure.

837
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:20,901
You just came
downstairs,

838
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:21,934
and they were gone?

839
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:22,934
Until 7:00 this evening,

840
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:24,001
they were free citizens.

841
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,100
I had no reason

842
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,133
to track
their movements,

843
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,467
and since I've broken no laws,

844
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,701
unless you want to talk about
lifting this quarantine order,

845
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,034
we have nothing left to discuss.

846
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:35,934
We'll talk again.

847
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:39,934
I suspect your job
is going to get rather ugly

848
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,001
from here on out,

849
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,901
kicking in doors
and such.

850
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:45,400
If I worked at NTAC,

851
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,233
I might spend a little less time
trying to find missing 4400s,

852
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,068
and a little more
trying to cure the ones I had.

853
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,701
So tell me,
have we got a list?

854
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:57,801
Yeah,

855
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,133
all the sick ones we know of are in.

856
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,233
As for the rest,
we had about 75% compliance.

857
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,567
Nationwide,

858
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,534
there's about 520 4400s
unaccounted for.

859
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,934
Well, that's not a few holdouts.

860
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,100
That's an insurgency.

861
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,300
So this is it, huh?

862
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,367
Us against them.

863
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,701
You know, it feels
kind of like the war

864
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,200
Jordan Collier always predicted.

865
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,300
Predicted or provoked?

866
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,667
We declared martial law on them.

867
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,634
We had no option.

868
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,734
I'm going to pursue

869
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,167
a policy of non-aggression

870
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:26,667
as long as I can,

871
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,667
but if it comes down
to a choice

872
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,567
between the safety
of the American people

873
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,233
and the welfare
of the 4400...

874
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,100
Tom...

875
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:36,934
... that's no choice at all.

876
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,534
Collier left behind
37 safe houses

877
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:42,968
throughout the country.

878
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:46,434
We liquidated the center's
emergency slush fund

879
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,867
should last for awhile.

880
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,034
Any 4400

881
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,367
who contacts the center
for help

882
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,901
will be given
an email address.

883
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:54,500
If we're satisfied
they're legitimate,

884
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,968
they'll be told
where to go.

885
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:58,267
Our goal is to get
every 4400 who wants shelter

886
00:38:58,267 --> 00:38:59,934
to safety.

887
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,500
And then what?

888
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,367
Matthew will try

889
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,834
to continue
to end this peacefully,

890
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,534
but if we have to
protect our own...

891
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,734
... we'll be ready.

892
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,001
Excuse me.

893
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,667
Excuse me.
Sorry.

894
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,001
Lily...

895
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,034
You make a good speech,

896
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,634
but this isn't Korea,

897
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:27,934
and those
aren't soldiers...

898
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,233
And your daughter

899
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,701
could get caught
in the crossfire.

900
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,100
You don't think
I'm worried about her?

901
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,233
And you too?

902
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:37,500
Lily, I'm not looking
for a fight,

903
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,567
but right now,
we don't have another option.

904
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,968
Hey. Sam said he liked comics...

905
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:54,034
you son of a bitch!

906
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,801
You lied to me.

907
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,133
What?

908
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,400
Wait a minute.
It wasn't like that.

909
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,534
Oh, really,
"Kyle Bingham"?

910
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,534
Your last name is Baldwin,

911
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,434
and your dad works
for NTAC.

912
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,801
So, what are you?
His little spy? Huh?

913
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,367
Did you think you were going to
sleep with me?

914
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,167
I was going to tell you
all about Roy?

915
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,100
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.

916
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,534
I know that.

917
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:14,467
I was just trying to help you.

918
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,467
Why?

919
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:20,233
You come off like you're
this really great guy,

920
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,767
and all you were trying to do
was use me.

921
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,934
You're a lying prick.

922
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:35,434
Okay.

923
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,467
Okay.

924
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,934
This thing that's
killing them,

925
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,601
it's not a disease.

926
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,267
It's a side-effect.

927
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,500
Dr. Burkhoff,
just calm down.

928
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,667
What are you
talking about?

929
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,801
A side-effect of what?

930
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:48,001
I don't know exactly,

931
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,801
but I do know this...

932
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:51,367
there's a synthetic substance

933
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,400
present in the blood
of every 4400,

934
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,601
all the ones I tested,

935
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:57,434
every medical report
you gave me,

936
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,334
sick ones, well ones,

937
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,667
doesn't matter.
They all have it.

938
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,934
They even gave it a name.

939
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:05,601
They call it
"promicin inhibitor".

940
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,001
Promicin?
What's promicin?

941
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,434
I have no idea,

942
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:09,534
and I don't know why anyone

943
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,701
would want to inhibit it,
either.

944
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,068
But whatever it is,

945
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,334
it's gathering
in their lymph nodes,

946
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:15,534
compromising
their immune systems...

947
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:17,100
it's what's making them sick.

948
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,267
But NTAC's been
studying the 4400

949
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,867
ever since
they got back.

950
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,200
- They should have known about this.
- They do know.

951
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,968
It's all in here. They know.

952
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:24,467
So why haven't they
told anyone?

953
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:26,400
That's a very good question.

954
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,901
When you find out,

955
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,267
why don't you tell me?

956
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,834
Are you sure
you want to do this?

957
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:52,400
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.

958
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,300
"P.I. dosage"...

959
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,034
it's on memos,
in every 4400 medical report.

960
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,634
It's on the fifth page
of every report.

961
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,734
That's what Hudson
had crossed out

962
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:05,133
when I went to see Maia.

963
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:07,934
"P.I."

964
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,467
"Promicin inhibitor".

965
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,034
Alana was getting it too,
and Shawn.

966
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:13,601
Everyone was getting it.

967
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,901
Every time
they came to NTAC medical.

968
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,901
Every checkup.

969
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,834
We did it to them, Tom.

970
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:22,001
We made them sick.
