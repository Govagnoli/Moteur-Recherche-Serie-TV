1
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,270
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

2
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,880
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,240
I'm not your little brother
anymore.

4
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,270
Then stop acting
like a two-year-old.

5
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,980
You're my brother.
She's your girlfriend.

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,100
It's all good.

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,760
You goddamn freak!

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,070
Danny, stop it!
Stop blaming me for Nikki!

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,830
Diana Skouris,

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,770
your adoption of Maia Rutledge
is hereby complete.

11
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,730
He's gonna die.

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,970
I saw it. He's gonna die.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,470
Jordan Collier?

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,910
Someone's going to kill him.

15
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,280
No!

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,800
No!

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,160
His body,
it's not there!

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,130
This is
your new house?

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,200
It's yours too.

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,100
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,190
Only one thing
missing--

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,520
Mom.

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,890
We really tried to make it work.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,940
How was your first day
of college?

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,190
I didn't have one.

26
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,600
Nobody paid my tuition.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm sorry, Kyle.
I must have forgot.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,970
You've been talking
about this for months.

29
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,080
How could you forget?

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,310
You spent three years
in a coma.

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,260
You have no business
drinking anything!

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,830
You told me everything
that happened that night, right?

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,130
Yeah.

34
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,310
Any coffee left?

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,600
Help yourself.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,750
Couldn't find a clean t-shirt?

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,830
This is what I wear
to school.

38
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,860
I like it.
You're looking sharp.

39
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,120
Thanks.

40
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,770
So...

41
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,890
How you doing, dad?

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,500
Good.

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,900
Fine. Why?

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,290
No reason.
Just, uh...

45
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,060
... you know, good luck.
Okay?

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,410
I'll be thinking
about you.

47
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll call you.
See how it goes.

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,820
Okay?

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,250
See you.

50
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,820
Hey,
there he is!

51
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,860
What's all this?

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,420
Welcome back.

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,220
The prodigal son returns.

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,110
Returns from where?

55
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,120
Get your gear on.
We got to roll.

56
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,030
Tom, I am so glad
to see you.

57
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,590
Yeah, you and everyone else.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,660
As soon as we take
Doherty down,

59
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,960
we're going to
pop the champagne.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,950
Doherty?
Who's Doherty?

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,100
Diana, stop.
Fill me in here.

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,860
Who's Doherty?

63
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,420
Does he have something
to do with Collier's murder?

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,210
What, governor Collier?

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,890
What are you talking about?
He's not dead.

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,790
This was
Garrity's idea, right?

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,570
Got to admit,
it's creative,

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,310
but "screw with
Tom Baldwin day" is over.

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,300
Hey, listen, Tom,
don't do this.

70
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,900
The doctors gave you
a clean bill of health.

71
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,120
Doctors?
What doctors?

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,470
Where is everybody headed?

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,170
And what the hell is going on
around here today?

74
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,680
I think you should
probably just stay here.

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,010
We'll talk
when I get back.

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,900
Diana, just--

77
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,230
So, this guy, Doherty,
is he a 4400?

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,450
What's a 4400?

79
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
Please, stop this.

80
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,130
Four thousand, four hundred
missing people...

81
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,680
... the future sent them back
in a ball of light.

82
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,810
Any of this
sound familiar?

83
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,300
Diana,
I'm not laughing,

84
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,210
so whatever game
you're playing,

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,500
stop it, and stop it right now.

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,780
Tom, whatever
you've been through

87
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,770
in the past few months,

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,950
I can't even
imagine it,

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,580
and everyone here is pulling
for your recovery,

90
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,420
but you've got to
listen to yourself.

91
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,870
You sound delusional.

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,640
The future?

93
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,310
I mean, I've never
heard of the 4400,

94
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,110
and I can promise you

95
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,460
that nobody ever came back
in a ball of light.

96
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,570
Tell me one thing.

97
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,990
According to you,

98
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,870
what have we been doing
for the last year?

99
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,110
You're serious.

100
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,780
Humor me.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,150
It's your case,
Tom.

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,630
Dirty bombs,
remember?

103
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,550
You went undercover

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,550
and infiltrated
an Aum Shinrikyo terror cell.

105
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,210
None of this means anything
to you, does it?

106
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,200
Of course not.
Why should it?

107
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,890
Well, your cover
was compromised.

108
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,660
They held you
for three weeks.

109
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,270
Sleep deprivation,
torture--

110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,680
They'd have killed you
if you didn't escape.

111
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,680
So how does Doherty
fit in?

112
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,950
Aum Shinrikyo's been planning
an attack on the U.S.

113
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,630
since they've been sneaking
radioactive material

114
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,590
into the country
in museum pouches.

115
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,540
Doherty's the curator.

116
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,140
He's been in bed with them
all along.

117
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,270
Tom, he sold you out.

118
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,360
You spent three weeks in hell
'cause of this guy.

119
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,470
You've been
on medical leave

120
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,720
for two months,
recovering, and...

121
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,150
... obviously,
it should have been three.

122
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,170
Jordan Collier
museum of contemporary art.

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,790
Tell me you recognize
this place.

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,670
I recognize it, all right...

125
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,670
Well, that's a start.

126
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,650
But everything's different.

127
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,270
This is the spot.

128
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,210
This is where Collier got shot.

129
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,060
Do me a favor.

130
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,960
Don't let anyone else
hear you say that.

131
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,020
Tom?

132
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,110
Tom!

133
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,410
Is he in there?

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,270
Yeah, I think so.

135
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,930
You want to do
the honors?

136
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,650
Did you find
anything?

137
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,890
Somebody's been messing
with my computer.

138
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,070
All my case files are gone.

139
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,130
I type "4400"
into a search engine, and...

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,020
Nothing.

141
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,830
How could there not be
a single mention of them?

142
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,620
I don't know.
Maybe because...

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
... none of it ever happened?

144
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,700
Something has obviously changed.

145
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,550
This is not the same world
that it was yesterday.

146
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,990
But I'm still Tom Baldwin,

147
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,490
and you're still Diana Skouris,

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,630
which means that the people
they took,

149
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,280
they exist too, right?

150
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
Gary Navarro.

151
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,670
We worked with him last month.

152
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,400
He could read thoughts.

153
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,390
Read thoughts?

154
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,340
Tom, come on.

155
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,780
Played for Cincinnati?

156
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,930
Lifetime. 317 batting average.

157
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,750
Isn't it 300?

158
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,280
When you know what
the pitcher's thinking?

159
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,360
But... he was never taken!

160
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,000
Richard Tyler.

161
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,330
What did he have?
Heat vision?

162
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
No, some of them
can do... things.

163
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,670
Some of them...
some of them can't.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,220
He's dead.

165
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,740
He's plane was shot down
over Sinanju in 1951.

166
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,030
So that's two down.

167
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,440
Are we going to go through
all 4,398 more?

168
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,530
I'll take my boots off
if we are.

169
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,790
Diana, your daughter.
Your daughter!

170
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,250
Your daughter, Maia Rutledge.

171
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,350
You adopted her,
right?

172
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,020
She's one of them.

173
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,700
Tom, don't include me
in your fantasy life.

174
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,350
You know I don't have
a daughter.

175
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,980
Yes! Right here.

176
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,830
It's a Seattle address
for Maia Rutledge.

177
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,860
It's right here.

178
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,560
Right here.

179
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,610
Oh, thank god.
Maia, it's me.

180
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,080
It's me, Tom.
Tom Baldwin.

181
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,570
I don't know you.

182
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,330
Don't say that, please.

183
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
- Don't say that.
- My name is Ella.

184
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,340
Maia's my grandmother.

185
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,930
Ella, who is it?

186
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,370
Oh, here she is.

187
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,390
This is my grandmother.

188
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,510
You're Maia Rutledge?

189
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,500
Can I help you?

190
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,670
Didn't expect you home
so soon.

191
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,250
How'd you do out there
today?

192
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,260
Glad to see you, too.
Everything okay?

193
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,750
Just tell me one thing.

194
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,310
You were in a coma
for three years, right?

195
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,610
If I have one more of these,

196
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,730
I could wind up in a coma
right now.

197
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,010
Come on.

198
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,860
I want to show you
something.

199
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,920
Come on.

200
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Uncle Tommy.
We can eat, finally.

201
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,860
How you doing?

202
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,340
Shawn, what are you doing here?

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,730
Well, the band
got delayed in Berlin.

204
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,360
We're not going to start
recording until tuesday.

205
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,330
Besides, I couldn't miss
your big day.

206
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,370
Or Danny's.
Come on, tell them.

207
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,110
Believe it or not,
she actually said "yes".

208
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,770
We're getting married.

209
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,540
Look, he bought me this!

210
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,090
Oh, I told him
I didn't even want one

211
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
till he was
out of law school.

212
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,160
I like that.
You like that?

213
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,740
Are you all right, Mr. Baldwin?

214
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,060
Dad, do you
need to sit?

215
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,660
It can't be a joke.

216
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,180
There's too many people
in on it.

217
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,050
Sit down.

218
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,670
So then either
I'm cracking up,

219
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,720
or the world is.

220
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,670
Dad, the doctors said
you were okay.

221
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,050
I don't want to scare you,
but something's wrong.

222
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,130
I don't recognize
this place.

223
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,150
I mean,
I sort of do,

224
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,470
but everything's
been tweaked.

225
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,000
Dad, dad,
look at me.

226
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,110
You're not making
any sense.

227
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,790
You know that,
right?

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,820
You guys started
without us?

229
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,280
Just as well.
Airport traffic was insane.

230
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,280
Hi, guys, Nikki.

231
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,870
Can you believe my kid,
my youngest kid,

232
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,640
is getting married?

233
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,690
When the hell
did we get so old?

234
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,140
So you're back in the saddle.

235
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,060
How'd it go?

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,430
I don't think it went too good.

237
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,220
Really? I was just
telling your wife

238
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,140
that you were going
to be fine.

239
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,410
My wife?

240
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm still married to Linda?

241
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,600
I said wife, not ex-wife.

242
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,270
Alana, over here.
Come here.

243
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,530
I've never seen this woman
before.

244
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,810
I think we need to be alone...

245
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,360
Go upstairs. Talk.

246
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,990
No. I don't know who you are.

247
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,350
Dad, Alana's
your wife.

248
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,690
You've been married to her
for two years.

249
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,830
She lives here, dad.

250
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,650
I don't know what any of you are
talking about, but it's over.

251
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,950
It's over,
it's over.

252
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,570
How'd you find me?

253
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,230
Guys downstairs called.

254
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,700
They said you've been
here four hours.

255
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,330
Yeah.
Sad, isn't it?

256
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,320
The only place
I feel normal

257
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,480
is hiding
in a storage closet.

258
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,620
I guess that's what it must
feel like to be insane--

259
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,350
You're not insane, Tom.

260
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,440
You just need a rest.

261
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,190
Everyone keeps telling me
I was tortured.

262
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,200
Maybe they broke my mind.

263
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,090
You're going to come back
from this, Tom.

264
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,720
It's just going
to take some time.

265
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,240
And I'm going to help you,
I promise.

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,260
So tell me again
about this ball of light.

267
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,190
When did you first come
to believe it happened?

268
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,200
August 14th, 2004.

269
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,020
That's when they came back.

270
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,610
Maybe not in the world you know,
but it happened in mine--

271
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,500
Get her out of here!

272
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,940
No one's plotting against you, Tom.

273
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,090
I did what I had to do
to get you better.

274
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,940
His wife's here.

275
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,110
She's asking to see him.

276
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,670
I am not married.
I am not married...

277
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,510
Look, lady, I don't
know who you are,

278
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,650
and I don't care
what you have to say.

279
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,830
You have to
play along.

280
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,050
I need you to
get out of here

281
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,750
so we can figure out
what's going on.

282
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,560
What are you talking about?

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,150
None of this is real
to me, either.

284
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,270
I know we're
not married.

285
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,470
I've never seen you
before yesterday.

286
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,530
The things you talk about--

287
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,930
The ball of light,

288
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,420
the 4400...

289
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,710
You know about the 4400?

290
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,460
Know of them?

291
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,740
I am a 4400.

292
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,410
I know my behavior
was totally out of line,

293
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,710
and I want to apologize.

294
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,330
I got fixated
on getting back to work,

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,700
and obviously,
the strain, the, uh...

296
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,500
The excitement,
it was just too much.

297
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,290
We're going to extend
your medical leave

298
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,740
by another six weeks,

299
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,990
and then we will see about
getting you back out in the field.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll circle the date.

301
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,290
Okay.

302
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,260
So I can go now?

303
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,400
Your psych hold is over.

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,520
Great.

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,340
I'm...
I'm sorry for the ambush.

306
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,320
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

307
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,560
I'll see you
in six weeks.

308
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,100
Tom Baldwin.

309
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,000
Alana Mareva.

310
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,680
So I guess we're married.

311
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,830
So I'm told.

312
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,850
Let's go home.

313
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,610
See if we can figure out
what the hell is going on.

314
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,140
- Where do you think we are?
- I don't know.

315
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Maybe we crossed into
some kind of...

316
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,370
... alternate reality,
a different dimension.

317
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,180
I know.
It sounds insane.

318
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
It sounds impossible.

319
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,320
Impossible
isn't what it used to be, and...

320
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,910
... you're a 4400.

321
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,380
You think I'm doing this?

322
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,520
It's an explanation.

323
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,640
A pretty simple one, actually.

324
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,750
Simple, but wrong.

325
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,410
If I were making this up,

326
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,430
why would I put myself
in the middle of your life?

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm sorry. This can't
be easy for you, either.

328
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,750
Yeah, easy.

329
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,100
My friends, my family,
everything I know is gone.

330
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,020
Erased.

331
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,690
I'm trapped
in the middle of your life.

332
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,400
How do I know it's not you
making this up?

333
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,830
Erased?

334
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,050
What do you mean,
your life has been erased?

335
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,940
I used to own
this place.

336
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,230
I bought it
four years ago,

337
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,350
a few months
before I was abducted.

338
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,250
And none of this
looks familiar now?

339
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,270
I was my own buyer.

340
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,310
I flew all over the world

341
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,290
And bought
mostly sculptures,

342
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,350
primitive art.

343
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,580
Excuse me.

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,300
Can I talk to the owner?

345
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,270
He's not here today.

346
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,570
Any idea
when he opened this place?

347
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,740
A long time ago.

348
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,600
15, maybe 20 years.

349
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,910
It only gets worse.

350
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,990
You're sure
that's the right bench?

351
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,940
I used to come here
every week.

352
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,600
Believe me, I know which bench
I dedicated

353
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,930
to my husband and son.

354
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,520
So back in the world
we came from...

355
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,340
They died.

356
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,480
In a car accident.

357
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,670
Shortly before I was abducted.

358
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,780
There's a way back home.

359
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,650
We're going to find it.

360
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,040
If you need anything,
I'll be right down the hall.

361
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,990
What, you're sleeping
in the guest room?

362
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,310
Under the circumstances,
yeah.

363
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,130
I don't think
that's a good idea.

364
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,880
We have to play along.

365
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,790
We're supposed to be
happily married.

366
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,080
We don't want your son
asking questions.

367
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay, I'll, uh, find a spot
on the floor.

368
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,900
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable in the bathtub?

369
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm kidding, Thomas.

370
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,330
It's a big bed.

371
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm sure we can keep
in our own sectors.

372
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,190
Do you think
we're the only ones?

373
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,400
Are there other people out there
like us,

374
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,020
wondering how
they got here?

375
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,550
If there are, we'll find them.

376
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,670
We'll take out
classified ads

377
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,920
in every major city paper.

378
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,510
"Remember the 4400s?
Drop us a line".

379
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,930
We'll check out every returnee
we can find.

380
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,520
Tell me
something about yourself.

381
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,480
What do you want to know?

382
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,470
Favorite records?

383
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,980
Where I went to school?

384
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,170
How about your husband and son?
What were they like?

385
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,100
Paul was a radiologist.

386
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,190
We met while he was on vacation
in Tahiti.

387
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,830
That's where I'm from.

388
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,960
Linda and I thought about
going there for our honeymoon.

389
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,490
We picked Haiti instead.

390
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,900
Two years later,

391
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,270
after we were married,
we had Billy.

392
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,840
He was so quiet and sweet.

393
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,120
This is unbelievable.

394
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,650
I think this was
the interview

395
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,170
where I said I wanted
to go into medicine

396
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,720
because nurses
are sexy.

397
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,330
You did not
say that.

398
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,200
I got into medical school!

399
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,380
Stanford, baby!

400
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,350
Congratulations.

401
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,370
The real Kyle used to talk
about being a doctor all the time.

402
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
Right up
until he went into a coma.

403
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,520
"The real Kyle..."

404
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,130
I know
that's not exactly your son,

405
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,230
but he seems pretty real to me.

406
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,720
He gets happy
when he hears good news,

407
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,920
cranky when he gets tired,

408
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,920
and he forgets to put
the toilet seat down.

409
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,060
He's a good kid.

410
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,920
He was raised well.

411
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,770
I got a response
from our ad in the post.

412
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,830
Philip Kendrick.

413
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,090
He wants to meet us.

414
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,350
Philip Kendrick?

415
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,510
Tom Baldwin.

416
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,640
What do you remember
about the 4400?

417
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,800
It was the best sedan
Citroen ever put out.

418
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,150
Hydraulics came standard
on every model--

419
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,350
You're talking
about a car?

420
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah!
Mine's parked outside.

421
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,020
Where's yours?

422
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,720
It's in the shop.
I'll send you a picture.

423
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,490
Uh, Tom,
I don't have your address.

424
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,350
Well, that was
productive.

425
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,370
Yeah...

426
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,340
Should we check out
the Blake exhibit

427
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,660
while we're here?

428
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,820
Uh... yeah,
why don't you...

429
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,400
Why don't you
go ahead?

430
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,960
I'll catch up with you
in a minute.

431
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,690
No, it's...

432
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,700
Thomas...

433
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,140
Thomas...

434
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,630
Thomas?

435
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,550
Thomas!

436
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,270
It's gone.

437
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,900
What's gone?

438
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,250
That door. It was back.

439
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,220
And I opened it this time.

440
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,050
It was some kind of
operating room, I think.

441
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,190
I didn't see
anything like that.

442
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,610
You were just standing
there like a statue.

443
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,820
That room's the answer.

444
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,220
It has to be.

445
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,520
It's the only thing
that doesn't fit.

446
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,080
It's not part
of this reality.

447
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,450
If it even exists.

448
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,650
You're the only one
who can see it--

449
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,420
I have to get back there.

450
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,340
Hey, partner.

451
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,940
Black, two sugars.

452
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,080
So the guards tell me

453
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,170
That you spent...

454
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,670
Five hours here yesterday,

455
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,250
three the day before that,

456
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,420
and, one saturday,
you logged up 12.

457
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,920
Yeah, so I like art.

458
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,820
It's a nice,
functional door, Tom,

459
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,920
but I wouldn't call it
a work of art.

460
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,710
Now, maybe if it were made
of black obsidian...

461
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,380
I read your psych file.

462
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,170
You planning on having me
locked up again, Diana?

463
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,670
You know, this other reality

464
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,410
that you're anxious
to get back to?

465
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,220
I mean, even if you could
get back to it,

466
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,070
it doesn't sound
that great, Tom.

467
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,600
Back there,
you were divorced.

468
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,380
Here, you have
a beautiful wife.

469
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,640
Back there,
you son, Kyle,

470
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,860
spent four years
in a coma.

471
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,480
Here, he's about to spend
four in medical school.

472
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,960
Back there, your sister's family
is completely dysfunctional,

473
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,770
your nephew is in a cult,

474
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,860
and the future of the world
is in jeopardy.

475
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,370
You make it sound so... bleak.

476
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,840
It's just a...

477
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,020
Just life.

478
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,340
This is life,

479
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,470
and it's a better life for you
and for everyone you care about.

480
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,140
Just accept
what you have.

481
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,370
Because if you don't,

482
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,860
well, you're going to spend
the rest of your life

483
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,400
just sitting in this hallway.

484
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,830
Alana?

485
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,720
What's the matter?

486
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,440
Have you seen
these pictures?

487
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,350
Look at all the things
we've done together.

488
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,880
You know, you'd think
if we're trapped here,

489
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,910
they would give us
these memories.

490
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,060
You know?

491
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,380
Look, we've been to China.

492
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,450
I've wanted to go
my entire life to China.

493
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,750
Look, Alana, I don't know
how long it's going to take

494
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,590
for us to get out of here.

495
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,340
I don't know.

496
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,710
Who says we will?

497
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,130
You keep talking
about that door.

498
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,580
It's been a month already.

499
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,810
What if
it never comes back?

500
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,160
Then we're trapped, okay,
then we're trapped.

501
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,590
I don't...

502
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,940
But if we are,
Alana,

503
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,370
I promise you,
we will make new memories.

504
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,190
Just as good as these.

505
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,530
Better.

506
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh, I believe we could, Thomas.

507
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,270
I like it
when you call me that.

508
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,730
"Thomas".

509
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,970
And this goes up, and then...

510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,870
Ugh, I can never get
these things right.

511
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,300
Let me take a shot.

512
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,680
Come here. Hold still.

513
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,630
You got to remember
to make big loops.

514
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,700
Leave yourself
a little room to work with.

515
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,640
Hands
of a surgeon.

516
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,060
Hands of a resident,
more like.

517
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,570
No, you'll get there.

518
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,320
So how do you like it
over at St. Bede's?

519
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,260
The hours are killer.

520
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,650
Doctors treat me like
a glorified candystriper.

521
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,270
A good night's sleep
is a distant memory.

522
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,880
I love it.

523
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,990
Well, I look
like I belong

524
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,200
on top of a wedding cake.

525
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,690
Hey, you brought this
on yourself.

526
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,290
Some people go to Fiji
for their 10th anniversary.

527
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,960
You two wanted
to renew your vows.

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,940
Yeah, well,
the first time

529
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,510
just felt like
pictures in a book.

530
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,440
This one...

531
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,700
This one is for me and Alana.

532
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,490
Ready to go, champ?

533
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,900
And do you,
Alana Baldwin,

534
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,300
also renew your
commitments to honor, obey,

535
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,920
and love
your husband, Thomas,

536
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,860
till death
do you part?

537
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,630
I do.

538
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,230
Then by the power
vested in me,

539
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,670
I now pronounce you
still man and wife.

540
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,810
Go ahead. You may kiss
your beautiful bride.

541
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm getting in here.

542
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,450
Oh, I love you guys.

543
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,330
So how do you feel,
Mrs. Baldwin?

544
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,710
Married. Finally.

545
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,930
Feels real now, huh?

546
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,900
Well, it felt real
for a long time.

547
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,560
It's hard to believe
we resisted it.

548
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,040
Do you miss it?
Your old life?

549
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,240
I still think about it,

550
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,510
but after
all these years,

551
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,760
that life, that world--

552
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,860
That feels
like the delusion.

553
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,210
I know.
I have to concentrate

554
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,460
to even remember
a life without you.

555
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,980
See, I'm good that way.

556
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,180
Like a cellphone
or TiVo.

557
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,990
Once you've got me,

558
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,480
you can't imagine
not having me.

559
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,150
I love you, Thomas.

560
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,140
It still kills me
when you call me that.

561
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,170
Come here, woman.

562
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,320
You're resigning?

563
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,390
I'm moving on, Tom.

564
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,520
I've been here
11 years.

565
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,480
The private sector beckons.

566
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,800
Dennis Ryland offered me

567
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,460
a partnership
in his consulting firm.

568
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,940
Nice gig.

569
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,370
So you're moving to Virginia?

570
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,750
Three weeks.

571
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,700
Look, D.C. has asked me
to submit a list of names

572
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,310
as potential replacements.

573
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,390
I'm giving them one.

574
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,860
Yours.

575
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,170
Well, I'm-- I'm flattered.
I, uh...

576
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,480
But you might need
a backup or two.

577
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,890
I mean,
somewhere in my personnel file

578
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,950
are measurements
for my straitjacket.

579
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,070
Nah, you were
convalescing

580
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,830
from injuries
received in the line of duty.

581
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,450
Your service in that case
was heroic.

582
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,930
I think you can talk your
way around the fallout.

583
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,140
That is, if you want the job.

584
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,090
A chance to sit
in the big chair?

585
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,470
I want it, all right.

586
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,090
Good.

587
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,110
Then practice saying,
"nice to meet you too, senator".

588
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,140
Best way to prep for
your confirmation hearing.

589
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,440
I'll spring
for a new suit.

590
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,220
My last act
as head of this division

591
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,050
will be to make sure
that this happens.

592
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,330
Congratulations, Tom.

593
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,730
You've earned this.

594
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,370
Thank you.

595
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,050
Guess what.

596
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,490
Don't tell me.

597
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,820
You just spoke to Jarvis.

598
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,620
You knew?

599
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,340
She might have
mentioned something.

600
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,800
And you didn't
tell me?

601
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,080
I'm transferring you
to Greenland.

602
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,220
Oh, look,
he's not even confirmed yet,

603
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,240
and he's mad with power.

604
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,430
Baldwin.

605
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,200
Hey, you're not
going to believe this.

606
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,160
They've just asked me
to join the board of directors

607
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,690
at the Collier museum.

608
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,360
Wow. That's... quite an honor.

609
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,110
Do you think I should take it?

610
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,270
The best museum
on the west coast.

611
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,440
You got to take it.

612
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,340
There's a benefit

613
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,530
at the "Seattle Inner City
Arts Council" on friday night.

614
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,100
They want
to introduce me around.

615
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,960
I didn't put my tux
back into storage.

616
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,970
So it, um...

617
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,010
Looks like we both got a little
surprise at the office today.

618
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,270
What do you mean?

619
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,940
Are you sitting down?

620
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,900
Just tell me, Thomas.

621
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,570
Honey, I'll see you
at home tonight.

622
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,710
Glendon Ritter,

623
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,480
C.E.O. of Stradwick Pharmaceuticals.

624
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,470
Isn't he president
of the arts council?

625
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,090
Well, you should go
say hello.

626
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,730
You come with.

627
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,660
No, no, you...
you go.

628
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,770
I'm all out
of small talk.

629
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,300
Go ahead.

630
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,740
Mr. Ritter.

631
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,900
So happy
you could make it.

632
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,400
Thomas?

633
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,650
Do you see it?

634
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,750
No.

635
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,200
Why? You do?

636
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,930
It's been gone
for eight years.

637
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,500
Why now?

638
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,090
Come back downstairs with me.

639
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,570
That's the way out. It...

640
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,670
... it has to be.

641
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,670
And if it is...

642
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,340
... and you walk through it...

643
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,350
... what happens to all of this?

644
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,480
To us?

645
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,560
I don't know.

646
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,090
And I don't want to find out.

647
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,590
I want to go to Washington
next month,

648
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,950
and I want to watch you
get promoted.

649
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,900
I want to see who Kyle marries.

650
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,180
So do I...

651
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,860
But this door, it's...

652
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,570
... it's back for a reason.

653
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,490
It's like
it wants me to walk through it.

654
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,560
But do you want
to walk through it?

655
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,620
I don't want you to, either.

656
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,070
Come on, Thomas.

657
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,130
Let's go home.

658
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,300
Kyle!

659
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,720
No, Kyle's my son!

660
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,320
Leave me alone! He's my son!

661
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
Kyle!

662
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Stop.
Let go of me!

663
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,700
What...

664
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,950
Congratulations.

665
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,200
You made it.

666
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,930
Where are we?

667
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,190
I think you know.

668
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,780
This is where
they brought you...

669
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,310
... and the rest of the 4400.

670
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,340
Yes, this is where
they altered us--

671
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,370
Gave me the ability

672
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,090
to create the world
we've been living in

673
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,710
for the last eight years.

674
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,040
So it is you.

675
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,770
You've been doing this
the whole time.

676
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,060
We've been living
in my mind,

677
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,510
but the instructions
for your reality

678
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,980
came from them.

679
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,530
They created
a sanctuary for you,

680
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,280
an easier,
less complicated world.

681
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,870
But none of it's real.

682
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,570
You are.

683
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,050
I am.

684
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,670
The feelings
we have for each other are

685
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,260
as real as anything
we've ever experienced.

686
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,660
Is that why they did this?

687
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,320
Kept us here for eight years?

688
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,370
Because they wanted us
to fall in love?

689
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,490
Moments.

690
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,640
That's all that's passed,

691
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,910
but in those
few seconds,

692
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,710
we've accumulated
years of memories

693
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,500
that will bond us
in the real world.

694
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,750
I thought they were worried
about saving the world,

695
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,670
not playing matchmaker.

696
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,440
They're worried
about you.

697
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,430
Your life
is about to plunge into crisis.

698
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,810
Your mission
will be threatened.

699
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,250
They can't allow this to happen.

700
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,680
They gave you this relationship
as a source of strength,

701
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,630
to sustain you

702
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,850
in the trials
that lay ahead.

703
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,470
What crisis? What--

704
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,850
What is it?

705
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,660
Why can't they just tell me
what it is?

706
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,040
I can stop it from happening.

707
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,220
It's already begun...

708
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,830
... but now you won't have to
face it alone.

709
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
No, if it's started,
I have to get back there.

710
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,950
Only your wife
can get you home.

711
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,000
You are my wife.

712
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,800
No.

713
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,730
I'm part of the program
they placed in her mind.

714
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
She has no idea
she's creating this.

715
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,140
If she did,

716
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,900
it would interfere
with the bonding.

717
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,360
So, what, I'm supposed
to just fill her in

718
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,500
and tell her what?

719
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,150
Whether she knows it or not,

720
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,260
she's willing this world
into existence.

721
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,200
She can will it
out of existence.

722
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah, and what if
she doesn't want to?

723
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,020
You have to
convince her.

724
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,790
That will be the first test
of your relationship.

725
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,040
They've created a damn near
perfect world for me.

726
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,650
What if I don't want to leave?

727
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,670
Then the future
picked the wrong man.

728
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,000
What about Kyle?

729
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,990
He spent nine years
becoming a doctor.

730
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,340
What, am I supposed
to get rid of him?

731
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,390
Wish him away?

732
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,330
It's not really Kyle.

733
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,540
Don't say that!

734
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,410
If it's not Kyle,

735
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,910
who's moving around
downstairs in the kitchen?

736
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,480
Kyle. Shawn. Danny.

737
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,110
None of them are real.
They're just projections.

738
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,060
You've spent eight years
with these people.

739
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,680
They're as real to you
as they are to me.

740
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,370
I love my family.

741
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,960
I really do love them.

742
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,790
It's not that I want to do this.

743
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,120
It's that we have to do it.

744
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,720
But they're my family, too.

745
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,600
Back there,
I'm just a stranger to them.

746
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,940
What about you and me?
Our life?

747
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,250
Is that a projection, too?

748
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,660
No.

749
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,380
What we have, our memories,

750
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,200
they'll carry over
into the real world.

751
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,730
But it won't be the same.
It can't be.

752
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,130
Maybe not,

753
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,410
but whatever we have,
it'll be real.

754
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,780
What are you doing?

755
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,890
Make it go away.

756
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,640
What do I do?
Stare at it until it disappears?

757
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,240
No, just believe
it's not there.

758
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,670
Well, thanks
for coming, everybody.

759
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,760
Alana and I just wanted
to tell you all that...

760
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,450
... we're going to be
leaving.

761
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,320
We're taking
a vacation.

762
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,890
We'll be gone
for a while, and, uh...

763
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,630
I know it's sudden,

764
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,900
but we just decided
this morning.

765
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,890
Well,
how long is a while?

766
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,090
I mean, you just got the biggest
promotion of your career.

767
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,140
It'll have to wait.

768
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,140
We wanted to see you all
one last time before we go,

769
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,500
and tell you...

770
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,310
How much we love you.

771
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,380
That's so sweet.

772
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,020
Careful, Alana.

773
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,000
She's going to be crying
in a second.

774
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,410
It's something
we have to do.

775
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,020
It's a...

776
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,140
It's a trip that we've been
talking about for a long time.

777
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,760
Where are you going?

778
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,420
Not far.

779
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,800
Well...

780
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,090
Send us a postcard...

781
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,890
At least.

782
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,700
To the people we love.

783
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,360
You have no idea
how much we will miss you.

784
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,800
We will miss you, too.

785
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,830
Don't look back.

786
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,290
Tom?

787
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,120
Tom?

788
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Are you with me, Tom?

789
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,520
Can you email me
the Mareva file?

790
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,380
Alana Mareva?

791
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,650
Yeah, A.K.A. returnee 2155.

792
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,480
She was just here
doing her med eval.

793
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,870
It's my week
to do reports,

794
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,420
remember?

795
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,510
Diana, the 4400,
the ball of light,

796
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,500
it happened, right?

797
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,490
Should I be worried about you--

798
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,820
- Just tell me it happened.
- Yes, of course it happened.

799
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,550
What else have we been
doing here the last year?

800
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,240
That's great.
My god.

801
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,380
Thank you.
Thank you.

802
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,950
Alana. Alana!

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,890
Alana!

804
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,960
Alana, wait!

805
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,950
Thomas.
