00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,540
WHAT ?

370
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,370
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME.

371
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,170
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

372
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,670
WHO IS SHE, TOM ?

373
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,640
WHO IS MAIA ?

374
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,670
I DONT KNOW.

375
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,470
THERE'S NO MENTION OF SOMEONE NAMED MAIA

376
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,570
IN ANY OF OUR CASE FILES.

377
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,570
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE WE MET HER TOGETHER

378
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,610
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

379
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,140
MAYBE AT ONE OF GARRITY'S BARBECUES.

380
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,170
NO, THAT DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT.

381
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,210
I DIDN'T JUST MEET THIS GIRL ONCE

382
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,410
AT A BARBECUE.

383
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,410
I KNOW HER BETTER THAN THAT.

384
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,870
ALL RIGHT, JUST CALM DOWN.

385
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,110
WELL,  THERE'SA REASON

386
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,140
THIS GIRL ISHAUNTING US, TOM.

387
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,510
OKAY, SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,

388
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,840
AND SHE WANTS US TO FIND HER.

389
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
WELL, RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW SHE EXISTS

390
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,510
IS IN ONE OF THESE DREAMWORLDS THAT ALANA AND I CREATE.

391
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,940
WELL, THEN I NEED

392
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,710

393
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,940
I NEED TO MEET THIS GIRL,

394
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,040
TALK TO HER.

395
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,070
NO, BUT YOU WOULDN'T REALLY

396
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,210
BE TALKING TO HER, DIANA.

397
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,210
YOU'D JUST BE TALKING TO WHATEVER

398
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,610
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS REMEMBERS OF HER.

399
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,710
WELL, MAYBE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS.

401
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,970
HOW DO I SOUND ?

402
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,070
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS.

403
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,210
BUT I HAVEN'T. IT'S MY FIRST TIME.

404
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,470
I KIND OF FIGURED THAT.

405
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,270
ISABELLE, YOU HAVE A MINUTE ?

406
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,910
HAVE A SEAT.

407
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,340
[SIGHS]

408
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,610
UH...

409
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,710
ISABELLE, YOU KNOWI'M PROUD OF YOU, DON'T YOU ?

410
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,110
THIS IS ABOUT SHAWN AND IHAVING SEX, ISN'T IT ?

411
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,970
THAT-- THAT'S PART OF IT, YEAH, YEAH,

412
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,370
BUT ONLY PART OF IT.

413
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,640
RIGHT NOW, EVERYTHING IS NEW TO YOU.

414
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
YOU'RE LEARNING SO MUCH, SO FAST.

415
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,310
HOW TO BE A...

416
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,940
A DAUGHTER...

417
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
A FRIEND--

418
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,770
A LOVER.

419
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,570
THAT PART YOU MIGHT BE LEARNING A LITTLE TOO FAST--

420
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,340
I WOULD JUST LIKE IT IF YOU AND SHAWN SLOWED DOWN--

421
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,470
STOPPED SLEEPING TOGETHER ?

422
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,440
FOR THE TIME BEING.

423
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,610
THERE'S NO REASON TO STOP.

424
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,140
SHAWN CARES ABOUT ME. I CARE ABOUT SHAWN.

425
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,640
THE SEX IS WONDERFUL.

426
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,110
IT MAKES US BOTH VERY HAPPY.

427
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,470
IT SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY, TOO.

428
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,240
MAYBE IT SHOULD,BUT IT DOESN'T.

429
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,570
I SUPPOSE THAT'S NORMAL.

430
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,540
BUT EVERYTHING'SGOING TO BE OKAY.

431
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,810
SHAWN WOULD NEVERDO ANYTHING TO HURT ME.

432
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,210
HE'S WAY TOO SMART FOR THAT.

433
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,510
SO YOU SEE ?

434
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,040
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

435
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,210
I WONDER IF ANYONE AT THE CENTER

436
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,610
HAS A CELLO.

437
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,010
SO, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO ?

438
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,110
WELL, THE MAIN THINGIS TO RELAX.

439
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,240
OH, MY GOD.

440
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,210
I USUALLY CLOSE MY EYES

441
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,970
AND COUNT BACKWARDSFROM 10.

442
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,310
BEFORE I REACH ZERO, WE'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

443
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,310
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

444
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,370
WHERE YOU WANT ALANATO TAKE YOU ?

445
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,410
WE USUALLY HAVE A DESTINATION

446
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,470
PICKED OUT.

447
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,470
WELL, WHEREVER MAIA IS.

448
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,540
I MEAN, YOU CAN DO THAT, CAN'T YOU ?

449
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,040
YOU CANTAKE ME TO HER.

450
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,740
SHE SEEMS TO SHOW UP ANY PLACE WE GO.

451
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,110
SO IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU.

452
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,340
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE.

453
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
HOW ABOUT MY APARTMENT ?

454
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,410
ALL RIGHT.

455
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,810
NOW, LET'S BEGIN.

456
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,040
ALANA...

457
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,070
THIS IS NOT MY APARTMENT.

458
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,170
I KNOW.

459
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,410
I'M NOT QUITE SUREWHAT JUST HAPPENED.

460
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,340
YOU DONE TALKING TO YOUR FRIEND ?

461
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,870
YOU'RE MAIA.

462
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,440
STOP FOOLING AROUND.

463
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,140
COME ON. HE'S WAITING FOR US.

464
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,970
THERE YOU ARE, MS. SKOURIS.

465
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,540

466
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,540
IF YOU'LL JUST HAVE A SEATAND SIGN WHERE INDICATED,

467
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,770
WE CAN FINISH UP.

468
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,870
YOU STILL WANT TO DO THIS...

469
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,810
DON'T YOU ?

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,740

YOU KNOW, SOME OF USHAVE TO LOOK FAR AND WIDE

475
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,610
TO FIND THE PEOPLE WE'LL CALL FAMILY.

476
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,010
YOU TWO HAD TO LOOK CLEAR ACROSS TIME.

477
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,870
DIANA, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU

478
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,970
TO YOUR DAUGHTER MAIA.

479
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,670
MAIA, SAY HELLO TO MOMMY.

480
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,270
OH, MY GOD, MAIA...

481
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,040
OH, MY GOD...

482
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,970
MY GOD...

483
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,940
DIANA, WHAT HAPPENED ?

484
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,370
SHE WAS KIDNAPPED,TOM.

485
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,770
SHE WAS TAKEN

486
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,140
BY A WOMAN PRETENDINGTO BE HER SISTER.

487
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,840
SHE TOOK MAIA, TYLER DOWNING, LINDSEY HAMMOND,

488
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,410
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF 4400 KIDS.

489
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,940
DO YOU REMEMBERANY OF THIS ?

490
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,610
NO. NO, I DON'T.

491
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,870
SO THIS WOMAN TOOK THESE CHILDREN,

492
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,240
AND SOMEHOW MADE EVERYONE FORGET

493
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,440
THEY EVER EXISTED ?

494
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,910
YES, BUT THEY EXISTED.

495
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,970

496
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,270
MARCH 3rd,1946.

497
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,310
WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING SHE WAS ABDUCTED,

498
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,640
THEN RETURNED WITH THE OTHER 4400,

499
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,340
THEN TAKEN AGAIN,

500
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,970
AND NONE OF US REMEMBER THIS BUT YOU ?

501
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,510
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE WIPED ALL OUR MEMORIES.

502
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,870
BUT WHY ?

503
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,640
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT US LOOKING FOR THEM.

504
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,470
THE 4400 WERE TAKEN AND RETURNED

505
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,710
TO CHANGE THE FUTURE IN SOME WAY,

506
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,410
AND MAYBE MAIA AND THE OTHERS WERE TAKEN

507
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,810
SO THAT THEY COULD CHANGE IT AGAIN,

508
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,910
BUT I DON'T KNOW,AND I DON'T CARE.

509
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,170
ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOUR DAYS AGO,

510
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,410
SHE WAS HERE WITH ME,

511
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,540
AND I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE

512
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,070
THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED MAIA,

513
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,240
AND THAT SHE'S BEEN TAKEN FROM ME.

514
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,340
I DON'T REMEMBER MAIA,

515
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,970
OR THE KIDNAPPING, OR ANY OF IT,

516
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,210
AND THE IDEA

517
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,070
THAT MY MEMORY'S BEEN MESSED WITH

518
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,470
SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME,

519
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,570
BUT AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

520
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,840
WITH THE 4400,

521
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,410
YES, DIANA...

522
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,570

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,710
OH, COME ON. COME ON...

727
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,100
AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE'D SUFFERED

728
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,570
SOME KIND OF INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,

729
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,000
BUT THE M.R.I. DIDN'T SHOW ANY BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN.

730
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
SO SHE HASN'T SUFFERED ANY DAMAGE ?

731
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,870
NOT YET,

732
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,600
BUT THE E.E.G WAS VERY TROUBLING.

733
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,170
HER BRAIN ACTIVITYIS FAR ABOVE NORMAL

734
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,100
AND CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE.

735
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,370
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR HER HEART RATE,

736
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,040
HER BREATHING, HER BLOOD PRESSURE.

737
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,900
THEY'RE ALL RED-LINING, IF YOU WILL.

738
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,740
ANY IDEA WHAT'S CAUSING IT ?

739
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,170
I REALLY CAN'T SAY AT THE MOMENT,

740
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,340
BUT HER METABOLIC RATE CAN'T STAY AT THIS LEVEL

741
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,640
FOR VERY LONG.

742
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,400
EVENTUALLY, HER ORGANS WILL FAIL.

743
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,540
WHAT, SHE COULD DIE ?

744
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,070
UNLESS WE CAN SLOW DOWN HER RATES,

745
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,140
WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY POOR OUTCOME.

746
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
DOES SHE HAVE ANY FAMILY ?

YOU SHOULD CALL THEM.

750
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,000
I NEED TO TALK TO HER. CAN YOU DO THAT ?

751
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,370
TAKE ME TO SEE DIANA.

758
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,500
I THOUGHT I'D BE SEEING YOU TWO.

I DIDN'T HURT YOU, DID I ?

760
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,700
IT FELT A LITTLE JARRING

761

WHEN YOU LEFT.

762
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,140

764
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,070
WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT.

765
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,600
YOU'RE IN AN I.C.U, DIANA.

766
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,070
I THOUGHT I MIGHT END UP THERE.

767

WHAT'S MY HEART RATE ?

768
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,240
IS IT 170 ? 175 ?

769
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,640
THAT STILL PROBABLY GIVES ME, WHAT,

ANYWHERE FROM THREE WEEKS TO TWO MONTHS ?

771
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
THAT COULD BE FOREVER IN HERE.

772
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,570
I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE,

780
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,270
BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THIS IS NOT THE WORLD.

781
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,170
NONE OF THIS IS REAL,

782
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,700

OH, SHE'S NOT COMING BACK, IS SHE ?

787
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,200
SHE'S GOING TO DIE IN THERE.

788
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
THAT SEEMS TO BE HER PLAN.

789
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,970
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THIS IS MY FAULT.

790
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,300

791
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,240
