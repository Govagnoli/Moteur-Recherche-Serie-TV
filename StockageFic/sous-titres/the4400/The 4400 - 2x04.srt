1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
[previously on the 4400...]
we're not sure what's just happened.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,300
The light is gone,

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,600
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,200
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,700
maybe the best you've got in this division.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,000
I thought I was being re-assigned to field duty.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,500
You are, effective immediately.

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,500
Work's been a little crazy lately

9
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
oh, the job?

10
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,700
I've been waiting for that one.

11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,400
It finally feels like old times around here.

12
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,800
April, glad to hear from you.You're my sister.

13
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,700
Surprised?

14
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,200
How come I've never met you before?

15
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,600
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.

16
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm shawn farrell.

17
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,400
I am one of the 4400.

18
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,400
Can I sign you up for a tour?

19
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,100
I was looking for cousin, shawn farrell.

20
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,500
Policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.

21
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,100
Been to that place where you're living.

22
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,100
There's some serious stepford wives vibes going on there.

23
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,900
You know that, right?

24
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,400
These centers,they're a chance to bring people together.

25
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,100
Sounds like someone got inside your head.

26
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,000
I will not allow these shadows from your past to alter your perceptions.

27
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,700
The goal is what matters.

28
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,700
Ensure the future.

29
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Save the planet.

30
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,500
If maia's having visions,you should know about it

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,100
and you should know what they are.

32
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,100
Isabelle is six months old.

33
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,300
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

34
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,800
Talks?

35
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,100
Ntac? Collier?

36
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,900
I don't know who it is,

37
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,600
but someone knows we're 4400s.

38
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Start packing

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,700
How'd it go today, daddy?

40
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,500
That bad, huh?

41
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,800
Nobody wants to buy time shares in wilmington, idaho.

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,500
Baja california, maybe.

43
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
If I were you, I'd go in there

44
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,100
and tell them "either let me have the good listings,

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,700
or I quit".

46
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,400
The whole staff wants baja,honey

47
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
and I don't have the seniority.

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
How is that fair?

49
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,800
You've been a salesman longer than any of them.

50
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,200
Salesman, not telemarketer.

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,000
It's different.

52
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,400
Hey, hey. Appelbaum.

53
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,700
Payday.

54
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Leave him alone!

55
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,600
He's trying to pay you back!

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This your beer, appelbaum?

57
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,200
You don't mind if I quench my thirst, do you?

58
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,400
Honey, stay back.

59
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
Stay back.

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,900
I just need a couple more weeks.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Something will turn around.

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
You know, in my business

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
you hear every sob story in the book

64
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
but I got to tell you,yours is a new one

65
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,800
"disappeared 15 years ago,

66
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,000
"came back in a ball of light

67
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,000
wife died

68
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,500
daughter dropped out of school

69
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
" You got a bad break,

70
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,400
but you borrowed the money,

71
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,700
and now you're going to have to pay me back.

72
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
I'll figure something out.

73
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh, you do it quickly,

74
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,600
because you and I are going to talk again in 48 hours.

75
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,800
I thought you 4400s got special powers.

76
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,800
How come you're such a big nothing?

77
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
Just lucky, I guess.

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,100
All right, let's go.

79
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
Thanks for the beer.

80
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
Should be at eric's place tomorrow.

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
Be nice to see a friendly face,

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
maybe sleep in for a change.

83
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,200
Sounds good.

84
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
You like eric, right?

85
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
Yes You guys got along in quarantine.

86
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,600
Richard, I'm late.

87
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Like, "I might be pregnant" late.

88
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,700
You sure?

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
No, I'm not sure.

90
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm late.

91
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,700
Well, we just have to wait and see.

92
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Wait and see?

93
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,700
We could go to the drug store, maybe...

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
get one of those test things.

95
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,900
And what would you want it to say?

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,300
I'd like it to say, "congratulations.

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
You have a job, a house, and a future.

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
You're ready for another child.

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,100
" But I don't think it's going to say that.

100
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,600
No.

101
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Probably not.

102
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,100
$3,150... 32, 33... $3,400.

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Well, that should keep that creep happy for a while.

104
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm sorry about your car.

105
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll ride the bus to work.

106
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
Sorry about the television.

107
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,100
I'll read a book.

108
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
Appelbaum, the miracle man, huh?

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
You notice anything different about me?

110
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,500
My god...

111
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,400
75 pounds in two days.

112
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,900
Now, at first, I thought the termites had gotten me.

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
You know, I was sick-- cancer.

114
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,200
Doctors ran all the tests. Turns out I'm fine.

115
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,000
But

116
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,000
how could I lose all that weight?

117
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Then I thought of you.

118
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,500
Me and you, we shared a bottle of beer,

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
and you're one of those 4400s.

120
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,200
What does that prove?

121
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,100
Nothing yet.

122
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
But let's-- let's find out.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,100
I want you to take a sip.

124
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Because if I'm right,

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,200
you made me lose all this weight,

126
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
and then the same thing should happen to my wife.

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Who-- mm...

128
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
though I love very much,

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
I do-- could stand to lose maybe 20 pounds.

130
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
30.

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
Go ahead.

132
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,400
Drink up.

133
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Applebaum...

134
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,200
these people who took you,

135
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,500
they set you up for life.

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,300
They snatched up a bum salesman,

137
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,100
and they sent you back "the human diet."

138
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
"The human diet."

139
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
I like that.

140
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,600
Go ahead.

141
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,400
So long ago, another life

142
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,100
I can feel your heart beat

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,700
it's not a dream remember us

144
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,900
I can see it in your eyes

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,400
we'll find our place in time

146
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,100
our place in time beyond the sun

147
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,600
we'll find our place in time

148
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,000
our place in time to call our own

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,599
Chloe

150
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
thank you thank you

151
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:18,801
reading Jordan's book was an absolute Revelation

152
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:23,802
I bought copies for all my back up dangers
and we discuss it every night after the show

153
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,003
she cut her tour short

154
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,704
yes,because i felt like i had to be here

155
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:32,005
obviously,i'm not one of 4400

156
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:35,406
but i expect to be treated just like any other student here

157
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,407
if i'm lucky enough

158
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,508
to tap into an ability

159
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,509
i will use it to ensure the world a brighter future

160
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,110
congratulations,Chloe Greezer,you have achieved "first key"

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,811
thank you

162
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,912
Last year, she was into Compila.

163
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:07,413
it's amazing, i lost 23 pounds

164
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,414
i haven't weighed less than 130 since college

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,715
told you applebaum was a real deal,right?

166
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,216
you have been happy harrassing him anymore

167
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,817
honey,what we got from him is way more than he owns me,right?

168
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,018
come on

169
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:21,919
turn around

170
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,819
Question of the day

171
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,420
who is Trent Applebaum and why is Drandix coporation calling me about it.

172
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:29,820
Applebaum disappeared in the late 80's

173
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:31,421
he's in phone-sells,right?

174
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,522
and now he's selling himself

175
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:36,523
he claimed that his saliva is catalogued for weight loss

176
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,624
Applebaum backed his claim up?

177
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,925
two good satisfied customers

178
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:45,526
married couple,one drop 75 pounds,the other 23

179
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,827
particularly over a night

180
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:48,328
my god

181
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,429
they got a hand of the future on this one

182
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,630
if they really give him this ability,it could be the cure for adiposity

183
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,630
yeah,it will change the world

184
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,931
that's about to change Trent Applebaum's world

185
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,032
he hired a lawyer,an agent

186
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,833
they were asking 20 million dollars

187
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,434
but Trent's in a bidding war with three other company so...

188
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,000
who knows what the final number will end up

189
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,601
a 4400 selling exclusive rights to his ability is legal

190
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,202
our lawyer is looking into conjunction

191
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:13,403
but at the moment,no legislation specifically prevents it

192
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:15,403
then our guy Stands to be a very rich man

193
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:15,904
hmm

194
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,305
maybe we should go see him

195
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:19,706
yeah,find out if he's really worth 20 million dollars

196
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,807
hey hey jet pilot

197
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:35,108
did i get it right?

198
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,309
close enough

199
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,210
so...you sounded a little freaked out on the phone
anything i should know about?

200
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,211
better that you don't

201
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:53,012
look at you two,love birds from quarantine building B

202
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:57,613
this little cutie must be Isabelle. your daddy told me all about you

203
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:59,414
i bet he did

204
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:03,315
look,come on in.i'll show you guys the guest room

205
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,116
or maybe somebody sleep on the couch

206
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:11,107
not too shabby from my first college

207
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:13,308
it was a good paper,well fall out

208
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:14,909
so what's the minus for?

209
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,510
well, i always like to leave a bit room for improvement

210
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:22,211
last days of pompeii

211
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,712
yeah,they throw that party every year

212
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,313
you should go,go out some steam you've earned it

213
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,614
i hate to go alone,you're up for it?

214
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,115
i probably love to have remembered that threat

215
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:36,416
not my scene, but don't let me stop you

216
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,707
i don't know how it works, they put something inside me

217
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,108
one of those enzyme or whatever

218
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:45,109
so someone drinks from the same bottle as you do and they lose weight

219
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,780
maybe we should give him a demonstration

220
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,281
cut it out,Louis

221
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,982
she thinks she needs to lose eight pounds

222
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:50,583
try ten

223
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,384
sweetie,you're beautiful,you don't need to lose anything

224
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,185
he's right about that, you don't

225
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,186
a lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen

226
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:00,287
and Lis had to take a job at a diner

227
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,088
we were apart for sixteen years

228
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,389
but while i was gone, they gave me a way to make it up to her

229
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,290
Mr.Applebaum, no one's telling you not to provide for your daughter

230
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,691
but a 4400 putting his gift on the open market is the first

231
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,392
we wanna make sure nobody gets to take advantage of that

232
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:17,993
not you, not the buyer,other 4400...

233
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,894
you don't have to teach me about selling

234
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,995
i've been a salesman my whole life

235
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,896
most of the stuff i paddled

236
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,397
junk

237
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:30,598
but now i got the product that everybody wants
and only i can provide,i'm the damn product

238
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,599
nobody is putting Trent Appelbaum back in the bottle

239
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:38,106
my father fought in Korea, infantry

240
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,107
i flew in 36

241
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,108
Eric told me

242
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,609
daddy admired you guys

243
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,000
he said there were only 25 black pilots in the whole air force
who allowed to flylike everybody else

244
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,701
there weren't a lot of us, it's true

245
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:51,602
the first person i met long time ago
couldn't metion the Korea War

246
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:56,000
that was a big deal in our house,we always go to pray

247
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,701
yeah,my grandfather and my mom said he'd take me too

248
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,202
except it was called "Armistice Day" back day

249
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,403
for world war one

250
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,104
put on those boot dress, go visit old buddy

251
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,805
daddy looks so handsome in his uniform

252
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,206
i bet you'd too

253
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,407
i'd like to meet him sometime

254
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,408
yeah,well,too late

255
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:17,209
he passed away two years ago this August

256
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,310
i'm sorry to hear that

257
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,011
thank you

258
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,012
he would really love to meet you too

259
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:25,213
the guy was 81, he was born four years after i was

260
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:27,414
well,lucky for you,i like elder man

261
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:30,315
so Rrichard, we've known what were you up to in 1951

262
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,316
how about lately

263
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,117
well, i've been working as an alternate weekend

264
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,418
oh,really?

265
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,019
so what brings you to this part of the country,it's kind of remote for vacation

266
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,720
they came to see me, as 4400, we gotta stick together

267
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:47,321
we have bond that you mere human will never understand

268
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:51,222
Eric,you freak me out when you talk that 4400 unity crap

269
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,923
not much of a talker,are you,Lily?

270
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,024
i'm not really used to be in social situation since these days

271
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,025
you are a luky man

272
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,926
with this one here

273
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,127
but i guess you already noticed that,didn't you?

274
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:20,528
i have to pee for about 75th-time today

275
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,229
i have to change Issabelle

276
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,907
that thing is beautiful

277
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,708
other all beautiful

278
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,909
i just like them better in this book than i do on somebody's shoulder

279
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,810
you don't get it,Dia(Diana)

280
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:38,211
this drawing are not meant live on the page

281
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,012
they're meant to live on the skin

282
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,413
that's very deep

283
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,314
but you're right, i don't get it

284
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,815
i do

285
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:51,916
ok, you got to let this brilliant little girl go with me tomorrow

286
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,817
it's a tattoo shop

287
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,618
a boddy art emporium

288
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,419
and for five hours tomorrow

289
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
i'm the featured artist

290
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,521
you must be pretty good

291
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:05,122
can we go just for a little while

292
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,000
one hour

293
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,801
Shawn, have you seen Chloe's schedule?

294
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,602
why would i see Chloe's schedule,Devon?

295
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:20,603
she has an interview with media three o'clock tomorrow?

296
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,404
oh,hopefully,she will mention the center

297
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,205
but her nutrition and purification class is at three o'clock

298
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,606
yeah, i think i heard Jordan said she was excused from the...

299
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,507
she's been on the microbiotic diet for three years

300
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:33,508
also she says

301
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,609
look, i'm sure Jordan plans on treating Chloe like any other student

302
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,210
Ok?

303
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:00,611
No, i'm ready to close.

304
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:02,012
I don't wanna wait,just tell him it's done

305
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,013
and i'll be in tomorrow

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,814
alright,thanks,Celine

307
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,915
how much?

308
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,916
40 million dollars

309
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:15,117
come up

310
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:16,118
it's on its way

311
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,419
but sir,this will be your fourth stake

312
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,220
we're hungry

313
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:21,321
Ok, just hate to see make yourself sick

314
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:24,622
no one is sick, we're hungry and starving,now go go

315
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,123
get your hands up,please,go

316
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:28,224
i'm starving

317
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,100
Morning-- you're not dressed?

318
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Those guys from arkham films are here to pitch us.

319
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh, the recruitment video.

320
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah, well, you can handle that meeting, can't you?

321
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Well, yeah, sure,

322
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
if you're too busy, yeah.

323
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,200
Hey.

324
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,600
Guess jordan's getting a late start this morning.

325
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,600
My bad.

326
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm going to just jump in the shower, okay?

327
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,500
Shower sounds good, chloe.

328
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
Close your mouth, shawn.

329
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,000
You'll draw flies.

330
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,900
One-on-one tutoring with a first key?

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,500
That'S.that's new.

332
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
First key or not,

333
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,600
chloe demands--

334
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,000
deserves a different level of attention.

335
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,200
She's our entree, shawn,

336
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,600
into the entertainment community.

337
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,000
Jordan, you have an entire chapter in your book that rips celebrity culture.

338
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,900
It's a cancer that separates people,

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,300
that helps define the haves and have-nots.

340
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
And 4400 culture is all about unity.

341
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes.Please, shawn

342
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
do not quote me back to myself.

343
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,100
The fact is,celebrities have deep pockets and deeper insecurities,

344
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,700
and we can use both to our advantage.

345
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
You can be a manipulative prick.

346
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,500
You know that?

347
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,700
Yeah.

348
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,900
Well.

349
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,200
it helps to use your entire skill set when you're trying to change the world.

350
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,100
You and lily should think about putting down some roots here.

351
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,000
I think all this running is fraying you both around the edges.

352
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
You noticed.

353
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Hard not to.

354
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,700
You can do a lot worse than white bird.

355
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,900
It's quiet.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,700
Everyone minds their own business.

357
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,300
Eventually you're going to have to stop criss-crossing the highways.

358
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,300
Might as well do it here,before you run out of road.

359
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,300
Thank you, by the way.

360
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
for not asking what we're running from.

361
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,700
I figured if you wanted me to know, you'd tell me.

362
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,900
Look,richard.

363
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,600
I got all the work I can handle up in livingston,

364
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,800
keeping up these movie stars' second homes.

365
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
I could use a hand.

366
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,900
You offering me a job?

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
They used to call us handymen.

368
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,100
Now we're property managers.

369
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Either way, you'd be working with me,

370
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,400
not for me.

371
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
And if you'll just sign right here..

372
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,200
as agreed-- your signing bonus.

373
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,200
When do I start?

374
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,900
You're making breakfast.

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
As you pour the milk over your cereal,

376
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,700
you notice that there's a photo of a missing child on the side of the carton.

377
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,300
It takes you a moment to realize that it's a picture of you at 10 years old.

378
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
this one's giving me the chills.

379
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,400
Who's making this stuff up?

380
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Moron.

381
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Devon, do not let jordan hear you say that.

382
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,700
The two of them hooked up last night.

383
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah,and by the looks of it,probably this morning, too.

384
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,300
There's a telephone number on the missing persons report.

385
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,100
It's the number of your childhood home.

386
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,200
Stay here?

387
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,400
You mean permanently?

388
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a nice town,

389
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,200
and eric says I can start work tomorrow.

390
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,700
Look,lily.

391
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
We've got to get you off the road,

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
especially if you're pregnant again.

393
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,100
I'm not.

394
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
You sure?

395
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,100
positive.

396
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,300
Please don't try and pretend you're not relieved.

397
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Relieved?

398
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,600
Lily, I was trying to wrap my head around it,that's all.

399
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,500
Especially if we're not going to be running anymore.

400
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,200
I don't know about this place, richard.

401
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Isabelle thinks--

402
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
oh, let me guess.

403
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
We should move on.

404
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,300
I was hoping we could go to salem, oregon.

405
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I have some relatives there.

406
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
I think they might be willing to help us out and keep quiet about it.

407
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,100
Salem?

408
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,900
That's a city.

409
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,100
Maybe we could get lost in a crowd for a change.

410
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,100
This place

411
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,600
this life,it feels right to me.

412
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,500
This is eric's life.

413
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,300
It's not yours.

414
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,900
It's not ours.

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,900
No,this is not a negotiating stance.

416
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
It's my answer-- no.

417
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,900
Goodbye.

418
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,200
So let me guess-- the answer is no?

419
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
That was a rep from the yoyotron corp.

420
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,300
They want to sign maia to a $300,000-a-year holding contract.

421
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
But maia doesn't have any ability anymore.

422
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
Well, you don't need any to make any of these deals.

423
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,500
They're signing 4400s up on spec.

424
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,100
They want them in their pocket in case something develops down the line.

425
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,100
Well, you did the right thing by saying no.

426
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,300
Tom.

427
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,300
about maia.

428
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
What?She's okay, isn't she?

429
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
She's fine.

430
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,100
I've been trying to figure out the right time to tell you this.

431
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,000
I probably should have done it right away, but.

432
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
you know those visions that maia used to have?

433
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,300
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.

434
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
How long have you known?

435
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,400
Not long.

436
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,900
I only found out because I read her diary,

437
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,400
but it was an eyeful.

438
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
You going to tell jarvis?

439
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,200
I'd rather not turn my daughter's diary over to the government.

440
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,600
Hey, don't give me that look, tom.

441
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,500
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

442
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Guess we're even now.

443
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,900
See how cool that looks?

444
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Your aunt, she's a real artist.

445
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh, say it again, billy boy.

446
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,100
I don't think my sister heard you.

447
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh, I heard him.

448
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
You're a star.

449
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Believe it.

450
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,700
As soon as I heard april was appearing here,

451
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,600
I booked my time right away.

452
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
So did pretty much all of my buddies.

453
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,500
that's impressive.

454
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm proud of you.

455
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,200
Wait a minute.

456
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,100
You didn't actually just say
that you were proud of me?

457
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Cut it out.Of course I am.

458
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,300
I always thought you thought I was a loser.

459
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Did you really think that?

460
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, I really did.

461
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,700
April.

462
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,600
all I said was that I liked the tattoo.

463
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,800
You don't always wear your helmet, do you?

464
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,300
You should wear one tonight.

465
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
Why's that?

466
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,500
You won't make it over to
monica's house if you don't.

467
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
Does that hurt?

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,400
How do you know about my girlfriend?

469
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,000
I really think you should wear your helmet.

470
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,500
You killed her.

471
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Dmitri?

472
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,500
What happened to you?

473
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,100
My wife, she's gone.

474
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Doctors say that she starved to death.

475
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm next.

476
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,800
You killed us both.

477
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
How many times am I supposed to tell you?

478
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,100
I don't know how I got to that store.

479
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,800
and I sure as hell don't
remember breaking any window.

480
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,300
Not remembering is no excuse.

481
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
and stop telling me somebody spiked your drink.

482
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,800
The police ran tests.kyle.

483
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,300
There's no ghb in your system.

484
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,100
What else could it be?

485
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,500
You spent three years in a coma.

486
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
You have no business drinking anything!

487
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay.so I screwed up.

488
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm sorry.What more do you want?

489
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,800
How about acknowledging that this was serious?

490
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,100
Do you know how close they were to
charging you with breaking and entering?

491
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,900
Which by the way is a felony.

492
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
If I didn't play the ntac card.

493
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
you'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.

494
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,300
Can I go to bed?

495
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,700
No.this is serious.

496
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,900
You want to make up for last time.

497
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,600
kyle.I get it.

498
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
I get it.

499
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,000
but we need to talk about
some ground rules for you.

500
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm not a kid.

501
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
I don't need ground rules.

502
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,700
I wouldn't know that from tonight.

503
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,800
Answer it.

504
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,000
What?

505
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,000
You're kidding me.

506
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
Yeah.I'll be right in.

507
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,600
We'll finish this later.

508
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,100
What happened to laying down the law?

509
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,300
Oh.right.Something more important came up.

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,900
Just go upstairs.kyle.

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
Just go upstairs.

512
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,200
Richard?

513
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,600
What are you doing out here?

514
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,900
Oh.I'm just getting some air.

515
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,600
Well.hop in.We'll give you a ride back.

516
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,600
I was reading about your air
force unit on the internet yesterday.

517
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,800
No kidding.

518
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,700
I looked at it a couple times too.

519
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,100
You guys were one of the most decorated flying squads--

520
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,600
tara.

521
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,200
will you stop pestering the man about his past?

522
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
It's okay.

523
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
I don't mind.

524
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,500
Well. as long as you're feeling talkative.

525
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I've got a question for you--

526
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,100
what did a brother have to do back in the '50s
before they'd let you fly a plane.huh?

527
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
Polish the officer's boots on the weekends?

528
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,700
David.

529
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
No.no.no.seriously.I mean.

530
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm wondering.

531
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,900
Boy must've done some serious bowing and
scraping before they'd hand you them keys.right?

532
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,300
Okay.that is enough.

533
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm so sorry.richard.

534
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,100
No problem.

535
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Some people the less they know the more they talk.

536
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,200
Oh.I know some things.

537
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,000
I know a lot more than you realize.

538
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,700
What's that supposed to mean?

539
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,300
It means quit fawning over the
man and keep your mouth closed.

540
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,700
Why don't you just let me out right here?

541
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,600
Hey.

542
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
you sit back and relax.huh?

543
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,800
Now this here?

544
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,000
It's called marriage.

545
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,800
That's all.

546
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,400
You know what I'm talking about.

547
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,300
Dmitri's dead?

548
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,300
Organ failure resulting from
malnutrition just like his wife.

549
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,600
They were supposed to lose 20 or 30 pounds.

550
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,800
not starve to death.

551
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,600
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?

552
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,400
Family?

553
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:33,900
Friends?

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,400
No.

555
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,200
Did you kiss anyone?

556
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,000
Share a drinking glass?

557
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,900
No.there's no one else.

558
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,500
We think we know what happened to the kazars.

559
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,600
There's a protein in your saliva that
hyper-accelerated their metabolism.

560
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,900
It's a cagey one too.

561
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,400
It stimulates the brain to release epinephrine
and it breaks down fat cells at the same time.

562
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,100
No wonder they burned up calories
faster than their bodies could take them in.

563
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,400
Well.they could eat anything and
everything and still starve to death.

564
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,000
That doesn't make any sense.

565
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,600
We're supposed to be helping people.right?

566
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,300
That's why we were sent back.

567
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,200
All I wanted was to make good for my daughter.

568
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,200
Now I'm a murderer.

569
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,900
You didn't mean to do it trent.

570
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,500
That supposed to make me feel better?

571
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,500
We're going to have to keep you here.

572
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,900
Try and find a way to remove the protein from your system.

573
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Well.the good news is we caught it early.

574
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,900
A lot more people could have been infected.

575
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,400
Oh.no.

576
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,300
I was at drandix this morning.

577
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,500
I spent two hours in their lab giving tissue samples.

578
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,700
Oh my god.

579
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,000
Look this isn't my fault.

580
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,200
and I have the documents to prove it.

581
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,200
How many people did you test?

582
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,160
Look.my bosses.

583
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,668
They wanted a clinical trial up
and running by the end of the day.

584
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:45,600
They said."make it your top priority."

585
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
How many?

586
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
A hundred.

587
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,200
Whoa.whoa.whoa.

588
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,400
Hey.what's going on?

589
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
What's going on?

590
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
Why would devon try to kill herself?

591
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
Obviously she's a very troubled young girl.

592
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,200
But she's going to be okay though?

593
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,900
Yeah.

594
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,400
they were able to pump her
stomach out at the emergency room.

595
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,800
She's at home recovering.

596
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,200
Okay.

597
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,800
I think what we need to
do right now is continue our work.

598
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,600
Kyle if the cops say you didn't get "g"ed.

599
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
you have to believe them right?

600
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,900
They could have screwed up the test.

601
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
I didn't drink that much.

602
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Well maybe your dad's right.

603
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Maybe you shouldn't drink at all.

604
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I hope it was just the booze.

605
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,300
Well.what else could it have been?

606
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,100
When I first came out of my coma.

607
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,300
I wasn't quite myself.

608
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I hope it's not happening again.

609
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't know exactly what you mean.

610
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,400
but if you're losing chunks of time.

611
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,900
you should talk to your dad about it.

612
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,900
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to ntac medical?

613
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm not going back into quarantine.

614
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
No way.

615
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,000
If you're looking for eric--

616
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
now there's your goddamn apology.

617
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,700
What are you talking about?

618
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,100
She was at me all morning.

619
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
"Richard this." "Richard that."

620
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,700
I should "go apologize."

621
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,900
From here on in.

622
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
you stay the hell away from my wife.

623
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,100
You're crazy.right?

624
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
I've got nothing going on with your wife.

625
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,000
Now you'd better step away
and take a deep breath or something.

626
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,600
Man.I step where I please.

627
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,900
Now.listen to me.

628
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,500
You're going to go home.

629
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,900
and you're going to apologize to tara.

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,800
and if you've got any brains at all.

631
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,700
you're going to start treating her better.
because if you don't.

632
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,400
one day someone is going to take her away from you.

633
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,300
Now get your ass out of here.

634
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,400
Trent.this isn't helping.

635
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
I had to see what I did.

636
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,200
You want to do something?

637
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,200
Get back to the lab.

638
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,800
Help them work on a way to counter this.

639
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,400
Just let me call elise first huh?

640
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,100
She'll be wondering where I was all night.

641
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Help me.

642
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,700
Elise?

643
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,500
Daddy?

644
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,900
Help me

645
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm sorry.

646
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,800
I just wanted to lose 10 pounds.

647
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,600
Baby.

648
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I told you you were perfect.

649
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I used one of your water glasses.

650
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
We're going to get you help.

651
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,100
We're going to get everybody help.

652
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,900
Tom.

653
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,100
We've got something.

654
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,674
What?

655
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:22,233
Tell me.

656
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,300
Well.I asked the guys downstairs if we
could approach this like a smallpox vaccine

657
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,900
use trace amounts of the antigen to build
resistance and counter the effects of the disease.

658
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
These people are starving to death.

659
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Yeah.but it's because of a chemical reaction.

660
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,900
Now.they biopsied trent's liver.

661
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,600
That's where the protein is coming from.

662
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,000
So if we extract this protein.

663
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,700
they can make a serum that will stimulate
antibody production in the victims.

664
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,400
but they're going to have
to harvest tissue to do it.

665
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,000
How much of his liver would they have to use?

666
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,500
Given how much time we have.

667
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
they want to take all of it.

668
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,300
I've never seen a sunset like that.

669
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,800
the way it takes forever to go down.

670
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,100
It's like it doesn't want to give up the sky.

671
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,000
It's a pretty sky.

672
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,400
Worth holding on to.

673
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,100
I'm sorry.

674
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,500
What for?

675
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,100
For letting you believe even for a second.

676
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,900
that I wouldn't want to have another child with you.

677
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,100
I want to build a future for us lily.

678
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
I just need to get my feet under me first.

679
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,400
Well maybe if we stay here you can.

680
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
I mean it richard.

681
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,900
You love it here.

682
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
I don't want to stand in the way of that.

683
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,100
I'd sure hate to give up that sky.

684
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
Me too.

685
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,900
Are you even sure this will work?

686
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,100
Well.it's elise's only shot--

687
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
her and all the others.

688
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,400
We've got a matching donor lined up.

689
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,900
It's still a big risk.

690
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
but say the word and the liver's on its way.

691
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Okay.then.

692
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
You want to close this deal.

693
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,600
here's the fine print--

694
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,900
you want elise to go to school.

695
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,700
It's already done.

696
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,700
I talked to drandix.

697
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,700
They've agreed to open up a college fund in her name.

698
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,200
Sold.

699
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
Great.

700
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,400
Your mom put them in a vase for me.

701
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,200
She's a very nice lady.

702
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
They're very pretty shawn.

703
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
but you didn't have to.

704
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,700
Well I wanted to.

705
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
I hope jordan's not too upset.

706
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,000
No.

707
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,907
no.

708
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:44,595
Hey.

709
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,600
He's probably too busy with his pet superstar.

710
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Devon.

711
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,300
what are you doing thinking
about jordan and chloe right now?

712
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Hey.

713
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,800
hey.

714
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,500
You have no idea how I feel about him.

715
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
How deep it runs.

716
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,600
I worship jordan for everything he's given me.

717
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,000
for allowing me to be so close to him.

718
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,000
He took me to a place I never thought possible.

719
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,600
Devon.

720
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,700
are you telling me that you and jordan.

721
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,800
jordan's heart is full of love.

722
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,600
He shares that love with me.

723
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,800
It's an honor.

724
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,900
An honor that chloe doesn't deserve.

725
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,100
She's not a real student of jordan's.

726
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,700
Billy?

727
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,900
God.what happened to you?

728
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,700
At the shop the other night.

729
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,900
I got clipped by a car on the way out of the parking lot.

730
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,200
But you were wearing your helmet.weren't you?

731
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,800
Yeah.

732
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,400
Doctors said it saved my life.

733
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,900
How'd you know that was going to happen to me?

734
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Children's intuition.

735
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,500
I'm glad you're okay.

736
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,500
Yeah.

737
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,500
Me too.

738
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
It's a shame to lose you so soon.

739
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,100
Sucks huh?

740
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,800
I thought my atlanta dates were pushed.

741
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,200
Now they're threatening to sue if I don't show.

742
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,000
You've made such progress
in such a short period of time.

743
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,600
Yeah.

744
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,600
Believe me.that doesn't happen very often.

745
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,600
Well.

746
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,600
I sure as hell hope not.

747
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,300
You know me jordan--

748
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,700
I like feeling special.

749
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
You are.

750
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
This was amazing.

751
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I can't wait to get back here.

752
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,400
Goodbye.

753
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,300
Talk about a quick study.

754
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
Third key status in less than a week huh?

755
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Noblesse oblige shawn.

756
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
She benefits and so do we.

757
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,200
It's too bad all of the women that
you screw don't share the same benefits.

758
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
That's cheap and childish.

759
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,000
I expect more of you.

760
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,700
I know the feeling.

761
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,300
I am so sorry you two.

762
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,900
What's wrong?

763
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,800
It's david.

764
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,500
He just looked on the website for the 4400s.

765
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,900
It said that you two were missing.

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
that you hadn't reported
in the way you were supposed to.

767
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,300
I heard him on the phone just now.

768
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,200
He's reporting you guys to the government.

769
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,600
Sorry about that idiot david.man.

770
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,300
I would have loved to have you two around.

771
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Thanks for putting us up.

772
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,500
Uh-uh.I can'T.

773
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,100
take it.man.

774
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,900
Call it a down payment on your next house.

775
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,200
wherever that may be.

776
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,200
Hope you find a safe place.

777
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,000
I thought it was here.

778
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,400
Is my dad going to be all right?

779
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Well.he's going to be in intensive care for a while.

780
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,000
but the transplant.it went well.

781
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,000
Your dad's a hero.

782
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,900
I'm going to tell him that when he wakes up.

783
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
If you have something to say.

784
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,100
now would be a good time.

785
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
You know what?

786
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
You want to hand out keys like they're junk mail.

787
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,700
you be my guest.

788
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
That woman will play to 20.000 people every night.

789
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,500
wearing our insignia.promoting our image.

790
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,700
Image?

791
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,700
How does nailing your
secretary help our image.jordan?

792
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,700
I'm not perfect.

793
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,500
I never pretended--

794
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't need perfection!

795
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,400
I just want you to stop giving me reason
to think of you as some kind of hypocrite.

796
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,700
When you're running this place.shawn.

797
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,700
you can behave as nobly as you'd like.

798
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,700
Meaning what?

799
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,500
Meaning one day all of this will be yours.

800
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,500
The paperwork's been drawn up.

801
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,300
The lawyers know what to do.

802
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
Everything's in place.

803
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
But you're not going anywhere?

804
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
Nevertheless.

805
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,066
I sleep better knowing my life's
work is in the hands of the saintly.

806
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:34,100
the unsullied shawn farrell.

807
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
So we thought we had a cure
for the world's obesity problems.

808
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,700
Yeah.and instead.
we've got two dead bodies.

809
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,000
a hundred other people in recovery.

810
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,700
and one corporation scrambling to cover its ass.

811
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,300
It looks like the great 4400 gold rush is over.

812
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Making the point of this little exercise what.exactly?

813
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,800
Well.maybe they got it wrong.

814
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,100
They thought they had a cure.but they didn't.

815
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I mean.they're from the future.

816
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,800
but they're still human beings.right?

817
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
Let's not rush to judgment.

818
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,900
We know rapid weight loss is
the effect on the human body.

819
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,100
but if the purpose of this protein is
to provoke metabolic chemical change.

820
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
it could have other applications.

821
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,000
Like.

822
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,700
I don't know-- breaking down toxic waste.

823
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,500
It could rid the ocean of pollutants.

824
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,200
maybe even restore in the ozone layer.

825
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,100
So in other words.

826
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,800
the possibilities are pretty much endless.

827
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,933
That's all they are right now though

828
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:27,839
possibilities.

829
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,800
I mean we're years away from practical use.

830
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,800
But with his new liver.

831
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,300
appelbaum won't be able to produce the chemical anymore.

832
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,300
He doesn't have to.

833
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,500
Now that we've got it isolated.

834
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
we can reproduce it and
find out what we've really got here.

835
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,200
So trent earned his golden parachute after all.

836
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,800
Maybe his daughter can study chemistry in college.

837
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,400
Hey.

838
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
All right.

839
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,800
There won't be any interruptions on my end.

840
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,700
Is this a good time to talk?

841
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,200
Yeah.

842
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,500
Okay.

843
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,900
Um.

844
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,600
Here to say thanks.

845
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
for getting me off the hook with the cops.

846
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,600
Look kyle.

847
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
I know you're going to make mistakes.

848
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
I did when I was your age.

849
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,900
The only thing I ask is you
let me help you learn from them.

850
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,700
Makes sense.

851
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,000
So I just need to know.

852
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,300
you told me everything that
happened that night.right?

853
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,500
Yeah.
