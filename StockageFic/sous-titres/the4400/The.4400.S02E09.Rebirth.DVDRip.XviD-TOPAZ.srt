1
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,207
We are not a threat.
We are salvation.

2
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,508
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,109
Previously on The 4400...

4
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,610
Remember me?

5
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,411
Nikki?

6
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:52,212
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.

7
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:53,613
Dan-- oh!

8
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:54,814
Danny!

9
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:55,723
Danny!

10
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,664
Stop blaming me for Nikki!

11
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,916
Shawn, stop it.
You're killing him!

12
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,990
So this whole "see the future" thing.

13
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:05,959
it doesn't just apply to
earth-shattering events, huh?

14
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:08,106
Not always.
That one.

15
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,119
Baby girl, you are my new lucky charm.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,460
Do you know what I bet?

17
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,113
Try my mother's diamond engagement ring.

18
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:16,939
and now it's gone.

19
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,772
You said winning didn't matter.

20
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,114
You said you liked me.

21
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,622
This was all just a test...

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,823
and you failed.

23
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,124
This doesn't sound like me, Lucy.

24
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,168
So change it.

25
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,160
You're the boss.

26
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:26,926
Matthew Ross.

27
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:27,627
Yes.

28
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,636
Jordan made it clear that
in the event of his death.

29
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,855
I was to step up front and center to help you out.

30
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,927
The ground just shifted under your feet.

31
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,230
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,030
The fact is that everyone
alive today owes Jordan Collier.

33
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,731
He had a vision to save the future.

34
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:46,132
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.

35
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,537
I don't know how I got there.

36
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,797
Please, believe me.
I had another blackout last night.

37
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,634
Kyle?

38
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:08,935
Kyle!

39
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:11,036
Yeah, I'm in here.
Hold on a sec.

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,637
It's 10 after 8:00.
You taking the day off?

41
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,108
I guess my alarm didn't go off.

42
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:20,764
You'd better get moving.

43
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,699
Your first class is at 9:00 on tuesdays, right?

44
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,142
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,476
Want me to get you some smelling salts?
Come on, buddy, it's time to roll.

46
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:27,217
Let's go.

47
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:29,597
Alana called last night.

48
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:30,769
I forgot to tell you.

49
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,051
She's in Barcelona, Kyle.

50
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,912
There's only like a 20-minute
window when we're both awake.

51
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:37,013
Any message?

52
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,614
Yeah, she... she, uh...

53
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:42,061
she bought a couple of paintings for her gallery.

54
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,285
and she misses you.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,216
- Next time she calls and I'm not here...
- Yeah...

56
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:46,536
... yeah, I'll try to remember.

57
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:47,675
I've got to get ready, okay?

58
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,700
Right, well, I can't wait.
You're going to have to grab the bus.

59
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:52,127
and don't leave your towel
on the bathroom floor again, okay?

60
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,819
Ben?

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,720
Tyler?

62
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,121
My god. You haven't changed.

63
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:33,322
50-year vacation will do that for you.

64
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:34,523
You look...

65
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:37,424
I look old. Especially next to you.

66
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,925
I had you beat by eight months.

67
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,526
Last time I saw you was...

68
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:44,527
... in a tent, outside of Sinanju, Korea.

69
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,828
May 11th, 1951.

70
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,029
You remember the date.

71
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,769
Sometimes I have trouble
remembering my grandkid's birthday.

72
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,753
but that's a day that I'll never forget it.

73
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,431
I mean, Lee hit you,
and you, uh...

74
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,632
I don't know, you disappeared.

75
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,533
So, what are you doing here, Ben?

76
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:17,034
You remember Milton Weinberg,
your old wingman?

77
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:21,635
Milt was the first guy who invited me over
to sit at his table in the officers' mess.

78
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,436
He passed on.

79
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,637
Parkinson's disease.

80
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,838
I'm sorry. I knew you guys were close.

81
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,639
And I'm sure he would
want you at the funeral.

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,347
Is, uh...
Lee going to be there?

83
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,142
We treated you as an equal.

84
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,306
but that wasn't good enough for you.

85
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:44,613
You had to cross the line.

86
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,944
None of us has spoken to Lee in years.

87
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:52,645
I'll be there...

88
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:55,446
out of respect for Milt.

89
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,447
Is he okay?

90
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,148
Better than okay.

91
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:15,197
Heart rate, respiration, reflexes...

92
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,668
all above average.

93
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,650
Say hello to your healthy child.

94
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:22,951
Edwin, I...

95
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:27,052
I can't even find the words.
We don't know how to thank you.

96
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,253
And he's going to know all about you.

97
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,654
the nurse who changed his life.

98
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,955
Enjoy your son, Mr. and Mrs. Ward.

99
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,856
Keep him safe.

100
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,758
Edwin.
Do you have a second?

101
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,559
I'm sorry, doctor.
I'm due in the nursery.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,060
It can wait.

103
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,261
I want to know what
you did to the ward baby.

104
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,462
We did amnio in the first trimester.

105
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,673
That baby was diagnosed
with Prader-Willi syndrome.

106
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,574
Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests.

107
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,375
You saw those results, Edwin.

108
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:06,122
The 15th chromosome was damaged.

109
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:08,739
That indicates severe
mental retardation at birth.

110
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:11,107
but their kid just scored
nine on the Apgar test.

111
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:14,308
A miracle is traditionally cause
for celebration, not an inquisition.

112
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,209
This is the fourth time this
has happened in the last six months.

113
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,610
In every one of those cases,
Edwin, you are the attending nurse.

114
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,111
And you're one of the 4400.

115
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,282
I'm not sure I see the connection.

116
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:31,348
Everyone's read about that
kid who's running the 4400 center now.

117
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,991
They say he's cured diseases like A.L.S.

118
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,985
Diseases no hospital in
the world can put a dent in.

119
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:39,985
He's a healer.

120
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,386
So are you.

121
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,887
For me, it only works in utero.

122
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,188
I can feel the damage
to their chromosomes.

123
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,289
I'm not sure exactly how it works, but,

124
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,100
somehow, I'm able to repair them.

125
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,401
That's incredible.

126
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,686
Dr. Hodler,
if it's all the same to you.

127
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,864
I'd prefer to work anonymously.

128
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:07,203
There are already rumors in
this hospital of miracle births, Edwin.

129
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,304
and people talk.

130
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,305
I don't think you're
going to have that option.

131
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,457
So long ago.

132
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,965
another life

133
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:24,558
I can feel your heart beat

134
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:29,641
it's not a dream remember us

135
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:33,788
I can see it in your eyes

136
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:37,416
we'll find our place in time

137
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:42,449
our place in time beyond the sun

138
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:46,862
we'll find our place in time

139
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:51,928
our place in time to call our own

140
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,507
Wait a minute.

141
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:12,106
It's Gavin Maar, I've read statement yesterday.
Why are they sending us these again?

142
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:12,815
Maybe we missed something.

143
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:16,016
There were a thousand people at
the party where Collier got assassinated.

144
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,917
Wouldn't you think that they could at least
send us a new set of completely useless files?

145
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:21,718
Any hot leads in there?

146
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,119
I didn't think so.

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
I'm pulling you off the Collier case,
just for the moment.

148
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,321
Something important, I hope.

149
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:30,022
One of the files in the morning
research report caught my eye.

150
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:32,423
There's an internet chat
room for pregnant women.

151
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,259
Yesterday, someone
started a thread about some

152
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,804
unexplained reversals of
birth defects at Mercy hospital.

153
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,325
So you're yanking us off Collier
to check out internet chatter?

154
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,826
There's a 4400 who works at the hospital.

155
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:42,927
Bingo.

156
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,828
Edwin Mayuya.
He was born in Rwanda.

157
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,619
So this guy's some kind of healer?

158
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,420
According to the internet.
Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog.

159
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,744
It's not like I mind.

160
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:52,745
It's great if he is, of course.

161
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:55,022
We should invite him to the center.

162
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,823
At the very least,
I think Mr. Mayuya merits a sitdown.

163
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:59,724
All right, set it up.
I'll be there.

164
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,325
Why don't you let me
handle the meet and greet?

165
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,126
I'll figure out if there's
anything to these stories.

166
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:06,220
In the meantime,

167
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,421
there's a move I'd like
you to consider making.

168
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,628
Call it the next phase in
your development as a leader.

169
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,229
Matthew, I told you,
I will read the art of war, okay?

170
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,930
I want you to call your mom.

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I know Jordan counseled you
to distance yourself from your family.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
Before Jordan was telling me anything,

173
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
my family had already distanced themselves from me.

174
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,700
Family dynamics are complex.

175
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
I don't think that a phone call

176
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,900
is going to lead straight into some kind of group hug.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Even if it leads to just dinner,

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
you're heading in the right direction.

179
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,700
But, Matthew

180
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,700
what is it to you?

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,900
Right now, every news desk in the country

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,700
is taking a long, hard look at you.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,900
They're looking for a weakness.

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
And because I'm not speaking to my family,

185
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,800
that implies what?

186
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,600
Everybody here is supposed to do likewise?

187
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
The press will spin it that way.

188
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,200
That's how they smear us with the "cult" label.

189
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,900
You want me to stir up all of this old business

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
as a publicity ploy?

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,000
You can take care of it now, or wait

192
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
and see it splashed all over the newspapers.

193
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Here's your mom's phone number.

194
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,100
In case you forgot...

195
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,700
Comes in and says,

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,100
"How do you think I rang the bell?"

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,500
We were just saying what a nice
ceremony this was. Old Milt...

198
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
... he left a great family behind.

199
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
He had a lot of love to spread around.

200
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,500
We thought you got killed,

201
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,500
or captured, maybe.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
There was some talk you went AWOL.

203
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
None of us put any stock in that.

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,700
Disappearing in a beam of light--
nobody thought of that, huh?

205
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Hey, uh, you in town tonight?

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, good. We're going to have our own
private wake for Milt down at Chauncey's.

207
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,000
You know he loved his bud,

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,600
so we're going to hoist a few in his memory.

209
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,500
You should come.

210
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
We'll kick around old times.

211
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,600
"Old times" was hardly more than a year ago for me.

212
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
You can fill in the gaps, then.

213
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,200
There's a lot of stuff we don't remember anymore.

214
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,700
Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers?

215
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,700
Wouldn't miss it.

216
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,400
NTAC has examined me several times already this year.

217
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,400
I don't think I'm due for another for?

218
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
three months, I believe.

219
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,200
You've never missed an appointment.

220
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,800
We appreciate that.

221
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability.

222
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,800
It's a kind of earth-shaking one, I have to say.

223
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,300
Forgive me,

224
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
but I don't see how submitting

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,300
to another round of tests helps anyone.

226
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,900
These mutations you can induce--

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,100
I believe they are not mutations, sir.

228
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
I believe they are repairs.

229
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Either way, our doctors need to take a look at you.

230
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
If they can figure out the way your ability works,

231
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,200
it could help a lot of people.

232
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,200
All right, then.

233
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,500
I will let your doctors poke and prod me to their hearts' content.

234
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,400
But I ask one thing--

235
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,000
that you allow me my privacy.

236
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I do not want to become a public figure.

237
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Well, that works for us.

238
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,700
I mean, whenever a new ability leaks to the press--

239
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,000
good, bad, or whatever--

240
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
it stirs a lot of people up.

241
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,700
Precisely what I hope to avoid.

242
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
I've seen firsthand the type of behavior

243
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
that irrational fears can provoke.

244
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,600
You left Rwanda in April of 1994.

245
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,800
That was the beginning of the Tutsis' genocide.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,900
The beginning?

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Believe me, I saw my fill of horrors
during those two weeks.

248
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
If I hadn't been granted asylum here in America,

249
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,300
I'd be dead.

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You were probably just getting used
to the place when you got abducted, I'm sure.

251
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,200
There were nights in Kigali
when I would have welcomed the chance

252
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,100
to disappear from the face of this earth.

253
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
So, uh, just let me get this straight--

254
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,500
you used Maia's predictions so that you could gamble?

255
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I didn't use her to gamble.

256
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,500
I used her to win.

257
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,900
You mean that you used her to cheat.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,300
You exploited a nine-year-old girl who loves you.

259
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
She was having a good time.

260
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,500
We both were.

261
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,700
But only one of you is an adult.

262
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
I can't believe that you're standing there defending it.

263
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,700
Well, this part of it,

264
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
I can kind of mount a credible defense.

265
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,200
What, so you haven't got to the part
that you're ashamed of yet?

266
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
These bets?

267
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
they were sure things?

268
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,900
but I needed money to make them.

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
You know mom's engagement ring?

270
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,900
You mean the one that she left to me?

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,100
The one I should have worn to my wedding.

272
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
I pawned it.

273
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,500
I just can't believe that I let Maia anywhere near you.

274
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
I want you out of here.

275
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,000
Lucy.

276
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,900
If I watch the news tonight,

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
am I going to be a happy man?

278
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,000
The stations I called all seemed very interested.

279
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,800
A 4400 who cures birth defects?

280
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,900
I'd cover it.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
I suppose the tip was anonymous?

282
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Believe me, I didn't want to leave my name.

283
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,200
The center outing a 4400 to the media?

284
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,500
Seems wrong somehow.

285
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,500
Well, it's not business as usual, I grant you,

286
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
but we leak it, we control the story,

287
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
and it beats letting him rot in the basement at NTAC.

288
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,300
Did Shawn go upstairs for the night?

289
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,000
He went out.

290
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Personal business, he said.

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,700
Good night, Lucy.

292
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Who is it?

293
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,900
Hello?

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
Mom, are you going to, uh,
are you going to open the door,

295
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
or should I use my key?

296
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
Shawn!

297
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
I would've-- I would've called ahead, but I?

298
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,500
Surprise.

299
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,300
Will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease?

300
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,300
That's the question on everyone's lips,

301
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
as it appears a member of the 4400

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,600
has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero.

303
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,200
Anonymous sources claim that Edwin Mayuya...

304
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,600
... a 38-year-old nurse at Mercy hospital...

305
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,800
Murderer!

306
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,500
... responsible for a series of miraculous healings...

307
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:00,800
Murderer!

308
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,300
... over the past five months.

309
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Murderer!

310
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,200
Murderer!

311
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
But if these claims prove true...

312
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
That's the man,

313
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,800
the one who killed your parents!

314
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,900
There's more.

315
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm bouncing around in the shotgun seat,

316
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,300
and Tyler here has got the gas
pedal all the way through the floor?

317
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Hey, we had 200 bucks on that race?

318
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,300
and Davis is 30 feet behind me.

319
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
and I can barely hear him screaming--

320
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,400
not that way.

321
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,100
That's where the landmines are.

322
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
If I knew he was serious.

323
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
maybe I would have paid attention.

324
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,500
Well, no one was going to follow us that way.

326
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
so we came in two minutes before the pack.

327
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,800
and we split the money.

328
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
We bought like five kegs of
Budweiser for the officers' club.

329
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Get a load of this.

330
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Looks just like it did back in the day.

331
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,800
Like you, Tyler.

332
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,100
Hard to believe-- 50 years go by,

333
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,500
we got the same guys,

334
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,800
and the same beer.

335
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,500
It's great to see you guys.

336
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
It's a shame it took Milt
dying to make it happen.

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,900
It's hard to find excuses
to get the whole gang together.

338
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,800
It's not exactly the whole gang, is it?

339
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
There's always Lee.

340
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Which one of you guys
is going to tell me where he is?

341
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,900
Come on does it matter?

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,700
Matters to me.

343
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Well, last I heard, he was in
a V. A. hospital outside of Bakersfield.

344
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
In bad shape for a long time.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Look, everyone here feels
terrible about what we did to you.

346
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Huh? Isn't that enough?

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,300
You're not going to get
anything out of talking to Lee...

348
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,200
Do yourself a favor-- just let it go.

349
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,400
I don't give a damn.

350
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I don't care if he?

351
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,500
What's up?

352
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
You know your miracle healer?

353
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,800
Turns out his real name is Edwin Musinga.

354
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,100
All his papers have been forged.

355
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
He's been wanted by the
Rwandan government since 1995.

356
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,400
Wanted for what?

357
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,700
Atrocities.

358
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,300
He was a doctor during the uprising.

359
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
He's killed a whole bunch of people.

360
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
I was a pediatrician at a clinic in Kigali.

361
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,700
I am a Hutu,

362
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,400
but most of my patients were Tutsi.

363
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
Many of my friends as well.

364
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
That called my loyalty into
question when the killings began.

365
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Some men from the military came to my clinic.

366
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,000
and they said they wanted
to broadcast it as a safehouse.

367
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,800
a place Tutsi could come
to be safe from the slaughter.

368
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,700
And they came?

369
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,600
By 3:00, the clinic was full.

370
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,500
Every room, every corridor.

371
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,500
all filled with frightened Tutsi

372
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,300
looking to me as their protector.

373
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,400
The same soldiers came back

374
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,300
with militia at their side.

375
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
It was a setup.

376
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Did you at least try to stop them?

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
The radio reports were claiming

378
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,100
the Tutsis had killed our president.

379
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
The anger spread like virus.

380
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
I got infected, too.

381
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,200
So basically, you stood by and did nothing?

382
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
All over the city, it was organized murder.

383
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,900
We never would have made it to safety.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
You could have tried.

385
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,900
Easy, Tom.

386
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Let the man finish his story.

387
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes, I could have tried.

388
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,500
That's true, I know that now.

389
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,700
They made me watch.

390
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,700
They killed them all.

391
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,200
I allowed them to turn
my clinic into a slaughterhouse.

392
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,700
But you didn't murder anyone personally.

393
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,800
True.

394
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
but not much of a distinction.

395
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,500
I knew what was going to happen.

396
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
I let it take place.

397
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm guilty.

398
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
My wife left me.

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,300
I have not seen her or my children since.

400
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700
Perhaps they will come to my execution.

401
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Your government's pushing for extradition.

402
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,600
You should be on a plane right now.

403
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
But your ability?

404
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,700
complicates things.

405
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
It would give me the
chance to make amends.

406
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,400
But I could save an infant
every day for the rest of my life.

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,300
and I'd still deserve
every one of my nightmares.

408
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
What was going on in there Tom?

409
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,400
Because if you were looking to shut
him down before he got his story out.

410
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,700
all that glaring was a
great way to go about it.

411
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
That guy should be
on his way to a tribunal.

412
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Instead, we're serving
him lunch downstairs.

413
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh, what, would you
prefer it if we starved him?

414
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I don't believe you're defending him!

415
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,300
I would never defend what he did.

416
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,900
but I would make an
argument for what he can do now.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,500
There's a reason the future
sent him back with this amazing ability.

418
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
But forgive me if I sound like?

419
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,400
I don't know, you?

420
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,900
No. No, not this time.

421
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
No, we're not talking about a criminal.

422
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
We're not even talking about a murderer.

423
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,800
We're talking about genocide, Diana!

424
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,800
Maybe the future doesn't
have a problem with that, but I do.

425
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,900
So if I don't believe that the world is
better off with a bullet in this guy's head.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm advocating genocide?

427
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,300
No.

428
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,900
There are people in Rwanda
right now who have lost mothers,

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,100
brothers, and children in that clinic.

430
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
And he stood by,

431
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,200
and he let it happen.

432
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
That's just like our government,

433
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
just like governments all over the world.

434
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
They all knew what was happening, Tom,

435
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
but nobody lifted a finger to stop it.

436
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah, and that was wrong, too...

437
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,200
... and so is this.

438
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,400
We've been working on
blind faith for a year and a half,

439
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,100
assuming these people
knew what they were doing.

440
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
but enough is enough.

441
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Yeah, we're saving the future,

442
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,100
but we're leaving justice behind.

443
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,400
Is it something that you
want to be a part of, Diana?

444
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,800
So Shawn just shows out of nowhere,

445
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
and all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop all of my plans

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,100
and head to some peace dinner.

447
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,000
We both know why he's turned up now, right?

448
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,000
You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together...

449
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,400
His mentor daddy figure gets killed,

450
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
and he comes crawling back to mommy.

451
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
Danny, why don't you quit whining
about Shawn?

452
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
He's your brother,
it's been a year, let it go...

453
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and
told me how brainwashed he is.

454
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,100
So if he's coming for dinner,

455
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,900
that's a good thing, right?

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
At least pretend it is,

457
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
for your mom's sake.

458
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,300
What's with the attitude, man?

459
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,900
I just don't want to hear you bitch anymore, okay?

460
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
I don't understand.

461
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why do you have to go?

462
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,900
Can't you just say you're sorry?

463
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,500
It doesn't always work that way with grown-ups.

464
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,100
Sometimes things gets so messed up

465
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
that "sorry" doesn't cut it.

466
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,300
Happens a lot when I'm involved, actually.

467
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
But if you only just leave,

468
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
nothing gets better...

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,300
Sweetie...

470
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,000
I used you.

472
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,800
It was wrong.

473
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
But I forgive you.

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,200
I still have to go.

475
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,300
Well, I know I cooked all day

476
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
but is my lasagna really that great?

477
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,600
You're both just stunned into silence?

478
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I haven't had this stuff in,

479
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
like a year...

480
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Good, you said something...

481
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Danny, why don't you give it a try?

482
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,700
All right, you know what?

483
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,100
That's it, Danny,

484
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
this entire night is about you and me.

485
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
That's why mom did this...

486
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,200
... you know?
What do you want me to do...

487
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,600
... say we're all fine and dandy?

488
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,400
It's not that easy.

489
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
I don't expect it to be,

490
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
but you and I obviously have some stuff
we need to get into the open.

491
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay, so you're going to apologize to me now,

492
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,800
is that it?

493
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,300
Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend?

494
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,600
The thing with Nikki,

495
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,300
I wish it wouldn't have happened that way,

496
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,200
What about almost stopping my heart,

497
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,200
or whatever it is that you did?

498
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,400
You feel bad about that, too?

499
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,900
You know what?

500
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
You want to hate me forever?

501
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,700
You be my guest,

502
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,300
But you're my brother,

503
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,300
and I came here to make things right by you,

504
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,300
What do you want me to do?

505
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,900
You need to punch me in the face or something?I mean

506
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,900
be my guest

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,900
Danny, don't you dare,

508
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,700
Just one shot, ma.

509
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,700
He deserves it.

510
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Look, he's even asking for it.

511
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,300
Are we okay?
Are we done?

512
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
We're letting him walk?

513
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,000
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths,

514
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,700
His degree of culpability is not for us to determine,

515
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,600
Okay, look, I can't ship him off to Rwanda,

516
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,200
Not yet, anyway,

517
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,200
In the meantime, his 48-hour hold is up,

518
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,400
and the 4400 center has hired lawyers
who are pressing for his release,

519
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
The press are all over this story,

520
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,300
Will he even be safe on the streets?

521
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,500
Yeah, a war criminal's safety,

522
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,100
that's my big concern,

523
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,100
Oh, it had better be,

524
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
In exchange for protection,

525
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Edwin Musinga has agreed
to continue coming into our labs,

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
We're babysitting him?

527
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,900
In exchange for a chance to study what he can do,

528
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years,

529
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
It sounds like a fair trade to me,

530
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Mm-hmm,

531
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,300
How long have you been feeling faint?

532
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,900
On and off, perhaps a month,

533
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
You should have told your doctors,

534
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,200
You forget, miss Skouris, I am a doctor,

535
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,700
I have been anemic since I was 15,

536
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
I'm certain--

537
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,500
You okay?

538
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah...

539
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,000
Stay with him, I'm going out.

540
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,300
Stay down, stay down, stay down...

541
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Take these people out of here...

542
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,900
I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes...

543
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Help!

544
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
Someone call an ambulance!

545
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,400
I think she's having a heart attack.

546
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,000
He did this to her...

547
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,400
Why are you protecting him?

548
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,700
He's a murderer!

549
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
How did this become public?

550
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,700
Well, I assure you,

551
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,700
it wasn't NTAC.

552
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them,

553
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
this could have been avoided.

554
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, yeah, that would have calmed them down...

555
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,100
They could have torn you apart.

556
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I think I have already demonstrated the lengths

557
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm willing to go in order to live,

558
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
You can add another victim to your list.

559
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,000
That woman is dead.

560
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,900
Okay, Tom, why don't you just go back outside?

561
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,900
Take a walk around the block.

562
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
You know why she was out there?

563
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,000
Huh?

564
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,600
Because this son of a bitch

565
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,000
let her son, her daughter-in-law, and about
eight of her nephews and nieces die,

566
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,600
Huh?

567
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,300
Isn't that right, doctor?

568
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,900
Tom, stop!

569
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,800
Isn't that right?

570
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,600
Stop!

571
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,000
I regret her death,

572
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,200
same as I regret them all.

573
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,900
Yeah, well, I'm sorry you feel bad,

574
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
but it doesn't change anything, does it?

575
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Tom, enough.

576
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,900
Let him go!

577
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,100
Now!

578
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,300
Let him go!

579
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,400
Look, Benjamin,

580
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't see what the problem is,

581
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,000
Edwin Musinga never killed anybody,

582
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,300
not personally, anyway,

583
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,900
I already told you which senators to call...

584
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,900
Get face time if you can,

585
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,200
do I have to fly out there and do this myself?

586
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,200
I thought not.

587
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,800
Blackberry me when things start to tip.

588
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,000
Full-court press is on?

589
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,600
I kind of wish I was out there,

590
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
cash in a few favors,

591
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,100
watch the hill fall in line...

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
Do we really want to be cashing in favors
for this guy?

593
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,400
He says himself he's dirty...

594
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh, he's worse than dirty,

595
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,400
he's practically a mass murderer...

596
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
So why are we wasting our time with him?

597
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,900
Somebody might come along who actually
deserves our help, Matthew...

598
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
He's a 4400,

599
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,400
guilty or not, he's a part of what we're doing,

600
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,200
they gave him that ability for a reason,

601
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,900
and I doubt it has anything to do
with being executed in Rwanda.

602
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,300
So let's say he didn't come back with an ability,

603
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,300
would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf?

604
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,500
You're the boss,

605
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
you tell me.

606
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,500
Breakfast is ready.

607
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,200
You know you're going to start talking to me eventually, right?

608
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,000
I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18.

609
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,900
She used you, Maia.

610
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,100
She said she was sorry.

611
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, there--there still has to be consequences.

612
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Your ability is a gift,

613
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
but it makes you a target, too,

614
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,900
and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you.

615
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,300
Besides,

616
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,300
you're not the only one your aunt April hurt this week.

617
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,200
But I showed her the ring...

618
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,400
... she wouldn't even have known about it
if it weren't for me.

619
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,100
Well, you should never have been playing with it,

620
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,700
which is why you don't get any tv this week.

621
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,100
What your aunt did was completely different,

622
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
and she knows it.

623
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,400
She made a bad mistake...

624
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,800
Isn't that what having a family's about?

625
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,100
Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake?

626
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,300
It doesn't matter if I forgive her,

627
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
I...

628
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,400
I just can't have her around you.

629
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,700
But we don't have such a big family...

630
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
We can't just kick someone out--

631
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,600
even if they mess up.

632
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Oh, Maia,

633
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,400
you've got to-- do me a favor.

634
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,300
Stop being more grown-up than your mom.

635
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,200
Now, just come on.

636
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,800
Come on, your cereal's getting mushy.

637
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,811
Come on, let's go.

638
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
I am not kidding you,

639
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
it was, like, the most intense
wrist-burn I think I've ever given.

640
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,100
He took it like a man, I'll give him that.

641
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,700
After that, we ate,

642
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
we talked a little bit.

643
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,500
I was surprised-- it was pretty much okay.

644
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,600
Good to hear.

645
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,600
I was glad I went.

646
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Well, you know what that makes you?

647
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Right.

648
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,600
Yeah, I'm a genius.

649
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't get it, Kyle.

650
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,600
Look, you're pissed at me when
I tell you I don't want to see Shawn,

651
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,800
and then I do it, and I tell you it went pretty good,

652
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,700
and I get a big shrug.

653
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
Nobody asked you to sit here, man.

654
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,400
What's going on, Kyle?

655
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
What, are you blacking out again?

656
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,300
Just forget it.

657
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on,

658
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,600
I'll talk to your dad.

659
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,600
I am not blacking out, all right?

660
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,800
I feel fine, you're not saying a word to my dad.

661
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,400
Yeah?

662
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,300
Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie.

663
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
I can remember now.

664
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,000
Some of the things I was doing during
those blackouts, I can remember.

665
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Like what?

666
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm in trouble, that's all I can tell you.

667
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm in big trouble.

668
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,200
Is there anything I can do?

669
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,200
Help yourself...

670
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
... stay away from me.

671
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,200
Got a cigarette?

672
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,800
You have emphysema.

673
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,300
I know I have emphysema.

674
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,000
What I don't have is a cigarette.

675
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Do you know who I am?

676
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,700
For a second, I thought you were the angel of death.

677
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Richard Tyler.

678
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
How was Weinberg's funeral?

679
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Simple.

680
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
Dignified, kind of like Milt.

681
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,400
Never did like his politics much.

682
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,900
You know, after you disappeared, he blamed me.

683
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,100
Fought me once or twice.

684
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,100
Of course, he was wrong.

685
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,600
So what are you here for?

686
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,900
Going to slap me around a little bit?

687
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,700
Shut off my oxygen tank?

688
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Uh...

689
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,900
... you don't make a very appealing target
these days, Lee.

690
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,800
What, then?
Looking for an apology?

691
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,100
When I first got back,

692
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you.

693
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,800
All the things I would do to you
if I ever saw you again...

694
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,100
Oh...

695
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,200
You want vengeance.

696
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,900
Well,

697
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,600
sorry to disappoint you,
that's not going to work out either.

698
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,700
Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could.

699
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,900
Time kicks everybody's ass, Lee.

700
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
Get you too, eventually.

701
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,600
Caught up with old Milt,
didn't it, for sure...

702
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,400
At the funeral,

703
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,700
those guys were tripping over
each other to say sorry.

704
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,700
But you've had 50 years to dwell on what you did...

705
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,300
I didn't like hitting a fellow officer,

706
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,900
but you gave me cause.

707
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,500
I ate beside you, I fought beside you,

708
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,900
but when you took up with a white woman,

709
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
you crossed the line.

710
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,800
That's what you said back then.

711
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm saying it again now.

712
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,200
The world's changed, Lee, or haven't you noticed?

713
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,900
The world, maybe, not me.

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,100
And how's that working out for you?

715
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,500
I stopped by your room...

716
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,800
... no cards...

717
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,200
... no flowers...

718
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,500
The lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor.

719
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
You know,

720
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,400
I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes.

721
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
You always did stick to your habits, Lee...

722
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,600
... even after they started to kill you.

723
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,700
So long.

724
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,700
They're not just statistics, Diana...

725
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
... he let that happen.

726
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,300
I know what he did,

727
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,900
and I don't need you to rub my nose in it.

728
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,700
It's worth putting the faces to the numbers.

729
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,600
We've got a problem.

730
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
The state department has decided to fight extradition.

731
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,200
They're going to argue special circumstances.

732
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,600
So Edwin gets a pass?

733
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,900
And who knows how many kids get a shot at a normal life?

734
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,600
No, not as many as we'd hoped.

735
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works,

736
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,900
forget about replicating it.

737
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
And I just got his med eval.

738
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,800
It turns out he's in bad shape.

739
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Well, he told me he's anemic,

740
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,700
and he couldn't sleep...

741
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
No, no, it's worse than that.

742
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,200
This ability, every time he rearranges a fetal chromosome,

743
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,900
he's damaging his own.

744
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
So if he keeps healing...

745
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,200
It's going to kill him.

746
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Listen, if you don't want to talk about what you did,

747
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,900
I'm not going to try to force you to.

748
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
But I guarantee you, whatever it is,

749
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
there's a way out of it.

750
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
That's easy to say, You don't know what it is.

751
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,600
So tell us.

752
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
How can we help you if we don't know what's going on?

753
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,700
I didn't ask for help.

754
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
In fact, I told you not to mention it to anyone, Danny.

755
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,700
And I'm not "anyone".

756
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm your friend.

757
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,500
Stop saying that, okay?

758
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,400
I know you two mean well,

759
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,900
but you don't have a goddamn
clue what you're talking about.

760
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,300
I have to deal with this on my own.

761
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,500
We get it,

762
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,900
on your own, absolutely,

763
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
and we're going to help you do that.

764
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,000
I think what he's trying to say

765
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,800
is if you need some time to clear your head and
get away from everything so you can figure stuff out,

766
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,300
I can make that happen.

767
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,900
Come to the center with me, Kyle...

768
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
You're turning this into a recruiting drive?

769
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,800
That's not what I'm talking about.

770
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,200
You will have the space you need,

771
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,700
no one will bother you...

772
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,600
Kyle, if you ever get to the point where you
feel like you want to talk to somebody,

773
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,000
we have counselors,

774
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,400
therapists, lawyers.

775
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,900
It was worth a try, man...

776
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,500
... because whatever you're doing right now,
it's not working.

777
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,300
My car is outside.

778
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
You can come with me right now, if you want.

779
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
Okay.

780
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
Just let me... I got a couple of things to take care of...

781
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,600
... get a leave of absence from school, stuff like that.

782
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,900
I'll meet you there tonight.

783
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,700
And I'll be waiting.

784
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Okay.

785
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
Thank you, guys.

786
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
How much time do I have left?

787
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,800
Well, that's difficult to say.

788
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,100
I mean, your genes are mutating
every time you heal a fetus...

789
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
... there's an indication of heart disease developing...

790
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,900
... you have spinal irregularities on your MRI...

791
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,600
If you keep healing, maybe a year, maybe less...

792
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,900
And if I stop?

793
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Oh, well, I mean, if you stop healing,

794
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,300
then there's no reason for the state
department to fight the extradition.

795
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You'll be handed back to the Rwandan government.

796
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,100
Who will have me tried and sentenced with all dispatch.

797
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,000
So...

798
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,300
... either choice that I make leads to my death...

799
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,100
Yes, that's right.

800
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,200
It would seem my abductors have
quite a perverse sense of humor.

801
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
I will, of course, continue to heal

802
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,200
for as long as my body allows...

803
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
At least then, my death will have a
purpose other than vengeance.

804
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in.

805
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,100
They'll try and slow your decline,

806
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,600
but you really should come with us,

807
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,600
because we have some of the best
physicians in the world on payroll...

808
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
Miss Skouris, if you're offering me a bed at NTAC...

809
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,200
... I'm afraid I have to refuse.

810
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,200
I did not pass up one prison so I can die in another.

811
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,700
There is one place you could go.

812
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,500
NTAC medical's going to need him five days a week,

813
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,200
so I'll get you the schedule.

814
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,700
We'll make sure he's there on time, every time.

815
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,700
Edwin Musinga, this is Shawn Farrell.

816
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
He runs the center,

817
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,100
and you two have a lot in common.

818
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,800
Not a lot.

819
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,100
Just one thing.

820
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,800
One very important thing.

821
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,600
Did you tell him?

822
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,300
Yeah, he's going to keep healing.

823
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,900
Not that that surprises me...

824
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,500
I took him over to the 4400 center...

825
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,700
I think he's probably better off
there than he is at home.

826
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,800
How does it feel, Tom?

827
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Some babies'll get saved,

828
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,600
and you'll get your pound of flesh.

829
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,800
You really want to know?

830
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,300
I asked you, didn't I?

831
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,500
It feels like justice...

832
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,900
Hi...

833
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,900
How'd you find me?

834
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,400
Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things.

835
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
What's in Berkeley?

836
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,000
A tattoo shop that likes my work.

837
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,200
Oh, some friends I can force myself on for a while.

838
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,900
Listen, Di...

839
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,500
I said this to Maia, but...

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,900
I'm so sorry.

841
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,300
Well, it's nice to hear,

842
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,500
but it doesn't change anything...

843
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You are so deceitful, and you're
completely untrustworthy, and...

844
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,700
... well, you're not seeing Maia until
you've proven otherwise.

845
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,300
I wish I knew how to make things right.

846
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,100
Yeah, I wish I did, too.

847
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,100
And I do know it's going to take a long time,

848
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,600
but you're still my sister,

849
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,300
and you're the only one I've got,

850
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
and I'm, uh...

851
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,500
... well, I'm not giving up on you.

852
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,300
You bought it back from the pawn shop.

853
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,700
I know you always felt that
mom should have left it to you,

854
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,400
and tell you the truth,

855
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,700
I thought she only gave it to me because she...

856
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,500
... well, she figured that was the only way I was
ever going to get one of those things.

857
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,400
Hmm, that's a whole other
therapy session.

858
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,100
Di, I don't deserve this...

859
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,500
No, you don't,

860
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,500
but you're going to take it anyway...

861
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,900
One day...

862
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Maia's going to wear that ring to her wedding...

863
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,100
... and I hope...

864
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,300
... well...

865
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,800
... I hope you know each other again by then.

866
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,900
Yeah.

867
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,500
Kyle?

868
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
Dad.

869
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,000
I had to leave.

870
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,700
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,100
Kyle?
Hey, it's me.

872
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,700
Uh, where are you, man?

873
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
It's 2:00 A.M.

874
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,000
You're not here yet...

875
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,500
Listen, just-- when you get this,

876
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,900
call me, or just show up...

877
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,900
Okay? Show up...

878
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,100
All right...

879
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,700
Yeah, I know you two mean well,

880
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,100
but you don't have a goddamn clue
what you're talking about.

881
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,000
I have to deal with this on my own.
