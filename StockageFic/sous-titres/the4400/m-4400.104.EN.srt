1
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:04,929
Previously on 'The 4400'.

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:15,565
We're not sure what's
happened. There's something out there.

3
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:19,152
The light has gone and
thousands of people have appeared.

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,530
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You will be one of the teams

5
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:25,200
investigating what happened
to the returnees.

6
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,952
- We're letting them go.
- Letting them go?

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,247
We don't have a right to hold them.

8
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,126
Why disappear a little girl,
hold her for 60 years

9
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,587
and send her back,
able to predict the future?

10
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:40,381
- What were they thinking?
- Is there a 'they'?

11
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:43,468
Whoever sent them planned
for these changes to take place.

12
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:46,179
You're talking about a ripple effect?

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,724
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.

14
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,393
You haven't told your counsellor,
have you?

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,189
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,150
- If you're interested, come and see me.
- I'll be there.

17
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:02,904
Despite nationwide
protests, Homeland Security refuses

18
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:07,242
to divulge the names or whereabouts
of the 4400 living in the United States.

19
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:10,370
You don't do journalism,
You're getting in the way.

20
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,747
What are you going to do?
Disappear me?

21
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:15,500
- About last night...
- The kiss.

22
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,085
And other things.

23
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,170
We've got a lot to talk about.

24
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:23,591
I was reviewing Kyle's EEG
read-out and it seems last Thursday

25
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:26,553
he had a momentary burst
of increased brain activity.

26
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,312
Shawn, did you do something
to him? Talk to me.

27
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,068
- How long have I been in the dark?
- Kyle?

28
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:51,244
The results are inconclusive
but we must be missing something.

29
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,955
People don't regain consciousness

30
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,708
after a three year coma for no reason.

31
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,502
We don't care why this happened.
Right, Tom?

32
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,005
We're just glad to have Kyle back.

33
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:06,426
You've been prodding him for a week.
When can we take him home?

34
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:10,430
- I don't see why not now.
- That's wonderful.

35
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,932
But there is something else.

36
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,978
Patients like Kyle often have difficulty
adjusting to their awakenings.

37
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:21,149
They do best in environments similar to
those they were in before their comas.

38
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:25,111
In every detail. Places, the people...

39
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,447
All right, come on.

40
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,745
- Why are we here?
- We thought you'd be happier at home.

41
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:38,499
- Then, why take me here?
- Kyle, this is your home.

42
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:43,963
This is your room, Kyle.
It's just the way you left it.

43
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:47,884
OK.

44
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:54,265
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got you.

45
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,976
I got you.

46
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,405
This isn't my room.

47
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:13,659
And this isn't my house.

48
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:17,330
- Kyle.
- Kyle.

49
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,335
What are looking for, buddy?
What are you looking for?

50
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,255
- We can help.
- Kyle, Kyle, talk to us.

51
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:38,142
- What is he doing?
- I say we just let him work it out.

52
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,728
But he hasn't recognised his room.

53
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:44,357
Linda, the doctor told us
he'd be disoriented.

54
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,197
I'm glad you're moving back in.

55
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,742
I'll try to stay out of your way
as much as I can.

56
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,454
Come on, Jordan,
aren't you overreacting?

57
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,206
No, I'm not at all.

58
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:05,336
Publishing the names and addresses
of the 4400 is a crime, Barbara.

59
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:09,131
It's a violation of the privacy
of over 4,000 people.

60
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,051
Whoever did it should be prosecuted.

61
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,471
So, warning people
they may be living next to

62
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,682
a public menace is a crime...

63
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,064
- We don't want any.
- Shawn, it's your uncle.

64
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,191
Let me in.

65
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,032
- Uncle Tommy.
- Hey, Shawn.

66
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:39,745
- Come to take the tour?
- Quite a procession out there.

67
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:45,459
Yep. They started driving by the house
the day my name showed up on the Net.

68
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,879
They haven't stopped since.
Yey for us!

69
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,636
Well, I know this is hard for you, Shawn.
I just stopped by to say thank you.

70
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:59,307
We took Kyle home yesterday
and... I'm grateful.

71
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:03,311
- He's doing good, right?
- Yeah. He's got a lot of work to do but...

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,063
...he's awake.

73
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,735
Aunt Linda, does she know?

74
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,157
- About what I did, I mean?
- No, I figured you wouldn't want that.

75
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,162
Truth is, Uncle Tommy...

76
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,123
I don't know what happened.

77
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,711
I put my hands on him. That's it.
He woke up.

78
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,923
- He woke up and I don't know why.
- You see, Shawn.

79
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,844
This thing that you can do.
Whatever it is, we need to learn more.

80
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,055
Well how? How?

81
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,683
I could go into quarantine again.
They could study me some more.

82
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,894
No! I'm done with all that.

83
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,230
With the hypnosis and the dream
journals and the counselling.

84
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:52,818
I hear you. But I can be an ally.
Maybe I can help you.

85
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:02,119
I don't think so, Uncle Tommy.

86
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,459
That was some movie.
Biggest screen I ever saw.

87
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,338
And the sound and all those, er...

88
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,508
- Special effects.
- Yes.

89
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:21,597
- So, did you like it?
- Not really. But it sure did look good.

90
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,257
- Something's wrong.
- Down!

91
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:44,531
- The genie is out of the bottle.
- Three different bombings in one day.

92
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:49,077
Each targeting the 4400s
whose addresses were made public.

93
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,663
Wait a second.

94
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,254
- It's a pipe bomb, tripwire trigger.
- It's about as basic as you can get.

95
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,798
Amateur.

96
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:10,390
Diana, I just found part of the casing.

97
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,937
Mm-hm.

98
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,441
It's beautiful.

99
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,863
Shawn's name is on that list.

100
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,408
I had my sister upgrade
her security system, but...

101
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,911
Yeah, I'm worried about Maia, too.

102
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,332
Did you ever think about
putting her back into quarantine?

103
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:39,378
Yeah, I've thought about it.
I've even talked it over with her.

104
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:42,130
She started crying.

105
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,925
She wants to stay with me, Tom.

106
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,304
I'm glad it's working out.

107
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,473
Who would have thought?

108
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,269
How's Kyle adjusting
to being back home?

109
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,482
Still weak, his memory's a mess
but he's out of that damn hospital.

110
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:05,487
What does his doctor think?

111
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:08,281
He's stunned, just like us.

112
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,244
It's a miracle. I don't have
any other way of putting it.

113
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,248
What about Shawn?

114
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,751
What about him?

115
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,505
Where was he when Kyle woke up?

116
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,845
I have no idea.

117
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:38,145
All three bombs so far were
identical in design and composition.

118
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,105
Pipe casings, tripwire triggers.

119
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:42,566
I did a chemical analysis
of the explosive.

120
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:45,527
It's homemade plastique,
boiled down from bleach.

121
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:47,487
The recipe's on the internet.

122
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,239
Just like the list of victims.

123
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,117
I'd like to get my hands on
whoever leaked those names.

124
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,995
Come on, Tom.
Who do you think leaked them?

125
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:59,207
- Barbara Yates.
- Goddamn right. It's just her style.

126
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:02,961
Cheap, inflammatory
and dangerously irresponsible.

127
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll handle Yates.

128
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:09,426
You two back-trace hits on websites
that published these bomb recipes.

129
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,554
- We'll have the results soon.
- So will I.

130
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:18,393
- You own this entire complex?
- 80 homes.

131
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,812
Once we have this place off the ground,

132
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:24,024
I'm planning developments in Chicago
and Los Angeles.

133
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,820
I intend to provide a safe haven for
any 4400 in this country who needs one.

134
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:33,658
We're opening sooner than I planned
but the bombings make that necessary.

135
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,869
You do think big, don't you?

136
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,079
I'm a business man.

137
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:41,333
I've been given a second chance
to do something with my life,

138
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,461
besides make money.

139
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,672
Cos right now, that's just not enough.

140
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,260
Or maybe I'm having a mid-life crisis.

141
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,930
93 Tomberra Lane,
what do you think?

142
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,433
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're all beautiful.

143
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,145
Well, it's yours.
You'll be our first official residents.

144
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:06,483
Oh, we can't afford a house right now.

145
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,027
Consider it a gift

146
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:12,364
for the two of you and your new baby.

147
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,255
It's a small world.

148
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,967
You did it, didn't you?

149
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,886
Kyle waking up?

150
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,558
That was you.

151
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,770
You fixed him,
just like you fixed my hand.

152
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,693
- Have you told Danny?
- No, and I don't want you to.

153
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:53,113
But maybe if he knew
what you did,

154
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,323
he'd stop thinking of you as...

155
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,286
A monster.

156
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,626
I've been doing some thinking.

157
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,630
This thing between Danny and me.

158
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:15,260
- Maybe it was a mistake.
- I don't want to hear this.

159
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,221
It's not your fault.

160
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,266
I mean that.

161
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,437
Danny's sweet.

162
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,481
I like him, but...

163
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,860
...that's all.

164
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,154
He more than likes you.

165
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,325
I know.

166
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,381
- Dennis Ryland?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:57,343
I'm Warren Lyttel. I believe HomeSec
in D.C. Mentioned I was coming.

168
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,764
Oh yeah, they warned me.

169
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,142
Well, they're never happy.

170
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:09,063
They seem to think you need to be more
aggressive investigating the 4400.

171
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,108
I'm here to nudge things along.

172
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:15,111
"Authority to review all 4400 case files.

173
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,032
"Access to all meetings
and briefing sessions.

174
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,243
"Permission to ride with field agents
at your discretion."

175
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,039
- That's a pretty broad mandate.
- They're looking at five murders.

176
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,041
Three unsolved bombings.

177
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,960
Barbara Yates
bashing us all over the airwaves.

178
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,837
Seems to them you could use help.

179
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:36,299
I suppose it could look that way
from a conference room in D.C.

180
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,886
It looks that way from everywhere
except this glass tower of yours.

181
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,598
I have 1,000 returnees
within 75 miles of Seattle.

182
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:46,809
I've got two dozen agents
to ride herd on all of them.

183
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,604
You wanna help me?
Get me some more personnel.

184
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:53,733
You wanna help me?
Get D.C. Off my back.

185
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:59,989
But you're not really here to help me,
are you?

186
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,866
No.

187
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:06,913
- We're here to clean up your mess.
- Where did they recruit you from?

188
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,124
- FBI? NSA?
- Doesn't matter where I came from.

189
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:14,879
How long have you been
in public service? 15, 16 years?

190
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:19,884
And suddenly you got a shot
at a command of your own.

191
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,762
Well, you come and take it from me.

192
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,639
If you can.

193
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,287
Kyle, what's going on?

194
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,665
- They're lies.
- What do you mean?

195
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,004
These pictures, I don't belong in them.
These people, I don't know them.

196
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,172
No, no, no. Of course, you do.

197
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,635
Look. This is you at the zoo with
Grandma Fran when you were eight.

198
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,137
Remember?

199
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,265
And this is your birthday party
when you turned ten.

200
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,767
You remember George?

201
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:15,857
- He was my friend.
- That's right. That's right.

202
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:18,818
And Freddy,
you have to remember Freddy.

203
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,864
He was over here all the time
when you were little. Remember?

204
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,991
- Bugs Bunny.
- That's right.

205
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,786
- Exactly. He was crazy about cartoons.
- Don't touch me!

206
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:34,167
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm... trying to help.

207
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,002
It's not my memory.

208
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:40,381
You're my father. I recognise you,
but I don't know who you are.

209
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,675
It's like you're a stranger.

210
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:55,521
Kyle, Kyle.

211
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,566
Kyle, just look at me.
Just look at me.

212
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,779
- I need help.
- I want to help you.

213
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,990
- Why can't you help me?
- I'm trying.

214
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,243
I'm trying.

215
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:13,664
I'm trying.

216
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:19,043
The ripple effect. What about it?

217
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,921
Every time we stop by the theory room,
you and Marco always talk about

218
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:26,425
how every case we work on
has a ripple effect.

219
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:28,844
Every case but
the Friday Harbor murders.

220
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,180
What if these bombings
are that ripple?

221
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,768
Knox went from killing prostitutes
before his disappearance

222
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,812
to killing random women
once he came back.

223
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,649
- What if they weren't random?
- That's interesting.

224
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:46,278
We should look into Knox's victims.
See if we can find a connection there.

225
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:51,575
I can't condone these bombings,
but I understand the fear behind them.

226
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:58,040
The easiest way to stop the violence
is to put the 4400 out of harm's way.

227
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:01,794
Someplace safe for them and for us.

228
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,423
Now, I know to some of you that
that may sound harsh, heartless even.

229
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,259
And I assure you, I don't mean it to be.

230
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:14,431
Just as I assure you that
there are those among the 4400 who...

231
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:18,102
Truck's ready to go.
I won't be happy till we torch them all.

232
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:20,312
They can all burn in hell.

233
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:26,026
- Hey, I was listening to that.
- I'm sick of listening to it.

234
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:28,821
- She's on our side.
- That woman is a parasite.

235
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:32,616
She doesn't give a damn about us
or that our sister was murdered

236
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:35,369
by one of those 4400 bastards. OK?

237
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,705
Why don't you unload the fertiliser, eh?

238
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:43,836
Leave the air filter on.
Those damn fumes are killing me.

239
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,224
Kyle! Kyle!

240
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,601
Hey!

241
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,104
Hey!

242
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,775
It's good to see you, man.

243
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:13,949
What are you doing
sitting out here in the rain?

244
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:19,580
What are you staring at?

245
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:25,377
Listen, you're looking pretty good.

246
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:29,464
The way your folks were talking
I thought you'd be some kind of zombie.

247
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,805
They won't leave me alone.

248
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:40,475
Asking me questions,
staring at me all the time.

249
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:43,020
They're just glad to have you back.

250
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,439
My mom did the same thing to me.

251
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,030
My parents had you come here, didn't
they? To try to make me remember.

252
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,784
- No, Kyle. Hey!
- I'm going inside.

253
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:02,122
- I've got reading to do.
- You've got reading to do!

254
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,999
Kyle!

255
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,252
Come on! I just got here.

256
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,509
Look at you!

257
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:19,348
I could have bought a car in my day
for the price of this suit.

258
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:22,893
- How's it going?
- We've got a lot of work to do.

259
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,356
Five families moved in today.
Seven more by the end of the week.

260
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:31,360
Got half a mile of property line
to shore up. The fences are too short.

261
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:35,864
- Overhanging trees along the perimeter.
- Along the perimeter?

262
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,534
Well, as long as you're on the job,
I feel safe and so does the baby.

263
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:42,579
Two happy residents.
That's a start.

264
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:48,627
It has been a crazy day.
No, my assistant's out.

265
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:52,381
My phone sheet is a mile long.
I never got to the end of it. Anyway...

266
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:56,468
Miss Yates, Dennis Ryland
would like to speak with you.

267
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:05,227
Dennis.
What a pleasant surprise!

268
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:11,358
Well, this is a bit theatrical,
don't you think?

269
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:14,027
- Read this.
- What is it?

270
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:18,073
- It's a story. A good one.
- About the 4400?

271
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,578
No, about a TV talking head that was
involved in a car accident last year.

272
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:26,123
A hit and run, actually.

273
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,334
It was really ugly.

274
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:32,629
The pedestrian she hit died instantly.

275
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:38,385
It was a shame.
He was 40 years old, father of three.

276
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,556
No wonder she spent
so much money covering it up.

277
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:43,890
So...

278
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,229
Are you blackmailing me, Dennis?

279
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:54,776
I shut up about the 4400 and this
envelope goes in a vault somewhere?

280
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,903
Not good enough, Barbara.

281
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:02,909
- What do you want me to do?
- It's too late for you to do anything.

282
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:06,163
I gave you a chance and you refused.

283
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,837
Steve Smizick from
the D.A.'s office wants to talk to you.

284
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,756
He's going to charge you
with vehicular manslaughter,

285
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:19,718
among other things.

286
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,973
Look, face it.

287
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,394
Shutting me up is not going to make
the 4400 disappear from the headlines.

288
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:33,398
And eventually,
they will cost you your job.

289
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,609
We'll see.

290
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,778
Goodbye, Barbara.

291
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:59,674
Is this wisest move under
the circumstances, Mr Collier?

292
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:02,844
All these 4400s in the same place
is a target.

293
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,806
There are always dangers.
That's why I hired the security team.

294
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:10,769
Mr Tyler, I know you're trying to protect
your family, but you must realise

295
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:14,147
that by staying here,
you could be in serious danger.

296
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:15,398
Maybe.

297
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,112
But you know I was born in 1922,
in Missouri.

298
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,491
And my skin was as black, then,
as it is now.

299
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:29,579
So, I've had to worry about fire
bombings and beatings my entire life.

300
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:32,582
And if there's anything I learned,
it's this.

301
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:36,294
Eventually a man's got to take a stand.

302
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:38,505
I'm making mine right here.

303
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:24,092
...a sprained ankle.
- To the other side.

304
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:28,680
- Maia, how did you do today?
- Miss Skouris, can we talk?

305
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:31,808
Well, give us a sec. Can you?

306
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,644
Sorry I'm late again.
Please understand...

307
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,189
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.

308
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:42,277
We have to consider
the safety of the other students.

309
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:45,155
- Has Maia been a problem?
- Not at all. She's lovely.

310
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,031
But it's the bombings.

311
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:51,536
With Maia's name on that list we can't
risk having her here at school. I'm sorry.

312
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,914
I understand.

313
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:04,257
I'm sorry, Maia.
We'll find someplace else, I promise.

314
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:08,511
- It'll be OK.
- No, it's not OK. It's wrong.

315
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,683
No, I mean, someone's coming
who will make everything better.

316
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,729
We just have to wait a little longer.

317
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,160
Oh, you got too warm.

318
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:36,581
Come on. Let's look pretty.

319
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,335
Don't you want to look pretty?

320
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:47,258
That's better.

321
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:16,664
- Is that a blasting cap?
- It's a commercial detonator.

322
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:20,001
It'll be easier to trace
than a bottle of bleach.

323
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:24,505
We'll send it to the lab. It needs serial
numbers. Or a purchaser would be nice.

324
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:27,800
What do you have on the victim?

325
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:32,388
Mary Denneville. 27-years-old.
The flower shop was her father's.

326
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:36,976
She disappeared in 1999 but picked up
her life right where she left off.

327
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,769
Until today.

328
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:45,943
Are the 4400 that frightening to people?
Are we too close, so we don't see it?

329
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,114
Something like this isn't fear.
This is hate, pure and simple.

330
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:55,745
Baldwin.

331
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:00,041
Right now!

332
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:05,630
- What?
- We have to go in.

333
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,062
Nikki.

334
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,273
Shawn.

335
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:30,529
- There's something I need to tell you.
- I know.

336
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:36,035
- I saw you and Danny talking yesterday.
- I just... want to make one thing clear.

337
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:42,708
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you. OK?

338
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,086
OK.

339
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:48,798
Do you ever feel like you just...

340
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:53,135
...wanted to get away
from your life for a while?

341
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:56,389
I did that for three years.
I don't recommend it.

342
00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:00,601
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

343
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:05,815
Find a quiet place where you
can pretend that... things are simple.

344
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:10,611
That nobody's angry at you,
or hurt or sad.

345
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,658
I know just the spot.

346
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,539
Come on. I'll take you. Yeah?

347
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,749
- Yeah.
- OK.

348
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:29,547
I've been studying your case files.

349
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,341
You're the first investigative team
I've talked to,

350
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,094
but it seems like
you're the right place to begin.

351
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:38,014
Where shall we start,
Orson Bailey, Oliver Knox?

352
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,307
How about Maia Rutledge?

353
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:44,270
Age eight. Disappeared in '46.

354
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,814
What about her?

355
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:51,819
It says here her foster parents returned
her to quarantine, no reason given.

356
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:56,198
Then there's all these reports of
her making predictions that come true.

357
00:27:56,365 --> 00:28:00,119
Next thing, she's been removed from
quarantine by one of our field agents.

358
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,955
I believe it goes on to say,
"For further study".

359
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:07,126
But you haven't filed any other reports
though, have you?

360
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:10,880
All of this was approved by Ryland.
I don't see what the problem is.

361
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:16,844
Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17.
Disappeared in April of 2001.

362
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,222
It's a little thin. Isn't it, Tom?

363
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:25,186
Why don't you accuse us of whatever
it is and let us get back to work.

364
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:27,897
You two are good field agents.

365
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:32,443
But it was a mistake to let two people
with such obvious conflicts of interest

366
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,612
to remain on the 4400 investigation.

367
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,408
This is not a conflict of interest, it is
a window into these people's lives.

368
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:43,245
You have a gang task force,
you want people on it who know gangs.

369
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:47,833
We know the 4400 better than anyone.
That's why we're on this case.

370
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,464
- Nice spin. Is this what Ryland thinks?
- Is that all your after? Ryland?

371
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:59,386
You know it's ironic. The North-West
Division used to be a backwater.

372
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:05,643
It was given to Ryland like a pat on
the back for a career of good service.

373
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:09,772
A quiet place where he could ride out
his last years before retirement.

374
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:15,277
But his free ride ended the night
the 4400 showed up by that lake.

375
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:19,657
Now there's going to be a change
around here, whether you like it or not.

376
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:23,619
You can either be part of it
or you can get swept aside.

377
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,462
- Lily Moore to see you.
- Uh, send her in.

378
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:42,054
- Lily, what can I do for you?
- Um...

379
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:48,936
Yeah, Chilean sea bass?
Tenderloin medallions? Lobster sushi?

380
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:53,190
Jordan, I just asked if I could use the
common area for our support group,

381
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:57,027
I didn't mean for you to cater it
like a black tie dinner.

382
00:29:57,194 --> 00:30:00,698
People want to eat whether
they're wearing tuxedos or not.

383
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:03,867
It's going to be
a really emotional night.

384
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:08,622
These people are like me. Their family
reunions didn't turn out as planned.

385
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:10,958
It's all paid for.

386
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:15,963
Anyone ever tell you
you're a control freak?

387
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,048
Once or twice.

388
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:21,885
Or that throwing money
at people might make them question

389
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,304
what you want in return?

390
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,017
That sounds awfully serious.

391
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,227
If I've made you uncomfortable...

392
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:36,316
It's just... you go so far out of your way
to make sure I'm taken care of.

393
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:42,990
You give me for than I've thought about,
or asked for or needed.

394
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:50,330
You know I'm in love with Richard, right?

395
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:55,961
Lily Moore, you are a blunt woman
and I find that attractive,

396
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:58,964
which I know was not your intent.

397
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:01,884
Look, why would I try
to break up you and Richard?

398
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:08,307
One, I'm smart enough to know I'd fail.
Two, I just would never do that.

399
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:14,646
Lily, thanks for coming by and I hope
your support group enjoys the lobster.

400
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:20,986
The William Wayne Construction
Company bought the blasting caps.

401
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:24,990
OK. Check their employee list
with the names from the Knox case.

402
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:26,492
I'm already onto it.

403
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:29,912
- I'll call you back if I find your ripple.
- Thanks.

404
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:33,207
- How is he?
- You better see for yourself.

405
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:49,807
What are you doing, buddy?

406
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:52,351
I'm looking.

407
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:59,066
- For what?
- For me.

408
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,826
- This is the spot?
- Yep.

409
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:17,876
Me and 4,399 of my closest friends
popped out of a ball of light right here.

410
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:24,508
It's so pretty. I wonder why
they sent you back here?

411
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:30,889
Why not on the White House lawn?
Or in the middle of Times Square?

412
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:34,518
I dunno, maybe
they just appreciate a good view.

413
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:37,646
- You think?
- I have no idea.

414
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:42,109
- You're such a jerk.
- You're just figuring that out now?

415
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:46,113
- Hey, let me see this.
- What are you doing?

416
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,907
Doctor's follow-up. Just...

417
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:52,035
It looks good.

418
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:06,008
I keep thinking you're still fourteen.

419
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:10,178
I'm not.

420
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:12,472
I know.

421
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:20,814
Tom? I've found something.

422
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:33,451
What do you got?

423
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,078
Gone.

424
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,917
- We've got fertiliser.
- And tyre tracks.

425
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:44,546
They've got a truck bomb.

426
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,426
The tyre prints matched
the phone company's service trucks.

427
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:51,219
So, we pulled their personnel records

428
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:52,929
and found one Dean Keating.

429
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:56,099
As in Gail Keating -
Friday Harbor murder victim?

430
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:58,518
- Dean's her older brother.
- Not only that.

431
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:02,188
Gail's younger brother, Glenn works
construction and on his last job

432
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:04,816
the company was short
two dozen blasting caps.

433
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:08,069
So, a returnee kills their sister
and they get revenge.

434
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:11,698
And the 4400 go from being a threat
to being sympathetic victims.

435
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,326
Your ripple effect.

436
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,787
All right, put out an APB
on Keating's truck,

437
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:20,165
and don't let it
get to where it's going.

438
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:27,422
Come on. Where are you?

439
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:31,092
Mr Tyler, we're looking for a truck
bomb. Be on high alert.

440
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,886
Understood. Thanks.

441
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:38,016
We're running out of time.

442
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:41,561
There! Truck number 85. That vehicle's
assigned to Dean Keating.

443
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:43,271
And it's heading north on...

444
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:46,107
Aurora.
Heading into Richmond Highlands.

445
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:49,319
We need a list of all the 4400s
in Richmond Highlands.

446
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:52,906
There's only one 4400 in that area.
It's Tom's nephew.

447
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:54,449
Tom, hold up!

448
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:03,500
Operations. Patch me through
to that phone number again.

449
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,004
Farrell residence.
We're not in. You know the drill.

450
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:13,802
Susan, Shawn, Danny. If you
can here this, get out of the house!

451
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:16,095
Is anyone there?

452
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:27,440
There it is. Number 85.
Get us down. Now!

453
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,077
Put your hands where I can see them!

454
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:42,455
Out of the truck. Keep
your hands where we can see them.

455
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:49,754
- What the hell...
- Shut up! Stay down.

456
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,757
- You're not Keating. Where is he?
- He didn't come in.

457
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:56,678
No explosives. The truck's clean, Tom.
They switched vans.

458
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,973
It's not Keating. Come on! Let's go.

459
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,938
We got the wrong van.
Re-check all principle targets.

460
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,940
Report anything suspicious.

461
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:32,589
We've got a 12ft step van
parked near Collier's housing complex.

462
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:34,424
No plates, new paint job.

463
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:38,261
That's what the phone company
uses. Patch us through to Collier's.

464
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:41,139
- Use any line you can find.
- The phones are dead.

465
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,857
Code Red. Main gate.

466
00:37:57,572 --> 00:38:00,116
There they are. Get me over there.

467
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:29,270
Go!

468
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,398
I've set it. Go!

469
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:25,868
Hands over your head!
Down! Down! Down! Down!

470
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:28,204
On your stomach now!

471
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,748
You are being arrested as a terrorist.

472
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:34,669
You will be treated as
an enemy combatant.

473
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,547
You do not have the right to an attorney.

474
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:40,299
Whatever you say
will damn sure be used against you!

475
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:07,243
Doctor MacMillan to...

476
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,498
Doctor Mayhew. I'm Warren Lyttel
from Homeland Security.

477
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:15,376
I need to ask a
few questions about Kyle Baldwin.

478
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,380
- Tom, you have to come quick!
- What?

479
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,132
Just come!

480
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,112
Kyle!

481
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,158
What are you doing?

482
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:50,202
I know what's wrong with me.

483
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:53,873
- I finally understand.
- What is it, Kyle?

484
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:56,375
Tell me!

485
00:40:57,084 --> 00:41:00,212
There's only one explanation.

486
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:03,883
Why I remember everything,
but can't feel anything.

487
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:09,013
Why all the people in my life
seem like strangers.

488
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:14,143
They're not strangers.

489
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,813
I am.

490
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:22,068
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
