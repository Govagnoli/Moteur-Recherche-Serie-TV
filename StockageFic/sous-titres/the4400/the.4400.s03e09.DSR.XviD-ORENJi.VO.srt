00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>We're not a threat,</i>
<i>we're salvation.</i>

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,900
The world
will have to deal with us.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,900
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
you're so sweet.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,600
I wish i could take you with me
when i go,

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
but i can't.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,800
[Diana]: Yesterday,
a few patients were compelled

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,900
to work on this thing,

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
and today,
it's the entire hospital.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,900
If we get tess
out of here,

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,800
do you think
this compulsion will fade?

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm injecting myself

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>with a modified version</i>

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
<i>of the promicin serum.</i>

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,900
<i>I will have taught my body</i>
<i>how to produce</i>

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>promicin,</i>

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,700
<i>and then i will be</i>
<i>the first</i>

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,900
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Enough running, dr. Burkhoff.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,800
You need to come with us now.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,700
No.

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Stay back.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
I don't want to
hurt anyone.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
That's very reassuring.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll keep that in mind.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,700
No! No!

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,400
[Gasping]: No!

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,400
Mr. Tyler. Come in.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
What can i do
for you?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,700
I wanted to ask you

32
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
about your work
with the students here.

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,300
Sure.

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
I teach three classes,
history, art, and...

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
i'm not talking
about your teaching.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
I was talking about

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,100
the "counseling" that you do.

38
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
I understand

39
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,600
you use your ability
with the kids?

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
That's right.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,000
My ability is to help them
focus their abilities.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
It's pretty much
what i've been doing

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
ever since i came back.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
If a student
has a talent...

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,100
like all of our kids here do...

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,500
i help them learn
how to use it,

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
gain control of it,
build their confidence.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Does it work with adults?

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
It didn't used to,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
but i haven't tried it

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,700
since i've been
off the inhibitor. Why?

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,500
I developed this ability
a few months ago...

53
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,400
telekinesis.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
What a word, huh?

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,700
I can't even say it
with a straight face.

56
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,200
That's fantastic.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
I've just been pretending
it isn't there.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,900
I mean, i know
a little bit about it.

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,800
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects,

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
little stuff.

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
But when i'm mad or excited,

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,900
i can do a lot more
with it.

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,800
And you're looking to control it
when you're calm?

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Yeah, that's why i'm here,
i guess.

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
How many times

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,000
do i have to go over this
with you people?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
I have not been
injecting promicin

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
into anyone but myself.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
You're certain of that?

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,900
You're a world-class
scientist.

71
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,200
I find it
difficult to believe

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,700
you wouldn't build
a redundancy plan

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,800
into your experiment.

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
This isn't
your basic sleep study.

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,500
I mean, look at me.

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,300
Do you think
i'd have an easy time

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
finding volunteers?

78
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,300
No. I do not.

79
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,700
Oh.

80
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,300
You look like you're in
quite a bit of discomfort to me.

81
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,500
[Chuckles bitterly]: Yes.

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,900
As a matter of fact,
i am.

83
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Well...

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,600
you can relax now.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
The experiment's over.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
This will only hurt
for a minute.

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Bag him.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
We'll take him back
for the autopsy.

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Get dr. Burkhoff
up there quickly.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They promised results
by the morning.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
[***]

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,200
* so long ago, another life *

93
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,000
* i can feel your heart beat *

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,300
* it's not a dream
remember us *

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,500
* i can see it in your eyes *

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,800
* we'll find our place in time *

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,600
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

98
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,200
* we'll find our place in time *

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,300
* our place in time
to call our own *

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,100
Mommy?

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Mommy?

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,100
Are you okay?

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,600
Of course, sweetie.

104
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm fine.

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
Why wouldn't i be?

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,800
I had a bad dream,
and you were in it.

107
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,500
Well, you get in
and tell me about it.

108
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
You turned into
a monster.

109
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,300
It was horrible.

110
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
It seemed so real.

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
It was you.

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,400
But you
were different.

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,000
What kind
of a monster?

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,200
Nice.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Something
for the refrigerator door.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
You don't think

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
there's anything
to this?

118
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
It's not a prediction,
right?

119
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,600
Just a bad dream.

120
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,900
Well, i hope so,

121
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,200
but when your daughter's
a precog,

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,300
you don't want her
giving you a picture like this.

123
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,700
Hello.
This is skouris.

124
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Well, thank you
for calling me back.

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,900
Let me know
if you see him,

126
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
all right?

127
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
Everything okay?

128
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,500
Maybe.

129
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm not sure.

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
I mean, that was
the 4400 center.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
I was hoping maybe
they'd seen dr. Burkhoff.

132
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,100
I stopped by
his apartment yesterday,

133
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,400
and he wasn't home.

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,900
Uh, diana.

135
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,600
Why would you be stopping by
dr. Burkhoff's apartment?

136
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You actually saw

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
the wound in kevin's hand
heal over?

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes.

139
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
He pulled the scalpel out,

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
and it was gone
within seconds.

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
He's developing
an ability.

142
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
I mean, he's close
to it, anyway.

143
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
He said
it comes and goes.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,300
What?

145
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,500
Anyone else developing
a 4400 ability

146
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,600
i should know about?

147
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
I should have
told you earlier.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
You're damn right
you should have.

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Got to hand it
to you, diana...

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,100
some people
play racketball

151
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
in their spare time,

152
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,600
maybe collect old records,
but you?

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You play igor
to the one man who...

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,500
Well, if he has developed
an ability, like you say,

155
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,600
maybe he really is
the father of 4400 technology,

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
just like the future predicted.

157
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,200
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
I thought we were...

159
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,200
and now i'm not so sure,

160
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
and that's what
i'm worried about.

161
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,300
Tom, what if
someone else finds out

162
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,000
what he's up to?

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Well, if he succeeds,
we could be talking

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
about the mass-marketing
of 4400 abilities.

165
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,400
A lot of people would
like to keep that genie

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,500
in the bottle.

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,900
Wouldn't make our jobs
any easier.

168
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,100
Are you...
are you okay?

169
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,800
It's just my allergies
are acting up.

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
I've already spoken
to his family.

171
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,700
They haven't heard from him
in months.

172
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,100
Okay, so who else
is he close to?

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
"I didn't know

174
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,100
"that cheshire cats
always grinned...

175
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,500
in fact, i didn't know
that cats could grin,"

176
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,400
said alice
very politely.

177
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,000
"You don't know much,"
said the duchess.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,400
"And that's a fact."

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
We'll finish this chapter
tomorrow.

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
I hope you all can make it.

181
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,700
I've been living
in a halfway house

182
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,900
for about
three months.

183
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,500
I got this job here
two weeks ago.

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,900
That's great, tess.

185
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
So they found a medication
that works for you?

186
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,000
So far, so good.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
I still
have my disease.

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
Schizophrenia
never goes away,

189
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
but i haven't had
any symptoms for a while.

190
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Hopefully i won't.

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,200
So these kids
you're reading to,

192
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
they're not going to try
and build a tower

193
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
to contact the future,
are they?

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't think so.

195
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,500
I can barely remember
all that now.

196
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,300
I'm still not sure

197
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,600
how i could compel people
to work

198
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,000
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm glad
it made kevin better,

200
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,100
but it was still so weird.

201
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,600
That's actually
why we're here.

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Have you been in touch
with kevin lately?

203
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
No.

204
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
I called him

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,900
when i first got out
of the institution.

206
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
We met for coffee,

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
but i haven't seen him
in months.

208
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
Is he okay?

209
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Well,
we're not sure,

210
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,700
but we'd like to
talk to him.

211
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
So, if he contacts you,
would you let us know?

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Well, of course.

213
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
When you find him,
will you have him call me?

214
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Sure.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,700
It's nice to see you
again, tess.

216
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,400
Bye.

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I just spoke
with the program coordinator.

218
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
She says the first segment
will be interviews

219
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
with some of the people
you've healed

220
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
and then
they'll bring you out

221
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,900
after the break.

222
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,300
She says
the emotional stuff

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,000
also plays well
with her audience,

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
so feel free
to cry or...

225
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
we'll see about that.

226
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,900
They're also curious
about the wedding.

227
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,100
She'd love it

228
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
if you answered
some questions...

229
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,800
let's keep the private life
private, okay?

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
[Woman]: Nick!

231
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Nick, please,
wake up!

232
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,700
Nick!

233
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,600
Nick, please,
wake up!

234
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, jesus,
that's nick crowley.

235
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, my god.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
You're that 4400,

237
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
the one
with the hands.

238
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Help him, please!
Nick! Nick!

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on, wake up.
Please!

240
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
If you're okay,
say something.

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Well, jim morrison says hello.

242
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
[Scattered laughter]

243
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,300
Easy. Easy, boys, easy.

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
You just saved nick crowley.

245
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
On behalf
of millions

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,100
of rock and roll
burnouts

247
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,200
all over the world,

248
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
allow me to thank you.

249
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,300
Any time you want to
lay these on me,

250
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
you just let me know.

251
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
It was a little bit big,

252
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
so i just had it resized.

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,400
It's perfect now.

254
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,600
I think
mom would be really happy,

255
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
don't you?

256
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Lily gave you
that ring.

257
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,700
I guess you can do
what you want with it.

258
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,100
I think it's perfect.

259
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Have you thought about

260
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,600
what you're going to say
at the wedding?

261
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,900
Usually, the father
of the bride

262
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,100
gives a toast.

263
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
Um...

264
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,700
well.

265
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
It's all been so sudden.

266
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,600
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.

267
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,500
That's okay.

268
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,900
I have a few thoughts.

269
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,300
There's an article
in this magazine on toasts.

270
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,800
Read it.

271
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I think i can handle that
on my own.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Dad, i want you to read it.

273
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Tonight.

274
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Hi.

275
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
I bought some food.

276
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,900
Let me help you with that.

277
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,400
Thank you.

278
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
My joints
are a little stiff.

279
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,300
Kevin,

280
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,700
why did you put your hood up
when i came in?

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You shouldn't have to
look at me like this.

282
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,900
Like what?

283
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Diana skouris and tom baldwin
came by the bookstore today.

284
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,700
They were asking
about you.

285
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,600
I figured
diana would be worried.

286
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,700
How did she look?

287
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,400
Okay, i guess.

288
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
A little sick.

289
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,100
Kevin, i felt bad
seeing her.

290
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,900
I don't like
what we're doing to her...

291
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,400
what i'm doing to her.

292
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,100
I don't like it
much, either,

293
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,700
but we are on the cusp
of changing the world...

294
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
for the better.

295
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,800
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.

296
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Kevin, it's already ugly.

297
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Someone shot you yesterday.

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
I know,

299
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
but the experiment

300
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,400
is worth the risk.

301
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
They woke me up
to do this.

302
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,200
You woke me up
to do this.

303
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,900
I have to move forward.

304
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,800
And to do that,
i need diana.

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
And i need you.

306
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,000
Is shawn farrell around?

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,400
I have something for him.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Oh!

309
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
I played that

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,900
when we were recording
my first album.

311
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
I've been holding onto it
for years.

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
You're really
giving this to me?

313
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
You saved my life.

314
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,600
Seems like a fair trade
to me.

315
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,700
So this, uh,
ability of yours...

316
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,500
it works every time
out of the gate?

317
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Yeah, pretty much.

318
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, my god.

319
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,800
I wish
they brought you back

320
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,100
15 years ago.

321
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
A career in rock 'n' roll...

322
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,300
sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.

323
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,000
You lose a lot of people
along the way.

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,700
One day you look up,

325
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,500
and you're the last man
standing.

326
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
You should take better care
of yourself.

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm not always around.

328
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
I feel like i owe you
more than a guitar.

329
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
We're playing tomorrow night

330
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
and i wanted to invite you
backstage.

331
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
You can hang out,

332
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,900
watch the show
from the wings.

333
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Really?
Sure.

334
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.

335
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
If i keel over,

336
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
you can always come out

337
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,500
and do your "hands of god" thing
for an encore.

338
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
It's cold.

339
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,400
You should
bring your jacket.

340
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,700
She didn't say anything
on the way over?

341
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
Of course not,
kevin.

342
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,700
She hardly ever does.

343
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,200
You're so brave.

344
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,700
I always wanted to
give it to you first.

345
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I thought
you deserved an ability.

346
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm sorry
it has to happen

347
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,900
without
your permission.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
Can i get this
started?

349
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,300
Give dr. Burkhoff your hand.

350
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,000
mommy
be late for school

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
if we don't leave soon.

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry, baby.

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,100
I slept through
my alarm.

354
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll be ready
in a few...

355
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Mommy,
are you okay?

356
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm fine.

357
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
I just broke a nail is all.

358
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Ew.

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Ew.

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hi.

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Hey, marco.

362
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,900
What are you doing down here?

363
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,400
Tom asked me to check out
dr. Burkhoff's computers.

364
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,700
Uh, you okay?

365
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
I heard
you had the flu.

366
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,600
Hey.

367
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,700
I thought
you were taking a sick day.

368
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,800
Would everyone please

369
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,100
stop treating me
like a plague patient?

370
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm fine.

371
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Have we learned anything
here?

372
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean.

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,700
Like, completely clean.

374
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,600
I mean, there're no saved files,
no records of anything.

375
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
It's like someone
took out his hard drives

376
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
and swapped them
for new ones.

377
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,900
So either he took them
somewhere...

378
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
or someone else has them.

379
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Diana.

380
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
Look at this.

381
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Is that...

382
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,500
kevin?

383
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Yeah.

384
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,400
My god.

385
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
These are the side effects
of the injections?

386
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,800
I haven't seen him
in a couple of weeks.

387
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,500
I had no idea
he'd gotten so bad.

388
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Think it's a self-portrait?
No way.

389
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
Kevin's hands
weren't steady enough

390
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,700
to make coffee.

391
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,100
Didn't tess like to draw?

392
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
I feel like i'm in
a staring contest.

393
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
It's okay.

394
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,300
I know it can be
a little awkward

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,700
at first.

396
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,800
So, sometimes
when i'm having trouble

397
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,000
getting started
with a student,

398
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
i'll take their hand.

399
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,500
It helps everything
get rolling.

400
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,200
You up for it?

401
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
Yeah.

402
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
I guess.

403
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,700
Just relax, okay?

404
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,600
Mm.

405
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh.

406
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

407
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
to be honest,
i felt a little awkward.

408
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,100
I, uh, i haven't
had someone touch me like that

409
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
since, uh...

410
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,000
my wife passed, and...

411
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,100
it's okay.

412
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Sometimes
it takes more than one session

413
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,100
to make headway.

414
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,300
[Distorted voice]:
Diana?

415
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
[Distorted]: Diana?

416
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,800
[Normal voice]:
Should i just

417
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
call you a cab?

418
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,300
I can handle this

419
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,900
if you want.

420
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,200
No, i'm okay.

421
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,900
Any sign of tess?

422
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,400
No, she hasn't come out yet.

423
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Look, tom.

424
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I made an appointment
with the doctor

425
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,600
for tomorrow morning,

426
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
but, for now, i'd just like to
stick with it, okay?

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,200
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.

428
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
It's like
i'm dragging myself around.

429
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,700
Here she is.

430
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,600
Come in.

431
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,900
Hey.

432
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,600
What?

433
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,500
Different look
for you.

434
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
"Look?"

435
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,100
I dressed like this
for 10 years.

436
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Hey, you're not going to ask
about the wedding, are you?

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,700
I am officially
taking the night off

438
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,300
from all planning.

439
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,900
This has nothing to do
with the wedding...

440
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,300
unless nick crowley's invited.

441
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,000
He's downstairs.

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Really?

443
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
No, i'm getting ready
for his show.

444
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,900
Maybe he wants to give me
a ride or something.

445
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,000
Uh, i don't think
that's it.

446
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Well, what?

447
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,100
[Slurring]:
I never get enough refills.

448
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,500
I mean, look at me...

449
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
What's he saying?

450
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,300
Nick has a prescription
for antabuse.

451
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,900
They're these pills

452
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,300
that are supposed to help him
cut back on his drinking.

453
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
He finally
tried some.

454
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
I guess
he overdid it, huh?

455
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
It's the same thing
he does with everything.

456
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.

457
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
Do your worst.

458
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,900
Please?

459
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,200
Come to my arms,

460
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,600
my beamish boy.

461
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Lie down. Lie down.

462
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,700
You're my little lifeline.

463
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,700
Kevin.

464
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,300
Dr. Burkhoff,

465
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,700
i've been worried about you.

466
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,900
What are you doing,
hiding up here?

467
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
My god.

468
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,800
Look at you.

469
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,300
Dr. Burkhoff,

470
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,900
you need to
come with us.

471
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
We're going to get you
some help.

472
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,600
I can't do that.

473
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
People are trying
to kill me.

474
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,700
What people?

475
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Who's trying
to kill you?

476
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,500
I think they work
for the government.

477
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,200
They don't work
for ntac.

478
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
Are you sure
about that?

479
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,400
Because i'm not.

480
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Listen, kevin.

481
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,600
You know us.

482
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,700
If you come in,
we'll protect you.

483
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,100
And, besides,
i'm not taking no for an answer.

484
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Come on.

485
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Actually,

486
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
i think
you're going to have to.

487
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Diana?

488
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,200
What the hell
are you doing?

489
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't know, tom.

490
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,100
I'm sorry.

491
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,600
Diana's not quite
herself right now.

492
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,300
She'll do
whatever tess wants her to.

493
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Tess,

494
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,300
will you get
his gun, please?

495
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,900
Please.

496
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,800
I am so close to finishing.

497
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,500
Stop trying to find me.

498
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,800
I have no desire

499
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,700
to hurt you.

500
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,800
Diana...
are you okay?

501
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Are you all right?

502
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,900
I don't know.

503
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,800
What happened?

504
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
You pulled your gun
on me.

505
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Tess?

506
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah.

507
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,900
[Groaning]: Oh, god.

508
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,400
What?

509
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,900
Something's wrong.

510
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,300
I just feel weird.

511
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh, my god.

512
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,900
What are those?

513
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,600
They're lesions.

514
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,700
They're just like
the ones kevin had

515
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,800
when he started
taking promicin.

516
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
We need to get you
to ntac medical.

517
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,300
If there's anything at all
to these experiments

518
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,800
dr. Burkhoff
has been conducting,

519
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
a lot of people in d.c.

520
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,300
Are going to want to
look over his notes.

521
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
These pictures
have already been circulated

522
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,900
to local law enforcement.

523
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,200
We're going to distribute them

524
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
around the neighborhood
near dr. Burkhoff's apartment

525
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.

526
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Maybe we'll get lucky.

527
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
So, what, we're supposed to
tell people

528
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,100
that there's some kind of
monster on the loose?

529
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,600
If anyone asks,

530
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
we tell them dr. Burkhoff
has werner syndrome.

531
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,900
It's a rare wasting disease.

532
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,100
Okay.

533
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,300
But do you really
think we'll be able

534
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,700
to bring this guy in
safe and sound?

535
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,900
I mean, some cowboy cop
sees this

536
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
stumbling
towards him,

537
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,100
you don't think
he might shoot first

538
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
and ask questions
later?

539
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,500
That's why we have to
get to him first.

540
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Whatever dr. Burkhoff
is guilty of,

541
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,300
he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.

542
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
The good thing
about his condition is,

543
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,200
it shouldn't make him
too hard to spot.

544
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,500
I don't know.

545
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,800
They're nice hands,

546
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
but they don't look magical
or anything.

547
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Making friends
already?

548
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Hey.

549
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
You've chosen
wisely.

550
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,600
I speak from experience.

551
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,800
The show was amazing.

552
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Thank you so much
for having me.

553
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
What are you
thanking me for?

554
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,300
The show would've been canceled
if not for you.

555
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Listen.

556
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I just had the best idea

557
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,800
during the encore.

558
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?

559
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And do what?

560
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,300
Well, you could start
with mischa

561
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,700
and work your way
onward from there.

562
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,400
[Chuckles]

563
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,

564
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,100
but i kind of have
a lot on my plate

565
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
here in seattle, you know?

566
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm supposed
to get married soon.

567
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
Well,
in that case,

568
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
you have to come with us.

569
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,800
It'll be like
an extended bachelor party.

570
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
We'll take good care of you.

571
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Promise.

572
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,500
And a promise
from mischa

573
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
is money
in the bank.

574
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
Besides, i like
having you along with us.

575
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,100
You keep me...

576
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,700
limber.

577
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,600
You mean upright?

578
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
Well, yeah, that too.

579
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
Um, it's just

580
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,000
i'm not your personal physician,
you know?

581
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Of course you're not.

582
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,000
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor i've ever met.

583
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh.

584
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,700
Think about it.

585
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,200
But not too long.

586
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
What's to think about?

587
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,800
Who could say "no"
to all of this?

588
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,100
* mr. Sandman
bring me a dream *

589
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,600
* bom, bom
bom, bom *

590
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
* make him the cutest
i've ever seen *

591
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,000
* bom, bom
bom, bom *

592
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,600
so what can i get you
this morning?

593
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,500
* then tell him *

594
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,300
* that his lonesome nights
are over *

595
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,000
could i have
the steak and eggs?

596
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,800
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?

597
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,300
* nobody
to call my own *

598
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,000
* bom, bom
bom, bom *

599
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
* please turn on
your magic beam *

600
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,600
* mr. Sandman
bring me a dream **

601
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
thanks.

602
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,100
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted
at a diner in beacon hill.

603
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
He's there right now.

604
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,500
Bring him in quietly,
if you can,

605
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,100
but bring him in.

606
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,300
Diana, wake up.

607
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,300
Dr. Anapurn.

608
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,200
I thought i was
supposed to sleep.

609
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,900
You gave me drugs...

610
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,000
you're being
discharged.

611
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,800
You need to come
with me.

612
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
[Grunts]

613
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,100
I don't know.

614
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,400
I guess he left
about 15 minutes ago.

615
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Did he say where
he was headed?

616
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,400
No.

617
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,500
I mean, he didn't
even touch

618
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,600
the food he ordered,
right?

619
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,900
He just left
in a hurry.

620
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,300
Left a good tip,
though.

621
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Where are we going?

622
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,300
Thank you.

623
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
You can go back
to your office now.

624
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,200
Tess,
don't do this.

625
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,700
I wish
it didn't have to be you,

627
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,100
but there's
no one else.

628
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,700
We'd better go.

629
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,100
He'll be
waiting for us.

630
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,900
How could i have done that?

631
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't remember any of it.

632
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
Diana doesn't
remember

633
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,500
going to kevin's apartment
at night, either.

634
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
If dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,

635
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,400
he must be getting desperate.

636
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,500
Feels like
he's running out of time.

637
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
Which means he has to
complete the experiment.

638
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,800
He's going to up her dosage.

639
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,200
If we don't find diana soon,

640
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,200
she's going to wind up
in the same shape as kevin.

641
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,800
I think
it's the silence

642
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,900
that's messing us up.

643
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,300
It's too awkward.

644
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
So instead of us

645
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,400
just staring
at each other,

646
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,500
i thought we'll talk.

647
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,100
Okay. Um...

648
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
is there something specific
you wanted to talk about?

649
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,700
No.

650
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,100
You pick.

651
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,300
Well, i've been thinking about
my parents a lot lately,

652
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,200
what they'd think
of all this,

653
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
this place...

654
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,700
me,

655
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
sitting here trying to
figure out how to use my...

656
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,500
telekinetic ability?

657
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
You know, you can
say it out loud.

658
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

659
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah, you can say that,

660
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,600
but when i first got back,
i was a 4400,

661
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,200
but i didn't have
an ability.

662
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
I felt normal.

663
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,300
It was something
i could hold on to.

664
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,400
Now you have to
get used to the idea

665
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,700
that you're special.

666
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,300
Is that what my parents
would think

667
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,600
if they were here?

668
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
Or would they just think

669
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
that their son
had become a freak?

670
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,600
Richard.

671
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
When you got taken,

672
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100
you were one of
the first black pilots

673
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,900
in all of the military.

674
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,700
You were at the vanguard.

675
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Now you're part of
a different vanguard.

676
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,800
There's a reason
they picked you.

677
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,900
I think your parents
would be proud.

678
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah.

679
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Uh...

680
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
maybe that's true.

681
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Richard?

682
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
Whoa.

683
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Well, i guess
that worked, huh?

684
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
This will be fine.

685
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
We can work here
for a while.

686
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Tell him

687
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,000
he can go home.

688
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Please.

689
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You have to help me.

690
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Say something.

691
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,500
Don't bother.

692
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,300
He's not going to remember
any of this.

693
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,500
Thank you.

694
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,300
You can
go home now.

695
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
[Coughing violently]

696
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,500
Kevin?

697
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,700
Can i get you
some water?

698
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm fine.

699
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
Kevin.

700
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,700
You're dying.

701
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,200
You're killing yourself.

702
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
And now you're going

703
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
to kill me, too.

704
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,700
No.

705
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,500
You will not die.

706
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,000
My work...

707
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
is valid.

708
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,900
Are you sure?

709
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,100
Look at yourself.

710
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
If it isn't
working

711
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,300
in me,

712
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,000
the fault isn't
with the experiment.

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
It's with me.

714
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,700
All those years,
the shock treatments,

715
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,300
the fistfuls
of medications,

716
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,800
they must have changed me.

717
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm not a good subject.

718
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,800
There is no good subject.

719
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,700
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.

720
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,600
You failed,

721
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,200
and you're not
thinking clearly enough

722
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,400
to see that.

723
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
My mind

724
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,400
is not compromised.

725
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,600
We are at a point, diana,

726
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,700
where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.

727
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,600
We have to be braver
than that.

728
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
And, if necessary...

729
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,300
[diana, pleading]:
Oh. No...

730
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,600
oh...

731
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,300
i'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.

732
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,000
Working on a song?

733
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,100
The end of one.

734
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,600
Can't nail it, though.

735
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Inspiration.

736
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
Are you shocked
i'm drinking my lunch?

737
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,200
I didn't say anything.

738
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Good, because this is...

739
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,400
listen...

740
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,800
this here is called
"maintaining a base level."

741
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,500
That's kind of scary, actually.

742
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,400
Shawn.

743
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Don't worry.

744
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,900
I've made a solemn vow
not to over-indulge...

745
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
unless, of course,
you're around.

746
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.

747
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,400
You're not going to be around,
is that it?

748
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,700
You're not coming on the road?

749
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,600
I wanted to.

750
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,700
It's just...

751
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,300
you know, even if it was
for a little while.

752
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,500
This gift i have, though,

753
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,700
it's kind of
a responsibility, you know?

754
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
And i don't mean
to be harsh, man,

755
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
but i don't think
it was meant to be used

756
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,600
as a rock star's

757
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,400
personal safety net.

758
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
You don't know that.

759
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,800
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive

760
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,400
so i could finish my album.

761
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,900
Nick,
if you go down again...

762
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
i can't be there for you.

763
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,500
There's still time,
you know.

764
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,900
We can save him.

765
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in kevin.

766
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
He can do this.

767
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700
He's special.

768
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,600
That's why
they had me wake him up.

769
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Tess?

770
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,000
I packed
an adrenaline shot

771
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
when we left
the cabin.

772
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,400
Have you seen it?

773
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,500
No.

774
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,400
I need it.

775
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
It has to be here
in case i slip under.

776
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Ah.
Kevin?

777
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,700
I think i got stung
by a bee.

778
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
What is this?

779
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,000
Don't move, dr. Burkhoff!

780
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Tess?
There's
nowhere to go.

781
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,900
We've got this place
surrounded.

782
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Nobody fire.

783
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,000
He's not going anywhere.

784
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,500
Diana,
are you all right?

785
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,600
Tom.

786
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,900
Whoa.
Hold still, burkhoff.

787
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,100
Put your hands up.

788
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Burkhoff!

789
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
They won't be able
to hide for long.

790
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,000
Tess will run out of meds.

791
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Dr. Burkhoff
is not exactly inconspicuous.

792
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,400
They'll show
themselves,

793
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
we'll find them.

794
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
You mean we'll find tess.

795
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,100
It doesn't sound like
burkhoff will live out the week.

796
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I don't get it.

797
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,700
He was supposed to be
the father of 4400 technology.

798
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,000
That's why they woke him up.

799
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
Well, that's
just our theory.

800
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,200
Maybe you're putting
too much faith in the future.

801
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,200
Diana's okay?

802
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Yeah,
she'll get there.

803
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
She's down
in ntac medical.

804
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
You got us a ride.

805
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Someone
let me borrow them.

806
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,500
* all this feels
strange and untrue *

807
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:01,200
* and i won't waste a minute
without you *

808
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,200
* my bones ache
my skin feels cold *

809
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,000
* and i'm getting
so tired *

810
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
* and so old *

811
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:30,000
* tell me
that you'll open your eyes *

812
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:45,000
* tell me that you'll open
your eyes *

813
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,100
* all this feels strange
and untrue *

814
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:55,700
* and i won't waste a minute
without you **

815
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,600
mr. Ryland
wants a status report

816
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,000
on the promicin.

817
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,800
We're good.

818
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Great, actually.

819
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
We have enough of a stockpile

820
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
to last us
for almost two years.

821
