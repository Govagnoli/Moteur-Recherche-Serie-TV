1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,439
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,577
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,468
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,581
The Canadian border
is about 30 miles away.

5
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,614
Cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,310
I didn't want us
to end, Thomas. Ever.

7
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,717
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,119
- April.
- Surprised?

9
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,623
How's it going, sibling?

10
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,728
Jordan, you just told me
there's a little girl there

11
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,557
who can see the future,
and she saw you dead.

12
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,790
So I stay away from the Center,
I cut myself off.

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,137
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.

14
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,173
If you try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.

15
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,242
We have to get married.
It's the way we can be sure

16
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,776
we'll never lose each other.

17
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,506
Shawn! Shawn Farrell!

18
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,480
Do you know who I am?

19
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,618
Get out of the way! Jordan!

20
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,855
Jordan! Let me through! Jordan!

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,927
Jordan!

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,297
Did you see Jordan Collier
come through here?

23
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,371
- No, sir.
- Long hair, beard. Anyone?

24
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,667
You saw him, right?

25
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,936
Yeah. Look,
I want this place secure.

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,740
No one gets in or out
until I say different.

27
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,980
- Come on.
- All right, guys, let's look around.

28
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,651
Guys, we've been all over the grounds
and we can't find anybody.

29
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,021
Are you sure it was Collier?

30
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,561
It was him. He looked right at me.
He talked to me.

31
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,132
Well, it did look like him,
but I only saw him for a second.

32
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,825
Well, if he's on foot, he can't be far.

33
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,403
I think we should call NTAC,
get them to sweep the neighborhood.

34
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,006
Shawn. What's going on?

35
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,040
The ceremony was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago.

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,905
Richard, I just saw Jordan.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,314
- He's alive. He's here.
- What?

38
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,213
- Where?
- Shawn.

39
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,375
- Me and Diana have to get moving.
- Hey, no, no, no.

40
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,781
- I'm coming with you.
- What?

41
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,047
I'm gonna help you find him.
Jordan looks different now.

42
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,817
- I got the best view of him.
- You're in the middle of your wedding.

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,690
We got a thousand guests here,
the media, lsabelle.

44
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,956
You're gonna have to do
some damage control.

45
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,931
Tell lsabelle
that the wedding's not off,

46
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,595
it's just postponed, and I'll come
see her as soon as I can.

47
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,331
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,016
Are we ready to go?

49
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,259
Daddy, what is it?

50
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,767
I thought we agreed
I don't want to see you.

51
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,458
This couldn't wait, Kyle.

52
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,932
He's alive.

53
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,068
Jordan Collier is alive.

54
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,581
I'm gonna find him, Kyle,
and I'm gonna get you out of here.

55
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:20,988
It's okay, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.
I just feel so bad for you.

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,561
I'll be fine. You don't need
to worry about me.

57
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,195
Shawn. Thank God. What happened?
All the guests are gone.

58
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,858
Everybody thinks you walked out.

59
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,765
That's-- It's okay. I just--

60
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,704
I need to talk to lsabelle
for a second, if you don't mind.

61
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,810
So your daddy came home, huh?

62
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,973
- Your dad told you about Jordan?
- He did.

63
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,609
I was really curious as to why
I wasn't getting married.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,724
I'm sorry, lsabelle. I am. It's--

65
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,883
Jordan's out there somewhere.
I need to find him.

66
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,155
And then what? If he's alive,
what does that mean for you and me?

67
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,196
I'm not sure.

68
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:05,668
- Jordan was dead and now he's not.
- Shawn, is the wedding off or isn't it?

69
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,373
It's still gonna happen,
just not today.

70
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,411
And not until I figure out
what's going on with Jordan.

71
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,475
I know Collier means a lot to you,

72
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,383
to everyone here.

73
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,945
Find him.

74
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,291
Di.

75
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,658
April, my God,
what are you doing here?

76
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,200
I came to see my sister.

77
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,338
Tell me, do you have
some kind of allergy

78
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,803
that keeps you from calling ahead?

79
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,436
I wasn't sure that was a good idea.

80
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,306
If I called, you might have
refused to see me.

81
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,042
So are you gonna hug
your only sister

82
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,774
or are you gonna
shut the door in my face?

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,346
I'm sorry, I just--
You surprised me, that's all.

84
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,251
I mean, I didn't even know
you were in Seattle.

85
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,860
- I'm moving here.
- Why? Are you in trouble?

86
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,187
No, I'm in love.

87
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,997
I know what you're thinking:
"Same difference."

88
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,099
But not this time.
This guy's the keeper.

89
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,365
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

90
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,731
Well, wait till you meet him,

91
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,896
which should be any minute now.
He's parking the car.

92
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,973
April, I'm in the middle
of something for work.

93
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,339
It won't take long.
Just a couple minutes, please.

94
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,538
It would mean a lot.
I bet you Maia would be happy too.

95
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,775
- Aunt April.
- Someone's getting tall.

96
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,216
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.

97
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,984
I'll bet the boys think so too.
Maia, this is my friend Ben.

98
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,626
I heard a lot about you,
young lady.

99
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,352
Your aunt says
you're a very special girl.

100
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,691
Maybe a little.

101
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,298
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.

102
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,926
I actually told April
we should have called ahead.

103
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,296
See? Polite.

104
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,668
And if you did a body search,
you wouldn't find a piercing anywhere.

105
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,809
April mentioned
that you're a photographer.

106
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,671
Yeah, April and l
just got back from lndia.

107
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,075
I was doing a piece
on the caste system there.

108
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,341
It's all for a show he's putting on
at the Museum of Contemporary Art.

109
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,109
Really?

110
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,245
- Well...
- Yeah.

111
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,152
I spent some time in lndia
when I was a graduate student.

112
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,816
We were doing an epidemiology study
in the Nilgiri range.

113
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,224
We were there.

114
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,990
Well, you are so lucky.
It was so beautiful.

115
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,363
I used to just wake up early to watch
the sun come up over the foothills.

116
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,164
Yeah, I got some shots of sunrises.
Just for my personal collection.

117
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,705
If I'd known you were interested,
I'd have brought them by.

118
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,241
- I'd like to see them.
- I'll bring them by.

119
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,470
I look forward to it.
But right now I really gotta rush.

120
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,671
Bye.

121
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,350
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

122
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,551
- Bye.
- Bye. You're right, he is a keeper.

123
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,466
This is a nice place.

124
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,697
Collier sure had an eye
for real estate.

125
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,775
I mean, what, this is the sixth place
we've looked at today?

126
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,709
It must be nice
to have that kind of money.

127
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,679
Diana, look at this.

128
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,945
Someone's been staying here.

129
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,587
Guys.

130
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,267
It's from a soup kitchen downtown.
What does the notebook say?

131
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,733
The whole thing's full.

132
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,032
"The city is a thousand miles wide.
The last city.

133
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,936
Walls are a hundred feet high.

134
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,508
Nothing grows
on the outside anymore,

135
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,646
so the people beg to be let in,
but nobody listens."

136
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,145
- It's all like this.
- Is that Collier's handwriting?

137
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,916
This is just preliminary,

138
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,916
but I ran the handwriting
from the notebook

139
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,021
against the sample from Collier's
that you gave me.

140
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,414
Now, they don't look alike at all.

141
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,457
I mean, the handwriting
from the notebook's shaky,

142
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,094
almost like whoever did it is sick.

143
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,787
But the software says
that they're a probable match.

144
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,433
- That Jordan wrote this stuff?
- I can't say for sure,

145
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,661
but there's a lab in D.C. that'll be able
to give us a positive identification.

146
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,771
But it's probable, right?
Jordan's alive.

147
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,373
- We don't know that yet.
- Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.

148
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,032
If he did write this,

149
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,303
he has seen some interesting stuff
while he's been gone.

150
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,880
And the whole thing goes on and on
about a walled city.

151
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,643
You know, a privileged elite
lives on the inside,

152
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,583
everything else is just a wasteland.
And then the last few pages

153
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,916
are just one phrase
repeated over and over again.

154
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,117
"The war for the future
will be fought in the past."

155
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,961
Mommy?

156
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,541
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

157
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,971
I couldn't sleep.

158
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,702
Oh, well...

159
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,780
Why don't you come on in?
I'll make you a bowl of ice cream.

160
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,849
Our family's gonna get bigger now.

161
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,519
Oh, sweetie.

162
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,088
Don't get too attached to the idea
of your Aunt April living in Seattle.

163
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,020
You know how she can be.

164
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,889
That's not it.
You're gonna get married.

165
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,766
I saw it. Not too long from now.

166
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,094
You look the same when it happens.

167
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,065
I'm getting married?

168
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,373
Isn't it great?
You're gonna be so happy.

169
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,578
Okay, well...

170
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,014
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?

171
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,948
Yeah, it was the man
we just met. Ben.

172
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,355
Maia, you saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

173
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,118
But Ben is with Aunt April.

174
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,864
I guess they don't stay together,

175
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,557
because you two
are gonna get married.

176
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,065
You're gonna have a husband,
I'm gonna have a dad.

177
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,207
Isn't that the best?

178
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,752
Hello? Oh, hey, Tom.

179
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,483
No, we're up.

180
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,789
Have you seen this man?

181
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,022
Sure. I volunteer
at St. Alban's kitchen.

182
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,168
These guys brought the sketch by
when we were closing up tonight.

183
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,893
We bring food down here
twice a week.

184
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,662
- I've seen him.
- Are you sure about that?

185
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,931
Positive.

186
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,803
I remember him because everyone
lets him go to the front of the line.

187
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,467
They get out of his way.
I've never seen that before.

188
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,738
- You haven't seen him today?
- Not for a couple weeks.

189
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,681
But I always see him
eating with Will.

190
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,945
Will's kind of
the elder statesman around here.

191
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,555
He knows just about everyone.

192
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,987
Yeah, I know him. We all do.

193
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,553
- The preacher.
- The preacher?

194
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,288
He never said
his real name was Jordan Collier.

195
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,297
I thought that Collier was dead.
Who are you guys, anyway?

196
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,196
We're from NTAC.
We need to find this man.

197
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,599
- When's the last time you saw him?
- Just now.

198
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,864
- What?
- He's here?

199
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,935
He's always here.

200
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,240
This is pretty empty.
You're sure he's back here?

201
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,575
He never goes anywhere.

202
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,012
Okay.

203
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:12,585
Say hello to the preacher.

204
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,034
You made a painting of him?

205
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,338
Not me personally,

206
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,969
but the preacher's a popular guy.
He's got some amazing stories.

207
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,046
The guy claims
to have seen the future.

208
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,411
People around here...

209
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,182
...we believe him.

210
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,772
You lied to me, lsabelle.

211
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,455
I don't remember much
about being a baby.

212
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,184
You and Mom mostly. Vague stuff.

213
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,524
I remember Collier.

214
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,363
I remember
how he made you guys feel,

215
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,024
and I remember how I felt
when he touched Mom that time.

216
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,727
Well, you gave him
something to remember that day.

217
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,236
Collier was recovering for months.

218
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,077
That's not the only thing I did to him.

219
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,640
Right before he died
he came to talk to me.

220
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,719
I know it sounds weird.
I was just a baby.

221
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,153
But he wanted me to tell him
whether it was safe to go ahead

222
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,782
- with the party he was planning.
- I remember.

223
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,952
He asked to take you for a walk
through the gardens.

224
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,361
He wanted power.
He wanted acclaim.

225
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,558
A name that would live on
after he died.

226
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,998
So that's what I showed him.

227
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,999
So, what? You gave him a vision?

228
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,001
He had the party. He got shot.

229
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,110
I didn't pull the trigger, but,
Daddy, I made that happen.

230
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,348
If Collier's back,
he knows what I did.

231
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,487
What does he want? Revenge?

232
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,523
We don't even know
whether or not he is alive.

233
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,593
What if he tells Shawn what I did?

234
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,028
You sound
like you're scared of Collier.

235
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,725
Isabelle,
Collier is a very powerful man,

236
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,165
but he is just a man.

237
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,971
He was just a man.

238
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,003
We don't know what he is now.

239
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,313
Guys, I've got something
you need to check out.

240
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,916
You know that graffiti mural?
The one that might be Collier?

241
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,882
Well, there's a national
graffiti database.

242
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,022
- I ran the portrait against it.
- And?

243
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,783
This preacher guy, he gets around.

244
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,116
That one's from Saint Louis.

245
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,457
That's El Paso. Tempe, Arizona.

246
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,428
- Reno.
- These are from all over the country.

247
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,261
If this is Collier,
he's been a very busy man.

248
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,768
Might need a shave and a haircut,
but he's still got charisma.

249
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,872
- He's got followers everywhere.
- So, what?

250
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,476
He's traveling around,
preaching the gospel of the future?

251
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,845
Are you almost done?
I was gonna make you a snack.

252
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,386
- Five more minutes.
- Okay.

253
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,085
Did you see Ben today?

254
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,492
You mean
your Aunt April's boyfriend?

255
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,999
No, I didn't see him,
and I'm not going to see him.

256
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,829
Your antenna is not working right
on this one, sweetie.

257
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,364
Okay.

258
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,679
Hi.

259
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,887
I'm not the type of guy who drops by
unannounced all the time, I promise.

260
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,387
- Okay.
- But I was just in the neighborhood,

261
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:09,049
I didn't have your phone number.
The pictures we talked about.

262
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,124
Thanks.

263
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,064
Come in.

264
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,605
- Hi, Maia.
- Hi, Ben.

265
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,107
I need to go to my room and study.
You two talk.

266
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,940
So you gonna open it?

267
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,592
Does that look familiar?
That's the Nilgiri Hills.

268
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,785
Yeah.

269
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,831
Listen, this is not gonna happen.

270
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,462
Excuse me?

271
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,830
Married?

272
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,203
Are you sure she meant me?

273
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,447
- Well, that can't happen.
- I'm glad you agree.

274
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,312
April told me about Maia,
what she could do,

275
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,853
- but she's wrong here, right?
- Oh, she's gonna be.

276
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,827
Okay, I'm gonna go.

277
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,824
And no more visits
to bring you pictures.

278
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,591
No more visits, period.

279
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,103
Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you

280
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,097
and then resolving
never to see you again.

281
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,475
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,638
Did you kill me?

283
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,513
It's him.

284
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,847
That's him. That's Jordan Collier.

285
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,684
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!

286
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,350
Tell them you're Jordan Collier!

287
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:29,198
Tell them! Tell them
you're Jordan Collier! Tell them!

288
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,940
Is that who I am?

289
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,750
When you went to see Kyle,
you signed in as Jeffrey Paulson.

290
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,155
Why?

291
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,991
I found a library card
in the pocket of my coat,

292
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,564
and that's what it said. I thought--

293
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,468
I thought maybe that was my name.

294
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,898
Your name is Jordan Collier.

295
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,367
You don't remember that?
You're one of the 4400.

296
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,271
- Am l?
- You were shot.

297
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,938
You died.

298
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:23,216
Yes, I saw that in the papers.
I thought I looked like that man.

299
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,882
You disappeared. Do you have
any idea where you've been?

300
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,889
Everywhere.

301
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,293
I have been everywhere.

302
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:43,465
I've been alive for hundreds of years.
Maybe thousands.

303
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:49,213
I couldn't speak to anyone.
I just-- I wandered.

304
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,679
No food, no sleep.

305
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,816
And I watched it all.

306
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,730
I watched the world change,

307
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,166
and it just kept getting worse.

308
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,772
And the skies filled with smoke...

309
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,634
...and all the machines
stopped working,

310
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,303
and the streets and the rivers

311
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,610
were filled with bodies.

312
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,412
And the dead were everywhere,

313
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,861
and the Earth cried out

314
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:42,493
and it never stopped.

315
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,530
The things you're talking about,
they haven't happened.

316
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,142
- Not yet, anyway.
- It's 2006.

317
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,042
It's been less than a year
since you were shot.

318
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:04,184
How could it be?
I've been wandering for so long.

319
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,750
That's the preliminary DNA report.

320
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,020
That man we're holding
is Jordan Collier.

321
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,187
Well, at least somebody's sure of it.

322
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,300
I need Collier to remember who he is
so he can stand in front of a judge

323
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,765
and ask for my son to be freed.

324
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,872
But, Tom, this is already a win for Kyle.
Collier's alive.

325
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,271
So he serves a term for
attempted murder instead of murder?

326
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,969
No, no, no, Diana.
That's not good enough.

327
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,343
Look, Collier knows who he is.
It's buried in there somewhere.

328
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,710
He showed up at the wedding.

329
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,682
He found his way
to one of his safe houses.

330
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,350
We just need to find a way
to help bring it all to the surface.

331
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,862
Tom, I just got off the phone
with the National Security Advisor.

332
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,930
He wants to schedule
a conference call with him, me

333
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,293
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

334
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,197
to discuss the fact that Jordan Collier
is somehow back from the dead.

335
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,999
And you want me to look the other way
while Alana Mareva, a fugitive,

336
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,505
walks into NTAC
and uses her ability on Collier?

337
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,839
She can access his memories.
Show him his life.

338
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,377
These people in D.C.,

339
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,515
they need Collier to remember
who he is too, right?

340
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,151
They need answers. This might be
the only way to get them.

341
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,278
Nina, please.

342
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,284
We're talking about my son.

343
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,660
You have a way
to get in touch with Alana?

344
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,669
Make the call.

345
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,773
I got it, Maia.

346
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,644
You just couldn't stand
to see me happy, could you?

347
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,723
- April, what are you talking about?
- What did you say to Ben?

348
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,328
- What did you say, Diana?
- Nothing, why?

349
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,588
He broke up with me!

350
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,824
You weren't supposed
to break up with her.

351
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,662
That's not why I told you
what Maia said.

352
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,862
I realize that,
but you have to understand,

353
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,008
a precog just told me
that I was with the wrong person.

354
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,608
And if you know you're with
the wrong person, why stay with them?

355
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,616
I don't know,
maybe because you love them.

356
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,580
I do love April.

357
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,114
At least I thought I did.

358
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,722
You know, I can't believe
how casual you can be with all this.

359
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,658
Maybe it's because
you live with a 4400,

360
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,989
but someone just told me
that I met the person, the woman,

361
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,390
that I'm supposed to be with...

362
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,762
...and I can't ignore it.

363
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,598
And I want you to tell me the truth.

364
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,580
When you look at me,
do you feel anything at all?

365
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,514
An attraction?
An inkling of an attraction?

366
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,352
Yes, I do.

367
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,151
You asked for the truth,
so yes, I do.

368
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,526
And if I met you
under different circumstances,

369
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,690
I'd wanna see you again.

370
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,531
Yeah.

371
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,436
Me too.

372
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:15,512
- But it doesn't matter, we can't do it.
- Yeah, I know.

373
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,615
I'm gonna take
my sister's stuff and go.

374
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,215
But wouldn't it be something if we were
giving up our shot at happiness?

375
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,388
- Hello, Thomas.
- You cut your hair.

376
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,668
I can't believe you're here.
Thank you for doing this.

377
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,397
For Kyle, I'll do anything,
you know that.

378
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,906
Besides, I've missed you.

379
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,304
Are you ready?

380
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,823
You don't have to do anything.
Just shut your eyes and relax.

381
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,259
You won't feel anything, I promise.

382
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,940
My name's Jordan Collier.

383
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,775
- If I could stay here for a while--
- You're one of the 4400.

384
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,940
That baby could be
the key to the future.

385
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,552
Peter has all the time in the world.

386
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,848
Hi, Peter.
My name's Jordan Collier.

387
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,852
Hello, Richard.
Welcome to the revolution.

388
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,837
Collier, are you all right?

389
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,390
My name is Jordan Collier.

390
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,027
I know why they sent us back.

391
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,194
I saw the catastrophe

392
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,767
and I know what we have to do
to stop it.

393
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,552
You say you have all these answers.

394
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,553
Tell us what they are and then we
can talk about letting you out of here.

395
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,554
You'll learn what I know
when everyone else does.

396
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,851
When will that be?

397
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,621
As soon as I'm free, you and the world
will know what I know.

398
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,198
And what if we hold you indefinitely?

399
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,627
- I've grown accustomed to waiting.
- Yeah, well, I can't.

400
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,369
My son is in prison. You're
the only one who can get him out.

401
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,474
Then you want me released
as badly as I do.

402
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,377
Your son Kyle is innocent.

403
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,813
He is a pawn, and I will say that
to whomever you want

404
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,111
the moment I am a free man.

405
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,811
I can't believe this, Nina.

406
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,081
My son could be one court appearance
away from freedom

407
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,384
and you're refusing to let Collier
testify on his behalf?

408
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,959
I'm not refusing, the Pentagon is.

409
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,187
Their official position is
Collier's not even back.

410
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,093
Come on, Nina. They can't honestly
believe that they can squash this.

411
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,733
Well, they're gonna try.

412
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,801
Look, Collier's return
changes everything.

413
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,996
We're not just talking
about galvanizing the 4400.

414
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,936
There are religious groups
all over the world

415
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,406
who would consider him
the messiah.

416
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,511
No matter what he says,
no matter how crazy it is,

417
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,476
people are going to listen.

418
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,512
So maybe we should find out
what's on his mind

419
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,344
before we stick him
in front of microphones.

420
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,179
What if we don't like
what he has to say?

421
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,514
We stick him in the basement,
pretend this never happened?

422
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,456
I don't think
that's gonna be our decision.

423
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,617
I'd be surprised if Collier's not
transferred out of here by tomorrow.

424
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,062
They should be here by now.

425
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,295
You sure you're okay?

426
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,038
I will be.

427
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,944
When I touched Collier,
those things I saw,

428
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,979
they weren't only from his past.
There were other images too.

429
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,138
Terrible ones.

430
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,581
It was like a nightmare.

431
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:53,452
I don't know how Collier
lived through it and stayed sane.

432
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,601
I don't wanna leave you, Thomas.
I don't wanna go on the run again.

433
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:12,073
Well, maybe you don't have to.
What you did today, it helped NTAC.

434
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,677
If I tell them they can have
access to your ability,

435
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,541
maybe they'll drop
the charges against you.

436
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,115
- I'd never hurt the 4400s.
- I know, I know.

437
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,379
Maybe we can work it
so you don't have to, okay?

438
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,917
- Uncle Tom.
- Wait right here.

439
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,091
What the hell's going on?

440
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,291
I didn't help find Jordan
so you could lock him away.

441
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,901
Shawn, they're scared.

442
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,163
This is how the government reacts
when it's scared.

443
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,569
You know, if we wanted
we could take him.

444
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,811
If we set our minds to it,
we can get into NTAC

445
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,380
and there won't be anything
you can do to stop us.

446
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,676
You may be right.

447
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,652
But there might be
another way. Here.

448
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,585
That's a still
from a security camera at NTAC.

449
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,453
It was taken this afternoon.
You show it to everyone.

450
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,590
You let the world know
that Collier's back.

451
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,370
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

452
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,234
Wagon Wheels.

453
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,271
You know, I used to live
on those things in college.

454
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,276
Ben, what are you doing here?

455
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,510
I eat too.

456
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:06,119
So, what do you think?

457
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,649
Coincidence,
or is this thing gonna happen

458
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,794
whether we try to stop it or not?

459
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,231
Well, normally, I'd give you a lecture
about free will right now,

460
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:24,535
but I have to admit,
it might sound a little hollow.

461
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,150
Well, we're both here,
both shopping.

462
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,882
Wanna join forces?

463
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,442
--loved doing the final project.

464
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:07,414
Let me guess, faces of the elderly?

465
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,152
Red lights.

466
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,586
Every time I'd stop at a red light,
I'd take a picture.

467
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,454
You know, you have to study
these intersections

468
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,061
that you never really noticed.

469
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,529
Like the stores, the people,

470
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,692
the garbage cans, everything.

471
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,667
That's very creative.

472
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,697
- I was just screwing around.
- I would like to see them.

473
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,343
Okay, yeah.
I think I've got them somewhere.

474
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,742
No, wait.

475
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,711
- What?
- We can't do this.

476
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:43,149
We just did. That was a date,
and that was a pretty good one.

477
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,781
No, it wasn't.
It was nice, but it wasn't a date.

478
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,654
Then why do I feel like doing this?

479
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,266
You gotta admit
that was nice too.

480
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,704
Can I see you again?

481
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,720
Free Collier noW, Free Collier noW,

482
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,358
- Free Collier noW,
- Anyone else feel like it's Bastille Day?

483
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,323
Well, it does feel like
the start of something.

484
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,793
We have gotta let him go.
It's either that or bring in troops.

485
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,898
And we won't just be
reading the riot act to 4400s.

486
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,003
There's clergy out there. Citizens.
Look, we can't just sit on this.

487
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,833
If Collier is some kind of messiah,
he needs to be free.

488
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,305
If he's not,
letting him out is still the right move.

489
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,643
It will give him enough rope
to hang himself.

490
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,347
I'll call D.C.,
but they're gonna wanna know

491
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,712
how those people got their hands
on a picture of Collier.

492
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,683
Any idea what I should tell them?

493
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,449
Yeah, tell them
it's hard to cover up a resurrection.

494
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:58,618
Free Collier noW,
Free Collier noW, Free Collier noW,

495
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,700
Free Collier now.
Free Collier now. Free Collier now.

496
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,805
Stay back.

497
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,315
It's you. Welcome back, Jordan.

498
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,024
Thank you for keeping
the Center alive while I was gone.

499
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,427
Richard,
glad to see you still with us.

500
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,297
You'll have an important role to play.

501
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,239
I stand here and I see the future:

502
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,646
4400s and non-4400s

503
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,083
working hand in hand
toward a common goal.

504
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,521
Saving humanity is no longer
the exclusive province of the 4400.

505
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:06,189
Each and every one of you
will have work to do.

506
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,491
And the work starts now.

507
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,465
We're going to the court house.

508
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,402
There is an innocent man
who needs to be freed.

509
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,927
Look, just get those people
away from this building.

510
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,789
You're impeding
the business of my court.

511
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,296
They won't leave until you listen
to what I have to say.

512
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,167
I hereby withdraw
any and all charges

513
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,463
against Kyle Baldwin
for my alleged murder.

514
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,575
Well, Mr. Baldwin
still assaulted two federal agents.

515
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,268
Now, he fired a high-powered weapon
into a crowd of people,

516
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,437
and he admitted it all
in a detailed confession.

517
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,106
My son has been in jail for months.
He's a first-time offender.

518
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,911
You could release him
with time served.

519
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,986
Those people out there,
they listen to me.

520
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,750
They will be back every day
until this man's son goes free.

521
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,687
Well, these are
highly unusual circumstances,

522
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,660
I'll grant you both that.

523
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,794
Perhaps we can revisit
the murder plea.

524
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,602
Do. Quickly.

525
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,504
Thank you.

526
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,177
- Thought you didn't wanna see me.
- I don't. I wanna see your pictures.

527
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,006
Well, okay. So I knew you'd be here.

528
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,347
Then why did you come?

529
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,386
I guess I've been thinking
about the grocery store,

530
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,151
and I thought
it was a good date too.

531
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,289
It just didn't end right.

532
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,161
Okay.

533
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,766
Then how should it have ended?

534
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,287
Hi, Mommy.

535
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,362
- Hi.
- Where you been, Di?

536
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,330
Nowhere, I just had to work late.

537
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,342
I'm sorry.

538
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,014
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize.

539
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,651
Those things you saw in me--

540
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,157
Pride, ambition, vanity.
--they were there.

541
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,026
I had to die to lose them.

542
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:41,133
I've done bad things
and I'm supposed to do more.

543
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,499
I know.

544
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,270
And I'm trying not to.

545
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,440
Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

546
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,218
Leave.

547
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,295
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.

548
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,292
Nothing you can do will change
what you are, lsabelle.

549
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,063
You are the enemy of the 4400.
The enemy of everything that is good.

550
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,304
And that part of you that is human...

551
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,839
...it is much smaller
than the part of you that's not,

552
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,346
and your struggle
to keep it alive will fail.

553
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,346
No, no.

554
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,224
- I have a choice.
- Others might, not you.

555
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,697
If that's true, if we're enemies, then
why shouldn't I just kill you right now?

556
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:53,173
You're welcome to try,
but it won't work.

557
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,245
I'm ready for you this time.

558
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,848
This place is mine again...

559
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,719
...and you're not welcome here.

560
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,931
Goodbye, lsabelle.
