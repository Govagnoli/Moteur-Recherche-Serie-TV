1
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:39,867
We're not a threat.

2
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,301
We're salvation.

3
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:43,334
The world
will have to deal with us.

4
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,767
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...

5
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,101
as far as
this department knew,

6
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,900
maia wasn't having
visions anymore.

7
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,533
She was keeping them
secret from me

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,900
and writing everything
down in a diary.

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,001
It's a subpoena.

10
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,067
What do they want?

11
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:54,267
Your diary.

12
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,500
Don't reveal
your healing ability,

13
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,500
because if you heal
one of them,

14
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,767
you're going
to have to heal them all.

15
00:00:58,834 --> 00:00:59,767
One day,

16
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,301
all of this will be yours.

17
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,234
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.

18
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,434
Everything's in place.

19
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,034
He had a vision
to save the future,

20
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,167
and now he won't be here

21
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,867
to see us achieve it.

22
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:15,234
But we will achieve.

23
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,001
 None of this
is real to me either.

24
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:19,600
This is where they altered us,

25
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:20,967
gave me the ability

26
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,700
to create the world
we've been living in

27
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,201
for the last eight years.

28
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,434
I love you, thomas.

29
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,800
So, let me see
if i've got this, um, straight.

30
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,001
You two met,

31
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,401
fell in love,

32
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,368
and spent eight years
together

33
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,800
in some kind of...

34
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,101
alternate reality,

35
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,834
and now you're here,

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,500
with eight years of love
and marriage under your belts,

37
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:47,800
in what to us was...

38
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,167
no time at all.

39
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,967
Yeah, that...
that about sums it up.

40
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,468
Yeah.

41
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,134
I'll play along.

42
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,567
But if you two start
calling each other "honeybunny,"

43
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:58,700
i'm so out of here.

44
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,368
I told you
he'd try, thomas.

45
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,134
How'd you know that?

46
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,767
Well, you might be meeting me
for the first time,

47
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,067
but i know all about you.

48
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,134
You're smart,

49
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,234
your favorite writer
is alan moore,

50
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,401
and your favorite meal

51
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:11,401
is meatloaf.

52
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:12,567
But i can't be
exactly the same.

53
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,967
You said there was no 4400,

54
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:18,667
so that means
no coma, no time lost...

55
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:19,934
no major problems.
That's right.

56
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,034
You were happy.

57
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,034
Successful.

58
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,201
Meaning what?

59
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,767
Nothing.

60
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,034
We used to talk about
medical school, remember?

61
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,500
Over there,
you went to stanford.

62
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,434
How'd i do?

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,867
You graduated
with honors.

64
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,368
You became
a neurologist.

65
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,567
Must have made you proud.

66
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,867
I'm always proud of you.

67
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:40,167
Right, but "dr. Kyle baldwin"

68
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,201
and that world
you were vacationing in,

69
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,434
it came from your mind,
right?

70
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,234
Actually, it was my mind.

71
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,267
Right,
but you created it

72
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,500
using his memories.

73
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,767
Kyle, i'm just as proud

74
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,101
of what
you've accomplished here.

75
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,234
Prouder.

76
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,734
Hey.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,134
You want to know why
all lawyers are jerks?

78
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,900
Because they spend
a lifetime

79
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,834
reading this crap.

80
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,267
What kind of crap,
specifically?

81
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,633
I'm a pretty good
interpreter.

82
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,301
I have 24 hours

83
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,401
to turn maia's diary over
to ntac,

84
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:19,600
and not one legal option
to get out of it.

85
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,967
What are you going to do?

86
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,468
Well, what ntac wants,
ntac gets,

87
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,201
but i have a 9-year-old
daughter at home

88
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,900
who's counting on me
to protect her.

89
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,134
Any way i can help?

90
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,101
Yeah, you can slap me
upside the head

91
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,934
for ever mentioning the diary
in the first place.

92
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,934
It didn't save collier's life,
and now it's making mine hell.

93
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,134
How about i just make
some fresh coffee instead?

94
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,967
Oh... thanks.

95
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,734
Yeah.

96
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,401
Do you think
they'll find

97
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,001
the man
who did it?

98
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,368
If, by "they,"
you mean "thomas,"

99
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,034
then yeah, probably.

100
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,533
My dad always gets
his man.

101
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,633
You heading out?

102
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,101
Yes, i have to keep
reminding myself

103
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,368
i don't live here
anymore.

104
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,600
Look, kyle,

105
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,468
your father and i
love each other.

106
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,667
That's great.

107
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,134
There's not enough love
in the world.

108
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,201
But i just met you.

109
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,800
Give me a few days

110
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,267
before i start
calling you "mom," okay?

111
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,267
You've got
one of those already.

112
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:24,134
I'll settle for being
a good friend...

113
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,134
and i'll keep bribing you
with meatloaf

114
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,234
until you give in.

115
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,434
Oh...

116
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:43,934
* so long ago, another life *

117
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:47,867
* i can feel your heart beat *

118
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:53,301
* it's not a dream
remember us *

119
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:57,567
* i can see it in your eyes *

120
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,834
* we'll find our place in time *

121
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,468
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

122
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,101
* we'll find our place in time *

123
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:15,533
* our place in time
to call our own *

124
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,934
Hello, mr. Ross.

125
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:39,634
Did you have
a good flight?

126
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:40,834
Yes. Thanks.

127
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,467
Now, would you like me
to show you around,

128
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,333
or do you want
to get some rest?

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
Neither. Take me
to mr. Farrell.

130
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,934
Yes, sir.
Right this way.

131
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,367
They've
been waiting.

132
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:50,567
Three days.

133
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,134
Tell publicity
i'm not sure yet.

134
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,801
They're saying
we're past our deadline.

135
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,233
We have to release
this press statement.

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,901
This is supposed to be coming
from me?

137
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,701
I don't even understand
half of what it says.

138
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,467
It doesn't sound
like me, lucy.

139
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:06,134
So change it.

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,333
You're the boss.

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,701
Oh, and legal
needs signatures now,

142
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,967
or no one gets paid,
including legal.

143
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,767
I can only do one thing
at a time.

144
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,101
So let's start

145
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,500
with the statement.

146
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:17,901
Why don't you dictate
something to me?

147
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,567
No press statement.

148
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:20,934
If the press wants to know

149
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:21,934
what mr. Farrell
is thinking,

150
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,834
they can watch
<i>60 minutes</i>

151
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,200
along with the rest of america.

152
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,701
I've already booked
an exclusive interview

153
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:30,400
with our new face
of the 4400.

154
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,967
That's all for now.

155
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:34,734
Thanks.

156
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,134
I'm sorry to just jump in
like that.

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,267
I thought you could use a hand.

158
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,333
Matthew ross.

159
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,534
Yes.

160
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,467
Yeah.

161
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you doing
in seattle?

162
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,168
I go
where i'm needed.

163
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:54,333
You've come
to the right place.

164
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,801
It's no coincidence, shawn.

165
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,267
Jordan made it clear
that, in the event of his death,

166
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,767
i was to step up,
front and center,

167
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,734
to help you out.

168
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,168
Well, another in a long line
of plans

169
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,168
that jordan neglected
to share with me.

170
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,600
Huh.

171
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,034
But i'm glad
you're here.

172
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,467
Jordan talked about you a lot...

173
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,001
you're going to need
to hire yourself a new lobbyist.

174
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,934
I'm moving to the home office
for the time being.

175
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,001
Pick any office you want.

176
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,367
You start right away.

177
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:16,367
Uh, these letters?

178
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,534
Everyone knows i can heal now.

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,101
Jordan had every intention

180
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,333
of revealing
your healing ability

181
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,667
to the public,

182
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,934
but he was planning on doing it
in stages.

183
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,767
We don't have
that luxury anymore.

184
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:25,901
We'll deal with it.

185
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,434
I can't go outside anymore.

186
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,967
There's sick people.

187
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,934
The press,
they follow me everywhere.

188
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,667
And they will
for the rest of your life.

189
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,367
The ground just shifted
under your feet.

190
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:38,101
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

191
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,200
This center
is the new lourdes.

192
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,600
Nobody's going to be calling us
a "cult" anymore.

193
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,701
We're turning away people
faster than we can sign them up.

194
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,068
In 10 years,
this movement's going to be

195
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,267
one of the dominant faiths
on the planet.

196
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,267
Stop.

197
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,068
I'm glad things are going
so well, i am,

198
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,734
but a week ago,

199
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,134
i was just some guy trying
to beat the last level of <i>doom.</i>

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,434
I wasn't the pope then,
and i'm not the pope now.

201
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,834
Yes, you are,

202
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,967
and you need to start
getting used to it.

203
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,667
The fbi is spearheading
the hunt for the man

204
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,233
who killed jordan collier.

205
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,001
Oh, but we're still in the game,
and ntac is making this collar.

206
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,034
I'm not having someone else
clean up our mess for us.

207
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,801
Then we'd better get moving.

208
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,333
We all know
there's an expiration date

209
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,734
on these manhunts.

210
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,101
Trail starts getting cold
after 48 hours.

211
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,001
I want another look at employee
sign-in sheets

212
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,701
for every office building
and parking garage

213
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,434
within a 10-block radius
of the center.

214
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,734
We've already cross-examined
everyone on those books.

215
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,467
Then we have to look
off the books.

216
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,101
This guy shot a public figure
in broad daylight.

217
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:40,034
There has to be an eyewitness.

218
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,701
And so far, tom, the only one
who has seen this killer

219
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,967
is you.

220
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,001
Loser.

221
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,200
Pathetic loser.

222
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:01,001
Sweetie, whatever you do,
never, ever gamble.

223
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,767
It's wrong
and it's stupid.

224
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,867
Then why do you do it?

225
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,333
Because,
unlike your mommy,

226
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,701
your aunt april doesn't
have a steady income.

227
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,400
She's an artist,

228
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,634
and artists
always need cash,

229
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,134
which is where the "stupid" part
comes in,

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
because i always lose.

231
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,434
So this whole
"see the future" thing,

232
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,467
it doesn't just apply
to earth-shattering events, huh?

233
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,168
Not always.

234
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,267
So, if i were to ask you
which card...

235
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,634
that one.

236
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,467
I'll take this one right here.

237
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,467
Thanks.

238
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,467
Baby girl...

239
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,134
you are my new lucky charm.

240
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,667
I'm pulling you off
the collier case.

241
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,734
What are you
talking about?

242
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,168
We still have half
that neighborhood to canvass.

243
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,600
It's going to have to wait.

244
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,734
At 10:37 a.m.,
pacific standard,

245
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,068
the federal emergency
management agency

246
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,867
sent in a task force

247
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,534
to granite pass, oregon,
population 273,

248
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,068
where there's been
an outbreak

249
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:15,101
of a lethal, highly contagious,
and as yet unidentified virus.

250
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,534
Airborne?

251
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,667
Mm-hmm. Yeah, likely.

252
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:18,667
Man-made?

253
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:19,667
Unknown.

254
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,168
What we do know is,

255
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,767
if you went to sleep
in granite pass last night,

256
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,001
chances are you're filling out
a body bag this morning.

257
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,068
There's only
one resident

258
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,901
that fema hasn't
accounted for yet.

259
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,467
Jean delynn baker,
age 30.

260
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:31,534
Returnee 0188.

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,034
Disappeared in '99.

262
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:34,134
Divorced. No kids.

263
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,934
Psych profile says
she's a loner.

264
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,101
Things have been
pretty grim for her

265
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,367
since she got back.

266
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,634
Hasn't been able
to hold down a job.

267
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,701
She was unemployed
four times

268
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,134
in the last year.

269
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
And now she's the only resident
of granite pass, oregon

270
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,801
who can't be
accounted for.

271
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,001
So we've got two possibilities.

272
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,267
Either she's immune
to this virus,

273
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,934
in which case we could
study her,

274
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,200
look for a cure.

275
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:54,434
Or else...
she's the carrier.

276
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,134
Either way,
your job is the same.

277
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Use whatever resources you need
and find her.

[Country western playing

279
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,967
[Driver]: So, are you
going to tell me

280
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:05,034
where you're headed?

281
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:10,834
I never could
stand the sight

282
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,701
of a woman in tears.

283
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,467
I guess that's why
i never got married.

284
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,034
You in some kind
of trouble?

285
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,467
Run off
on your family?

286
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,168
Law on your tail?

00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,367
Seattle.

288
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:27,434
I'm going to seattle.

289
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,434
That's a big city.

290
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,600
You want me to just drop you
on the edge of town?

291
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm going to the 4400 center.

292
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,600
I've got to get there.

293
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,168
What the hell for?

294
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,634
Are you joining up?

295
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,834
Just get me as close
as you can.

296
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,300
Please.

297
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,834
If you're looking
for salvation,

298
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,400
you're not going
to find it there.

299
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,400
What you want to do

300
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,600
is to give yourself
over...

301
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,967
to your true lord
and savior.

302
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:52,901
Purification day
is coming.

303
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,367
Signs are everywhere...

304
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:57,267
pestilence, plagues.

305
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,867
Tell me about it.

306
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,801
I woke up in a town
full of dead people

307
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:01,834
this morning...

308
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,967
my mother,
my father.

309
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,101
Every...
everyone.

310
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,001
Yeah?

311
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:08,767
How come you survived?

312
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,200
I think maybe i caused it.

313
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,200
You?

314
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,667
Now i know you're
messing with me.

315
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:17,701
Okay, go ahead,
laugh at the jesus freak,

316
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,701
but i'm telling you,

317
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,701
the whole world'll be
wiped clean soon enough.

318
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,400
Look, i don't think
you're a freak at all, mister.

319
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,867
Matter of fact,

320
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,634
i believe...

321
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:41,067
The eyes and fingernails show
only slight discoloration.

322
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,434
Rigor mortis
has barely set in.

323
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,800
What did the autopsies show?

324
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,500
Nothing we have a name for.

325
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,101
Their internal
organisms

326
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,167
are pretty much liquefied.

327
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,633
This thing works fast.

328
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,500
So you just took
your helmet off...

329
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,867
you got a death wish?

330
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,101
This virus gets released,
goes airborne,

331
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:54,934
then dissipates
within a half-hour.

332
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,734
Seen enough?

333
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,401
Plenty.

334
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:03,600
So everyone
we're looking at

335
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,600
died this morning

336
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,567
because
they were within

337
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:06,934
the virus's
original radius?

338
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:08,067
Yeah, and if they
drove through town

339
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:09,201
an hour later,
they'd be fine.

340
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,301
That's something,
anyway,

341
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,468
but orson bailey,
trent appelbaum...

342
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,267
when a 4400
manifests an ability,

343
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,800
it can get more intense,
quickly.

344
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,567
Which means that
if jean delynn baker

345
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,201
is transmitting
the virus...

346
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,967
yeah, she might be
just warming up.

00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,267
Everybody's waiting.

361
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:50,468
Shawn?

362
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,533
Yeah, i'm flattered.

363
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,667
I'm just not sure

364
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,500
i can take a job
right now.

365
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,034
Richard's going to be
travelling quite a bit.

366
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:03,234
The daycare here is first-rate
and completely free.

367
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,368
Well, for one thing,
i'm not sure i'm qualified.

368
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,034
I mean, assistant director
of human resources?

369
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,134
I had my first daughter
right out of college.

370
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,700
You could fit my entire resume
on half a page.

371
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,134
You're a 4400.

372
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,900
That's like an advanced
graduate degree around here.

373
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,401
Besides,
jordan talked about you.

374
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,734
Oh, i'm sure he did.

375
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,633
He said you had
the gift of empathy,

376
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,101
that you were
a natural born organizer,

377
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,267
and that you had a knack

378
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,201
for bringing out
the best in people.

379
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,267
Jordan said that about me?

380
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,767
You're a returnee.

381
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,101
You're smart.

382
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,001
We empower people like you
around here.

383
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,700
Wipe your feet.

384
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,267
A killer airborne virus
has been released,

385
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:49,700
and you're worried
about muddy footprints?

386
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,567
It's still
somebody's home.

387
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,600
So this is where
jean delynn baker lived.

388
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,034
Until she hit
the road, yeah.

389
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,201
Does she keep a schedule?

390
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,667
Any kind of daily planner?

391
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,434
Yeah, but i think
it went out the window

392
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
when she realized

393
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,800
her entire hometown
had been wiped out.

394
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,468
Anyone get in touch
with the parents?

395
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,667
This
is their house.

396
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:06,767
They were sleeping
upstairs

397
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,368
when the virus hit.

398
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,767
Okay, you guys
aren't leaving this house

399
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,134
until you've been through
everything...

400
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,600
letters, phone bills,
grocery lists.

401
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,734
Marco, listen to me.

402
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,468
Find me a pattern,
the way she thinks.

403
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,734
She's on the run.

404
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,134
I want to beat her
to wherever she's headed.

405
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,800
Flirt.

406
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,167
You heard the man.

407
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,767
4400 center.
How may i direct your call?

408
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,101
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

409
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,301
I didn't mean to kill them.

410
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,034
I...

411
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,301
these... these blisters,
they itch so bad.

412
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:37,533
Killed who?

413
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,767
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to help me, please.</i>

414
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,067
Who is this?

415
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm a 4400,

416
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,934
and there's something wrong
with me.

417
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>that i'm around dies,</i>

418
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>and i don't know</i>
<i>how to stop it.</i>

419
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,067
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how to stop it.</i>

420
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,334
Tell me your name
and where you are.

421
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:49,301
How many
people dead?

422
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:50,468
She said hundreds,

423
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,334
but there's nothing about it
on the news.

424
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,001
Could be
they're trying to keep it quiet,

425
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,034
and there is a 4400
named jean baker?

426
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,667
She said
she's staying

427
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:58,867
at a motel near
the squirrel hill exit

428
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,967
on the 65.

429
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,334
Get me ntac on the phone.

430
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,633
Yes!

431
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,434
You were right.

432
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,401
Philadelphia creamed 'em.

433
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:14,767
How much
did you win?

434
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,267
$200 for aunt april.

435
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:21,101
All because of you,
my little genius.

436
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,567
Now, i'm looking
at chicago versus new york,

437
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,201
even up.

438
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,667
Chicago's the home team,
which gives them some advantage,

439
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:29,800
but new york
is coming off

440
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,500
a three-game
winning streak.

441
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,334
So, who's your pick?

442
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,101
How much are you betting?

443
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,767
The whole
200 bucks,

444
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,201
which won't win me
enough to retire on,

445
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,800
but a girl's got
to start somewhere.

446
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,800
So, you getting
anything?

447
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,067
Do you like me?

448
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,500
What kind of question is that?

449
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,767
I mean,

450
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,667
like me for myself...

451
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,201
or because i tell you stuff
that's going to happen?

452
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,967
Honey, listen.

453
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,234
I love you
for who you are,

454
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,734
not what you can do.

455
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,201
Always.

456
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,301
Okay?

457
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,700
I'd go with chicago.

458
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,800
Chicago it is.

459
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,401
Now, come on.

460
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,800
Aunt april is going
to take you out for pizza.

461
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,167
Go wash up,

462
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,533
and take your mom's stuff off.

463
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,267
You know she gets
kind of uptight about...

464
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:28,734
maia.

465
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,301
This is my mother's
engagement ring.

466
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,468
Where did you get this?

467
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,368
I always play with it.

468
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,401
This is a very valuable ring,

469
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:38,434
which means

470
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,167
it is not
for little girls

471
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,434
to play with.

472
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,234
Now wash good,
or i'll order anchovies.

473
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,767
Go!

474
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,134
Hey.

475
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,700
Hey.

476
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,767
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how'd you get in here?

477
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,767
Your dad gave me a key.

478
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,600
A little early
for dinner, isn't it?

479
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:10,034
Early for eating.
Not for preparing.

480
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,401
Can you cook?

481
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,434
Sorry, i'm a world-class
brain surgeon,

482
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,834
not a chef.

483
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,101
But i can empty
a grocery bag

484
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,967
with the best
of them, though.

485
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:21,600
But i have
to warn you,

486
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,734
you're ignoring

487
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,734
the number-one
"rule of dad."

488
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,334
Which is?

489
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,234
The longer and more carefully
you prepare for a family event...

490
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,800
the more likely it is
he won't show.

491
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,368
I guess you do know the man.

492
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,368
Which means i guess
you also know me,

493
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:38,001
which, i'm sorry,
is really weird.

494
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,201
You have to admit

495
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,734
it's a little strange
for me, too.

496
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,134
We have an eight-year
relationship,

497
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:43,600
and i have to
keep reminding myself

498
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,767
that it doesn't really exist.

499
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:49,468
So tell me,

500
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,600
was i, like, number one
in my class in medical school?

501
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,267
What does it matter, kyle?

502
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:56,067
You're not in competition
with yourself.

503
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,267
I'm just curious.

504
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,500
Well, you keep bringing it up.

505
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,001
It's more than curiosity.

506
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,301
So what if it is?

507
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,967
If you knew there was
some parallel universe

508
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:06,134
where a better, smarter version
of you was walking around,

509
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:07,533
how would you feel?

510
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,401
He wasn't better,
and he wasn't smarter.

511
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:10,867
He was you.

512
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,368
He just had options
i'll never have.

513
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,667
No 4400,
no coma.

514
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,301
He got to go to medical school.

515
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,368
Who says
you don't have that option?

516
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,567
I'm 21.
I'm a freshman in college.

517
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,067
So you started a little late.

518
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,667
You keep thinking
i know two kyles.

519
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:25,001
I don't. I just know you.

520
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,567
You want
to be a doctor?

521
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:30,468
I know for a fact
that you can pass your mcats.

522
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,867
Jean baker's in a motel

523
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,633
about 10 miles ahead.

524
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,600
Right now, half of ntac
is headed for that place.

525
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,001
Mortimer and falcone
should be there already.

526
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,167
It's weird, huh?

527
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,301
Responding to a tip

528
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,468
that came from inside
the 4400 center?

529
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,900
Shawn did tell me

530
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,368
he wanted
to cooperate with us.

531
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:49,800
I guess he meant it.

532
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,600
Excuse me. We're ntac.

533
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,800
We need to get through here.

534
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,633
I'll open it for you.

535
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,934
So what's going on
down there?

536
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,167
Dead trucker.

537
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:13,468
Looks like
it came on sudden.

538
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,867
Jean delynn baker?

539
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,101
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

540
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,201
I called you for help.

541
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,134
We know.
Come with us.

542
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,434
No, you're scaring me.

543
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
Please, stop.

544
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,967
They start to itch
when i get scared.

545
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:00,067
Please, get away from me!

546
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,633
Oh, god.

547
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,900
H
that trucker died

548
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,533
not more than
three hours ago.

549
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,700
Yeah, and he couldn't
have picked up jean

550
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,834
more than two hours
before that.

551
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,167
Which means
he was exposed, infected,

552
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,500
and killed within,
what, 120 minutes.

553
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,734
That's faster

554
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
than any virus
i've ever seen.

555
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,834
Mortimer and falcone.

556
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,067
Looks like
we're playing backup.

557
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,134
Baldwin.

558
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,301
[Jean]: <i>it's not my fault.</i>

559
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,301
Who is this?

560
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,567
<i>I called you for help.</i>

561
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,567
You tossed tear gas
into my room!

562
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:56,900
Jean baker?

563
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,600
How did you get
mortimer's phone?

564
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,900
<i>How do you think i got it?</i>

565
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,067
They scared me.

566
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:05,834
They... they came barging in
to my room.

567
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,468
What did you do
to them?

568
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,767
<i>I guess you thought</i>
<i>those suits they had on</i>

569
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,900
<i>would keep them safe, huh?</i>

570
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,934
<i>Well, you were wrong, okay?</i>

571
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,134
Nobody's safe.

572
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,533
That's why i'm warning you.

573
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,368
You stay away from me, okay.

574
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:20,434
Just keep everyone away.

575
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,234
Where are you?
<i>I'm driving.</i>

576
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,500
I think
she took their car.

577
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,034
Call jarvis.
Get a bead on it.

578
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:26,267
Jean, tell me
where you are,

579
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:27,267
where you're going.

580
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:28,533
We want to help you.

581
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,567
<i>No. I tried that.</i>

582
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,767
No one can help me.

583
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,167
No one ever could.

584
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:33,700
Why should it be
any different now?

585
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,767
I know you don't want
to kill anyone,

586
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,034
but listen to me,

587
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,600
this virus that's
growing inside you,

588
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,034
it's incredibly lethal.

589
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,434
I've always been toxic.

590
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,401
I poisoned every relationship
i ever had.

591
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:45,301
This is different.

592
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:47,267
Yes, they made it real.

593
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:51,101
<i>My parents always said</i>
<i>i was a walking disaster.</i>

594
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:53,234
They never got to see
how right they were.

595
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,434
<i>Jean, it doesn't have</i>
<i>to be like that.</i>

596
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,567
If you want this
to be over,

597
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:57,800
it can be.

598
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,267
Just find a deserted
spot, pull over,

599
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:00,567
and wait for us
to come to you.

600
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:01,633
<i>I don't need you.</i>

601
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,834
I'm taking care of it myself.

602
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,334
What are you
going to do?

603
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:08,301
I'm going to end this
before i kill anyone else.

604
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:09,700
End what?

605
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,167
This phone call, this day,
everything.

606
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,067
No, jean, just wait.
Hold on. Listen to me.

607
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,800
Goodbye, baldwin.

608
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,967
She says she's going
to kill herself.

609
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,533
Well, i'm not sure
that's a solution.

610
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,900
It could trigger
another release of the virus.

611
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,301
Do we have a fix on her?

612
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:26,834
Yeah, she's driving west
on the 99.

613
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,368
Jarvis has got three
helicopters in the air.

614
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,767
If she doesn't pull over,

615
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,234
there's orders
to incinerate.

616
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,633
Vacation?

617
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,001
For how long?

618
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,533
A month, maybe two.

619
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,834
I don't know.

620
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,468
You think that's what
the center, the movement,

621
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:41,567
needs right now?

622
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:42,633
I don't know, matthew,

623
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,633
but i'm damn sure

624
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,134
it's what i need
right now.

625
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,667
I think you're going
to have to settle

626
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,134
for a long weekend.

627
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,633
I hear puget sound
is nice.

628
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,834
Okay, you're not hearing me.

629
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,034
I'm ignoring you.

630
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:53,201
There's a difference.

631
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,800
Listen.

632
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,633
I'm not saying
i can't do this.

633
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,301
I will lead this movement.

634
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,067
But jordan just died,

635
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,834
and i need some time
to get my head around that.

636
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,334
You're going to have to grieve
on the run

637
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:09,533
like the rest of us.

638
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,201
It's called being a grownup.

639
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,667
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.

640
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,567
You just got here,

641
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,201
and if this place needs me

642
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,800
the way that you keep
saying that it does,

643
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,167
then it's going to have
to work around me sometimes.

644
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:25,434
Work around you?

645
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,633
We can do that.

646
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,034
Mary o'connell.

647
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,567
Taken 1972.

648
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,034
Very promising empath.

649
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:33,434
Robert fields,
1987.

650
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,767
Genius with numbers
and pattern recognition.

651
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,934
John gersten...

652
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,201
who are these people?

653
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,767
Replacements, potentially.

654
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:42,767
None of them make
the slam dunk you would,

655
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,500
but i'm ready
to move this center forward,

656
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,633
with you or otherwise.

657
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,533
Jordan used to talk to me
that way sometimes.

658
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,167
He was great at getting me
to see things his way.

659
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:01,334
You?

660
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,267
You're not quite there yet.

661
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:08,134
Your healing power
makes you unique.

662
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,001
Jordan knew it.

663
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,468
I believed it.

664
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,401
I came here to work with you,

665
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:16,067
but you're asking me
to work around you,

666
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:17,800
and that i can't do.

667
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,067
Then you are going
to have to spend

668
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:21,867
some quality time
with that list,

669
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,434
because i'm leaving.

670
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,700
I'm sure you won't
miss a beat, though.

671
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:30,500
I know there's a huge demand
for pattern recognition.

672
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,368
Th-th-that's impossible.

673
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:39,934
Mortimer and falcone
were wearing

674
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,867
state-of-the-art
biohazard gear.

675
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,468
That stuff's engineered
to withstand an anthrax attack.

676
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,167
They're dead, marco.

677
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,700
Obviously, whatever
she's releasing

678
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,900
is a little craftier
than the anthrax virus.

679
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,533
If it got through those suits,

680
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,434
that means the antigen's
operating on a subatomic level.

681
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,434
Which basically
makes it unstoppable.

682
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,734
<i>Yeah, pretty much.</i>

683
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,234
Jean told me mortimer
and falcone scared her

684
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,401
when they came
into her room.

685
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,301
Is it possible
the release of this virus

686
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:02,800
is connected
to her emotional state?

687
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,267
Yeah, more than possible,
it's likely.

688
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,500
Her medicine cabinet
is basically a neon sign

689
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,600
flashing "borderline
personality disorder."

690
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:14,434
<i>She's got cortisone creams</i>
<i>for stress rashes,</i>

691
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,633
<i>an assortment</i>

692
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,567
of your finer
psychopharmaceuticals...

693
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,167
xanax, prozac...

694
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:20,401
<i>yeah,</i>
<i>we get it, marco.</i>

695
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:21,834
<i>She's a wreck.</i>

696
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,734
A wreck whose body acts
as a delivery system

697
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,267
for the virus she's producing...

698
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,533
the same way
flowers release pollen.

699
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,201
What, she's emitting
spores?

700
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,101
<i>Something like that.</i>

701
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,600
<i>Look, spores are just</i>

702
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,967
reproductive bodies
released by a vascular system.

703
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,533
The human body
is one big vascular system.

704
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,201
It runs on blood flow.

705
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,600
Yeah, which can
speed up or slow down,

706
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,934
depending on moods,
feelings.

707
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,633
Right, so when jean's blood
gets going...

708
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,167
when she's angry,
confused, upset, whatever...

709
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,867
a killer virus goes airborne.

710
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,834
We're not far
from her car now, marco.

711
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
Any advice on how
to deal with her?

712
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,533
Uh... don't piss her off?

713
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Hey.

714
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,567
Hi.
How are you, lily?

715
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,667
Good.

716
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,468
I heard, um,
you're leaving for a while.

717
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,434
That was fast.

718
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,934
Anyway, yeah, i don't know
how long i'm going to be gone.

719
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,334
What are you going to do?

720
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,334
For starters, i'm going to
disappear for a while,

721
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,500
and then, um, i don't know,
who knows?

722
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,134
I mean, i don't have
to work here

723
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,667
to make people healthy,

724
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,800
so i guess i could go anywhere.

725
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:46,267
So you're just
going to kind of roam the earth,

726
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,734
kung fu style?

727
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,667
I'm not going to shave my head
and wear a robe,

728
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:51,834
but... something like that,
i guess.

729
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,001
Well, you could take these
with you,

730
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,334
check out
the return address...

731
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,700
stop off

732
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,434
in gloucester, massachusetts,

733
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,468
do a quick healing,

734
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,700
and then go on your way.

735
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,633
You know about the letters?

736
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,767
Oh, shawn,
they're everywhere.

737
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:06,934
Yeah, each one sadder
than the next.

738
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,134
It's too much to take, almost.

739
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:13,401
It did give me
an idea, though,

740
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,167
but, you know, you're leaving,

741
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:17,468
so we'll talk it over
when you get back.

742
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,067
No, lily, i mean...

743
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,967
like i said, i don't know when
that's going to be, so, please,

744
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:24,900
i would love to hear
what you have to say.

745
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:26,633
All right, well,

746
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,067
i was thinking...

747
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:31,533
i mean, we're not
a hospital,

748
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,667
and we're not
a charity,

749
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,800
and still, thousands
of these requests

750
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:36,934
keep pouring in
every day.

751
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,567
I mean, no wonder
you feel overwhelmed.

752
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:39,967
We're not set up
to handle it.

753
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,301
Yes, exactly.

754
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:44,001
That's why
i've got to get out of here.

755
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,101
What if we set up a foundation?

756
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,800
Part of this place,
but separate.

757
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,633
Hire a staff
whose only job

758
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,267
is to open
these letters

759
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,500
and find the neediest cases,

760
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:57,334
people that we can help
that no one else can.

761
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,767
But that is still saying no
to thousands of people.

762
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,600
Well, that's right, shawn,

763
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,067
but what if we can say yes
to one?

764
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,867
I mean, you heal
one person a day,

765
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,267
every day.

766
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,967
That's a big job, though...

767
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,667
deciding who deserves it most.

768
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,500
Well, so you form a committee,

769
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:28,533
and you load it up
with doctors and social workers.

770
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
And you.

771
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,900
Oh. Well...

772
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,533
come on, i mean,
it's your idea.

773
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,301
You should at least be there
to help make it happen.

774
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:36,834
Yeah, i just took a job
at human resources.

775
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,334
I think i could probably
get you transferred.

776
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,301
Did you find a body
in there?

777
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:55,734
Can't get
close enough yet.

778
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,434
As soon as you can,
we need to retrieve it.

779
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,533
Well, she said
she wanted to end it.

780
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,267
I guess we could send
marco and his boys

781
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:04,401
back down
to the basement,

782
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:05,767
let 'em find
a ripple effect

783
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:06,767
on this one.

784
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:08,967
Excuse me.

785
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,800
Baldwin.

786
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:13,134
<i>I came close,</i>
<i>but i don't know...</i>

787
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:14,234
jean?

788
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,101
I couldn't go through with it.

789
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,767
That's good.
Nobody wants you dead.

790
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,368
Just tell me where you are.

791
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:20,734
<i>No. You can't</i>
<i>help me.</i>

792
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,001
The 4400 center can't help me,
but it doesn't matter.

793
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,067
I finally know
where i'm supposed to go.

794
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,301
Tell me where.

795
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,667
I'll meet you
there.

796
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,167
You ever read
the <i>bible,</i> baldwin?

797
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,967
I went to sunday school.

798
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,001
<i>I spent some time</i>
<i>with it earlier today,</i>

799
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,567
<i>back at that motel.</i>

800
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,067
"The time is at hand."

801
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:38,234
That's "revelations," right?

802
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:39,434
<i>But do you know</i>
<i>what it means?</i>

803
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,533
<i>I bet you don't.</i>

804
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,368
See, these blisters...

805
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:48,134
they form on my hands.

806
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:50,734
Do you get it?

807
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,167
I'm not sure i do, jean.

808
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:54,667
<i>They're talking</i>
<i>about me in that book.</i>

809
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,900
You got family?

810
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,334
Jean, what are you
talking about?

811
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:02,434
<i>Go to them.</i>

812
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,134
Hug them real tight.

813
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>I've finally</i>
<i>figured it out,</i>

814
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,934
<i>why they</i>
<i>sent me back.</i>

815
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,201
I'm part of their plan.

816
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:11,900
They want me to do this.

817
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:14,134
Do what?

818
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,034
Purify humanity.

819
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:24,900
She was quoting "revelations?"

820
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,667
Never a good sign, tom.

821
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,234
She's gone
from wanting to help,

822
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,401
wanting to stop
all of this,

823
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,067
to believing she's
the end of the world,

824
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:32,334
so what does she do?

825
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:35,001
She said they want her
to do this, right?

826
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,401
Well, that implies
it's out of her hands.

827
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:39,600
Destiny.

828
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,667
She's giving up
responsibility.

829
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,034
Yeah, that's one way

830
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,468
to deal with being
a walking plague...

831
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:45,600
pretend the decision's
out of your hands.

832
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,734
I don't think
she wants to even

833
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,767
think about it
anymore.

834
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,167
I think she just
wants it over.

835
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,368
Well,
that's her mindset.

836
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,834
It still doesn't tell us
where she's going.

837
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,201
She's on
autopilot, tom.

838
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:54,967
My best guess?

839
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,234
She does whatever
she planned on doing

840
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,101
before the bodies
started rolling.

841
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,867
Right.
[Cellphone ringing]

842
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,234
Marco.

843
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,567
Today's tuesday, right?

844
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,567
<i>It's wednesday,</i>
<i>marco.</i>

845
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,301
My bad.

846
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,134
She's only got one thing
written down for the day.

847
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:11,900
She's filing
her unemployment claim

848
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:14,167
in downtown portland.

849
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:16,434
Son of a bitch!

850
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,034
I don't believe it.

851
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,368
Am i dreaming,

852
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:22,800
or did you not tell me
that chicago would win?

853
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:26,368
Do you know
what i bet?

854
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:28,368
$200.

855
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:31,334
Try my mother's
diamond engagement ring,

856
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,034
and now it's gone,

857
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:37,767
all because i believed in you,
trusted you,

858
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,101
and you let me down.

859
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,334
You lied to me.

860
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,267
You said winning
didn't matter.

861
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,167
You said you liked me anyway.

862
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,067
Oh, so you knew chicago
would lose, didn't you?

863
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,267
Right from the jump,

864
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:54,900
this was all just a test.

865
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,468
A foundation?

866
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,834
Don't you think

867
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,334
we have our hands
full already?

868
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,368
It's one person a day.

869
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,001
Once it's up
and running,

870
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,134
it's not really going
to eat into my time.

871
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,001
I thought you were
looking for privacy.

872
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,201
You do this,

873
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,934
you're stepping into
a white-hot spotlight.

874
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,301
Yes, but it's
on my terms.

875
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:21,567
Be good publicity.

876
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,468
Not too hard
to get off the ground.

877
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,967
We could get
some huge names

878
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,567
for that
filtering committee.

879
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,533
I think
it's a good idea.

880
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,500
Well, i'm glad
that you approve,

881
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,368
but i wasn't really asking
for your permission.

882
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:38,034
I would hope not.

883
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:12,267
Jean.

884
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,434
Baldwin?

885
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,834
That's right.

886
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,967
You should've stayed away.

887
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,700
Look around you.

888
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,867
All these people, they haven't
done anything to hurt you.

889
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,301
They haven't done anything
to help me, either.

890
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:31,167
Besides,
it doesn't matter.

891
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:33,368
I don't have a choice.

892
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:34,934
I am doing
what they wanted me to do.

893
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,001
 You don't have
to accept that.

894
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,533
You have a choice.

895
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,734
Yeah, like i had a choice
when i was abducted.

896
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,401
I never had a choice.

897
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:44,600
Ever.

898
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,900
They have

899
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,201
the right girl
for the job.

900
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:50,101
What are you doing
here, anyway?

901
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,267
You should have gone

902
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,700
back to your family,
like i said.

903
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,234
No. I'm right where
i want to be.

904
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,034
Then you must have
some kind of death wish.

905
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,201
You think you're here
to kill people.

906
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,900
I think i'm here to stop you.

907
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,800
They infected you, jean,
and that was wrong,

908
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:06,401
but you don't have to let them
make you into a mass murderer.

909
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,633
I'm already a killer.

910
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,067
No. No.

911
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,468
You haven't decided
to kill anyone.

912
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,434
That's what you're doing
right now.

913
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,700
Whatever
you're thinking

914
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,567
about destiny or fate,
whatever...

915
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,101
you're wrong.

916
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:22,034
You don't have to do this.

917
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:24,201
You don't.

918
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:27,700
Want to hear
something funny?

919
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:30,834
I... i believe you.

920
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:36,167
But it's too late.

921
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:39,067
Oh...
they're so ripe.

922
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:41,600
I can't stop it now.

923
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:45,167
They itch so bad.

924
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:46,734
They do.

925
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:25,168
Hell of a day.

926
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:26,801
How are you holding up?

927
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,068
Well...

928
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,600
i'm scheduled

929
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,333
for psychiatric
counseling on monday.

930
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,567
Saved thousands
of innocent people,

931
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,734
had to shoot a woman
to do it...

932
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:38,567
you did what you had to do.

933
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,801
Anyway, uh,

934
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:43,500
not sure if this
is a good time,

935
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,600
but i made you
a little something.

936
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,867
It's kind of a...

937
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,500
well, a fake version
of maia's diary.

938
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,934
Should fool
just about anybody.

939
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:54,734
You forged this
to get ntac off my back?

940
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,233
I know
it's a big thing,

941
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,001
but you were kind of
over a barrel, so...

942
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,300
this could get me
into a lot of trouble.

943
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,367
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.

944
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:06,534
Yeah, uh...

945
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,801
you don't
have to use it

946
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,034
if you don't want to.

947
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:10,333
Just giving you
an option.

948
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,934
This is insane.

949
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,967
It's also maybe one
of the nicest things

950
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:20,134
anybody's ever done
for me.

951
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,233
I want to thank you
for a job well done.

952
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,034
You must have been
very persuasive.

953
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:28,600
I just said what i thought.

954
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,400
Your idea for a foundation
was terrific.

955
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,300
You mean your idea, don't you?

956
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,333
Do we have to be

957
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,667
all cloak-and-dagger
about it?

958
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:36,734
You and shawn

959
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:38,200
both got what you wanted,

960
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,734
and a lot of sick people
are going to get help.

961
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,068
Well, you did a lot of good
for the center today,

962
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:44,300
and i'm not going to forget it.

963
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,400
Hey, matthew,

964
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,168
you know what the center
means to me?

965
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,567
What?

966
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:52,168
Free rent and daycare
for my daughter.

967
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,101
I'm not
an 18-year-old kid.

968
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,400
I don't need to discover
the magic power inside of me.

969
00:38:57,467 --> 00:39:00,934
So, in other words...

970
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:03,200
you're not a true believer?

971
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,534
Is that a problem?

972
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:09,333
Not at all.

973
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,534
Neither am i.

974
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,600
You look wiped.

975
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:31,867
Yeah. Don't ask.

976
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,534
You didn't
have to do this.

977
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,934
Well, i didn't.

978
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,300
Your son's the cook.

979
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,767
Kyle?

980
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,467
I bet he had
a little help.

981
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:41,500
Well, you know,
we got to talking.

982
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,600
It was nice.

983
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:47,068
How was your day, alana?

984
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,701
Well, i bought
these pieces

985
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,801
from this young artist,
this girl from bed-stuy,

986
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:53,967
self-taught,

987
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,068
and she painted

988
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:56,567
this little
scrap of garden

989
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:58,068
in her backyard,

990
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,534
and it's night,

991
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,101
and the sky
is so rich and deep...

992
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,500
You okay?

993
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,068
More or less.

994
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:20,600
Bet you almost forgot.

995
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,600
No, i didn't,

996
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,134
but i thought,
in light of today's events,

997
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,701
i would give you
a little extension.

998
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,567
Well, it's not necessary.

999
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,134
It's a hot read.

1000
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,667
Lots of good stuff
about spongebob.

1001
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,500
