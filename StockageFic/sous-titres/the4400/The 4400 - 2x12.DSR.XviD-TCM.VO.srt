1
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,056
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,020
Kevin's a genius, you know,

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,375
but he doesn't brag about it.

4
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,627
Kevin, did you just speak to me ?

5
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:56,601
I haven't

6
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,760
said anything for a long time.

7
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:00,967
Try six years.

8
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:04,348
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father of the 4400 technology.

9
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:06,779
I can think again too.

10
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,787
Kyle never came home last night.

11
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:09,923
Kyle said he blacked out.

12
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,316
You could've come to me, told me what was
going on. He's your cousin, your friend.

13
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,639
Kyle thinks he did something during one of
his blackouts. He seemed really freaked out about it.

14
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,630

This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier ?

15
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:21,990
If it happened during one of his blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

16
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:25,062
I don't remember them telling me
to turn my son into a murderer.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,166
I kept hoping
i was wrong about it.

18
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,796
This is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold onto that.

19
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:30,606
Kyle...

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,590
you weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

21
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,898
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

22
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,892
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

23
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,134
They just arrested
a suspect in the Collier killing.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,312
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for. It's all over.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,532
Not yet.

26
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,225
Thursday, July 28
5:37 pm

27
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:56,897
Mommy,

28
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,280
i'm scared.

29
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:00,748
I know, baby.

30
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,531
I'm scared too.

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,268
But it's going to be okay,

32
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,159
because mommy's here.

33
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,385
Okay ?

34
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,152
Whatever's coming through that door...

35
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:23,930
i'll protect you.

36
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,169
Thursday, July 28
7:22 am
Ten Hours Earlier

37
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,341
Today is Jordan Collier's Birthday

38
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:04,891
He died on NTAC's watch

39
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,648
What does that mean ?

40
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:09,021
What's what means ?

41
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,135
Nothing.
Just some crank..

42
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:12,873
it's nothing.

43
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,315
Guess it's Jordan Collier's birthday.

44
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,576
The state of washington gave him
a birthday present. Did you read this ?

45
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:20,366
They're talking like
it's an open-and-shut case.

46
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,842
He made threats against Collier.
Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup.

47
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,390
But they're wrong.
Roy marsden didn't kill Jordan Collier.

48
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:27,683
And neither did you, Kyle.

49
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,220
You told me he'd never see a courtroom.
They want to execute this guy.

50
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:34,603
It's not going to happen, Kyle.
No one can put him up on that roof. Any...

51
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:38,806
any public defender will have a motion to dismiss
in front of a judge by this time next week.

52
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,706
What if you're wrong ? What if they find him guilty ?
What am i supposed to do ? Nothing ?

53
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,141
Marsden has been in and out of jail since
he was 15. Theft, assault, attempted rape...

54
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,327
but he didn't kill anybody.

55
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,262
And he's not going to be convicted of it, Kyle.
I'm not going to let it happen.

56
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,553
Neither will i.

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,731
Kyle, it's not going to be easy, but you're going
to have to start putting all this behind you.

58
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,750
It's your first day back at school,

59
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,205
and i want you focused

60
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:05,696
and fierce,

61
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,810
and thinking about "a"s.

62
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:11,567
Okay.

63
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,140
Okay.

64
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,336
All right.

65
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:24,658
Sweetie...

66
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:28,216
Mrs. Benke's going to be here
any minute. It's time to get up.

67
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,243
I don't feel good.

68
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,892
You've got a real fever, young lady.

69
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:42,133
Hey,

70
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,611
how long have you had that ?

71
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:50,669
Dishonest ? No, no, no.
I don't think we're being dishonest at all.

72
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:54,762
Human beings use less than
20% of their brain capacity.

73
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,582
Everything else is just...

74
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,457
collecting cobwebs.
Here at the 4400 center,

75
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,338
we're trying to tap into
that unused potential.

76
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,281
So your own ability, you believe it
stems from increased brainpower ?

77
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,089
Show me another explanation.

78
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:10,809
Look, whether you believe that
we were taken to the future or not,

79
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:14,261
somebody did change us,
and they used technology to do it.

80
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,727
We're just trying to figure out
how and share it.

81
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:21,123
But "first keys," "second keys,"
"unlocking the ability inside you..."

82
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:24,902
you have to admit that the terminology
is more religious than scientific.

83
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,685
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

84
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:29,393
It's a potent combination.

85
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,758
So what time was
your appointment for ?

86
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,984
They told me 11:15...

87
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,661
but they always tell me 11:15.

88
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,878
I never get in before 12:00, 12:30.

89
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,159
Hey, free health care, right ?
So what if they're so slow ?

90
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,218
Compulsory free health care.

91
00:06:57,324 --> 00:07:01,410
You don't show up for a quarterly checkup,
you've got the goon squad knocking at your door.

92
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,620
You don't like it ?

93
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:03,876
Don't show.

94
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,976
Doubt they'd slap the cuffs
on someone's grandma.

95
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,471
Does it itch at all ?

96
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,258
Here.

97
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,081
103.1.

98
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,708
No wonder you wanted
to stay in bed.

99
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,768
Is it some kind of flu ?

100
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:22,559
Most likely.

101
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,118
Is it okay if we keep her
here for a few hours ?

102
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,504
I want to go home.

103
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:30,261
I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you,

104
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,680
and i'll look in on you as often as i can.

105
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:34,659
I wish i brought Lemon.

106
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,078
That's her stuffed dog.

107
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,309
Let me guess.
He's yellow.

108
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,492
Yeah. Well, i could go
back and get him.

109
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:44,418
You have a very nice mommy.

110
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,508
I try.

111
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,563
About this rash...

112
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,032
now, i worked at the C. D. C. for seven years,
and i never saw anything like it.

113
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,582
It's kind of a weird shape, huh ?

114
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:55,227
Yeah.

115
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,564
Don't read too much into it.
It could still be

116
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,182
hives... an allergic reaction.
We'll take care of it.

117
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,447
Sweetie, you'll be okay here

118
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,645
if i go get lemon ?

119
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,512
Okay, my darling.

120
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,696
Bye, darling.

121
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,792
When daddy's away, he misses Isabelle so much.
But traveling around the country,

122
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:18,943
talking to all sorts of people,
clueing them in about my life...

123
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:20,927
it's kind of fun.

124
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,132
Shawn's amazing.

125
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,164
This woman comes in.

126
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:31,322
Her c. a. t. Scan says she's got
a brain tumor the size of a walnut.

127
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:34,002
20 minutes later, she's on
her way. Good as new.

128
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:34,767
Hmm.

129
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,570
I'll feed her.

130
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:38,131
She's not hungry yet.

131
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:39,754
How do you know ?

132
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,645
She told me before you came in.

133
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:43,171
So she's...

134
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:44,991
... talking to me.

135
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,185
Communicating.
Same as she does with you.

136
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,837
- Since when ?
- This morning.

137
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,598
I thought you'd be happy.
First time she ever said anything to me.

138
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:00,512
That's great.
It's just...

139
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,128
she hasn't said anything
to me for weeks.

140
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,946
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just how you used to tell me...

141
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:10,450
kids always alternate
between parents. It's normal...

142
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,818
just with Isabelle,
it comes with a twist.

143
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:25,896
This is major Charles Culp of the National
Security Agency's field enforcement division.

144
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,752
D. C. Has loaned us his services.

145
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,694
Effective immediately, the major
and his team will be providing backup

146
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:34,293
in any 4400 cases
requiring armed intervention.

147
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,762
We know this office bears
a heavy caseload,

148
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,652
and we're here to help when needed.

149
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:41,944
Welcome aboard.

150
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:45,102
Hope you guys are up to it, 'cause
i'm going to have you on speed dial.

151
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:47,921
We'll stay out of your way,
let you do your jobs.

152
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:49,353
When the time comes,

153
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,185
we hope you'll return the favor.

154
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,806
Well, the last lady that we went up against
released poison spores from her palms, so, uh...

155
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,931
if you want to track her
down instead of me...

156
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,211
by all means.

157
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,876
My men and i are used to
unique challenges.

158
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,812
How long have we been asking
for tactical support ?

159
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,796
Eight months.

160
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,687
I guess someone up
there likes us.

161
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,706
You guys check your emails
this morning ?

162
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,301
"Happy birthday, Jordan Collier" ?

163
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,720
Everyone in the building
got that one.

164
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,821
Maybe Marco should have one
of his guys try to backtrack it.

165
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:22,776
They already did. It came from
a public terminal in an internet cafe.

166
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,596
It was a new email account.

167
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,716
Nice to know
Collier's still got his fans.

168
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,039
What's that ?

169
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:34,066
It's valerian root or

170
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,295
something. I don't know. Alana swears by it.
They calm me down a little.

171
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,490
My suggestion ?
Double your dosage.

172
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,731
The Baldwin trigger has been
a little "hair" lately.

173
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,351
My girlfriend agrees with you.

174
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,570
I need you to cover me
for an hour.

175
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:49,621
Maia's got the flu or something, and
Hudson wants her to spend the day here.

176
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:50,520
She okay ?

177
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm sure it's nothing.

178
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:56,461
I mean, i was sure that it was the bubonic plague,
but her doctor tells me that it's nothing.

179
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,112
So you plowed into some guy
and got away with it ?

180
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,396
That's kind of a weird way to put it.

181
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,907
Well, the perks of having
a dad at N. T. A. C., i guess.

182
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,420
And this guy you hit,
how messed up was he ?

183
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,944
I can't really talk about it.
You know, it's lawyer stuff.

184
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,578
Who am i going to tell ?

185
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,439
I broke both his legs
and his collarbone.

186
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:18,989
That's it ?

187
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:22,397
He was in a car, Danny.
It's not like i mowed over a pedestrian.

188
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,401
Yeah, but you kept talking about this "awful thing"
you did. I thought you killed somebody.

189
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:27,727
What ?

190
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,853
Well, thanks a lot, man.

191
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,091
So did Shawn.

192
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,240
Well, sorry to disappoint you guys.

193
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,162
Well, look, do me a favor, okay ?

194
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,898
If you get in trouble again,
tell somebody.

195
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,479
There's nothing you can tell me
or Shawn that we can't handle.

196
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,546
Next time i black out and have a car accident,
you'll be the first to know.

197
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,258
Yeah, long as i'm not riding shotgun.

198
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:53,471
Oh, hey, listen, you want to go see
arcade fire with me on friday night, or

199
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:55,923
do you have to stay home
and nurse your guilty conscience ?

200
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,156
No nursing. I'll go.

201
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,931
- Yeah ?
- I'll go.

202
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:58,941
- All right.
- Yeah.

203
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:00,772
It's good to have you back.

204
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,324
Good to be back.

205
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:04,437
I got to go.

206
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,515
Okay. See you.

207
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,138
You hear that ?

208
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:37,369
That buzz ?

209
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,007
What is it ?

210
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,944
What ?

211
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,537
Is that coming from your gadget ?

212
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,862
Is what coming from my gadget ?

213
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,141
That noise.

214
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,572
I don't hear anything.

215
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,157
Neither do i.

216
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:23,921
What is that noise ?

217
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:25,852
You hear that ?

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,081
What's going on ?

219
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,476
I've got, like, a headache.

220
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:39,378
Did you hear that ?

221
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:41,377
A gift from me to you

222
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:45,598
Have fun trying to survive the day

223
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:48,910
Why is my signature
on this requisition ?

224
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,927
Because i had to get it in !

225
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,579
Do not sign my name
on another report.

226
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,255
They sit on your desk for weeks.

227
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:58,172
If there's a space for my signature,
it should be my signature !

228
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,241
Foster and mcclenahan are tearing
each other apart by the elevator.

229
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,178
Right before this started,
there was a noise.

230
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:05,247
I didn't hear anything.

231
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,621
Yeah, well, the rest of us did !

232
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,634
there was some kind
of high-pitched whine,

233
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,614
and we got another one of those emails.
It said, "have fun trying to survive the day."

234
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,267
Show me.

235
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:18,340
Okay, everybody try to stay calm.

236
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,949
If this noise or signal did something
to you... you've got to fight it.

237
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,355
What she's talking about ?

238
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,289
What did i just tell you ?

239
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,642
- Nina.
- you saw it.

240
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:41,117
She pulled her weapon first.
I was defending myself...

241
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:43,987
how is she ?

242
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,070
Breathing.
She's bleeding pretty bad.

243
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,407
Get her to medical.
Park is under arrest.

244
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,884
Crowley, restrain him.

245
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,414
Baldwin, what are you doing ?

246
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:58,828
Until we know what's going on,
nobody gets in and nobody goes out.

247
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:02,022
What's going on ?

248
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,496
Security procedure enabled.

249
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,411
Who's a very good girl ?
Isabelle is.

250
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,806
Isabelle's a smartie.

251
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,017
Glad to see you guys are having fun.

252
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:25,236
Lily. I didn't expect to
see you till 5:00.

253
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,925
Well, i'm taking an early lunch. I thought
i'd take Isabelle out to the garden.

254
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,966
That sounds fun.
Doesn't it, little girl ?

255
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,545
Oh, i use flash cards with her
all the time.

256
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,940
Let's see if i can find an apple.
It's her favorite.

257
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,312
What is this ?

258
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:56,350
Someone's been mixing up our cards.
I've told them a million times.

259
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,970
What do you use these for ?

260
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,802
These don't belong in the nursery.

261
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:04,463
I think they use them for the applicants.
Part of their psych profile. Sorry.

262
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,485
Okay, Isabelle.

263
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:09,468
Going to go with mommy.

264
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,229
Okay.

265
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,201
See you real soon.

266
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,139
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

267
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:32,560
It's a potent combination.

268
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,671
The movement's 100,000 members
would certainly agree,

269
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,825
but Kevin Burkhoff, a neuroscientist
at western washington university,

270
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,187
thinks otherwise.

271
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,384
Uh, i don't question anybody's faith.
Why should i ? Faith is a good thing, right ?

272
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,065
But what they're doing over there at the center
has nothing to do with science. I mean,

273
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,491
you tell me how fasting,
meditation, and chanting

274
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:57,795
can alter, in any way, your
neurochemistry. It's preposterous.

275
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,273
It's a good scam,
but still preposterous.

276
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,752
"Scam." That's a strong word.

277
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,758
it fits. They're taking
this kernel of truth

278
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:08,877
about the brain's potential, and using it
to bilk people out of their life savings.

279
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,825
A lot of people might be surprised
by your stance. After all,

280
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:15,095
you suffered from paranoid
personality disorder for years.

281
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,228
Wasn't it a device engineered
by a 4400 that cured you ?

282
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:21,077
Yes, and i'm grateful,

283
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:25,544
but you need to make the distinction
between the 4400 and the 4400 center.

284
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,749
4400s have remarkable abilities...
everybody knows it...

285
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:32,495
but the center is co-opting
that phenomenon for profit.

286
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,245
Those machines they're hooking
people up to over there ?

287
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,453
They might as well not
even be plugged in.

288
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,517
If you ask me, he still
looks rather demented.

289
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:45,200
He seemed pretty sane to me, Matthew,
especially when he was ripping us...

290
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,949
Shawn, don't overreact.

291
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,229
It's just one interview.

292
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:48,992
Oh...

293
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,267
You did good, though.

294
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,298
Yeah.

295
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,422
Garrity, give me the gun.

296
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,158
Look, this is crazy, Baldwin.

297
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,447
How are we going to
defend ourselves ?

298
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,772
Whoever's doing this wants us
to attack each other.

299
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:05,132
If we stay armed, we're dead
by the end of the day.

300
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,647
If we don't, we'll be slaughtered.

301
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,423
Look, everyone in the building
is under the effects of this thing, okay ?

302
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,135
The cafeteria staff could be
forming an army right now.

303
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:15,000
Which is why i'll find out
who's doing this and stop it.

304
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:18,182
They're doing checkups in the medical lab today.
That means there's 4400s in the building.

305
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:19,633
You think that one of them
is behind this ?

306
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:20,502
I...

307
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:22,510
I don't know,

308
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,799
but right now,
it's all i have to go on.

309
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,185
You ?

310
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:27,887
Who put you in command ?

311
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,513
He's not. I am.

312
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,527
This building is the target
of a 4400 terrorist attack.

313
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,124
It is now a military situation.

314
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,438
This is great, Baldwin.

315
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,598
Why don't you explain to these guys
why they should just lay down their arms, huh ?

316
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:42,599
Major Culp, the signal, whatever it is,
it's like someone set off a rage bomb.

317
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:45,934
It's pumping up the aggression of everybody
in the building. The men, anyway.

318
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,288
We cannot be walking around
with loaded firearms.

319
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:50,989
My team's trained to resist
psychological pressure tactics.

320
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,631
This is a 4400 ability.
You can't resist it.

321
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:56,755
There's 4400s down in the med lab.
It's probably one of them doing it.

322
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,809
Baldwin was just headed
down there right now.

323
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:00,465
Cartwright, watch them.

324
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,906
Everyone else, with me.

325
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:02,963
Just wait. Wait.

326
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,017
What are you going to do ?

327
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,967
I'm going to find out which one of
them's responsible for this.

328
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:08,082
And then what ?

329
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,442
I'm going to make sure that it stops.

330
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,906
Be careful.
There's a little girl down there.

331
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,502
If it's not her,

332
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,450
then she has nothing
to worry about.

333
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,357
You have to let me out !

334
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,670
We got to get out !

335
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,725
We're going to get killed !

336
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,942
Would you stop saying
that already ?

337
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,407
It's not helping.

338
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:41,553
An "a" ?
That's great.

339
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,277
But what's my name
doing on here ?

340
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,506
Well, we're lab partners, right ?

341
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,396
This is our presentation.

342
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:52,830
But i haven't met with you in almost three
weeks. I didn't type a word of this.

343
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:56,528
Well, it's not like you didn't do anything.
You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis.

344
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,243
You stained the slides.

345
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,239
One or two of them, maybe.

346
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:02,869
Look... you were in trouble, right ?

347
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,582
I just figured
that whatever it was,

348
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:08,538
you could probably do without
an "incomplete" in bio.

349
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:15,078
I still don't know if i deserve this,
but thank you.

350
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,329
What can i say ?

351
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,701
I have a soft spot for stray cats.

352
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:21,463
I look that pathetic ?

353
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:26,019
Hardly.

354
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,220
You're shooting up ?

355
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,510
Doesn't exactly fill me
with confidence.

356
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,618
It's a sedative.
If i lose control

357
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,684
and become like everyone
else in this place,

358
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,528
i can't help you anymore.

359
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:46,113
What's happening to my agents ?

360
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,837
I don't feel any different,
but they're all going crazy.

361
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,642
Dr. Hudson ?

362
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:55,165
I feel worse.

363
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,431
You shouldn't be out of bed.

364
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,210
Sweetie, what's that on your arm ?

365
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:16,318
Skouris, N. T. A. C. I need to get past.

366
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,692
Building's locked down.

367
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,507
Well, what's going on ?

368
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,280
Security breach from the inside.

369
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,395
That's all we know.

370
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,309
- I have to get through.
- That's not going to happen.

371
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:25,660
You don't understand.

372
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,832
My daughter's in there.

373
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:33,252
Thursday, July 28
3:19 pm

374
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:49,062
Well, I can't do it myself.

375
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,818
Turn around.

376
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:01,402
Hold still.

377
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:17,386
I can't believe you
broke my nose.

378
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:19,675
Yeah, well, you broke
my knuckle when i hit you.

379
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:22,219
But i'm still right.
The signal is constant.

380
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:25,530
It doesn't matter if you can hear it
or not. It's like a dog whistle.

381
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,698
It's one pulse, and it'll wear off.
We just have to wait it out...

382
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,128
Both of you guys shut up !

383
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:33,807
I'm trying to get work done.

384
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:40,182
Not a good time, Diana.

385
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,680
Marco, what's going on in there ?

386
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:43,253
Depends on who you ask.

387
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,343
Somebody's definitely
set off a whammy in here.

388
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,504
Something's pumping up
our "fight or flight" instincts.

389
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,617
Heavy emphasis
on the "fight" part.

390
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,010
Well, Marco, i need to get inside,
and i need your help.

391
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:55,861
Every male in this building has got a gallon of
adrenaline coursing through his veins right now.

392
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:59,196
And most of them are armed.
If you're on the outside, stay there.

393
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:02,652
Listen to me, Marco. Maia is inside,
and i need to get to her.

394
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,907
Do you have access
to the building schematics ?

395
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:06,938
Uh, yeah.
I can pull them up.

396
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,147
Do it.

397
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,567
And what do i get in return ?

398
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:15,898
Well, we can talk about that later.

399
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,035
Good. Good.
I'm going to hold you to that.

400
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,447
Get off me.
You're in my space !

401
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,014
Hang on.

402
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:21,666
- You're in my space !
- Guys !

403
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,416
Settle it later !

404
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:25,424
We've got to get
Skouris into the building.

405
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:26,657
I said get on your knees.

406
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:29,108
I just need to take these.
They're keeping me calm.

407
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,470
Little late for that.

408
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:34,087
You sure you don't want one ?
They might help.

409
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,337
Cut us loose. Come on.
Cut me free.

410
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:44,418
Get some cuffs.

411
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,445
Put them on commando-boy.
Then you can let everybody else go.

412
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,889
Hey, hey, where are you going ?

413
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:52,529
I'm going to the med labs. Hopefully
the major met some resistance along the way.

414
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,426
What kind of tests ?
You mean like an i. q. Thing ?

415
00:23:57,449 --> 00:24:00,134
I don't know, Richard.
Those flash cards were weird,

416
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:03,140
and after we got back,
i was changing her.

417
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,429
She has these marks on her skin.

418
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:06,956
Marks ? Bruises ?

419
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,859
No. Like irritations.

420
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,489
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

421
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:12,346
Let me see.

422
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:13,427
They faded.

423
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,319
Richard...

424
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,070
don't look at me like that.
I'm not imagining things.

425
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:19,055
She's not going back
to that nursery.

426
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,967
Lily... all you've been talking about
is how much you love ruth

427
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,008
and the nursery, and how much
Isabelle seems to love it there.

428
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,311
I wish you'd been there.

429
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:29,351
I mean, ruth, she had
this weird smile on her face.

430
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,721
Think about what you're saying.
Nobody's doing tests on her at the nursery.

431
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,314
You know, i know you feel
like she's shutting you out, and

432
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,153
no offense, but maybe
this is an overreaction.

433
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,677
- Can i take her for a second ?
- No.

434
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,603
Lily, what are you doing ?

435
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,784
I'm sorry.
It's just this place.

436
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:51,575
I feel like it's changing everything,
like it's changing us.

437
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:56,947
we're okay.
Everything's okay.

438
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:06,399
The meditation courses, the synaptic potential
readers, and our purification seminars...

439
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,075
that's half our curriculum
you're putting on the chopping block.

440
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,871
We don't need them, Matthew.

441
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,456
Jordan seemed to think we did.

442
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,417
Jordan's not here anymore, is he ?

443
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:16,855
Besides, that Burkhoff guy is right...

444
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:20,283
a bunch of chanting is not going to
unlock the 4400 inside of anyone.

445
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,890
Whether it will or it won't,
the product is selling.

446
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:24,381
Wait, wait, wait. "product" ?

447
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,995
This is not a pyramid scheme, Matthew.

448
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,823
People are coming here, they're looking to be
changed. They're looking for answers.

449
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:32,397
And we'll find them,

450
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,780
but if we change, we look weak.

451
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:38,256
For now, all that matters is that
people believe in what we're doing.

452
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,053
I need to believe in it, too.

453
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:00,241
Nobody move !

454
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,400
They're gone.
They all took off.

455
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:04,292
Who are you ?

456
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,866
Roger wolcott.

457
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:07,897
I'm just here for my checkup.

458
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:09,090
The 4400 ?

459
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,711
Why else would i be here ?

460
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,460
Now cut me loose !

461
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,591
Thursday, July 28
4:22 pm

462
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,831
That's not going to hold anybody.
Not for long. Let's hope no one finds us.

463
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,498
What do you think
our chances are ?

464
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,706
The calmer we are,
the longer we stay alive.

465
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:57,344
How are you doing, sweetie ?

466
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:00,817
I feel all sweaty,

467
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,481
and it's getting hard to breathe.

468
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:05,855
Poor baby.

469
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:07,945
I have something for you.

470
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:13,065
- Lemon.
- Yeah.

471
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,316
As soon as this is over, i'm going
to get you to the hospital, okay ?

472
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:18,725
All right.

473
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,763
I'm guessing you don't have
a stuffed animal for me.

474
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,018
Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels ?

475
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:24,867
Sorry.

476
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,462
Looks like it's starting to clot.

477
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:29,833
You need another shot for pain ?

478
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:31,254
No.

479
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:33,893
You need the sedatives
more than i do.

480
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,490
How many shots have you taken ?

481
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:36,617
Three.

482
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:40,022
And you're still on your feet ? Shouldn't that
have knocked you on your ass by now ?

483
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,979
Well, on a normal day, i'd be out
for the next 12 hours, but today,

484
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,105
it's barely enough
to keep me sane.

485
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,866
Well, thank you...

486
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,932
for keeping Maia safe.

487
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,047
She's a sweet kid.

488
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,396
Listen, Diana...

489
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:58,762
look, i've only got
three shots left.

490
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,147
They're wearing off a little
faster each time, so...

491
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:04,987
i don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody. So if i...

492
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,466
start to go...

493
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,343
oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

494
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:09,611
Do me a favor...

495
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,760
back of the head, okay ?

496
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:13,544
You'll never see it coming.

497
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:17,033
Now, listen, Hudson...

498
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,698
look, i just gave you permission
to blow my head off.

499
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,507
Why don't you call me Max ?

500
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:23,491
All right, Max.

501
00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:26,864
About this signal...

502
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:33,040
which one of these bitches
do you think is sending it ?

503
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,778
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.

504
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,962
Hey, you wanted to
know my story.

505
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:48,948
Well, right now, you're living it.

506
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,827
Open your eyes.

507
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:55,982
Now, imagine three years went
by while you had them shut.

508
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,272
Can't do it.

509
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,398
Neither could i...

510
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:02,818
but they were gone.

511
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:07,057
I missed senior year of high school,
which is supposedly the best year ever.

512
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,717
I got robbed. The rest
of high school just sucked.

513
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:15,073
So this blackout that
you had behind the wheel,

514
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:19,106
that was some sort of
after-effect of the coma ?

515
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,961
Yeah.

516
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:21,983
Wow.

517
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,695
God, you've been through so much.

518
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,963
You're jealous ?

519
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:29,239
What part sounds good ?

520
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,784
The coma ?

521
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,921
The hit and run ?

522
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,283
I'm jealous

523
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:38,178
because you have all
this experience under your belt.

524
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:40,996
It makes you interesting.

525
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,598
But i didn't do it.

526
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,581
It wasn't me.

527
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,665
Great, so now someone
can kill me in my sleep.

528
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,284
How do you know it's one of us ?

529
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:58,388
Well, i don't,

530
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,206
but none of you are talking,
and so i'm about out of options.

531
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,437
This isn't going to make
a damn bit of difference.

532
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:07,452
That's it.

533
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,342
No more sedatives.

534
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:11,127
Can you still function as a doctor ?

535
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:12,395
For now.

536
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,107
Kind of busy here, Diana.

537
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,218
We just put the 4400s under, but we're
not sure if that's killed the signal.

538
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,791
Do you still feel amped up ?

539
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:26,351
Yes, i do, okay ?
I'm working on it from my end.

540
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,596
What's that noise ?

541
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:34,397
I'm trying to counter
the effects of the signal.

542
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:37,515
If you'd just shut up for a second,
maybe i could find the right frequency...

543
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:40,190
Okay, calm down, Marco.
I need you to do this.

544
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,503
It always has to be me,
doesn't it ?

545
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:45,196
Old, reliable Marco
does whatever you want.

546
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,400
I truly believe in what
we're trying to do.

547
00:31:57,447 --> 00:32:00,940
The 4400 are the template
for the next stage in human evolution.

548
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:03,417
Do you mind backing up ?
You're standing a little close.

549
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:19,066
We can recreate the technology
they used to change us.

550
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,483
Not by chanting "om"
three times, you can't.

551
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:23,351
Agreed...

552
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:28,893
but if you come to work with us,
we could get somewhere.

553
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:29,786
You know,

554
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:31,629
the government

555
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,398
has approached me
half a dozen times.

556
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,957
They seem to have
this bizarre theory i'm

557
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:40,971
the father of this new branch
of science. I turned them down.

558
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:44,799
I don't like working
with people with badges.

559
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:47,861
Listen, you can't blame
them for being curious.

560
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:51,266
You were in a mental hospital
for... six years ?

561
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,166
The future busted its ass
to get you working again.

562
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:56,031
I haven't forgotten my debts.

563
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:58,544

And besides, the government
cannot offer you what i can.

564
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,082
Oh ? What's that ?

565
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,994
Signing bonus ?
Fancy car ?

566
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:04,930
Me.

567
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,899
I'm the poster boy, right ?

568
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:10,719
Healing hands.

569
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:13,690
Unlimited access.

570
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,440
Can you really turn that down ?

571
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:28,498
Mommy,

572
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:30,600
i'm scared.

573
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,302
I know, baby.

574
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:34,851
I'm scared too.

575
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,812
But it's going to be okay,

576
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,784
because mommy's here.

577
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,698
Okay ?

578
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,391
Whatever's coming
through that door...

579
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,522
i'll protect you.

580
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:05,056
Tom.

581
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:14,774
Tom... put the gun down.
It's me. It's Diana.

582
00:34:14,798 --> 00:34:17,545
No, you'll... you'll shoot me
if i put it down.

583
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,635
No, Tom.
I don't want to hurt you.

584
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:23,449
Well, i want to hurt you, Diana.

585
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:36,116
Tom... i said calm down.

586
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:42,947
My mom always wanted me
to hit it off with a cute doctor,

587
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:45,671
but make another move,
and i will pull this trigger.

588
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,129
What is that ?

589
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:10,173
That'd be Marco
earning his paycheck.

590
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:34,171
I feel like an idiot.

591
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:37,905
It's just... Isabelle and i
were so close for so long.

592
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:39,525
And you still are.

593
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,252
I know.
It's like you say...

594
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:45,082
she's a baby.
It isn't personal.

595
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:46,961
Yeah, you just have
to remember that.

596
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:50,061
Hey, ruth, look who's back.

597
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,447
That was a long lunch.

598
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,584
Yeah, sorry.
Time got away from us.

599
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,204
Come on. Here you are.

600
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,187
we'll be back in an hour for her.

601
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,466
- We'll be here.
- Thank you.

602
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:01,155
Bye, Isabelle.

603
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,977
I'd still like to do
a little house-hunting.

604
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,806
We could take a look around,
see what's out there.

605
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:26,033
You're in charge until i'm released.
Pool whatever manpower is still up walking.

606
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:27,489
Start picking up the pieces.

607
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:28,977
- I'll handle it.
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:31,091
All right. And you get
that head looked at.

609
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,302
How are you doing ?

610
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,601
Well, for a slender lady,
you pack a punch.

611
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:43,285
I can't take all the credit.
Culp softened you up a little bit.

612
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,129
Hmm.

613
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,927
It's the final tally.

614
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:50,692
Three agents dead, two N. S. A.
operatives, a 4400...

615
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:54,964
concussions, broken bones,
stab wounds... yikes.

616
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:58,616
It's tough to swallow. It was
a major attack, and we weren't ready.

617
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,107
Yeah.

618
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:05,952
How are you, baby ?

619
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,927
Okay.

620
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,345
Not so good.

621
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,152
I've got her on glucose
and erythromycin.

622
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,216
We're going to get her over to St. Michael's
and see if we can bring that fever down.

623
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,189
And the rash ?

624
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:18,490
I'm going to bring in a specialist.

625
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:19,664
Should i be worried ?

626
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,722
Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists
in the city. I'm sure he'll figure it out.

627
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:25,706
You're coming with us,

628
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:26,738
right ?

629
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:31,329
Of course. I'll be right there
in the ambulance with you.

630
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:35,497
All right, i'll get to the hospital
as soon as i can.

631
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:36,370
Okay.

632
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,342
- Oh, Max...
- yeah.

633
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,573
Thank you... for everything.

634
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:42,569
No, thank you, for...

635
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:44,929
well, for not putting one
in the back of my head.

636
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:51,308
Uh, so those 4400s
Diana was protecting...

637
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:54,772
they're not going to see daylight until N. T. A. C.'s
sure they're not responsible for this.

638
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,991
That's going to be
a marathon debriefing session.

639
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,150
Yeah, i bet you they'll
both be up all night.

640
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:00,852
Both ?

641
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:03,776
I thought Diana said
there was three of them.

642
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:11,500
Tom ?

643
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:12,581
She's gone.

644
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:17,057
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

645
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:19,253
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

646
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,256
Do they even have
a name for that ?

647
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,945
Yeah, "terrorism."

648
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,689
Payback is a bitch.

649
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,617
Welcome to the center.
Would you like to sign up for the tour ?

650
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:54,155
No.

651
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:59,039
Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin
Burkhoff is here to see him.

652
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:01,906
I'm sorry. Mr. Farrell's
busy at the moment.

653
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:04,055
Is there a message
i can pass along ?

654
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,748
Yes.

655
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,461
I want to get
started immediately.

656
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,146
You can stay over if you like.

657
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:15,363
Get some dinner,

658
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:18,269
do a little studying...

659
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,065
Kyle ?

660
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:30,847
Are you okay ?

661
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:38,468
I don't deserve you.

662
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,621
That is so sweet.

663
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:57,765
I'll be right back.

664
00:39:57,935 --> 00:39:58,631
Okay.

665
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:18,923
Shawn...

666
00:40:19,745 --> 00:40:21,447
this is Olivia Cohen.

667
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,809
Take a seat here.

668
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:23,725
Mm-hmm.

669
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,555
That's good.

670
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:30,634
She lost her eyesight to macular
degeneration 10 years ago.

671
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:33,887
The foundation was
very moved by her story.

672
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:36,559
Hi, Mrs. Cohen.

673
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:37,381
Hello.

674
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,084
It's nice to meet you.
So, uh,

675
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,420
what we're going to do here

676
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,769
is going to feel
a little weird, but

677
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,105
when we're done,

678
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:46,549
you'll be able to see again.

679
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,380
Oh, i can't wait.

680
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:51,128
I have to admit,
i'm a little nervous.

681
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:52,690
You don't have to be.

682
00:40:53,406 --> 00:40:55,238
I'm going to take
your hands now, okay ?

683
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:56,283
Mm-hmm.

684
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,146
Here we go.

685
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:01,612
Here we go.

686
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:35,064
So when does it start ?
