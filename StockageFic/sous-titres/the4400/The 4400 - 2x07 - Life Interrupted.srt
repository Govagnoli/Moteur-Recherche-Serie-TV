1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,470
WE'RE NOT A THREAT.
WE'RE SALVATION.

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,080
THE WORLD
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.

3
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,440
I'M NOT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
ANYMORE.

4
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,470
THEN STOP ACTING
LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

5
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,180
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.
SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,300
IT'S ALL GOOD.

7
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,960
YOU GODDAMN FREAK!

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,270
DANNY,STOP IT!
STOP BLAMING ME FOR NIKKI!

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,030
DIANA SKOURIS,

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,970
YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE
IS HEREBY COMPLETE.

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,930
HE'S GONNA DIE.

12
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,170
I SAW IT. HE'S GONNA DIE.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,670
JORDAN COLLIER?

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,110
SOMEONE'S GOING TO KILL HIM.

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,480
NO!

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
NO!

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
HIS BODY,
IT'S NOT THERE!

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,330
THIS IS
YOUR NEW HOUSE?

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
IT'S YOURS TOO.

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,300
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS MOMENT FOR TOO LONG.

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,390
ONLY ONE THING
MISSING--

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,720
MOM.

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,090
WE REALLY TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,140
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY
OF COLLEGE?

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,390
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,800
NOBODY PAID
MY TUITION.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,720
I'M SORRY,KYLE.
I MUST HAVE FORGOT.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,170
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS.

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,280
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,510
YOU SPENT THREE YEARS
IN A COMA.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,460
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
DRINKING ANYTHING!

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,030
YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT,RIGHT?

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,330
YEAH.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,310
ANY COFFEE LEFT?

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,600
HELP YOURSELF.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,750
COULDN'T FIND A CLEAN T-SHIRT?

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,830
THIS IS WHAT I WEAR
TO SCHOOL.

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,860
I LIKE IT.
YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP.

39
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,120
THANKS.

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,770
SO...

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,890
HOW YOU DOING,DAD?

42
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,500
GOOD.

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,900
FINE. WHY?

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,290
NO REASON.
JUST,UH...

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,060
YOU KNOW,GOOD LUCK.
OKAY?

46
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,410
I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

47
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,360
I'LL CALL YOU.
SEE HOW IT GOES.

48
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,820
OKAY?

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,250
SEE YOU.

50
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,820
HEY,
THERE HE IS!

51
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,860
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,420
WELCOME BACK.

53
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,220
THE PRODIGAL SON
RETURNS.

54
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,110
RETURNS FROM WHERE?

55
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,120
GET YOUR GEAR ON.
WE GOT TO ROLL.

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,030
TOM,I AM SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

57
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,590
YEAH,YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,660
AS SOON AS WE TAKE
DOHERTY DOWN,

59
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,960
WE'RE GOING TO
POP THE CHAMPAGNE.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,950
DOHERTY?
WHO'S DOHERTY?

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,100
DIANA,STOP.
FILL ME IN HERE.

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,860
WHO'S DOHERTY?

63
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,420
DOES HE HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH COLLIER'S MURDER?

64
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,210
WHAT,GOVERNOR COLLIER?

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,890
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE'S NOT DEAD.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,790
THIS WAS
GARRITY'S IDEA,RIGHT?

67
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,570
GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S CREATIVE,

68
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,310
BUT "SCREW WITH
TOM BALDWIN DAY"IS OVER.

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,300
HEY,LISTEN,TOM,
DON'T DO THIS.

70
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,900
THE DOCTORS GAVE YOU
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

71
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,120
DOCTORS?
WHAT DOCTORS?

72
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,470
WHERE IS EVERYBODY HEADED?

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,170
AND WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
AROUND HERE TODAY?

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,680
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST STAY HERE.

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,010
WE'LL TALK
WHEN I GET BACK.

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,900
DIANA,JUST--

77
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,230
SO,THIS GUY,DOHERTY,
IS HE A 4400?

78
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,450
WHAT'S A 4400?

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,040
PLEASE,STOP THIS.

80
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,130
FOUR THOUSAND,FOUR HUNDRED
MISSING PEOPLE...

81
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,680
THE FUTURE SENT THEM BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.

82
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,810
ANY OF THIS
SOUND FAMILIAR?

83
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,300
DIANA,
I'M NOT LAUGHING,

84
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,210
SO WHATEVER GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING,

85
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,500
STOP IT,AND STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,780
TOM,WHATEVER
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

87
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,770
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,950
I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE IT,

89
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,580
AND EVERYONE HERE IS PULLING
FOR YOUR RECOVERY,

90
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,420
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

91
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,870
YOU SOUND DELUSIONAL.

92
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,640
THE FUTURE?

93
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,310
I MEAN,I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THE 4400,

94
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,110
AND I CAN PROMISE YOU

95
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,460
THAT NOBODY EVER CAME BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,870
TELL ME ONE THING.

97
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,290
ACCORDING TO YOU,

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,170
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING
FOR THE LAST YEAR?

99
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,410
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

100
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,080
HUMOR ME.

101
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,450
IT'S YOUR CASE,
TOM.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,930
DIRTY BOMBS,
REMEMBER?

103
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,850
YOU WENT UNDERCOVER

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,850
AND INFILTRATED
AN AUM SHINRIKYO TERROR CELL.

105
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,510
NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING
TO YOU,DOES IT?

106
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,500
OF COURSE NOT.
WHY SHOULD IT?

107
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,190
WELL,YOUR COVER
WAS COMPROMISED.

108
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,960
THEY HELD YOU
FOR THREE WEEKS.

109
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,570
SLEEP DEPRIVATION,
TORTURE--

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,980
THEY'D HAVE KILLED YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T ESCAPE.

111
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,980
SO HOW DOES DOHERTY
FIT IN?

112
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,250
AUM SHINRIKYO'S BEEN PLANNING
AN ATTACK ON THE U.S.

113
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,930
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN SNEAKING
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,890
INTO THE COUNTRY
IN MUSEUM POUCHES.

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
DOHERTY'S THE CURATOR.

116
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,440
HE'S BEEN IN BED WITH THEM
ALL ALONG.

117
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,570
TOM,HE SOLD YOU OUT.

118
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,660
YOU SPENT THREE WEEKS IN HELL
'CAUSE OF THIS GUY.

119
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,770
YOU'VE BEEN
ON MEDICAL LEAVE

120
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,020
FOR TWO MONTHS,
RECOVERING,AND...

121
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,450
OBVIOUSLY,
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE.

122
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,470
JORDAN COLLIER
MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART.

123
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,090
TELL ME YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,970
I RECOGNIZE IT,ALL RIGHT...

125
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,970
WELL,THAT'S A START.

126
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,950
BUT EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

127
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,570
THIS IS THE SPOT.

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,510
THIS IS WHERE COLLIER GOT SHOT.

129
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,360
DO ME A FAVOR.

130
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,260
DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

131
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,320
TOM?

132
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,410
TOM!

133
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,710
IS HE IN THERE?

134
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,570
YEAH,I THINK SO.

135
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,230
YOU WANT TO DO
THE HONORS?

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,950
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING?

137
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,190
SOMEBODY'S BEEN MESSING
WITH MY COMPUTER.

138
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,370
ALL MY CASE FILES ARE GONE.

139
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,430
I TYPE "4400"
INTO A SEARCH ENGINE,AND...

140
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,320
NOTHING.

141
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,130
HOW COULD THERE NOT BE
A SINGLE MENTION OF THEM?

142
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,920
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE...

143
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED?

144
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,000
SOMETHING HAS OBVIOUSLY
CHANGED.

145
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,850
THIS IS NOT THE SAME WORLD
THAT IT WAS YESTERDAY.

146
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,290
BUT I'M STILL TOM BALDWIN,

147
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,790
AND YOU'RE STILL DIANA SKOURIS,

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,930
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE
THEY TOOK,

149
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,580
THEY EXIST TOO,RIGHT?

150
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,900
GARY NAVARRO.

151
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,970
WE WORKED WITH HIM LAST MONTH.

152
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,700
HE COULD READ THOUGHTS.

153
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,690
READ THOUGHTS?

154
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,640
TOM,COME ON.

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
PLAYED FOR CINCINNATI?

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,230
LIFETIME .317 BATTING AVERAGE.

157
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,050
ISN'T IT .300

158
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,580
WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PITCHER'S THINKING?

159
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,660
BUT...HE WAS NEVER TAKEN!

160
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,300
RICHARD TYLER.

161
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,630
WHAT DID HE HAVE?
HEAT VISION?

162
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,300
NO,SOME OF THEM
CAN DO...THINGS.

163
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,970
SOME OF THEM...
SOME OF THEM CAN'T.

164
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,520
HE'S DEAD.

165
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,040
HE'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN
OVER SINANJU IN 1951.

166
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,330
SO THAT'S TWO DOWN.

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,740
ARE WE GOING TO GO THROUGH
ALL 4,398 MORE?

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,830
I'LL TAKE MY BOOTS OFF
IF WE ARE.

169
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,090
DIANA,YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOUR DAUGHTER!

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,550
YOUR DAUGHTER,MAIA RUTLEDGE.

171
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,650
YOU ADOPTED HER,
RIGHT?

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,320
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

173
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,000
TOM,DON'T INCLUDE ME
IN YOUR FANTASY LIFE.

174
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,650
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER.

175
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,280
YES! RIGHT HERE.

176
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,130
IT'S A SEATTLE ADDRESS
FOR MAIA RUTLEDGE.

177
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,160
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

178
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,860
RIGHT HERE.

179
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,910
OH,THANK GOD.
MAIA,IT'S ME.

180
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,380
IT'S ME,TOM.
TOM BALDWIN.

181
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,870
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

182
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,630
DON'T SAY THAT,PLEASE.

183
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,380
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- MY NAME IS ELLA.

184
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,640
MAIA'S MY GRANDMOTHER.

185
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,230
ELLA,WHO IS IT?

186
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,670
OH,HERE SHE IS.

187
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,690
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER.

188
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,810
YOU'RE MAIA RUTLEDGE?

189
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,800
CAN I HELP YOU?

190
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,970
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU HOME
SO SOON.

191
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,550
HOW'D YOU DO OUT THERE
TODAY?

192
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,560
GLAD TO SEE YOU,TOO.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

193
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,050
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

194
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,610
YOU WERE IN A COMA
FOR THREE YEARS,RIGHT?

195
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,910
IF I HAVE ONE MORE OF THESE,

196
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,030
I COULD WIND UP IN A COMA
RIGHT NOW.

197
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,310
COME ON.

198
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,160
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

199
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,220
COME ON.

200
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,460
UNCLE TOMMY.
WE CAN EAT,FINALLY.

201
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,160
HOW YOU DOING?

202
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,640
SHAWN,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

203
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,030
WELL,THE BAND
GOT DELAYED IN BERLIN.

204
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,660
WE'RE NOT GOING TO START
RECORDING UNTIL TUESDAY.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,630
BESIDES,I COULDN'T MISS
YOUR BIG DAY.

206
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,670
OR DANNY'S.
COME ON,TELL THEM.

207
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,410
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SHE ACTUALLY SAID "YES."

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,070
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

209
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,840
LOOK,HE BOUGHT ME THIS!

210
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,390
OH,I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT ONE

211
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,900
TILL HE WAS
OUT OF LAW SCHOOL.

212
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,460
I LIKE THAT.
YOU LIKE THAT?

213
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,040
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,MR. BALDWIN?

214
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,360
DAD,DO YOU
NEED TO SIT?

215
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,960
IT CAN'T BE A JOKE.

216
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,480
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN ON IT.

217
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,350
SIT DOWN.

218
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,970
SO THEN EITHER
I'M CRACKING UP,

219
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,020
OR THE WORLD IS.

220
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,970
DAD,THE DOCTORS SAID
YOU WERE OKAY.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,350
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU,
BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG.

222
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,430
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,450
I MEAN,
I SORT OF DO,

224
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,770
BUT EVERYTHING'S
BEEN TWEAKED.

225
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,300
DAD,DAD,
LOOK AT ME.

226
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,410
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

227
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,090
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

228
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,120
YOU GUYS STARTED
WITHOUT US?

229
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,580
JUST AS WELL.
AIRPORT TRAFFIC WAS INSANE.

230
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,580
HI,GUYS,NIKKI.

231
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,170
CAN YOU BELIEVE MY KID,
MY YOUNGEST KID,

232
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,940
IS GETTING MARRIED?

233
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,990
WHEN THE HELL
DID WE GET SO OLD?

234
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,440
SO YOU'RE BACK IN THE SADDLE.

235
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,360
HOW'D IT GO?

236
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,730
I DON'T THINK IT WENT TOO GOOD.

237
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,520
REALLY? I WAS JUST
TELLING YOUR WIFE

238
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,440
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE FINE.

239
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,710
MY WIFE?

240
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,720
I'M STILL MARRIED TO LINDA?

241
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,900
I SAID WIFE,
NOT EX-WIFE.

242
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,570
ALANA,OVER HERE.
COME HERE.

243
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,830
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS WOMAN
BEFORE.

244
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,110
I THINK WE NEED TO BE ALONE...

245
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,660
GO UPSTAIRS. TALK.

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,290
NO. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

247
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,650
DAD,ALANA'S
YOUR WIFE.

248
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,990
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED TO HER
FOR TWO YEARS.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,130
SHE LIVES HERE,DAD.

250
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,950
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT,BUT IT'S OVER.

251
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,250
IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

252
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,870
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

253
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,530
GUYS DOWNSTAIRS CALLED.

254
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,000
THEY SAID YOU'VE BEEN
HERE FOUR HOURS.

255
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,630
YEAH.
SAD,ISN'T IT?

256
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,620
THE ONLY PLACE
I FEEL NORMAL

257
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,780
IS HIDING
IN A STORAGE CLOSET.

258
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,920
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT MUST
FEEL LIKE TO BE INSANE--

259
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,650
YOU'RE NOT INSANE,TOM.

260
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,740
YOU JUST NEED A REST.

261
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,490
EVERYONE KEEPS TELLING ME
I WAS TORTURED.

262
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,500
MAYBE THEY BROKE MY MIND.

263
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,390
YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK
FROM THIS,TOM.

264
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,020
IT'S JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME.

265
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,540
AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU,
I PROMISE.

266
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,560
SO TELL ME AGAIN
ABOUT THIS BALL OF LIGHT.

267
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,490
WHEN DID YOU FIRST COME
TO BELIEVE IT HAPPENED?

268
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,500
AUGUST 14th,2004.

269
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,320
THAT'S WHEN THEY CAME BACK.

270
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,910
MAYBE NOT IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW,
BUT IT HAPPENED IN MINE--

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
GET HER OUT OF HERE!

272
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
NO ONE'S PLOTTING AGAINST YOU,
TOM.

273
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,390
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO GET YOU BETTER.

274
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,240
HIS WIFE'S HERE.

275
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,410
SHE'S ASKING TO SEE HIM.

276
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,970
I AM NOT MARRIED.
I AM NOT MARRIED...

277
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,810
LOOK,LADY,I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

278
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,950
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

279
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,130
YOU HAVE TO
PLAY ALONG.

280
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,350
I NEED YOU TO
GET OUT OF HERE

281
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,050
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

282
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,860
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

283
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,450
NONE OF THIS IS REAL
TO ME,EITHER.

284
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,570
I KNOW WE'RE
NOT MARRIED.

285
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,770
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
BEFORE YESTERDAY.

286
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,830
THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT--

287
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,230
THE BALL OF LIGHT,

288
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,720
THE 4400...

289
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,010
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 4400?

290
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,760
KNOW OF THEM?

291
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,040
I AM A 4400.

292
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,910
OW MY BEHAVIOR
WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE,

293
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,210
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

294
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,830
I GOT FIXATED
ON GETTING BACK TO WORK,

295
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,200
AND OBVIOUSLY,
THE STRAIN,THE,UH...

296
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,000
THE EXCITEMENT,
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

297
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,790
WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND
YOUR MEDICAL LEAVE

298
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,240
BY ANOTHER
SIX WEEKS,

299
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,490
AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT
GETTING YOU BACK OUT IN THE FIELD.

300
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
I'LL CIRCLE THE DATE.

301
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,790
OKAY.

302
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,760
SO I CAN GO NOW?

303
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,900
YOUR PSYCH HOLD IS OVER.

304
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,020
GREAT.

305
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,840
I'M...
I'M SORRY FOR THE AMBUSH.

306
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,820
DESPERATE TIMES,
DESPERATE MEASURES.

307
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,060
I'LL SEE YOU
IN SIX WEEKS.

308
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,600
TOM BALDWIN.

309
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,500
ALANA MAREVA.

310
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,180
SO I GUESS WE'RE MARRIED.

311
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,330
SO I'M TOLD.

312
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,350
LET'S GO HOME.

313
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,110
SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

314
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,640
-WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

315
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,860
MAYBE WE CROSSED INTO
SOME KIND OF...

316
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,870
ALTERNATE REALITY,
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

317
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,680
I KNOW.
IT SOUNDS INSANE.

318
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.

319
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,820
IMPOSSIBLE
ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE,AND...

320
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,410
YOU'RE A 4400.

321
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,880
YOU THINK I'M DOING THIS?

322
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,020
IT'S AN EXPLANATION.

323
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,140
A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE,ACTUALLY.

324
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,250
SIMPLE,BUT WRONG.

325
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,910
IF I WERE MAKING THIS UP,

326
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,930
WHY WOULD I PUT MYSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE?

327
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,380
I'M SORRY.THIS CAN'T
BE EASY FOR YOU,EITHER.

328
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,250
YEAH,EASY.

329
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,600
MY FRIENDS,MY FAMILY,
EVERYTHING I KNOW IS GONE.

330
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,520
ERASED.

331
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,190
I'M TRAPPED
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE.

332
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,900
HOW DO I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU
MAKING THIS UP?

333
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,330
ERASED?

334
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,550
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN ERASED?

335
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
I USED TO OWN
THIS PLACE.

336
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,730
I BOUGHT IT
FOUR YEARS AGO,

337
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,850
A FEW MONTHS
BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.

338
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,750
AND NONE OF THIS
LOOKS FAMILIAR NOW?

339
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,770
I WAS MY OWN BUYER.

340
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,810
I FLEW ALL OVER THE WORLD

341
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,790
AND BOUGHT
MOSTLY SCULPTURES,

342
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,850
PRIMITIVE ART.

343
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,080
EXCUSE ME.

344
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,800
CAN I TALK TO THE OWNER?

345
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,770
HE'S NOT HERE TODAY.

346
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,070
ANY IDEA
WHEN HE OPENED THIS PLACE?

347
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,240
A LONG TIME AGO.

348
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,100
15,MAYBE 20 YEARS.

349
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,410
IT ONLY GETS WORSE.

350
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,490
YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S THE RIGHT BENCH?

351
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,440
I USED TO COME HERE
EVERY WEEK.

352
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,100
BELIEVE ME,I KNOW WHICH BENCH
I DEDICATED

353
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,430
TO MY HUSBAND AND SON.

354
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,020
SO BACK IN THE WORLD
WE CAME FROM...

355
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,840
THEY DIED...

356
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
IN A CAR ACCIDENT...

357
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,170
SHORTLY BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.

358
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,280
THERE'S A WAY BACK HOME.

359
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,150
WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT.

360
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,540
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

361
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,490
WHAT,YOU'RE SLEEPING
IN THE GUEST ROOM?

362
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,810
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
YEAH.

363
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,630
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

364
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,380
WE HAVE TO PLAY ALONG.

365
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,290
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAPPILY MARRIED.

366
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,580
WE DON'T WANT YOUR SON
ASKING QUESTIONS.

367
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,020
OKAY,I'LL,UH,FIND A SPOT
ON THE FLOOR.

368
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,400
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T BE
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE BATHTUB?

369
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,340
I'M KIDDING,THOMAS.

370
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,830
IT'S A BIG BED.

371
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,220
I'M SURE WE CAN KEEP
IN OUR OWN SECTORS.

372
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,690
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES?

373
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,900
ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE
LIKE US,

374
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,520
WONDERING HOW
THEY GOT HERE?

375
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,050
IF THERE ARE,WE'LL FIND THEM.

376
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,170
WE'LL TAKE OUT
CLASSIFIED ADS

377
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,420
IN EVERY MAJOR
CITY PAPER.

378
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,010
"REMEMBER THE 4400s?
DROP US A LINE."

379
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,430
WE'LL CHECK OUT EVERY RETURNEE
WE CAN FIND.

380
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,020
TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

381
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,980
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

382
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,970
FAVORITE RECORDS?

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,480
WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL?

384
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,670
HOW ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND AND SON?
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

385
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,600
PAUL WAS A RADIOLOGIST.

386
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,690
WE MET WHILE HE WAS ON VACATION
IN TAHITI.

387
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,330
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM.

388
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,460
LINDA AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING THERE FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

389
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,990
WE PICKED HAITI INSTEAD.

390
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,400
TWO YEARS LATER,

391
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,770
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED,
WE HAD BILLY.

392
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,340
HE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET.

393
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,620
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

394
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,150
I THINK THIS WAS
THE INTERVIEW

395
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,670
WHERE I SAID I WANTED
TO GO INTO MEDICINE

396
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,220
BECAUSE NURSES
ARE SEXY.

397
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,830
YOU DID NOT
SAY THAT.

398
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,700
I GOT INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL!

399
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,880
STANFORD,BABY!

400
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,850
CONGRATULATIONS.

401
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,870
THE REAL KYLE USED TO TALK
ABOUT BEING A DOCTOR ALL THE TIME.

402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,020
RIGHT UP
UNTIL HE WENT INTO A COMA.

403
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,020
"THE REAL KYLE..."

404
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,630
I KNOW
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR SON,

405
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,730
BUT HE SEEMS PRETTY REAL TO ME.

406
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,220
HE GETS HAPPY
WHEN HE HEARS GOOD NEWS,

407
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,420
CRANKY WHEN HE GETS TIRED,

408
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,420
AND HE FORGETS TO PUT
THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.

409
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,560
HE'S A GOOD KID.

410
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,420
HE WAS RAISED WELL.

411
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,270
I GOT A RESPONSE
FROM OUR AD IN THE POST.

412
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,330
PHILIP KENDRICK.

413
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,590
HE WANTS TO MEET US.

414
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,850
PHILIP KENDRICK?

415
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,010
TOM BALDWIN.

416
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,140
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THE 4400?

417
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,300
IT WAS THE BEST SEDAN
CITROEN EVER PUT OUT.

418
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,650
HYDRAULICS CAME STANDARD
ON EVERY MODEL--

419
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,850
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CAR?

420
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,500
YEAH!
MINE'S PARKED OUTSIDE.

421
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,520
WHERE'S YOURS?

422
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,220
IT'S IN THE SHOP.
I'LL SEND YOU A PICTURE.

423
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,990
UH,TOM,
I DON'T HAVE YOUR ADDRESS.

424
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,850
WELL,THAT WAS
PRODUCTIVE.

425
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,870
YEAH...

426
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,840
SHOULD WE CHECK OUT
THE BLAKE EXHIBIT

427
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,160
WHILE WE'RE HERE?

428
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,320
UH...YEAH,
WHY DON'T YOU...

429
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,900
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD?

430
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,460
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.

431
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,190
NO,IT'S...

432
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,200
THOMAS...

433
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,640
THOMAS...

434
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,130
THOMAS?

435
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,050
THOMAS!

436
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,770
IT'S GONE.

437
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,400
WHAT'S GONE?

438
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,750
THAT DOOR. IT WAS BACK.

439
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,720
AND I OPENED IT THIS TIME.

440
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,550
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
OPERATING ROOM,I THINK.

441
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,690
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

442
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,110
YOU WERE JUST STANDING
THERE LIKE A STATUE.

443
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,320
THAT ROOM'S THE ANSWER.

444
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,720
IT HAS TO BE.

445
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,020
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DOESN'T FIT.

446
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,580
IT'S NOT PART
OF THIS REALITY.

447
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,950
IF IT EVEN EXISTS.

448
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,150
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE IT--

449
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,920
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.

450
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,340
HEY,PARTNER.

451
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,940
BLACK,TWO SUGARS.

452
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,080
SO THE GUARDS TELL ME

453
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,170
THAT YOU SPENT...

454
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,670
FIVE HOURS HERE YESTERDAY,

455
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,250
THREE THE DAY BEFORE THAT,

456
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,420
AND,ONE SATURDAY,
YOU LOGGED UP 12.

457
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,920
YEAH,SO I LIKE ART.

458
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,820
IT'S A NICE,
FUNCTIONAL DOOR,TOM,

459
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,920
BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT
A WORK OF ART.

460
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,710
NOW,MAYBE IF IT WERE MADE
OF BLACK OBSIDIAN...

461
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,380
I READ YOUR PSYCH FILE.

462
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,170
YOU PLANNING ON HAVING ME
LOCKED UP AGAIN,DIANA?

463
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,670
YOU KNOW,THIS OTHER REALITY

464
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,410
THAT YOU'RE ANXIOUS
TO GET BACK TO?

465
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,220
I MEAN,EVEN IF YOU COULD
GET BACK TO IT,

466
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,070
IT DOESN'T SOUND
THAT GREAT,TOM.

467
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,600
BACK THERE,
YOU WERE DIVORCED.

468
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,380
HERE,YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

469
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,640
BACK THERE,
YOU SON,KYLE,

470
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,860
SPENT FOUR YEARS
IN A COMA.

471
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,480
HERE,HE'S ABOUT TO SPEND
FOUR IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

472
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,960
BACK THERE,YOUR SISTER'S FAMILY
IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL,

473
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,770
YOUR NEPHEW IS IN A CULT,

474
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,860
AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD
IS IN JEOPARDY.

475
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,370
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO...BLEAK.

476
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,840
IT'S JUST A...

477
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,020
JUST LIFE.

478
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,340
THIS IS LIFE,

479
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,470
AND IT'S A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU
AND FOR EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT.

480
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,140
JUST ACCEPT
WHAT YOU HAVE.

481
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,370
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

482
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,860
WELL,YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

483
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,400
JUST SITTING IN THIS HALLWAY.

484
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,830
ALANA?

485
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,720
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

486
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,440
HAVE YOU SEEN
THESE PICTURES?

487
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,350
LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS
WE'VE DONE TOGETHER.

488
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,880
YOU KNOW,YOU'D THINK
IF WE'RE TRAPPED HERE,

489
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,910
THEY WOULD GIVE US
THESE MEMORIES.

490
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,060
YOU KNOW?

491
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,380
LOOK,WE'VE BEEN
TO CHINA.

492
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,450
I'VE WANTED TO GO
MY ENTIRE LIFE TO CHINA.

493
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,750
LOOK,ALANA,I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE

494
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,590
FOR US TO GET OUT OF HERE.

495
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,340
I DON'T KNOW.

496
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,710
WHO SAYS WE WILL?

497
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,130
YOU KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THAT DOOR.

498
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,580
IT'S BEEN A MONTH ALREADY.

499
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,810
WHAT IF
IT NEVER COMES BACK?

500
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,160
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED,OKAY,
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED.

501
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,590
I DON'T...

502
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,940
BUT IF WE ARE,
ALANA,

503
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,370
I PROMISE YOU,
WE WILL MAKE NEW MEMORIES.

504
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,190
JUST AS GOOD AS THESE.

505
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,530
BETTER.

506
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,300
OH,I BELIEVE WE COULD,THOMAS.

507
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,270
I LIKE IT
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.

508
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,730
"THOMAS."

509
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,970
AND THIS GOES UP,AND THEN...

510
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,870
UGH,I CAN NEVER GET
THESE THINGS RIGHT.

511
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
LET ME TAKE A SHOT.

512
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,680
COME HERE. HOLD STILL.

513
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,630
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
TO MAKE BIG LOOPS.

514
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,700
LEAVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE ROOM TO WORK WITH.

515
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,640
HANDS
OF A SURGEON.

516
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,060
HANDS OF A RESIDENT,
MORE LIKE.

517
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,570
NO,YOU'LL GET THERE.

518
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,320
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
OVER AT ST. BEDE'S?

519
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,260
THE HOURS ARE KILLER.

520
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,650
DOCTORS TREAT ME LIKE
A GLORIFIED CANDYSTRIPER.

521
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,270
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
IS A DISTANT MEMORY.

522
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,880
I LOVE IT.

523
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,990
WELL,I LOOK
LIKE I BELONG

524
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,200
ON TOP
OF A WEDDING CAKE.

525
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,690
HEY,YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF.

526
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,290
SOME PEOPLE GO TO FIJI
FOR THEIR 10th ANNIVERSARY.

527
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,960
YOU TWO WANTED
TO RENEW YOUR VOWS.

528
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,940
YEAH,WELL,
THE FIRST TIME

529
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,510
JUST FELT LIKE
PICTURES IN A BOOK.

530
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,440
THIS ONE...

531
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,700
THIS ONE IS FOR ME AND ALANA.

532
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,490
READY TO GO,CHAMP?

533
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,900
AND DO YOU,
ALANA BALDWIN,

534
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,300
ALSO RENEW YOUR
COMMITMENTS TO HONOR,OBEY,

535
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,920
AND LOVE
YOUR HUSBAND,THOMAS,

536
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,860
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

537
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,630
I DO.

538
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,230
THEN BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME,

539
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,670
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
STILL MAN AND WIFE.

540
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,810
GO AHEAD.YOU MAY KISS
YOUR BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.

541
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,060
I'M GETTING IN HERE.

542
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,450
OH,I LOVE YOU GUYS.

543
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:47,330
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MRS. BALDWIN?

544
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,710
MARRIED. FINALLY.

545
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,930
FEELS REAL NOW,HUH?

546
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,900
WELL,IT FELT REAL
FOR A LONG TIME.

547
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,560
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WE RESISTED IT.

548
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,040
DO YOU MISS IT?
YOUR OLD LIFE?

549
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,240
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT,

550
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,510
BUT AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS,

551
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,760
THAT LIFE,THAT WORLD--

552
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,860
THAT FEELS
LIKE THE DELUSION.

553
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,210
I KNOW.
I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE

554
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,460
TO EVEN REMEMBER
A LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

555
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,980
SEE,I'M GOOD THAT WAY.

556
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,180
LIKE A CELLPHONE
OR TIVO.

557
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:23,990
ONCE YOU'VE GOT ME,

558
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,480
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
NOT HAVING ME.

559
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,150
I LOVE YOU,THOMAS.

560
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,140
IT STILL KILLS ME
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.

561
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,170
COME HERE,WOMAN.

562
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,320
YOU'RE RESIGNING?

563
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,390
I'M MOVING ON,TOM.

564
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,520
I'VE BEEN HERE
11 YEARS.

565
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,480
THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECKONS.

566
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,800
DENNIS RYLAND
OFFERED ME

567
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,460
A PARTNERSHIP
IN HIS CONSULTING FIRM.

568
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,940
NICE GIG.

569
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,370
SO YOU'RE MOVING TO VIRGINIA?

570
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,750
THREE WEEKS.

571
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,700
LOOK,D.C. HAS ASKED ME
TO SUBMIT A LIST OF NAMES

572
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,310
AS POTENTIAL REPLACEMENTS.

573
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,390
I'M GIVING THEM ONE.

574
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,860
YOURS.

575
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,170
WELL,I'M-- I'M FLATTERED.
I,UH...

576
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,480
BUT YOU MIGHT NEED
A BACKUP OR TWO.

577
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,890
I MEAN,
SOMEWHERE IN MY PERSONNEL FILE

578
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,950
ARE MEASUREMENTS
FOR MY STRAITJACKET.

579
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,070
NAH,YOU WERE
CONVALESCING

580
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,830
FROM INJURIES
RECEIVED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

581
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,450
YOUR SERVICE IN THAT CASE
WAS HEROIC.

582
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,930
I THINK YOU CAN TALK YOUR
WAY AROUND THE FALLOUT.

583
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,140
THAT IS,IF YOU WANT THE JOB.

584
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,090
A CHANCE TO SIT
IN THE BIG CHAIR?

585
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,470
I WANT IT,ALL RIGHT.

586
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,090
GOOD.

587
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,110
THEN PRACTICE SAYING,
"NICE TO MEET YOU TOO,SENATOR."

588
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,140
BEST WAY TO PREP FOR
YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARING.

589
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,440
I'LL SPRING
FOR A NEW SUIT.

590
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,220
MY LAST ACT
AS HEAD OF THIS DIVISION

591
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,050
WILL BE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS HAPPENS.

592
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,330
CONGRATULATIONS,TOM.

593
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,730
YOU'VE EARNED THIS.

594
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,370
THANK YOU.

595
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,050
GUESS WHAT.

596
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,490
DON'T TELL ME.

597
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,820
YOU JUST SPOKE TO JARVIS.

598
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,620
YOU KNEW?

599
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,340
SHE MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED SOMETHING.

600
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,800
AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME?

601
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
I'M TRANSFERRING YOU
TO GREENLAND.

602
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,220
OH,LOOK,
HE'S NOT EVEN CONFIRMED YET,

603
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,240
AND HE'S MAD WITH POWER.

604
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,430
BALDWIN.

605
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,200
HEY,YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

606
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,160
THEY'VE JUST ASKED ME
TO JOIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

607
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,690
AT THE COLLIER MUSEUM.

608
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,360
WOW. THAT'S...QUITE AN HONOR.

609
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,110
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE IT?

610
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,270
THE BEST MUSEUM
ON THE WEST COAST.

611
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,440
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT.

612
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,340
THERE'S A BENEFIT

613
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,530
AT THE SEATTLE INNER CITY
ARTS COUNCIL ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

614
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,100
THEY WANT
TO INTRODUCE ME AROUND.

615
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,960
I DIDN'T PUT MY TUX
BACK INTO STORAGE.

616
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,970
SO IT,UM...

617
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,010
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE AT THE OFFICE TODAY.

618
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,270
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

619
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,940
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

620
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,900
JUST TELL ME,THOMAS.

621
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,570
HONEY,I'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME TONIGHT.

622
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,710
GLENDON RITTER,

623
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,480
C.E.O.
OF STRADWICK PHARMACEUTICALS.

624
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,470
ISN'T HE PRESIDENT
OF THE ARTS COUNCIL?

625
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,090
WELL,YOU SHOULD GO
SAY HELLO.

626
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,730
YOU COME WITH.

627
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,660
NO,NO,YOU...
YOU GO.

628
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,770
I'M ALL OUT
OF SMALL TALK.

629
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,300
GO AHEAD.

630
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,740
MR. RITTER.

631
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,900
SO HAPPY
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

632
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,400
THOMAS?

633
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,650
DO YOU SEE IT?

634
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,750
NO.

635
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,200
WHY? YOU DO?

636
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,930
IT'S BEEN GONE
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

637
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,500
WHY NOW?

638
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,090
COME BACK DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME.

639
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,570
THAT'S THE WAY OUT. IT...

640
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,670
IT HAS TO BE.

641
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,670
AND IF IT IS...

642
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,340
AND YOU WALK THROUGH IT...

643
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,350
WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL OF THIS?

644
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,480
TO US?

645
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,560
I DON'T KNOW.

646
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,090
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT.

647
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,590
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON
NEXT MONTH,

648
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,950
AND I WANT TO WATCH YOU
GET PROMOTED.

649
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,900
I WANT TO SEE WHO KYLE MARRIES.

650
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,180
SO DO I...

651
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,860
BUT THIS DOOR,IT'S...

652
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,570
IT'S BACK FOR A REASON.

653
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,490
IT'S LIKE
IT WANTS ME TO WALK THROUGH IT.

654
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,560
BUT DO YOU WANT
TO WALK THROUGH IT?

655
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,620
I DON'T WANT YOU TO,EITHER.

656
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,070
COME ON,THOMAS.

657
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,130
LET'S GO HOME.

658
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,700
KYLE!

659
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,120
NO,KYLE'S MY SON!

660
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,720
LEAVE ME ALONE! HE'S MY SON!

661
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,600
KYLE!

662
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
STOP.
LET GO OF ME!

663
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,100
WHAT...

664
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,350
CONGRATULATIONS.

665
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,600
YOU MADE IT.

666
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,330
WHERE ARE WE?

667
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,590
I THINK YOU KNOW.

668
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,180
THIS IS WHERE
THEY BROUGHT YOU...

669
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,710
AND THE REST OF THE 4400.

670
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,740
YES,THIS IS WHERE
THEY ALTERED US--

671
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,770
GAVE ME THE ABILITY

672
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,490
TO CREATE THE WORLD
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN

673
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,110
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

674
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,440
SO IT IS YOU.

675
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,170
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.

676
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,460
WE'VE BEEN LIVING
IN MY MIND,

677
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,910
BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR YOUR REALITY

678
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,380
CAME FROM THEM.

679
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,930
THEY CREATED
A SANCTUARY FOR YOU,

680
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,680
AN EASIER,
LESS COMPLICATED WORLD.

681
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,270
BUT NONE OF IT'S REAL.

682
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,970
YOU ARE.

683
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,450
I AM.

684
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,070
THE FEELINGS
WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER ARE

685
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,660
AS REAL AS ANYTHING
WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

686
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,060
IS THAT WHY THEY DID THIS?

687
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,720
KEPT US HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS?

688
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,770
BECAUSE THEY WANTED US
TO FALL IN LOVE?

689
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,890
MOMENTS.

690
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,040
THAT'S ALL THAT'S PASSED,

691
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,310
BUT IN THOSE
FEW SECONDS,

692
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,110
WE'VE ACCUMULATED
YEARS OF MEMORIES

693
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,900
THAT WILL BOND US
IN THE REAL WORLD.

694
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,150
I THOUGHT THEY WERE WORRIED
ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD,

695
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,070
NOT PLAYING MATCHMAKER.

696
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,840
THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

697
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,830
YOUR LIFE
IS ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO CRISIS.

698
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,210
YOUR MISSION
WILL BE THREATENED.

699
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,650
THEY CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

700
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,080
THEY GAVE YOU THIS RELATIONSHIP
AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH,

701
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,030
TO SUSTAIN YOU

702
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,250
IN THE TRIALS
THAT LAY AHEAD.

703
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
WHAT CRISIS? WHAT--

704
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,250
WHAT IS IT?

705
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,060
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?

706
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,440
I CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.

707
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,620
IT'S ALREADY BEGUN...

708
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,230
BUT NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO
FACE IT ALONE.

709
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,060
NO,IF IT'S STARTED,
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.

710
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,350
ONLY YOUR WIFE
CAN GET YOU HOME.

711
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,400
YOU ARE MY WIFE.

712
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,200
NO.

713
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,130
I'M PART OF THE PROGRAM
THEY PLACED IN HER MIND.

714
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,800
SHE HAS NO IDEA
SHE'S CREATING THIS.

715
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,540
IF SHE DID,

716
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,300
IT WOULD INTERFERE
WITH THE BONDING.

717
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,760
SO,WHAT,I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST FILL HER IN

718
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,900
AND TELL HER WHAT?

719
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,550
WHETHER SHE KNOWS IT OR NOT,

720
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,660
SHE'S WILLING THIS WORLD
INTO EXISTENCE.

721
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,600
SHE CAN WILL IT
OUT OF EXISTENCE.

722
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,440
YEAH,AND WHAT IF
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO?

723
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,420
YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE HER.

724
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,190
THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TEST
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

725
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,440
THEY'VE CREATED A DAMN NEAR
PERFECT WORLD FOR ME.

726
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,050
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE?

727
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,070
THEN THE FUTURE
PICKED THE WRONG MAN.

728
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,600
WHAT ABOUT KYLE?

729
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,590
HE SPENT NINE YEARS
BECOMING A DOCTOR.

730
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,940
WHAT,AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET RID OF HIM?

731
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,990
WISH HIM AWAY?

732
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,930
IT'S NOT REALLY KYLE.

733
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,140
DON'T SAY THAT!

734
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,010
IF IT'S NOT KYLE,

735
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,510
WHO'S MOVING AROUND
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE KITCHEN?

736
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,080
KYLE. SHAWN. DANNY.

737
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,710
NONE OF THEM ARE REAL.
THEY'RE JUST PROJECTIONS.

738
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,660
YOU'VE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

739
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,280
THEY'RE AS REAL TO YOU
AS THEY ARE TO ME.

740
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,970
I LOVE MY FAMILY.

741
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,560
I REALLY DO LOVE THEM.

742
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,390
IT'S NOT THAT I WANT TO DO THIS.

743
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,720
IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT.

744
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,320
BUT THEY'RE MY FAMILY,TOO.

745
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,200
BACK THERE,
I'M JUST A STRANGER TO THEM.

746
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,540
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ME?
OUR LIFE?

747
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,850
IS THAT A PROJECTION,TOO?

748
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,260
NO.

749
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,980
WHAT WE HAVE,OUR MEMORIES,

750
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,800
THEY'LL CARRY OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD.

751
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,330
BUT IT WON'T BE THE SAME.
IT CAN'T BE.

752
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,730
MAYBE NOT,

753
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,010
BUT WHATEVER WE HAVE,
IT'LL BE REAL.

754
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

755
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,490
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

756
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,240
WHAT DO I DO?
STARE AT IT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS?

757
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,840
NO,JUST BELIEVE
IT'S NOT THERE.

758
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,270
WELL,THANKS
FOR COMING,EVERYBODY.

759
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,360
ALANA AND I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU ALL THAT...

760
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,050
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LEAVING.

761
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,920
WE'RE TAKING
A VACATION.

762
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,490
WE'LL BE GONE
FOR A WHILE,AND,UH...

763
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,230
I KNOW IT'S SUDDEN,

764
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,500
BUT WE JUST DECIDED
THIS MORNING.

765
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,490
WELL,
HOW LONG IS A WHILE?

766
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,690
I MEAN,YOU JUST GOT THE BIGGEST
PROMOTION OF YOUR CAREER.

767
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,740
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

768
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:22,740
WE WANTED TO SEE YOU ALL
ONE LAST TIME BEFORE WE GO,

769
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,100
AND TELL YOU...

770
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,910
HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU.

771
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,980
THAT'S SO SWEET.

772
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,620
CAREFUL,ALANA.

773
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,600
SHE'S GOING TO BE CRYING
IN A SECOND.

774
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,010
IT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO DO.

775
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,620
IT'S A...

776
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,740
IT'S A TRIP THAT WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME.

777
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,360
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

778
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,020
NOT FAR.

779
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,400
WELL...

780
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,690
SEND US A POSTCARD...

781
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,490
AT LEAST.

782
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,300
TO THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

783
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,960
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH WE WILL MISS YOU.

784
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,400
WE WILL MISS YOU,TOO.

785
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,430
DON'T LOOK BACK.

786
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,890
TOM?

787
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,720
TOM?

788
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,000
ARE YOU WITH ME,TOM?

789
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,120
CAN YOU EMAIL ME
THE MAREVA FILE?

790
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,980
ALANA MAREVA?

791
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,250
YEAH,A.K.A. RETURNEE 2155.

792
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,080
SHE WAS JUST HERE
DOING HER MED EVAL.

793
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,470
IT'S MY WEEK
TO DO REPORTS,

794
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,020
REMEMBER?

795
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,110
DIANA,THE 4400,
THE BALL OF LIGHT,

796
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,100
IT HAPPENED,RIGHT?

797
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,090
SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU--

798
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,420
- JUST TELL ME IT HAPPENED.
- YES,OF COURSE IT HAPPENED.

799
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,150
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE BEEN
DOING HERE THE LAST YEAR?

800
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,840
THAT'S GREAT.
