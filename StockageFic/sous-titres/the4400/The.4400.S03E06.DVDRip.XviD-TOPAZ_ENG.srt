1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,302
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,568
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,904
-Previously on The 4400:
-My name is Daniel Armand.

4
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,777
- KnoW Who I am?
- With the Nova Group?

5
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,748
I called to arrange a truce
and to talk about ShaWn Farrell,

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,888
We need to discuss his future,

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,650
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,

8
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,053
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,320
Believe me, I know which bench
I dedicated to my husband and son.

10
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:07,626
They died in a car accident
shortly before I was abducted.

11
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,634
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.

12
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,671
And they've let loose a terrible evil
into your time.

13
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,365
This evil, there has to be

14
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,010
- some other way to deal with it.
- There is. You.

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,006
You are the other way.

16
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,743
Oh, Tom. Good, you're here.

17
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,948
Yeah, just like always.

18
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,647
Well, come on.
We need to get started.

19
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,058
Started with what?

20
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,986
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,599
Sure you do. Come on, let's go.
She's waiting.

22
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,130
What is this?

23
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,833
I brought her in. You can just do it,
and we can get on with our day.

24
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,000
It?

25
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,948
No.

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,245
- No way, I'm not.
- Tom, you're supposed to do this.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,446
- They told you so.
- I know. It's just...

28
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,052
They didn't say why.

29
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,555
- I don't think I can.
- Maybe I'm bad.

30
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,732
Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,197
You can stop it.

32
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,828
I could be responsible for millions
of deaths, unless you do something.

33
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,234
We got a lot to do today.

34
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,142
It's all right, Tom. I don't mind.

35
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,348
- Come on.
- Take the needle.

36
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,347
Come on, Tom.

37
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,787
Do it.

38
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,583
Do it.

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,049
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,842
I can't find it,

41
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,176
I can't find it,

42
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,784
I know you're listening.

43
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,682
I know you put it
somewhere inside of me.

44
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,845
I'm gonna find it.

45
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,656
I can't find it.

46
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,223
I can't find the bug.

47
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,923
I can't find it. I can't find the bug.

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,761
I know you put it
inside me somewhere.

49
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,441
I know you're listening.
I'm gonna find it.

50
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,201
I'm gonna get an x-ray
of my whole body.

51
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,312
Maia's it! Maia's it!

52
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,347
- I'm gonna get you, Amy!
- No, you won't.

53
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,580
Yes, I will.

54
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,926
Maia.

55
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,991
- Maia, are you all right?
- It hurts.

56
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,328
I can help you.

57
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,304
It's just a bump, Shawn.

58
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,701
I can make it better.

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,045
- Oh, that hurts.
- You're getting better.

60
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,777
Hey, let her go! You're hurting her!

61
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,182
Somebody help!

62
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,346
Let go! Help!

63
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,890
- What's going on?
- He's killing her! Get him away!

64
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,493
Mister Farrell, let go.

65
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,960
Stay away from her!

66
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,998
- Stand back.
- I don't understand. I was healing her.

67
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,167
- What happened?
- I was making her better.

68
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,176
Sweetheart.

69
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,543
- Hey, Mom.
- How are you doing?

70
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,009
- I'm okay.
- Maia's vital signs are fine.

71
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,584
There's no lasting damage
that I can detect.

72
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,814
At the moment,
she's mostly just dehydrated.

73
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,249
Sweetheart?

74
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,088
- Mommy?
- What is it?

75
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:41,195
Why would Shawn hurt me?

76
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,403
Oh, my God. Shawn did this?

77
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,704
He missed some meetings yesterday,
but I had no idea it had gotten this bad.

78
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,939
- How's Shawn? Is he okay?
- We don't know.

79
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,606
We called a psychiatrist for him.
They're back in the bedroom now.

80
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,277
- I wanna see him. He'll feel better.
- lsabelle, not right now.

81
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,946
Let him meet with the doctor
for a while, okay?

82
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,727
Sorry.

83
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,989
This is my daughter lsabelle.
Isabelle, this is Tom Baldwin.

84
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,497
- Hi.
- Shawn told me about you.

85
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,793
Hi.

86
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,869
Hi.

87
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,407
You're staring at me. Why?

88
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,713
How is he?

89
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,552
I gave him a sedative.
He's sleeping right now.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,848
Shawn is experiencing persistent
and powerful auditory hallucinations.

91
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,219
They're contributing
to his delusions.

92
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,385
Delusions? I don't understand.
What's happening to him?

93
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,929
Shawn's symptoms are...

94
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,157
Well, I'm afraid
they're consistent with the onset

95
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,824
of disorganized schizophrenia.

96
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,434
But you're gonna fix him, right?
You're gonna make him better?

97
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,573
Well, I've never seen a case
quite like this.

98
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,174
Typically, schizophrenia
has a gradual onset.

99
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,302
Patients slowly withdraw
from the world

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,538
as their symptoms get worse.

101
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,309
But with Shawn, it's almost
as if the disease was just turned on.

102
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,059
Last week, we got a phone call
from Daniel Armand.

103
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,559
He said if we weren't willing
to reach a compromise with Nova,

104
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,889
he'd come gunning for Shawn.

105
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,122
And now it's two days later,

106
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,630
and he just happens to come down
with schizophrenia.

107
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,564
You think the Nova Group
did this to Shawn?

108
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,802
Well, we'll investigate it,
but until the matter's cleared up,

109
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,907
Shawn just can't walk around free.

110
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,273
I mean, okay, he's probably
a victim in this, but his mental state

111
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,572
has been compromised.
He can't control his ability.

112
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,681
Shawn is one of the leaders
of this place.

113
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,975
People love him.

114
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,015
If he just disappears
into the basement at NTAC,

115
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,778
there's gonna be a lot
of unhappiness here.

116
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,184
Nobody's talking
about disappearing anyone.

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,121
You need to just distance yourself
from the situation. Just for a second.

118
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,660
Now, we have an insane 4400
with a potentially lethal ability.

119
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,424
This is an ability that he has turned
against my daughter.

120
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,500
If you don't voluntarily remand him
to a psychiatric hospital,

121
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,695
then I'll file a complaint for assault and
take the decision out of your hands.

122
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,066
No!

123
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,505
You can't lock him up.
This isn't his fault.

124
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,202
Isabelle, Shawn is in trouble.
He needs help.

125
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,440
I know he does, and instead,
you just want to abandon him.

126
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,107
He sacrificed for this place.
He told you not to talk to Nova,

127
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,083
even if it meant
they were gonna come after him.

128
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,848
- Now they did, and you cut him loose?
- We're not cutting him loose.

129
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,322
- We are protecting him.
- Oh, by locking him up?

130
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,395
- I guess it's fine for you, right?
- lsabelle, that is not true.

131
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,499
And we are not having this
discussion now. This is not the place.

132
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,602
If you'll agree that Shawn goes
nowhere near a government facility,

133
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,472
we'll commit him to a private hospital
until all this is cleared up.

134
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,314
How much did they tell you
about what I do here at the school?

135
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,817
Not much. You're some sort
of guidance counselor, right?

136
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:59,124
Something like that. It's more
like a therapist, I guess you could say.

137
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,132
I work with the students here
using my ability.

138
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,099
All the kids here are 4400s,

139
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,763
which means you missed years
of your family's lives.

140
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,801
Your parents had another child
while you were gone.

141
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,843
- Your brother, Curtis?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,504
Before they got divorced.
I barely know him.

143
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,944
That's where I come in.

144
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,014
It's hard to explain, but if you let me,

145
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,884
I can take you back to the years
when you were gone.

146
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,220
You can meet your brother
when he was baby, see him grow up,

147
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,294
and spend all the time
you need with him,

148
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,397
and build the relationship
you don't have.

149
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,158
I'm sorry. What?
You wanna take me back in time?

150
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:42,001
No. We'll be going to a world
we create using both our minds.

151
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,665
And it will seem just as real
as this one.

152
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,817
Look, no offense,

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,681
but maybe you should worry
about helping yourself.

154
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,489
You think I need help?

155
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,994
You have this sadness inside you.

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,859
Not sadness exactly.

157
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,591
I guess rage would be the best word.

158
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,062
It's because of what happened
to your husband and son

159
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,229
all those years ago.

160
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,867
You know about Billy and Paul?

161
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,478
They got killed in a hit-and-run.

162
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,403
The police never caught the guy.

163
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,742
You try to move on...

164
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,049
...and I guess you kind of have.

165
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,289
But you still think about it every day.

166
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,022
And there's still that rage.

167
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,069
How do you know all that?

168
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,408
You have an ability,
and I have an ability.

169
00:11:55,147 --> 00:12:00,175
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just not up for this.

170
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,919
So is it okay if I go back to class?

171
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,898
You're right to be mad, you know.

172
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:21,506
The guy? The driver?
He's kind of out there.

173
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,073
It's not fair.

174
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,475
But you did see Shawn Farrell
on Tuesday?

175
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,384
A home loan from the center.
And how did the meeting end?

176
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,688
Oh, well, congratulations.
That's a really nice neighborhood.

177
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,964
No, no, Mister Donavan.
Thanks for your time.

178
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,398
We'll be in touch
if we need anything further.

179
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,798
You know, your nephew is one
of the leaders of the center.

180
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,770
He sees dozens of 4400s every day.

181
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,104
And the ones that we've spoken to
who have registered abilities with us,

182
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,542
they have minor stuff.
Nothing like the capacity

183
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,181
to induce insanity.

184
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,408
And that's assuming
that whoever did this

185
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,711
had to be in proximity to Shawn
to make it happen.

186
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,081
Whoever?

187
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,849
We basically know who did this.
It was Daniel Armand.

188
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,719
Either he did it, or he gave the order.

189
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,453
Well, no, the truth is we don't actually
know that Shawn's condition

190
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,119
is the result of an attack.

191
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,527
Nova's not claiming credit,

192
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,100
and Shawn's exactly the right age
for onset of schizophrenia.

193
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,067
So it's possible
that we're looking for a crime,

194
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,206
and the only thing
we're gonna find is a tragedy.

195
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,402
Then there's nothing we can do.

196
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,374
I cannot accept that.

197
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,244
Nova threatened Shawn.
Shawn got sick.

198
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,978
For right now,
that's all the cause and effect I need.

199
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,922
You're Zachary?

200
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,326
- Thanks for meeting me out here.
- It's all right.

201
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,525
Matthew said you had something
you wanted to discuss.

202
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,536
About six weeks ago,
a friend of mine from quarantine,

203
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,799
she asked me to meet her
for dinner.

204
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,378
So I go, and she's asking me
all sorts of questions.

205
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,844
Now, she never came right out
and said it,

206
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,883
but I swear she was feeling me out
to see if I would join the Nova Group.

207
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,782
She was recruiting you?

208
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,947
I mean, she used to bitch
about the government all the time.

209
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,888
- I guess she just finally got fed up.
- Zachary.

210
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,529
If you got a name, give it to me.

211
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,559
Jane Nance.

212
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,333
Thank you for coming forward.

213
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,905
Hi.

214
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,378
Todd?

215
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,554
Ms. Mareva. What's up?

216
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,129
Those things you said about me.
They're very private.

217
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,226
How did you know?

218
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,563
Sometimes, when I'm talking
to somebody,

219
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,471
if they feel something real strong,
I feel it too.

220
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,438
And then I know
why they feel that way.

221
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,603
I see it.

222
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,509
So you saw what happened
to my family?

223
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,021
Not the whole thing.
I just get, like, fragments.

224
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,896
I saw the two cars hit.
I saw this guy.

225
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,588
There were empty beer bottles
by his seat.

226
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,757
He thought about getting out.

227
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,996
Calling the cops.

228
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,200
I guess he changed his mind.

229
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,038
The man who hit them,
you know who he is?

230
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,805
Yeah, I already wrote it down.

231
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,773
I figured you'd want it.

232
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,885
"Keane Driscoll."

233
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,160
Security told me you were up here.

234
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,362
What are you doing?

235
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,905
I'm packing Shawn's stuff.
I'm taking him out of the hospital.

236
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,135
Isabelle, I have to caution you
against overreaction.

237
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,610
I know you're worried about Shawn,
but all we have is a tip.

238
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,477
We might know the name
of one person in the Nova Group.

239
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,175
What's my dad gonna do with that?

240
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,220
Let me guess, call NTAC? What are
they gonna do for Shawn that I can't?

241
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,981
They're equipped
to deal with 4400s.

242
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,181
Not as well as I am.

243
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,120
- lsabelle.
- Matthew, get out of my way.

244
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,024
What are you gonna do?

245
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,392
We don't even know if that tip
is any good.

246
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,390
And if this woman, Jane Nance,
is in the Nova Group,

247
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,060
there's no guarantee
she's the one doing this to Shawn.

248
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,468
If she's not, she'll get me closer
to the person who is.

249
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,575
She was recruited into Nova, right?
So she'll know at least one name.

250
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,679
I'll find that person. If they're not
the one, they'll know a name too.

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,008
And eventually, I'll find the person
who is hurting Shawn,

252
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,207
and I'll make him stop.

253
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,589
Wait. Wait a minute.

254
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,055
Do you remember the first time
I came to see you?

255
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,194
You were so sad.

256
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,593
You didn't know who you were.
Why you grew up so fast.

257
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,961
Why you were making
your mother so sick.

258
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,161
And I told you,
you were one of the lucky ones.

259
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,774
You have a purpose, a job to do.

260
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,307
I even told you what it was.

261
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,603
Do you remember?

262
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,978
Say it.

263
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,983
I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400.

264
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,055
That's right.

265
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,691
Not everyone from the future
thinks they're a good thing.

266
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,589
Not everyone thinks
they're gonna save the world.

267
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:49,064
All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400
are supposed to prevent, it's lies.

268
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,259
They are the catastrophe.
All of them.

269
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,997
Your father, Shawn...

270
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,569
And if he's in trouble,
that's good for us.

271
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,010
So you keep telling me.

272
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,047
Goodbye.

273
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,675
No, I can't allow you to do this.

274
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:13,348
You're not ready to be on your own.
You need me. You need my guidance.

275
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,939
I don't think I do, Matthew.

276
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,704
Today's graduation day.

277
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,626
Shawn?

278
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,025
Isabelle.

279
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,894
We have to go now, okay?

280
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,970
- lsabelle. Isabelle.
- Okay.

281
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:06,736
My back teeth are melting,
and they're gonna run down my throat.

282
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,812
I can feel it.

283
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,076
It's okay.
I'm gonna make you better.

284
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,747
Just come with me, okay?

285
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,985
Okay?

286
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,093
Her name is Jane Nance,
and she lives about 20 minutes away.

287
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,094
We think the tip is good.

288
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,630
If she really is a member of Nova,

289
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,235
you can bet she'll be ready
to defend herself, so let's be careful.

290
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,598
Here you go, Triton.

291
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,569
Here you go.

292
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,373
You've been a very patient boy.

293
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,777
Fidget?

294
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,413
What did I tell you
about sitting on the TV?

295
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,392
Not yet, Herkie.

296
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,870
Who are you?

297
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,347
We all know what it's like
to hit bottom.

298
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,852
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.

299
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,388
It comes in a different way
for each of us,

300
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,087
that moment when we realize
our drinking is out of control.

301
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,130
I'm sorry to interrupt.

302
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,001
It's okay. It's okay. Come on in.

303
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,070
Grab a seat.

304
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,842
I was just saying, my name is Keane,
and I'm an alcoholic.

305
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,349
Hi Keane.

306
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,092
Jane Nance!

307
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,740
Oh, my God.

308
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,542
What?

309
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,560
Get those animals away from her.

310
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,988
What the hell happened here?

311
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,031
It's like all these pets she keeps,
they turned on her.

312
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,364
Maybe someone
turned them on her.

313
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,767
He died very quickly.

314
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,242
It could have been a massive stroke,
maybe a coronary.

315
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,074
I'll call an ambulance
and the coroner.

316
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,148
Mister Tyler.

317
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,144
Those two NTAC agents are here
again. They say they need to see you.

318
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,084
Look, Mister Tyler,

319
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,780
Isabelle broke Shawn
out of the hospital.

320
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,322
We know that for a fact.

321
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,791
And now we learn that Matthew Ross,
a 36-year-old man,

322
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,726
just happened to die of a stroke
on the floor of Shawn's living room.

323
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,526
Within the hour,
Jane Nance dies as well.

324
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,931
I mean, are you telling us
that you don't see a connection?

325
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,502
You're talking about my daughter.

326
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,605
She shouldn't have taken Shawn,
I'll admit that.

327
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,571
She can be immature sometimes, yes.
But she is not a killer.

328
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,870
Any idea where lsabelle
may have taken Shawn?

329
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,512
No.

330
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,439
If she calls, I'll try to convince her
to come in and I'll let you know.

331
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,380
That's the best I can do.

332
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,287
Is there anything else?

333
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,682
See you.

334
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,130
Hey.

335
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,061
It's okay to be shy.

336
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,600
I remember my first meeting.
I didn't say anything either.

337
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,537
I was at rock bottom,
embarrassed just to be breathing.

338
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,436
How long ago was that?

339
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,704
About nine years.

340
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,206
I was in a car accident.

341
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,874
The truth is,
I can barely remember it.

342
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,989
I came to and I knew
I had to change my life.

343
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,651
So I did. I've been leading
these meetings for five years now.

344
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,489
How about you?
You have a moment like that?

345
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,499
Diana, we opened a trace
on Shawn's cell phone.

346
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,693
Richard Tyler's too.

347
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,533
If lsabelle calls, we'll be listening.

348
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,143
Does this girl scare you
as much as she scares me?

349
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,575
I mean, never mind what she did
or didn't do today.

350
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,578
You just meet her.

351
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,612
I mean, she looks like a normal kid.
Attractive, maybe a bit naive.

352
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,652
But when she says something,

353
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,756
you realize she's looking at you
like you're an ant

354
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,518
and she's just deciding whether or not
she's gonna rip your legs off.

355
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,653
Every other 4400 had a past
before they were taken, a history.

356
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,958
Not her.

357
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,296
She just kind of sprouted.

358
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,464
She's not even a 4400.

359
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,703
She's something else.
A new category.

360
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,673
We got a hit on the APB.
Shawn's car was spotted

361
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,905
- headed east on Forbes Avenue.
- That's in Everett. Let's go.

362
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,481
Diana, I need to make a stop
at home first.

363
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,970
I'm not taking those.
I'm not taking those.

364
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,132
There's radio antennas
inside of there.

365
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,437
And that's how they hear
what I'm thinking.

366
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,772
- I'm not taking those.
- Shawn.

367
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,278
Shawn, there are no radio antennas.

368
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,383
They're just pills.
They make you feel better.

369
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,645
The label says you're supposed
to take them every four hours.

370
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,549
Shawn, stop that.

371
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,564
Wait a minute. There he is.

372
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,872
It's so late.

373
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,718
You scared me.

374
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:27,051
I'm sorry. Someone called in a tip
on Shawn's car.

375
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,194
It was abandoned, though.
He's still missing.

376
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,729
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

377
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,033
I don't know.

378
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,663
No.

379
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,505
A boy at school, he has this gift.

380
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,580
He sees things,
things that already happened.

381
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,313
He says he saw the accident
that killed Billy.

382
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,950
Oh, my God. Baby.

383
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,921
- Why would he tell you that?
- Because.

384
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,893
He also gave me the name
of the man who did it.

385
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,895
I went to see him, Thomas.

386
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,094
You did what?

387
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,566
He was leading an AA meeting.

388
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,643
He told me he had a car accident
while he was drunk nine years ago.

389
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,279
Alana, sweetie,
if this really is the guy,

390
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,508
- we'll look into it.
- Based on what?

391
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,051
The visions of a 4400
who was a little kid

392
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,278
when the accident happened?

393
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,423
Alana, please.

394
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,186
Don't go see this guy again.
It could be dangerous.

395
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,159
You should pick up, Thomas.

396
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,632
Yeah, but are you sure you're okay?

397
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,536
I'm fine.

398
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,643
Better than your nephew anyway.

399
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,110
Baldwin.

400
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,824
The place is owned by a 4400
named Jorge Molina.

401
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,760
Fire Department found some burnt
remains inside. They think it's him.

402
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,593
- What started the fire?
- They're not sure.

403
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,961
Apparently, Molina had a habit

404
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,966
of leaving oily rags
laying around the garage.

405
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,628
Someone in Health and Safety
gave him a bunch of citations for it.

406
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,707
Said it was a fire hazard.
Guess they were right, huh?

407
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,276
Yeah, either that,
or lsabelle found the name

408
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,073
of another member
of the Nova Group.

409
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,660
- Hello?
- This Will all be over soon, Daddy,

410
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,819
Hello?

411
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,990
I found out who's doing this to Shawn.
It's Daniel Armand.

412
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,730
- lsabelle?
- The last Nova I talked to told me.

413
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,271
Isabelle,

414
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,033
Where are you?

415
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,378
I'm just waiting for him to come home,
and then I'm gonna make him stop.

416
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,572
Isabelle, if you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC.

417
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,182
They'll take care of it.

418
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,083
I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping until Shawn's better.

419
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:18,622
Daddy, when all this is done,
can I come home?

420
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,564
Will they let me,

421
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,534
or am I in too much trouble?

422
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,230
I don't knoW, Maybe,

423
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,408
If you stop noW, maybe,

424
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,572
Just tell me where you're going
so I can come meet you.

425
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,817
Okay.

426
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,219
Diana, we just intercepted a call
to Richard Tyler's phone.

427
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,622
- It was lsabelle.
- Where is she?

428
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,387
She's headed to an address
in Munhall.

429
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,055
She says Daniel Armand is there.

430
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,943
You'd better not be hurting him.

431
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,915
I'm not. It's almost done.

432
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,263
Isabelle.

433
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,902
Shawn, are you okay?

434
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,436
Yeah, I think so.

435
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,336
What happened?
I don't remember anything.

436
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,140
What's Armand doing here?

437
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,343
He was hurting you.
He broke your mind.

438
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,785
That's his ability,
but I made him stop.

439
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,321
He's yours now.
You can do what you want.

440
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,291
Now she wants you to kill me.

441
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,889
I'm not killing anybody, lsabelle.

442
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,999
If you don't, she will.

443
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,196
Is that true?

444
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,134
I did what I had to do
to make you better.

445
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,570
What does it matter anyway?
You're not sick anymore.

446
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,836
I know. I know. Thank you.

447
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,503
But it's over. It's over.

448
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,376
I'm better. We have Armand.

449
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,245
Let's just go.
We can walk away.

450
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,221
You don't really know
this girl at all, do you?

451
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,727
You think she's one of us?

452
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,863
Don't listen to him, lsabelle.

453
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,932
- Stop talking.
- She's not, Shawn.

454
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,133
She killed her way across town
to find me,

455
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,431
and there's no way
she's walking away.

456
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,870
I said stop talking now.

457
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,170
Isabelle, don't. Isabelle, don't.

458
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:52,476
For the record, Daniel,
I didn't kill your people.

459
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,618
Not exactly.

460
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,383
All I did was turn their abilities
against them.

461
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,525
And what do you do again?

462
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,593
Oh, right.

463
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,263
You make people crazy.

464
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,625
No.

465
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,230
Isabelle.

466
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,734
Isabelle, stop it!

467
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,307
Stop it!

468
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,078
They wanna take my organs out.

469
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,950
All of them.

470
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,584
They're halfway done.

471
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,527
They're halfway done.

472
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,858
Why did you do that to him?

473
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,268
He was still a threat to you, Shawn.

474
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,134
If we just left, what's to keep him
from attacking you again?

475
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,178
Everything I did,
I did to make you better.

476
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,143
I don't regret any of it.

477
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,081
If I had to kill a hundred people,
I would have.

478
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,352
Who are you?

479
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,860
If anyone gets any resistance
from the girl or Daniel Armand,

480
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,333
do not hesitate to use deadly force!

481
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,699
Tom, anything to add?

482
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,500
- No, let's move.
- Stop!

483
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,971
Can't do that, Mr. Tyler.
We need to end this.

484
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,941
Look, if you go in there
with your guns out,

485
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,977
this could end badly for everybody.

486
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,742
Let me talk to lsabelle,
see if I can get her to come out quietly.

487
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,987
You guys have got
the place surrounded, right?

488
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,946
If I'm gone more than five minutes,
you can just come in anyway.

489
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,291
Go.

490
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,566
Isabelle? Shawn?

491
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,131
Richard.

492
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,803
You've gotta talk to her.
You've gotta talk to her.

493
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,972
She wants to fight them.
She's gonna get everyone killed.

494
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,017
Daddy, we can get past them.
You can help me.

495
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,155
You can get the guns
out of their hands, right?

496
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,621
No, lsabelle! We're not here
to fight the government. Not today.

497
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,123
I don't have a choice.

498
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,921
Yes, you do.

499
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,060
Walk out there with me.

500
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,729
You're gonna get in trouble

501
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,300
for breaking Shawn out of the hospital,
but we can deal with it.

502
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,439
I don't know what happened with
Matthew, but we can deal with that too.

503
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,540
But if you go after those agents,
that is it.

504
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,007
You're an enemy of the government.
They will catch you eventually.

505
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,578
They will put you away forever,
I don't care how strong you are.

506
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,546
And there won't be anything
I can do about it.

507
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,224
All this.

508
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:57,324
I did it to save Shawn,
and he hates me now.

509
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,535
Isabelle.

510
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:06,075
Isabelle, I don't hate you.

511
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,872
He's just scared, that's all.
We all are.

512
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,708
Let's go.

513
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,750
They're coming out!

514
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,060
Shawn, are you all right?

515
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,996
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,430
Daniel Armand's inside.
He's all yours.

517
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,263
So this is what it feels like

518
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,628
to watch someone
get away with murder.

519
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,101
If there's no evidence of foul play,
how can there be a murder?

520
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,764
As for the deaths,
Shawn doesn't remember anything.

521
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,276
There's no witnesses.
So officially, we don't have a case.

522
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,937
Yeah, but she did it.

523
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,947
And I can't help but think
when all this is over,

524
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,018
she's gonna do a lot more.

525
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,017
Their names were Billy and Paul.

526
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,958
Paul was my husband.
Billy was our son.

527
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:39,360
They were killed
in a hit-and-run accident in 1 997.

528
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,630
The same year you hit bottom.

529
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,406
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything.

530
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,981
You killed them.

531
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,718
Look...

532
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,556
...I told you before. Nine years ago...

533
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,299
...I was a different man.

534
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,272
Something happened. Something...

535
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,304
...terrible.

536
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,941
And I had a choice.

537
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:27,073
I could end my life,
or I could try to live it better.

538
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,848
And I decided to live.

539
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,389
And I did do better.
I dedicated myself to it.

540
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,426
I mean, look around. I help people.

541
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,153
You do.

542
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,559
And you probably feel
like that's enough.

543
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,268
I'll bet you do go days,
whole weeks even,

544
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:51,170
without ever thinking
about that other man, and what he did.

545
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,179
I think about it every day.

546
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,815
It never goes away for me.

547
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:06,489
And I'm going to make sure
it never goes away for you either.

548
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,726
I won't let you forget them.

549
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:18,325
I'm fine, Daddy.
They treated me fine.

550
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,430
I just need a little time alone, okay?

551
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,536
Isabelle.

552
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,569
You know, sometime very soon,

553
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,736
we're gonna have to talk
about Matthew.

554
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,205
About all of this.

555
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,118
How did you get in here?

556
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,631
Shut the door. We need to talk.

557
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,075
About what?

558
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,115
Some people want me to kill you.

559
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,314
I was hoping you could tell me why.

560
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,262
Who gave you that?

561
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,890
Long story.

562
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,632
Let's just say the woman
who left it for me, she called you evil.

563
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,806
Said if humanity was gonna survive,
you had to die.

564
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,242
What, you think that's funny?

565
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,079
No.

566
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,275
It's just it seems like a lot of people
have opinions about me.

567
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:46,890
Either I'm the savior,
or I'm the end of the world.

568
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,717
It's nice to have options, I guess.

569
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,895
That man, Matthew?

570
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,758
The one who had a stroke?

571
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,729
He came to me right after I grew up.

572
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,897
He said I was supposed
to do all kinds of things.

573
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,234
Destroy the 4400. Kill them all.

574
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,883
He told me it was the only way
to save the world.

575
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,916
I told him no.

576
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,525
I might have been conceived
in the future, but I'm not their puppet.

577
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,992
He didn't like that.

578
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,223
He's not around anymore.

579
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,033
Neither are those members
of the Nova Group.

580
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,341
Those people were terrorists.

581
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,533
They were murderers.
They were hurting Shawn.

582
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,170
Look, whoever told you that I'm bad,

583
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:49,012
that I'm some sort
of walking Armageddon, is wrong.

584
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,483
I turned my back on all that.

585
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,124
I'm not a murderer.

586
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,691
You know what?
I don't care how much I scare you.

587
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,329
I don't think you are, either.

588
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,224
You don't know me.

589
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,923
No?

590
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,894
Let's find out.

591
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,700
Here I am, the angel of death.

592
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:19,310
The end of the human race,
whatever the hell it is they call me.

593
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,813
I won't move. I promise.

594
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,435
No.

595
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,373
Not yet.

596
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,112
Not until I'm sure.

597
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,339
You're not a murderer.

598
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,646
It's okay.

599
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,718
You should take that with you
in case you change your mind.

600
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,220
You better hope I don't.

601
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,127
I made that happen, didn't l?

602
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,567
No, Todd. I did.

603
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,175
I didn't mean to.

604
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,977
I didn't want to.

605
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,154
But I did.

606
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,928
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?

607
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,070
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.

608
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,763
- My name's lsabelle Tyler.
- Oh, Miss Tyler.

609
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,168
Mister Ryland's expecting you.

610
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,503
Go on up to 24. He's waiting.
