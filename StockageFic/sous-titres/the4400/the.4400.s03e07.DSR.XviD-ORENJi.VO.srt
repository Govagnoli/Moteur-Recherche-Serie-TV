1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,380
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,350
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,970
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,650
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,590
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,790
We're not a threat.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,370
We're salvation.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,680
The world will have to deal with us.

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,390
Previously on the 4400...

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,060
I've been offered a job working with the children at the school.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,180
I blew the surprise,didn't I?

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,850
I just want to make one thing clear--

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,860
me breaking up with danny has nothing to do with you.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,110
Okay.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,490
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm the guy who killed you.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,130
Is this list complete?

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,570
Because I'm just wondering how many 4400s you did kill.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,530
What's up?

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,490
Who are these guys?

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,090
They've been brought in to help expedite the interrogation.

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,450
I know you find this hard to believe,tom,but we're on the same side.

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,320
One of our members has been compromised.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,400
I have to assume he's going to give up my name.

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,540
If you know where armand is,we'll tell ntac.They'll take care of it.

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,650
Daniel armand's inside.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
He's all yours.

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,330
This is it.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,710
The last member of the nova group.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,340
The last one we know about,anyway.

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,300
If this tip is good and we bring in gary navarro,

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,570
this could pretty much be the end for the nova group.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,180
The tip is good.

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,960
Here they are.Let's go.

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,480
Gary! It's over!

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,730
Go. Go.
Downstairs.

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,870
Clear.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Clear,sir!

41
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,200
There's nobody here.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,030
Looks like he just left.

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,530
In the middle of making lunch?

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,410
He must have known we were coming.Someone must have tipped him off.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,580
Ah,isabelle...

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,560
ah... isabelle...

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,150
you're not hearing me.

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,060
Sure I did.

49
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,610
You said you don't want to be with me anymore.

50
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,560
I just don't see why.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
The nova group's gone.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,380
My dad knows about us now.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,130
There's nothing to stop us from being together.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,050
Yes,there is.

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
Me.

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,440
This is because of what happened to matthew,right?

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,900
You think I killed him...

58
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,800
and the people from the nova group,too.

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,760
I wasn't in my right mind,isabelle,so I don't know what happened.

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,650
Well,then I'll tell you.

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,060
Matthew had a stroke,some terrorists died,and you got better.

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,530
What's to question?

63
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,780
I just think that you and i got a little too intense too fast.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,680
See...

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,620
I thought that was the best part.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,860
Sorry for the interruption.

67
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,860
Shawn,there's someone here to see you.

68
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,220
She's a friend of yours.

69
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,510
She says it's important.

70
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,850
Nikki.Oh,my god.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,310
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,240
It's been a long time,shawn.

73
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,800
Yeah.

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,220
H-hi.
Hi.

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,110
I-I should have called first.

76
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,010
No.

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,630
No,it's fine.

78
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,170
You look great.How've you been?

79
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,730
Good. Good.

80
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,950
School's kind of fun.

81
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,800
It's just...

82
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,840
my father.

83
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,660
He's been sick.

84
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,750
Your dad?I'm sorry to hear that.

85
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,110
It's cancer.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,610
It's in his pancreas.

87
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,950
There's nothing they can do.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,770
Shawn?

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,520
Is everything okay?

90
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,850
Yeah. Um...

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,810
I just need to deal with this thing now,so we'll talk later,okay?

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Okay.

93
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,210
So,amy...

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,490
you used to call your grandmother "mimi"?

95
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,630
Yes.

96
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,020
I'd go stay with her for two weeks every year,

97
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,040
but when I came back with all the other 4400s,

98
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,280
my mom told me she was gone.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
Alana mareva?

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,850
We're from the national security agency.

101
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,220
You need to come with us.

102
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,620
What is this about?

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,740
The pentagon has commissioned a study on the membership and the origins of the nova group.

104
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,320
We've been authorized to interview all persons of interest.

105
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,920
And why would I be a person of interest?

106
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,970
Ma'am,we have a list.

107
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,740
Your name is on it.

108
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,750
Let's not make a scene in front of the child.

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,030
How did my name get on the list?

110
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,340
What am I being accused of?

111
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,060
We have evidence that suggests you're a member of the nova group.

Proudly Presents

114
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,280
I wrote a check.

115
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,880
My friend ryan at the center.

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,740
He came up to me one day about six weeks ago,said he couldn't pay his power bill.

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,470
They were going to shut it off if he didn't come up with the money.

118
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,060
It was a small loan.$165.

119
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,380
No big deal,right?

120
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,290
Ryan freel?

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,440
We picked him up three days ago.

122
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,710
He's one of the names daniel armand gave us.

123
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,140
So they were right.He was in nova.

124
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,990
They say they can hold me for providing financial support to terrorists.

125
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,640
It was just a loan,thomas.

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,860
How long are they going to keep me here?

127
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,740
They can hold you for questioning without any charge for 36 hours,

128
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,220
but it's not going to come to that.

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,770
This is harassment,and it's not going to continue.

130
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm going to talk to ryan freel.

131
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,250
I'll get him to admit that this was just a casual thing,that it had nothing to do with nova.

132
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,890
Alana,I promise,this is all going to be over soon.Just--

133
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,690
Just sit tight,okay?

134
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,850
I love you.

135
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,170
I know it's frustrating,but there's nothing we can do.

136
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,220
Nina,it's harassment,pure and simple.

137
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,080
Yeah,I know it is,and I don't like it either,

138
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,250
but the nova group made a lot of people nervous.

139
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,940
Now that it's broken,the military want to make sure that it's dead and gone.

140
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,240
Yeah,we all do.

141
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,520
It's still no excuse to hold an innocent woman based on absolutely nothing.

142
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,500
I agree,but the pentagon went around us on this one.

143
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,420
They went private.

144
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,550
They hired the haspel corporation to conduct the study.

145
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,460
The haspel corp?

146
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,320
They do a lot of defense contracting,don't they?

147
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,480
Right now,they're focusing on this nova report.

148
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,020
Nsa even loaned them agents to do field work.

149
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,940
Now some conglomerate has the right to arrest and detain people?

150
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,620
Where's the oversight?

151
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,340
There isn't a lot.

152
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,320
Look,this whole thing runs on the discretion of the executive in charge of the study.

153
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,210
So who's this executive?

154
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,990
I appreciate your frustration,tom.

155
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,120
It's unfortunate that your girlfriend got involved in this mess...

156
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,390
but my people were just being thorough.

157
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,190
Your "people"?

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,950
Alana's being held by the national security agency.

159
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,490
The way I remember it,your life in public service ended with a perp walk through ntac.

160
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,890
Yeah,there were some unpleasant moments,but that's the past.

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,660
I was censured for my part in the inhibitor...

162
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,210
"scandal,"I guess you'd call it.

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,050
"Scandal"?Why don't you try "murderous plot"?

164
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,920
Your opinions are already a matter of record,not that the majority of people agree with you.

165
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,790
Anyway,after the government saw fit to terminate my employment,

166
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,860
I weighed my offers and wound up here.Haspel corp.

167
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,290
And alana just happened to wind up in your crosshairs,right?

168
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,710
Tom,do you think I would use your girlfriend to prosecute some kind of personal vendetta?

169
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,430
Actually,dennis,yeah,I do.

170
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,820
So that's his punishment for causing the deaths of 28 4400s--

171
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,070
a six-figure consulting gig and a corner office.

172
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,330
Don't act so surprised,tom.

173
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,910
We always knew ryland had a lot of support for what he did.

174
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,410
Learning anything new?

175
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Yeah.She's incredible.

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,930
In a week,we've made discoveries we thought it would take years to get to.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,200
Where'd you find this girl?

178
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,380
He didn't find me.

179
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,220
I found him.

180
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,770
Shawn.

181
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,070
It's all right.

182
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,870
Hey.

183
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,630
That was amazing.

184
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,280
It looks like my father could walk out of here this afternoon.

185
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,640
Good.

186
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,490
I know my whole family just thanked you,again and again,

187
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,280
but I wanted to say it,too,so...

188
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,180
thanks.

189
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,830
It's all right,nikki.

190
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,490
You look so different.

191
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,260
Last time I saw u,I don't think you even owned a belt.

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,340
You used to wear the same flannel shirt every day for a week.

193
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
A lot's changed,I guess.

194
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,970
Now you're doing so great.

195
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,440
It kind of makes me wonder why you never called,just to say hi,you know?

196
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,000
I was just trying to put everything behind me,I guess.I don'T...

197
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,230
but I thought about you. A lot.

198
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,790
I got to go,I guess.

199
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,050
Yeah.

200
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,340
Tell your dad not to hurry back to the office,okay?

201
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,630
He always was a workaholic.

202
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,330
We just got the phone records in from gary's safe house.

203
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,970
A call came in at 11:14 A.M.

204
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,380
11:14?That's right before we got there.

205
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,200
It's a tip-off call.It had to be.

206
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,440
It came from inside the 4400 center.

207
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,920
Look,I really don't know what to say.

208
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,130
I can't tell you why that call came from my office,

209
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,560
but I didn't make it.

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,600
Heather,we've got phone records that say it came fromour extension.

211
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,300
You said the call was made around 11:10,right?

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,020
Then there's no way it could have been me.

213
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,120
I was teaching a class from 11:00 to noon.

214
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,560
I was standing in front of 12 students for the entire hour.

215
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,170
I never left the room.

216
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,690
Anyone else have access to your office?

217
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,350
Just the janitor,but you'd have to ask maintenance.

218
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,650
We will.

219
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,440
We'll need to talk to your students as well.

220
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,530
Look,heather,ntac isn't the only organization investigating the nova group.

221
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,590
There's going to be a lot of people looking at those phone records,

222
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,210
and they're all going to be less friendly than we are.

223
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,750
Sorry,guys.

224
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,710
It's like I said--I was in class.

225
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,820
That's all I know.

226
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,940
I got a little worried about you this afternoon.

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,510
You were gone all day again.

228
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,200
I was out walking.

229
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,540
I like to do that now.

230
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,200
Dad...

231
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,460
I need you to talk to shawn.

232
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,450
Tell him he can't break up with me.

233
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,600
It would be a mistake.

234
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,500
I can't do that.

235
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,910
For one thing,I don't think it is.

236
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,040
I know how much it must hurt right now,

237
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,560
but you'll get over it.

238
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,490
Don't talk to me like I'm a teenager.

239
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,220
There are things I have to do.

240
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,540
They're going to be really hard,dangerous,

241
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,000
and if shawn's not with me,

242
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,620
it's going to make things worse.

243
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
Worse for who? You?

244
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,480
No.

245
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,490
Everyone else.

246
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,870
Yeah? And what if he says no?

247
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,520
Be more convincing.

248
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,410
Heather.

249
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,960
What's up?

250
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,940
I need to talk to you.

251
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,610
Listen...

252
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,230
I've been thinking all day about this.

253
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,130
I didn't tell you everything this afternoon.

254
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,380
There was someone who had the key to my office.

255
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,650
Okay,this person...

256
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,200
I need to know who it was.

257
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,950
Tom...

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,130
it was alana.

259
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,300
I didn't want to say anything in front of your partner.

260
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,080
I'm sure you understand why.

261
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,990
Tom...

262
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,560
did alana know that you found out where this guy,gary,was living?

263
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,780
Yeah,yeah,she did.I...

264
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,850
I was on the phone with her when the tip came in.I told her.

265
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,390
She knew we'd been chasing gary for a long time.

266
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,130
Heather,come on.It wasn't alana.

267
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,470
There has to be some other explanation.

268
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,020
I hope so,and I hope you find it,

269
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,520
but what do I do while you're looking?

270
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,520
You said it yourself--you're not the only one with access to those records,

271
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,820
and you're not the only one who's going to come asking questions.

272
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,220
You tell anyone who asks the same thing you told me this afternoon.

273
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,320
Your alibi checks out.

274
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,430
Unless you say differently,

275
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,660
no one is going to be able to prove you lent that key to alana or anyone else.

276
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,340
Heather,alana didn't make that call.

277
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,400
If you just stick to your story for one more day,this whole thing will be over.

278
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,660
What if I say no?

279
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,450
She comes after me?You?

280
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,150
I don't know,

281
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,000
but I know she's determined to get you back.

282
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,560
It's like she sees you as her one connection to the world,to people,to a normal life.

283
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,890
So,what you're saying is it's like my job to...

284
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,980
keep her,I don't know,human?

285
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,930
It sounds that way,doesn't it?

286
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,110
Look,shawn...

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,380
I'm not trying to tell you what to do,but I do know this--

288
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,730
isabelle's not giving up,not without a fight,

289
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,620
and we've both seen what happens when my daughter decides to fight.

290
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,850
Is everything all right,thomas?

291
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,390
Don't think about it as informing.

292
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,150
You're helping us catch a criminal.

293
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,290
I need you to tell me,

294
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,560
who did you lend heather's office key to?

295
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,580
Sweetie,please.This is important.

296
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,060
Somebody compromised our investigation.

297
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,790
I didn't give the key to anyone.

298
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,380
It was me,thomas.

299
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,180
I called gary navarro.

300
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,410
I don't understand.Are you a member of the nova group?

301
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,530
No,of course not.

302
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,330
Then why?

303
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,320
I trusted you.

304
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,020
I told you what we were doing,and you used it to betray me.

305
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,550
I wasn't betraying you.

306
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,910
I did it for you.

307
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,780
How many times have I heard you say that you felt responsible for what happened to gary navarro?

308
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,580
He came to you for help,

309
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,090
and instead,the government used him and turned him against his own kind.

310
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,010
I don't like what happened to gary,

311
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,720
but he chose to become a terrorist.

312
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,530
He joined nova of his own free will.

313
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,780
Gary wasn't with the nova group anymore.

314
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,290
What?

315
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,690
How would you even know that?

316
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,140
A lot of people at the center know it.

317
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,790
After the nova group had T.J. Kim murdered,

318
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,380
he turned his back on them.

319
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,020
How can you even believe that?

320
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,500
Gary personally tried to murder dennis ryland.

321
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,260
Ryland is responsible for the death of 28 4400s.

322
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,310
28 people that might have changed the world for the better were they allowed to live.

323
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,670
He declared war on us.

324
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,540
I almost died,thomas.

325
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,240
All gary did was fight back.

326
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,500
You should have told me what you were going to do.

327
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,380
I wanted to...

328
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,330
but I couldn'T.

329
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,130
You were bound by your job.

330
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,350
You couldn't give gary another chance,

331
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,070
so I did it for you.

332
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,390
And now you're going to stand trial right alongside him.

333
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,290
You made that phone call from the center.

334
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,740
It's right there on gary's phone records.

335
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,900
They'll figure it out it was you,alana.

336
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,730
So,what,am I supposed to lie for you now?

337
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,940
Am I supposed to become gary's accomplice too now?

338
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm not asking you to do anything,thomas.

339
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,160
You want to turn me in,fine,

340
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,140
but I believe I did the right thing...

341
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,940
and I hoped the man I love would believe it,too.

342
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,770
Nikki,if I did pay off your dad's hospital bill,

343
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,240
and I'm not admitting to anything,

344
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,650
let's just say that it's not that big of a deal,okay?

345
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm glad to do something with my money.

346
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,360
Giving up my social life to work seven days a week at this place has to have its perks,right?

347
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,130
I have a hard time believing that you don't have a social life.

348
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,470
Running this place is a big job,you know?

349
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,120
It kind of cuts you off from the world.

350
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,540
Well,I don't have $60,000,

351
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,260
but if you're feeling isolated,

352
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,410
maybe I can pay you back in another way.

353
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,370
There's a new sushi place that opened in belltown.

354
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,030
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

355
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,330
You like sushi now?

356
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,290
You're not the only one who can change.

357
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,930
Just give me a second.

358
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,080
Hey,shawn.

359
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,890
Have you seen my copy of the republic in here?

360
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,250
No,you know what?I haven't seen it.

361
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,250
Hello again.

362
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,350
I'm isabelle.

363
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,700
N-nikki.

364
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,600
Nice to meet you.

365
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,810
I've heard of you.

366
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,640
Well,let me know if you find my book.

367
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,590
I'm right in the middle of it.

368
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,520
So tomorrow night?

369
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,340
We're going to check out this new sushi place?

370
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,040
yeah.

371
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,630
Oh,my god.

372
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,560
Tom...

373
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,410
I'm so sorry.

374
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,030
Anything I can do to help?

375
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,510
I don't know.

376
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,380
I don't know what i can do.

377
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,040
I can't just turn alana in.

378
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,600
And if we do catch gary,eventually,he's going to give her up,

379
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,110
so either way,her life is ruined.

380
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,520
Well,tom,there's no way you can try and shake this agency off gary's scent.

381
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,810
You'll wind up a felon yourself.

382
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,450
I have to do something,diana.

383
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,540
We're talking about alana.

384
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,130
One way or another,we've been together for more than a decade.We...

385
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,300
I have to protect her.

386
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,560
Once I know she's safe,then I can figure out how we move on.

387
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,320
If we move on.

388
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
You need to keep yourself safe,too.

389
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,460
I think that the best thing that we can do,

390
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,750
the only thing we can do,

391
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,710
is to take ourselves off this case.

392
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,580
And do what?

393
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,740
Cross your fingers.

394
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,470
Hope gary buys himself a one-way ticket to costa rica.

395
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,500
What did you expect to happen?

396
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know.

397
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,030
But it's only for 36 hours,right?

398
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,780
That's all they can hold her for.

399
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,810
Honestly,I'm not sure.

400
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,380
They can hold her for as long as it takes to investigate her alibi.

401
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,520
We're talking about dennis ryland here.

402
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,400
You've told me a dozen times,

403
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,900
he'll do whatever it takes to get information.

404
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,440
He's going to interrogate her,

405
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,140
and I don't know how far it's going to go.

406
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,030
Alana...

407
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,810
I'll call his office in the morning.

408
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,750
I checked out heather's alibi myself.

409
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,050
I'll give them my notes.

410
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,390
It'll all go on the record.

411
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,640
Right now,that's all I can do.

412
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,890
You know...

413
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm always happy to talk to one of the 4400,

414
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,140
but I have to say,

415
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,020
I was surprised to find you waiting outside my office this morning.

416
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,240
You can release heather tobey.

417
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,550
That phone call to gary navarro--

418
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,180
I was the one who made it.

419
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,780
Dennis...

420
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,010
thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

421
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,110
What were you thinking,tom?

422
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,840
To get romantically involved with a 4400...

423
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,660
what alana did was misguided,it was wrong,

424
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,670
but gary wasn't part of the nova group anymore--

425
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,590
are you actually going to stand here and defend gary navarro to me?

426
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,390
The nova group isn't a bridge club.

427
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,680
You don't just leave.

428
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,860
Even if gary tried to,

429
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,940
that doesn't absolve his other crimes,which include attempted murder.

430
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,740
If the doctors had gotten to me 30 seconds later,

431
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,060
I would have been dead.

432
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,340
I know how badly you want him,dennis.

433
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,890
If it was up to me,

434
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,330
gary navarro would never even make it to trial.

435
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,490
Okay,forget about gary.

436
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,350
Can we just...

437
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,650
concentrate on alana?

438
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,030
Well,I'm afraid it's not possible to make that distinction.

439
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,630
They're kind of intertwined,aren't they,tom?

440
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,690
Alana will be prosecuted like any other member of the nova group.

441
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,670
She's not a member of the nova group!

442
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,220
Dennis...

443
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,470
dennis.

444
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,780
We've known each other for 25 years.

445
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,360
You have to help me.

446
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,060
Like you helped me when my back was to the wall?

447
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm not a petty man,tom.

448
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,420
I'll honor our relationship.

449
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,840
Thank you.

450
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,540
I appreciate anything you can do.

451
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll tell nsa you had nothing to do with this.

452
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,060
You may be a dupe,but you're not a traitor.

453
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,410
And as for alana,

454
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,850
her best chance of seeing mercy is to cooperate fully

455
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,330
and help us find gary navarro.

456
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,960
Now you want to catch gary navarro?

457
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,120
Tom,we've already passed the case off to roth and tierney.

458
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,860
We've got to get him before they do.

459
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,950
We've got to get him before ryland does.Before anyone.

460
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,630
Look,ryland wants gary.

461
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,030
It's a personal thing.

462
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,580
If we can get gary first,we can deal with ryland directly.

463
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,830
A straight-up trade.

464
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,010
Gary for alana.

465
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,910
So ryland gets his hands on gary,

466
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,720
and it happens with no official record.

467
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,410
No arrest,none of that sticky due process.

468
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,970
You really think that ryland's going to agree to that?

469
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,300
If we dangle gary in front of him,in a heartbeat.

470
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,140
Look,tom,you saved my daughter's life.

471
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,650
I owe you everything for that,

472
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,910
and I'll do what you want here,but...

473
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,620
this is dangerous,

474
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,290
and it's a lot of trouble to go to for A...

475
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,580
a woman who just betrayed you.

476
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,210
I owe her that much.

477
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,330
More than that.

478
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,690
My son is incarcerated,diana.

479
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,380
Alana's been right there with me all the way through it...

480
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,510
and she doesn't deserve to rot in some secret prison for the rest of her life.

481
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,250
Well...

482
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,340
any idea where we'd start?

483
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,390
Yeah.

484
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,140
Hey,shawn.

485
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,760
Isabelle.

486
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,010
What are you doing in here?

487
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,620
I came by to talk.

488
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,290
I know you're still thinking about us,

489
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,580
but we're still friends,right?

490
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,130
I can still drop by.

491
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,050
Well,isabelle,usually,friends knock.

492
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,730
What's up?

493
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,830
I came to talk to you about nikki.

494
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,600
I know you pretty well.

495
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,940
I don't think she's the right girl for you.

496
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,920
Well,I don't know why you think she's my girl.

497
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,920
You're entitled to your opinion,though,I guess.

498
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,080
I'm just trying to protect you.

499
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,310
I just have this feeling that...

500
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,940
if you guys get together...

501
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,070
it's going to end badly.

502
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,590
Isabelle...

503
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,010
what does that mean?

504
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,270
Are you threatening nikki now?

505
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,060
Of course not.

506
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,080
Why would I threaten nikki?

507
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,250
It's just...I have this feeling that if you two...

508
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,700
hook up...

509
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,200
it's not going to end well.

510
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,520
Not for you.

511
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,570
Especially not for her.

512
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,750
It's always harder on the girl,you know?

513
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,030
Hey.

514
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,130
You doing okay?

515
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,530
More or less.

516
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,840
I want to help you,alana.

517
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,930
I want to get you out of here.

518
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,910
I don't think you can.

519
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,580
I do.

520
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,610
I think there's a way,but I need you to trust me.

521
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,300
remenber theyire listening

522
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,130
I think you should cooperate with dennis ryland.

523
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,020
Tell him whatever he wants to know.

524
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,200
I can't do that,thomas.

525
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,230
That would be a betrayal.

526
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,780
Learn to live with it.

527
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,270
Listen to me--if you don't cooperate,

528
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,500
I don't think you're ever going to get out of here.

529
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,690
I can'T.

530
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,390
Then I can't help you.

531
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,100
Thomas...

532
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,410
I was supposed to take the students on a field trip to the aquarium this afternoon.

533
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,200
I need you to go there and leave them a note.

534
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,010
There's a bulletin board outside the aquarium.

535
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,090
You should put it there,

536
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,400
and it should say,"field trip canceled."

537
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,060
Some of the kids will show up with their parents.

538
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,760
When you see them,give them my apologies.

539
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,740
I'll make sure they understand.

540
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It was a code.

541
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,600
At least,I think it was.

542
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,840
She was telling me how to get ahold of gary.

543
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,250
Well,I don't know,tom.It's already been two hours.

544
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,020
Let's give it another 15 minutes.

545
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,090
Diana...

546
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,020
gary,stop!

547
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,290
Get down!Everybody get down!

548
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,620
Look out! Look out!

549
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,400
Look out! Get down!

550
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,420
Get down!

551
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,420
Look out! Look out!

552
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,620
Get out of the way!

553
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,510
Don't move,gary!

554
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,040
Don't move!

555
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,540
It's over,gary.

556
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,840
Come on. Get up.

557
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,790
So you're going to turn me over to ryland.

558
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,750
You know what he's going to do to me,right?

559
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,730
Ryland is going to interrogate me.

560
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,250
You know all about that.

561
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,040
You've seen that firsthand.

562
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,170
And then he's going to disappear me.

563
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,590
No trial.

564
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,860
No record.

565
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,220
I'm not a mind reader,gary.

566
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,580
Not like you.

567
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,050
I have no idea what ryland's going to do with you.

568
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,000
That's how you're going to get throughthis little hand-off with your conscience intact?

569
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,400
You want to know?

570
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,820
I'm trading you for alana.

571
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,830
She helped you.Now it's your chance to help her.

572
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,250
You owe her that much.

573
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,530
You made your own bed,gary.

574
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,140
Nobody forced you to join nova.

575
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,460
Nobody forced you to kill people.

576
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,230
I was a baseball player!

577
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,270
I was worried about making the major leagues.

578
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,410
That's it.

579
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,830
If I hadn't met you two,

580
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,750
I'd be shagging grounders right now.

581
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,920
Okay,you should go--

582
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,160
if you still want to,that is--

583
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,620
but if you make this deal with ryland,it's forever.

584
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,270
We live with this.

585
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,460
I'll call you after the meet.

586
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,130
You're going to have to move him right away.

587
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,660
7:30 on the nose.

588
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,110
I got to say,I'm impressed.

589
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,360
Big mogul like you,

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,330
figured that you'd keep a girl waiting.

591
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,080
You ready to go?

592
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,740
Nikki,listen,we can't do this.

593
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,380
Do what?

594
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,990
Dinner?

595
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,350
Shawn,it's not a big deal.

596
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,550
That's what people do at night.

597
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,920
You know this is about more than just dinner...

598
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,490
I'm sorry.I don't mean to stand you up.

599
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,600
I just...

600
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,960
I just can't do this right now.

601
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,470
Shawn,I don't get it.

602
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,370
What happened?Did some adviser tell you that I don't fit in with your pr strategy?

603
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,910
No,nothing like that.

604
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,690
It's going to sound like a stupid guy thing...

605
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,920
but me leaving here right now is the best thing I can do for you.

606
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,130
All right,then.

607
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Go.

608
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,910
Bye,nikki.

609
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,690
So,tom,

610
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm guessing that if I don't agree to this...

611
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,240
trade you're proposing...

612
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,500
you're not going to drop navarro off at the nearest police station,are you?

613
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,100
You say no,

614
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,360
and you can forget about getting your hands on gary navarro.

615
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,020
I'll get him a passport,a plane ticket...

616
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,400
he'll be in a third world country by this time tomorrow.

617
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,940
And if I decide to play along?

618
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:53,610
You want to know whether I'll be asking questions about gary navarro after you drive away with him?

619
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,700
No.

620
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,220
I won't be.

621
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,760
It's going to be tricky to make the charges against alana go away.

622
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,550
You can do it,dennis.

623
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,280
I have faith in you.

624
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,980
Let's go.

625
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,150
Listen...

626
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,110
takes this key ring.

627
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,530
The blue key opens a safe deposit box.

628
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,810
There are eight letters inside,

629
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,740
and I'd appreciate it if you'd mail them.

630
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,820
These letters,who are they addressed to?

631
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,140
Eight families.

632
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,070
All over the world.

633
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,140
Your nsa work.

634
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,580
Those are the families of the 4400s that you helped target.

635
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,980
Well,I figured it...

636
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,890
it's time to let them know what happened.

637
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,400
Give them a sense of closure.

638
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,150
Seems like the least I can do.

639
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,430
Seems like the only thing I can do,actually.

640
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,720
You okay?

641
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,810
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,130
It's all right.

643
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,600
I know it wasn't your idea.

644
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,680
Nice working with you again,tom.

645
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,150
Well,that went well.

646
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,980
Tell me,why do I have such a weird feeling in my stomach?

647
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,870
It's not easy to sentence a man to death.

648
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Quiet back there.

649
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
It's all right.

650
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,640
Let him pray.

651
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,210
Look out!

652
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,790
Get out of the car!Get out!

653
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,110
Keep your hands where I can see them!

654
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,120
Up!

655
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,050
Keep your hands where I can see them!

656
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,450
You okay?

657
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,280
Okay.

658
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,920
Tom,you need to think about this.

659
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,460
Tom,you're letting a terrorist walk free.

660
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,970
No,I was a soldier.

661
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,930
You created me.

662
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,220
All I did was switch sides.

663
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,440
Well,guess what--now I'm done fighting.

664
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,840
I'm walking away from the war.

665
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,750
There is no walking away.

666
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,650
You've got numerous federal charges hanging over your head,

667
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,570
including attempted murder.

668
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,080
Murderers walk free all the time,dennis.

669
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,170
Some of them even get cushy jobs at fortune 500 companies.

670
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,970
Very cute,tom.

671
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,410
Have you thought about what this means for your girlfriend?

672
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,190
Making her a fugitive is kind of a funny way of showing your love.

673
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:17,270
I'd rather be on the run than be responsible for handing over a 4400 to you.

674
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,920
Skouris...

675
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,810
you're supposed to be the level-headed one.

676
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,710
Are you really going to throw your career away because your partner is on some personal crusade?

677
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,800
Well,I don't see it that way,dennis,

678
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,020
and if you want to hold on to your job,

679
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,050
you won't say anything about this.

680
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,160
A 4400 you personally signed out of a military detention facility?

681
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,940
A secret trade in a remote location?

682
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,090
It's all kind of messy.

683
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,960
I'm guessing...

684
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,840
this one stays off the books.

685
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,820
Let's go.

686
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,690
Nice working with you again,dennis.

687
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,360
There's two I.D.S in there,

688
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,800
and there's enough cash to last you for a while.

689
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,070
The canadian border's about 30 miles away.

690
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,390
I'd cross as soon as you can.

691
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,680
Ryland will be looking.

692
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,670
Yeah.

693
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,450
You know,it'S...

694
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,180
it's been almost two years since I met you two,

695
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,320
and I remember that you said that you would help me.

696
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,080
Well,it's been a long time coming,

697
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,110
but I guess you finally came through.

698
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,610
Thank you.

699
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,230
I didn't want us to end,thomas,ever...

700
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,890
but especially not here,like this.

701
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,630
It doesn't have to end.

702
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,380
I can come with you.

703
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,510
You can'T.

704
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,410
You need to be here.

705
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,580
You're one of the only good men left in this fight.

706
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,650
I'll find a way to bring you back.

707
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,080
I promise.
