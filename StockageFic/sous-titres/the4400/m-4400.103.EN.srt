1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,187
Previously on "The 4400".

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:08,441
- Listen up, we're DefCon 1.
- A comet cannot change course.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,653
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,739
We're not sure what's happened.

5
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:17,408
Thousands of people have appeared.

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:21,037
A telekinetic salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year-old

7
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,623
and some kind of super-vigilante.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,835
They can't hurt me, no one can.

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:32,340
Those are only the ones we know about.
Unless you can think of anyone else?

10
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:34,634
There's nothing to tell.

11
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:41,349
What's going on between you two?

12
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:44,269
You're my brother.
She's your girlfriend.

13
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,521
It's all good.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,233
Oh... We're not actually a couple.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,446
- So, it's just you and the baby?
- No. It'll be the three of us.

16
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:59,951
- What did you do to Kyle?
- I didn't do anything to him.

17
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:06,583
Then can I go home? With you?

18
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:10,587
I don't like being here alone.
You don't like being alone either.

19
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:15,883
They said draining the fluid might
not be enough, more might build up.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,139
If it does, Kyle could suffer
permanent brain damage.

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,855
The time I lost is gone.

22
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:33,276
I'll never get it back,
but my years in the dark

23
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:36,029
didn't kill me.

24
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,906
And my work remains.

25
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:46,164
And even though I might not
understand what's happening to me,

26
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:49,334
I have faith in the final outcome.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,629
After all, I'm doing
what I was intended to do,

28
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:58,092
becoming what I was meant to be.
I look forward to

29
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,765
corresponding with you again,
I know it's been a long time.

30
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,436
I tell you this as a courtesy -
you can observe my work,

31
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:12,857
but there's no point
in trying to interfere with it.

32
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,818
I'm now in full command of my talents.

33
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,906
I hope the world is ready.

34
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:25,536
Despite protests, Homeland Security
refuses to divulge the names

35
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:29,749
or whereabouts of the 4400
living here in the US.

36
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:34,087
Confirmed reports of unusual abilities
have the public panicked.

37
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:39,842
And yet this man sitting beside me
says we have nothing to worry about.

38
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm sure most of you recognise him

39
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:47,058
even though he's been away
for the past 28 months.

40
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:49,769
I'm talking about Mr Jordan Collier,

41
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,689
who recently breached
the government's wall of silence

42
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:58,736
and chose to out himself
as one of the notorious 4400.

43
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:00,947
Jordan...

44
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,534
Why? Why now? Why here?

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,829
- What's your agenda?
- I have no agenda.

46
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,207
But someone had to put
a human face on the 4400.

47
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:14,752
We've been demonised enough
by people like you.

48
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,381
If you're implying this is a witch-hunt,
I disagree.

49
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,925
You're not the one burnt at the stake.

50
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:25,012
- Breakfast is ready.
- Shouldn't I be saying that to you?

51
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:33,646
Maia!

52
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,274
Thank you very much!

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,070
This beats a can of coke
and a slice of cold pizza.

54
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:46,659
- I'll get better at being the grown-up.
- It's OK.

55
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,245
I like being the grown-up.

56
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:52,498
I think you'll have a good time
with Mrs Benke.

57
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,002
I hear she's a very cool babysitter.

58
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:00,756
I talked to Mr Ryland about permission
to get you enrolled in school.

59
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:05,386
- That would be nice, right?
- Yeah, school might be fun.

60
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:10,391
Diana...
You're not going to like what's in there.

61
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,286
Oliver Knox disappeared
August 22nd 1983,

62
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:33,205
five nights after the last body turned up.

63
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,958
- He moved back when?
- Three weeks ago.

64
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,921
- Nineteen days before the latest body.
- It could be a coincidence.

65
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:45,301
The letter seems genuine but
the latest victim wasn't a prostitute.

66
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,762
- The others were.
- Coincidence.

67
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:51,641
That's the kind of positive thinking
we like to encourage.

68
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:56,270
If it is Knox, we've got
a 4400 serial killer on our hands.

69
00:04:56,437 --> 00:05:00,107
If that's not a worst-case scenario,
it'll do for one.

70
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,277
It's the kind of issue
Barbara Yates lives for.

71
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:08,407
- So we're off to Friday Harbor.
- Bring me back a t-shirt. Alex...

72
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,703
National Threat
Assessment Command, NTAC.

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,456
- You're here about Knox?
- Got it.

74
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,124
It's a small town.

75
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,253
Oliver reappeared after 21 years
and he doesn't look a day older.

76
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,881
We connected the dots.

77
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:27,176
Are you gonna take over
my investigation?

78
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:32,139
We'll be co-operating until we
establish Knox's guilt or innocence.

79
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,769
I could use some fresh air.
And some co-operation.

80
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:40,398
His alibi's airtight.

81
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:44,693
We still want to talk to him.
Anything else you can tell us?

82
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:49,156
You want to know about Knox?

83
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:53,160
When he was 15,
he was bow hunting with his cousin.

84
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:57,790
There was an accident, Knox
ended up with an arrow in his chest.

85
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,000
His cousin panicked and ran.

86
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,921
Knox woke up in a pool of blood,
with an arrow in his chest.

87
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,341
So he pulled it out
and cauterised the wound?

88
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:11,595
Even better. He stood up
and walked four miles into town,

89
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,141
strolled into the emergency room
and checked himself in.

90
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,852
All this with an arrow in his chest.

91
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:20,938
Years later, I asked him
if it happened that way.

92
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:23,524
He said every word was true.

93
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:27,194
I told him, "That must have been
the walk from hell."

94
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:31,282
"Not at all", he said. "It was exhilarating."

95
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:34,034
He felt like he could
have walked forever.

96
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:36,495
That's Oliver Knox.

97
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,676
Mr Knox... Mr Knox.

98
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:48,305
We've a few questions
about the death of Theresa Baron.

99
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,100
Sheriff Conrad call you or you
jumped to the same conclusion?

100
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:56,063
Not a big jump. You were
on the police radar back in '83.

101
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,815
Along with a number of other people.

102
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,986
Did you know Ms Baron?

103
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:06,990
No. She was born after I was abducted.

104
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:13,789
Look, I know how tempting
the math is on this murder.

105
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:16,083
I disappear in '83, the killings stop.

106
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,379
- Here I am, and the poor girl's dead.
- We noticed.

107
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,924
In your shoes,
I'd probably want me to be guilty too.

108
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,802
It would be so convenient, but...

109
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,262
I almost feel bad I can't oblige you.

110
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,557
I did not kill that woman.

111
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,018
Listen, can I get you some water?

112
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:38,855
If we're going to talk
we might as well be civilised.

113
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:43,068
No. We've taken up
enough of your time.

114
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:47,155
Conrad told me about
how you got shot in the chest that day.

115
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:49,866
Jim does love to talk.

116
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,744
You'd like to see the arrow?
I have it inside.

117
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,914
That won't be necessary.

118
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,255
How's Kyle?

119
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,216
We don't know yet.

120
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:14,558
About last night...

121
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,311
- The kiss.
- That.

122
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,732
And other things.

123
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,610
- We have a lot to talk about.
- No, we don't.

124
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,237
Shawn.

125
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,323
You have a gift.

126
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,579
- Nikki. When did you get here?
- How's Kyle?

127
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:39,332
Still in intensive care
but Uncle Tommy says he's stable.

128
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,794
Guess whatever they've been
doing to him worked.

129
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,005
For now, anyway.

130
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:51,720
Listen, I'm starving. You wanna
come with us to the cafeteria?

131
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:58,894
Yeah. I'll bring you a burrito.

132
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,276
Start with something easy.

133
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:10,947
- Tell me about your parents.
- My parents?

134
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:15,994
They used to argue about money a lot.
That was before they split up.

135
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,164
- They divorced?
- Yeah, I was 14.

136
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:21,541
Do you remember
how that made you feel?

137
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,835
Depressed.

138
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:26,713
Angry, maybe.

139
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:31,092
Why don't you tell me
about the rest of your family?

140
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,345
They're gone.

141
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:38,683
Got a few cousins outside of St Louis
who remember me as a...

142
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,311
picture in an old photo album.

143
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:44,064
My husband married another woman.

144
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,608
My brother hates that I'm back.

145
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:53,740
What's the point of this?

146
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:58,036
Look, you wanna help me?

147
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,581
Help me find a job.

148
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,960
Tell me what to say
when they ask me how old I am.

149
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:09,839
Or about my work experience or
how to explain that gap in my resume.

150
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:15,303
Everyone says the world's better,
people don't judge you by your skin.

151
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,684
I'm still being judged. You're asking me
about my relationship with my parents?

152
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:29,567
Let's talk about this hostility
that you're manifesting towards me.

153
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,365
Danny, you wanted to see me?

154
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:37,575
Thanks, Peter.

155
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:41,830
- So this is where you work?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:46,084
- What's up?
- I want to talk to you about something.

157
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,797
- Is it about Shawn?
- How did you know?

158
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:53,049
I'm listening.

159
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:57,804
He had a fight
at school a few weeks ago.

160
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:00,348
He might've killed the guy
but I stepped in.

161
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,809
What did he do to him?

162
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,729
It sounds crazy but...

163
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:10,900
It was like Shawn was draining
the life out of him, somehow.

164
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,695
I'm not the only one who saw it.

165
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,240
What made you decide to tell me now?

166
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,870
Just thought you should know.

167
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:51,941
Beautiful, aren't they?

168
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:56,529
I wonder if that's where we were.

169
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:05,413
- What's everybody doing here?
- What are you doing here?

170
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,667
I don't know. I wanted to see it,
where we came back.

171
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:14,881
I figured it would be a good place
to come and think, to clear my head.

172
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:17,967
Most people come for the conversation.

173
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:21,054
- There's not a lot of that going on.
- Give it time.

174
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:26,643
Around 11 o'clock, this place becomes
one big group therapy session.

175
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:45,954
I'm sorry to interrupt
but I just had to see this myself.

176
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,291
My name's Jordan Collier.

177
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,836
Some of you may recognise me.

178
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:58,591
If you do, you know I'm one of the 4400,
just like you.

179
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:03,471
I'm impressed that
you've found each other.

180
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:07,517
And I'm glad that you've come
in support of each other.

181
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,435
And...

182
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,064
I'm cold!

183
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:16,985
And I have to guess
that you guys are cold too.

184
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:20,655
I suggest that we continue
these get-togethers indoors.

185
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:26,035
I have a place nearby.
It's warm, it's spacious.

186
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:31,582
I want to invite all of you to meet me
there next Thursday afternoon.

187
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:37,005
You listen to the news,
you read the paper, you hear the talk.

188
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:42,176
It seems like the entire world
is turning against us.

189
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:45,138
Well, what are we going to do about it?

190
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,266
Are we gonna give up?
Run and hide? Maybe.

191
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:56,441
Or maybe, just maybe,
we build a world of our own.

192
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:02,572
This is the spot where
we found Theresa Baron's body.

193
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,164
- We went over everything pretty good.
- Yeah, well...

194
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,917
We have the toys.
We like to take them out of the box.

195
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:17,628
The killer posed her
after she was dead?

196
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,882
There should have been
blood hand-prints all over.

197
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,427
It rained that day.
The scene was washed clean.

198
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:28,264
But if he dragged her over here,
he had to grab onto something.

199
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,273
Tom.

200
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,905
I'll be damned.

201
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,583
His name is Philip Lopez.
He did 18 years for rape.

202
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,211
He was paroled six months ago.

203
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:02,173
His prints were found at the scene
of Theresa Baron's murder.

204
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,177
Everyone set?

205
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:07,338
Go.

206
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:09,841
Lopez!

207
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,310
Tom.

208
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,963
The suicide note says
he killed all nine women.

209
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,007
Only his time away
kept him from doing more.

210
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:44,218
The dates makes sense?

211
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:48,889
Lopez worked as seasonal
labour during the first round of killings.

212
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:53,811
I guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology.

213
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:26,802
Excuse me, can I get
a cranberry juice and Seltzer?

214
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:30,514
And... give me another
of what he's having.

215
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:38,731
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I...

216
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:43,110
I go to Florence in four days
and I didn't want to seem like a tourist.

217
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:45,571
- Ice?
- A little.

218
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:49,533
- I studied Italian in college.
- Really?

219
00:17:56,457 --> 00:18:01,003
"Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo."

220
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,425
- That is very good. You get an A Plus.
- And you get a free round.

221
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:09,428
- Felicia. Can I get a beer?
- Grazie.

222
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,434
Need a refill, friend?

223
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:19,271
- Thanks.
- Listen, I...

224
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:22,608
We don't know each other
but I've something to show you.

225
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,118
- So, what's her name?
- I don't know.

226
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:37,539
But... I can tell you something about her.

227
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,364
Hello?

228
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,699
So sorry I'm late!

229
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,952
Hey, Iris, how did we do today?

230
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:18,163
- I can't come back here.
- What? Why?

231
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,415
That child. I'm sorry.

232
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:23,168
You'll find someone.

233
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:34,721
I told her we wouldn't be seeing
each other for a couple of weeks.

234
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,766
Why did you tell her that?

235
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,686
Because she was
gonna be called for jury duty.

236
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,146
She thought I was kidding.

237
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:47,234
A few hours later, her husband called.

238
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:50,487
And she got a summons for jury duty?

239
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:56,577
Well, hey, come here.

240
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:58,912
It's OK, all right? It's OK.

241
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:10,966
- What are you doing here so late?
- My mom said he was getting worse.

242
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,556
The fluid's building inside his skull again.

243
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:21,852
Why did they take me
and leave him like this?

244
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,314
We were both on the beach that night,
I don't understand.

245
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,192
I wish I could remember something
'cause I keep thinking,

246
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,403
I think it would help.

247
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,448
Tom said you were here
the night Kyle had that...

248
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:37,909
jump in his brain activity.

249
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,203
He was getting better.

250
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,123
And now he's dying.

251
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,128
Shawn, did you do something to him?

252
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:01,725
Shawn, tell me. Just talk to me.

253
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,810
You know I didn't do anything.

254
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:07,397
I told Uncle Tommy. I told you, OK?

255
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:09,941
I gotta go.

256
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,703
I wish we could talk to a doctor.

257
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,789
And say what?

258
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:28,251
"My baby may be an alien and,
by the way, I know what it's thinking"?

259
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,797
That will just get me thrown
right back in to quarantine.

260
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,424
I was there today
to register our address.

261
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:36,968
Thanks,
I can't stand going back there.

262
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:39,429
I ran into Gary Branscombe.

263
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:47,020
He had the bed next to mine. He told me
about Jordan Collier's get-togethers.

264
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:52,234
- He's the hotel guy?
- Yeah, turns out he's one of us.

265
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,861
We should go.

266
00:21:56,988 --> 00:22:01,243
Richard, come on! You can't tell me
teenagers didn't make out in 1951.

267
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:05,580
- Yeah, in a parked car by the lake.
- Oh, in a parked car by the lake?

268
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:07,874
That's very cute.

269
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:19,970
Let me tell you somethin' about her...

270
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:23,723
Let me tell you somethin'...
I can tell you somethin'...

271
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,017
Let me tell you somethin'...

272
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:28,353
Let me tell you somethin'...

273
00:22:43,577 --> 00:22:45,787
Are you crazy?

274
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,331
Get outta the road!

275
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:57,090
I killed them. I killed them all.

276
00:22:57,257 --> 00:23:00,969
- I killed them all.
- Hands up! Keep your hands up!

277
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,420
Gail Keating.
She worked at a video store.

278
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,339
They found her body
in the park this morning.

279
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:13,634
Her blood was all over him.

280
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,637
He spoke for five minutes
when we brought him in.

281
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:20,349
Confessed to Gail's death
and the other nine murders.

282
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:23,227
- Not a word since.
- Lopez killed Theresa Baron.

283
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:27,064
He said so in his suicide note,
her shirt was in his apartment...

284
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:30,735
This morning, Charlie Staley
confessed to the same murder.

285
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:33,988
They both claim to be
behind the original killings?

286
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:39,577
Yeah. Only Charlie's 39. He was five
years old when the first death happened.

287
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,955
We can eliminate Lopez
as a suspect as well.

288
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,209
- How d'you figure that?
- Lopez's prison records.

289
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,378
He was left-handed.
The autopsy reports show

290
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:52,173
the Friday Harbor killer
was right-handed.

291
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,842
So Lopez kills one girl,
Staley kills the other,

292
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,012
and neither one
committed the original crimes.

293
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:03,309
Why would they confess to murders
they couldn't possibly have committed?

294
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:10,942
- The pieces don't quite fit together.
- Until you add Knox into the puzzle.

295
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:15,529
He disappears, the killings stop.
He came back, they started again.

296
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:18,032
Let's say Knox is involved somehow.

297
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:22,745
That means what? He's forcing
these men to do his murders for him?

298
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:26,457
Could be. The question is, how?

299
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,669
Why have more than one person
admit the crimes?

300
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,713
One, we'd stop digging.
Two gets our attention.

301
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,386
Maybe he can't control everything.
What if Knox can force people to kill?

302
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:43,182
But only by convincing them
they really are the Friday Harbor killers?

303
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,726
In for one murder, in for them all.

304
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,733
Good!

305
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,777
Hi, welcome.

306
00:24:55,861 --> 00:25:00,908
1969, huh? The good news is,
your bell-bottoms are back in style.

307
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:04,787
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

308
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:10,292
There's this guy I was just
talking to, he was gone for 40 years.

309
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:13,254
He picked everything up
without missing a beat.

310
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:17,007
Then there's me,
I'm gone for three years.

311
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:22,096
- And it's like my life's fallen apart...
- I know, Shawn.

312
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:25,725
Remember that most of us
feel the same way you do.

313
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:30,020
Some of us are more different
than others, if you know what I mean.

314
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:31,731
I'm not sure I do.

315
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:37,528
OK. I had this fight with a guy at school,
I know it's gonna sound crazy...

316
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,906
I really can't hear the specifics right now.

317
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:45,578
Not yet, anyway. I've a lot of interviews
over the next few weeks.

318
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,956
I have to be able to deny what I need to.

319
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,044
I know you're feeling confused,
and I can't blame you.

320
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:57,047
But it sounds to me
like you've been given a gift.

321
00:25:57,214 --> 00:26:00,009
That's what Nikki called it.

322
00:26:00,176 --> 00:26:03,220
Well, Nikki's right, whoever she is.

323
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,598
And this gift, don't let it scare you.

324
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:09,226
- You will find the right way to use it.
- OK.

325
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:14,315
What can I do for you this afternoon,

326
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:16,734
Lily '93?

327
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,612
Don't worry, it's not a line.

328
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:24,366
Though you're the most attractive
abductee I've met all afternoon.

329
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:29,079
- Jordan Collier. I'm throwing this party.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

330
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:32,333
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

331
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,003
Do I detect a little romance
brewing among the 4400?

332
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,214
You have a good eye.

333
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,800
I'm happy you're getting
something positive out of all this.

334
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:46,597
- You're Jordan Collier.
- Yes. See? He's not afraid of me.

335
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:50,684
I'm a little light-headed. It's hot.

336
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:54,146
I should sit down.

337
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,191
- Why don't I find you a seat?
- I'll get some water.

338
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,901
Thank you.

339
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:03,405
Thank you.

340
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,699
Do you want me to call a doctor?

341
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:08,577
No, I'm not sick. It'll pass.

342
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,996
- Here you go.
- That's good.

343
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:16,252
- If you're not sick, then what's...?
- It's just morning sickness.

344
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:22,424
- You're pregnant.
- First trimester.

345
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:28,222
Well, that explains it.
Congratulations to both of you.

346
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,892
Did I say something wrong?

347
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,272
- It's a little more complicated...
- Richard's not the father.

348
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:42,319
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted
but I was when I got back.

349
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:45,489
Strange, huh?

350
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:48,575
Interesting, is more like it.

351
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:51,328
It makes you wonder
what they had in mind.

352
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,414
Whoever took us, I mean.

353
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,875
You haven't told your counsellor
about this, have you?

354
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:01,130
- We haven't told anyone.
- I'd keep it that way for now.

355
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:06,844
Look, how are you guys managing?
Have everything you need?

356
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,680
Everything except a job.

357
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:13,267
I was a pilot in the air force,
supposed to be drawing a pension.

358
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,477
That hasn't come through yet.

359
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:20,315
I've applied for flight instructor jobs,
even for Seattle PD.

360
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:23,777
Every time they find out
I'm one of the 4400,

361
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:26,321
the job suddenly goes away.

362
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,199
Look. I may have something
you'd be interested in.

363
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:35,414
It doesn't involve flying but given
your background in the military...

364
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,584
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.

365
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:42,254
- Foundation?
- For the 4400.

366
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,799
If you're interested,
come by tomorrow and see me.

367
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,343
- I'll be there.
- Good.

368
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,346
The rash of violence
involving the 4400 continues.

369
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:55,809
Sources tell us Homeland Security is
investigating a possible connection

370
00:28:55,976 --> 00:29:00,606
between the Friday Harbor murders
and an undisclosed returnee.

371
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:05,944
That hypocritical, self-righteous,
irresponsible bitch...

372
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:12,284
- I take it he doesn't like her show.
- He doesn't like her.

373
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,954
When we were with the FBI,
she disclosed the name of a juror.

374
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,666
Judge declared a mistrial,
three years of work down the drain.

375
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:24,046
She blindsided me once.
That is not going to happen again.

376
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,091
Tom Baldwin.

377
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:30,177
Yes, Sheriff.

378
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,057
I see.

379
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:38,101
We'll be there. That was Conrad.

380
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:40,312
He got another letter.

381
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,190
"I decide who lives and who dies.

382
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:46,568
"My judgement is final
and more verdicts are coming."

383
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,613
The date's clipped
from this morning's paper.

384
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,700
Couldn't have been composed
by Charlie Staley. Not from jail.

385
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,370
This letter's
from the Friday Harbor killer?

386
00:29:56,537 --> 00:30:00,332
It's genuine. It describes
wound patterns on the original victims.

387
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,834
We kept that private.

388
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:07,673
If you believe Knox is involved,
why's he out there walking around?

389
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,634
- Let's pick him up, right now.
- We can't.

390
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:14,805
We need to know exactly how he's
linked to these murders to bring him in.

391
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:19,059
So what do we do?
Wait for another girl to turn up dead?

392
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:21,270
We can do better than that.

393
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,073
- $27.75, your change.
- Thank you.

394
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:38,161
- What's this?
- Let me tell you something about her.

395
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:43,333
Her name's Felicia.
She works over at the bar...

396
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,096
I expected a scolding on the phone.

397
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,392
Maybe a tax audit. Not an invitation
into the belly of the beast.

398
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,311
Consider it a tribute to your bully pulpit.

399
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,522
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be.

400
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,441
DC is calling for your head.

401
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,902
I want you to dial back on the 4400.

402
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,739
Not gonna happen. I'm a journalist,
I answer to my viewers.

403
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:12,203
Don't hide behind freedom of the press.
You shout "Fire!" in a crowded theatre.

404
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,915
And you're gonna stop
before the stampede begins.

405
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:21,588
Yeah, you have a really strong face.
Seriously, you should come on my show.

406
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,923
You're getting in the way of my job.

407
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,637
If you continue to interfere with
Homeland Security, tread lightly.

408
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,515
And what are you gonna do?
Disappear me?

409
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:37,270
- I asked for your cooperation.
- I've chosen not to give it.

410
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:43,318
Fair enough. Don't forget to get
your parking validated on the way out.

411
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,198
This healthcare plan is incredible.

412
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,827
The cover should provide
for all your doctor's visits

413
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,705
and hospital care once the baby's born.

414
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,959
- Mr Collier, I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll take the job?

415
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,675
I'm sorry, I have to take this...
Len?

416
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,013
Good, good.
The whole property?

417
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,223
Excellent. 26 million.

418
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,102
Yes, I want you to close.

419
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,356
Don't worry about the board of directors.

420
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:26,235
They voted me back in as CEO
when I returned. I'll handle them.

421
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,905
Call me when it's done. OK.

422
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,659
Real estate deals.
They're never over till they're over.

423
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,912
So, are you going to come
to work for me or not?

424
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,459
I can start tomorrow.

425
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,760
Mr Ryland, Phil Gibson.
This is an honour.

426
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,679
Barbara will be very disappointed
not to be here.

427
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,766
- Actually, I prefer to speak to you.
- Great.

428
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,728
First, just let me say, sir,
any information you give us

429
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,648
about the 4400
will never be traced back to you.

430
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,235
Glad to hear that.
I've something important to pass on.

431
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,904
- Mind if I tape this?
- Quick and simple.

432
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,825
I want Barbara Yates's
coverage of the 4400 to stop.

433
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,452
- What do you mean?
- I mean it ends.

434
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,414
She stops covering the story, period.

435
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,711
Listen, Mr Ryland, Barbara has sole
authority over her editorial content.

436
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,549
Barbara says what Barbara wants.
There's nothing I can do about it.

437
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,844
You're her producer. Produce.

438
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,306
You don't know what it's like
in this business these days.

439
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,644
- We're not Walter Cronkite.
- You want to talk about the old days?

440
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,483
In the old days, I would need
a warrant to tap all your phones,

441
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,528
to freeze all your assets,

442
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:56,492
and to prevent you from ever being
a passenger on any airline in the world.

443
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,829
Like you say,
it's not the old days any more.

444
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,291
You've worked for Barbara Yates
since the beginning.

445
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:06,335
I'm guessing you know
where the bodies are buried.

446
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,548
Draw me a map.

447
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:25,104
My Dad will kick your ass
if I come home smelling of beer.

448
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,652
Evil cousin Shawn,
corruptor of the innocent.

449
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,583
Help! Help me, Shawn!

450
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,933
Oh, my God!

451
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,443
Excuse me.

452
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,738
I lost my dog.
Can you help me find him?

453
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,659
- I haven't seen him.
- A wire-haired terrier named Boss.

454
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:22,662
I haven't seen him.
Would you let me by?

455
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,498
This isn't funny.

456
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,209
- I'll scream.
- Yes, you will.

457
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,212
Don't move!

458
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,092
Felicia has to die! She has to!

459
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:47,436
This man. What did he say to you,
Mr Mitchell?

460
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,857
- You've been following me?
- No. Actually, we were following Knox.

461
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:56,278
I really like the composition of this shot,
its nice, cosy symmetry.

462
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,783
Now, what did he say to you?

463
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,544
You keep at him. We'll bring in Knox,
sit him next to his friend.

464
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,213
See what they
have to say to each other.

465
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:26,684
- Knox! Open up!
- Tom!

466
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:37,027
Knox!

467
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:35,725
- Are the police at the girl's house?
- She refused an escort.

468
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:47,361
Hello.

469
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,573
Hello?

470
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,661
Excuse me. I lost my dog.

471
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:58,914
Can you help me find him?
A wire-haired terrier named Boss.

472
00:38:17,808 --> 00:38:20,686
Somebody help me!

473
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:25,566
Let her go, Knox!

474
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:28,861
Knox! Get away from her or I'll shoot.

475
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,961
- I think you broke my nose.
- Stay down!

476
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:50,883
- You got me wrong. Let me tell you...
- Not a word, not a word.

477
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,306
Goddamn serial killer. This guy murders
eight people before he's abducted.

478
00:38:57,473 --> 00:39:00,142
They send him back,
he picks up where he left off.

479
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:03,396
In '83, Knox was
your garden variety psychopath.

480
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:06,190
They sent him back enhanced.
Big difference.

481
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:08,901
It makes whoever took him
sound pretty nasty.

482
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:11,612
They also sent back Shawn. And Maia.

483
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:16,367
I know. For that, I'd like to thank them.
But it all seems so random.

484
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:20,246
Maybe. Until you start
to look at the bigger picture.

485
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:24,583
Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington.
Revenge murder. Open and shut.

486
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,796
Carl Morrissey's a well-intentioned
vigilante who ends up dead.

487
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:30,381
Random.

488
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:35,594
But we know Kensington's company
was perpetrating a massive fraud.

489
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,430
We've learned that
since Morrissey's death,

490
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:41,976
his neighbours formed
a committee protecting the park.

491
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:44,895
Anyone starting to see a pattern?

492
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:48,440
What? You're talking about
some kind of ripple effect?

493
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:50,568
Diana to the head of the class.

494
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:54,572
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.

495
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,533
- Positive change in these two cases.
- Wait a minute.

496
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,662
Whoever sent them back planned
for these changes to take place?

497
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:04,248
Nothing positive in the Knox killing.

498
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:08,377
Or maybe we haven't
seen the ripples yet.

499
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,219
Excuse me.

500
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:21,390
Hey... I have something I wanna tell you.

501
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:33,068
Hey...
I have something I wanna tell you!

502
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:54,548
Police won't say who released
this closely-guarded secret.

503
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:57,426
A document containing the names
and addresses

504
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,721
of all the 4400
has appeared on the internet

505
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:03,766
and is now posted
on more than 20 sites.

506
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:07,728
Authorities won't confirm the leak
but efforts to shut down the sites,

507
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:11,565
with an emergency injunction,
suggest the list is genuine.

508
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:15,736
We'll have more on this breaking story
as it develops.

509
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:31,377
What are you doing here, Shawn?

510
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,302
Kyle?

511
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:46,100
How long...

512
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:50,979
...have I been in the dark?
