1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,380
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,350
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,970
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,650
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,590
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>We're not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>

9
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,033
The world
will have to deal with us.

10
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,933
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

11
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,067
okay, we're clear, right?

12
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,966
It's over
between the two of us.

13
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,734
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice,

14
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:57,334
and i'm afraid if i lose you
i'm going to make the wrong one.

15
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,701
Welcome to haspelcorp.
How may i help you?

16
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,067
Hi.

17
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,866
I have an appointment
with dennis ryland.

18
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,600
Learning anything new?

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Yeah.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,767
She's incredible.

21
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,267
In a week,
we've made discoveries

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,367
we thought
it would take years

23
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,100
to get to.

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,534
Isabelle, i don't love you.

25
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,767
Shawn, you and i are

26
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,767
the two most powerful people
on the planet.

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,200
We have to get married.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,667
[Richard]:
I knew she was different.

29
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,600
Dangerous.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
[Gasps]

31
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,400
You can't kill me, shawn.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,966
Richard, if i believed

33
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,634
that staying with isabelle
would save all those lives,

34
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:28,900
i would marry her tomorrow,

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,966
but what happens
if she gets tired of me,

36
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,634
or i make her angry?

37
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,467
There are things
i was sent here to do.

38
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:35,600
Brutal things.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,801
[Shawn]: I don't know
how you can know that,

40
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:37,567
but it doesn't
have to happen that way.

41
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,300
We need to be together,

42
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,567
because i think

43
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,767
you're the only one
who can stop me.

46
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,267
Looking for a date?

47
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,966
Not you.

48
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,634
Him.

49
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,933
[Sighs]

50
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,534
Tim.

51
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,267
You've got a customer.

52
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,267
[Engine turns over]

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,233
So it's 40 bucks,

54
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,500
if you want
to get started.

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,933
I just want
to look at you

56
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,267
for a second.

57
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,500
Do you have any idea
how special you are?

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,233
You don't, do you?

59
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,933
Look, we can talk
if you want to,

60
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,701
but it's still 40 bucks.

61
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:01,600
Timothy winters mccarren.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
You're going to
change the world.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,033
How'd you know my name?

64
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,667
It's true.

65
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,000
You're going to
change everything...

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,033
unless i stop you.

67
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,367
That's it. I'm out of here.

68
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:13,534
[Rattles door handle]

69
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,267
Come on, man. Let me out.

70
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:16,367
I'm serious.

71
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,833
[Screams]

72
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,133
[Screaming]

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
[Man]:
I rolled that myself.

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,866
It's my way
of saying thank you

75
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,400
for inviting me
to your wedding.

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,667
Well, thank you,
but you didn't have to.

77
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,100
Isabelle and i
invited every 4400.

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,033
I wouldn't have missed it.

79
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,966
I'm quite excited.

80
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,767
You must be, too.

81
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,801
The ceremony's so close.

82
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,367
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,033
Four days.

84
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,966
I have to offer you
a word of caution.

85
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,500
The cigar...

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,334
when you smoke it,

87
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,467
you might be surprised
by its effects.

88
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,033
Oh, i'm not going to
get arrested

89
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,233
for having this,
am i?

90
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,701
[Chuckling]:
Of course not.

91
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,334
About a year
after we returned,

92
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,300
i learned i have an ability.

93
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,133
When i come in contact
with a person,

94
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,400
they sometimes see a vision
of their future.

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
I see nothing,
understand...

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,334
only those i touch...

97
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,000
but i'm told
it can be quite accurate.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,767
That's a nice talent.

99
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,267
Thank you.

100
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,334
I grew this tobacco
myself.

101
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:26,434
It's been in contact
with my hands,

102
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:30,100
and so it contains my ability.

103
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,334
Wait, so,
what you're saying is

104
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,200
if i smoke this cigar,

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
i'm going to
see the future?

106
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,866
Your future.

107
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,866
A possible one,
anyway.

108
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,467
As i said,
use with caution.

109
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,434
You might not like
what you see,

110
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,801
but it seems
an appropriate gift

111
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,233
for a man
on his wedding day.

112
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,233
Well, it is better
than a toaster oven.

113
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,600
Thank you, claudio.

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,233
My congratulations
to you.

115
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,000
The centerpieces
are amazing.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
You should take a look.

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,133
Uh, yeah, sure,

118
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,300
after we're done

119
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,866
with these meet-and-greets,
though, okay?

120
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,367
Mm-hmm.

121
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, you taking up smoking?

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,534
[Door opens]

123
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:15,500
This is edwin garrett
and his wife, denise.

124
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,634
They came all the way
from edinburgh

125
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,033
to be here.

126
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,833
Thank you so much
for coming.

127
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,833
The guy's name
was tim mccarren.

128
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,100
He was a hustler.

129
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,467
Worked an area of the park

130
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:30,734
not far from here.

131
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,767
I found his body
just after sunrise.

132
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,033
Now, i've already
interviewed

133
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,267
his colleagues,

134
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,833
and they say he got
into a pickup truck

135
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,000
with a man in his 20s
at about 1:30 last night.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
One of the other
working boys

137
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,534
got a real decent look
at the driver.

138
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:42,701
So you could probably
sit him down

139
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,900
with a sketch artist.

140
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Probably could,
but you do realize

141
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,133
we're not homicide cops,
right?

142
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,400
We're from ntac.

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,367
So why'd you call us?

144
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:57,833
That's why.

145
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,801

[***]

155
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,366
My best guess?

156
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,566
His body
was completely oxidized.

157
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,666
It's a chemical reaction.

158
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,133
Cells change
at the molecular level.

159
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,332
Oxidizing?

160
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,800
That's what happens
when metal rusts.

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,100
Exactly.

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,433
Well, almost exactly.

163
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,933
Rusting is
a slow process.

164
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,199
There's nothing gradual

165
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,633
about what happened
to tim mccarren.

166
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:25,067
One minute he was alive,
the next...

167
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,800
have you ever seen
anything like this before?

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,933
No.

169
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,933
There's no
documented disease

170
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,133
that affects
the human body this way.

171
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,266
Meaning a 4400 ability did this.

172
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,666
That's for you to figure out.

173
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,100
All i can tell you

174
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,766
is there's no...
earthly explanation

175
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,399
about what happened
to this guy.

176
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,266
Thanks.

177
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,266
So nothing
even close?

178
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,700
Okay.
Thanks, brian.

179
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,833
That was the lab.

180
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,299
They ran
the composite sketch

181
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,466
of the driver

182
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,733
against our database
of 4400s.

183
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:56,900
No matches.

184
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,966
Anything
from forensics?

185
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,232
No.

186
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:00,499
They pulled a couple
of partial prints

187
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,666
off the safety pin

188
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,133
that held the note
to the kid's jacket,

189
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,299
but nothing we can
make an i.d. From.

190
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,800
Okay, what about the note?

191
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,299
It's a deliberate message
to whoever found the body.

192
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,366
That's typical

193
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:09,433
of a serial killer
pathology.

194
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,700
Yeah,
but it says "27."

195
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,866
There can't be
26 other corpses

196
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,133
like tim mccarren's
out there.

197
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,299
Even one would make it
onto our radar.

198
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,533
So we'll talk
to mccarren's friends,

199
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,866
families...

200
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,000
maybe he's got
a connection to a 4400.

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Diana...

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,067
there is
one other thing

203
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,100
i want to
talk to you about.

204
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,933
You got plans on sunday?

205
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,666
Y-you want me to go
to shawn's wedding...

206
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,833
with you?

207
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,433
It's not a date, okay?

208
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,900
I figured you might be
interested.

209
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,466
Almost a thousand 4400s
are coming.

210
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,399
Oh, so it's
a professional courtesy.

211
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,633
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

212
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,533
Look, to be honest,

213
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,900
i'd rather not be the only one
sitting at the ntac table.

214
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,000
You'd have a hard time
finding a dance partner.

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,167
Look, you know,

216
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,133
maia begged me to go,
and i told her no.

217
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,800
All those 4400s in one place...

218
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
we have no idea
what could happen.

219
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,399
Diana, it's shawn and isabelle.

220
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,000
Nobody's going to cause
any trouble.

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I mean, would you want to be
on the bride's bad side?

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,199
I can't imagine you're eager

223
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,366
to welcome that girl
into the family.

224
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,599
I'm not...

225
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,566
this all happened
a little too quickly

226
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:03,833
for my liking...

227
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,466
but shawn won't talk to me
about it.

228
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,067
I must have left him
20 messages.

229
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:10,133
I was thinking
about going to see him

230
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,666
after we finish work today.

231
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,933
Just make sure
bridezilla is out of earshot.

232
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,900
I have to.

233
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,533
"Have to"?

234
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,100
You're about to
get married, shawn.

235
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,299
You should want to.

236
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,100
What's going on?

237
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,033
is she...

238
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,133
is she pregnant?

239
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,633
No, no,
nothing like that.

240
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,766
Is she forcing you?

241
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:28,933
Look, shawn,

242
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,199
if you're
feeling trapped,

243
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,232
if you're looking
for a way out of this,

244
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,232
just tell me.

245
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,566
I can help.

246
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:34,733
"Help"?

247
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,167
I'm not in front
of a firing squad.

248
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,332
I'm getting married.

249
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,399
People do it all the time.

250
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,399
Come on, shawn.

251
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,399
You're marrying isabelle.

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,566
She's a very dangerous girl.

253
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,800
I happen to know that.

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,299
Okay, i know all about her, too,

255
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:46,266
so don't think
you're going to surprise me.

256
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,499
I appreciate
you coming down here,

257
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,800
i know you mean well,

258
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,866
but this marriage,
it is the right thing.

259
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,366
The right thing for who?

260
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,033
For everybody.

261
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,700
They just cannot
keep anything working

262
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,332
around here.

263
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:07,833
This always happens
when i work late.

264
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,266
You know,
i don't even know

265
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,133
where the stairs are
in this place.

266
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,466
Right down here.

267
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,067
Come on. I'll show you.

268
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,067
So, do you always
work past 8:00?

269
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,533
Most nights, yeah.

270
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,800
Trying to get ahead,
you know?

271
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,866
Dedication.

272
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,366
I like that.

273
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,533
You could accomplish
great things.

274
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,167
Her name
was paula nakata.

275
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,900
She was a lawyer
at a firm in the building.

276
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,399
My god.

277
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,466
The poor woman.

278
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,266
That's two bodies
in less than 24 hours.

279
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:39,599
It doesn't
make any sense.

280
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,633
Most spree killers,
they have a type,

281
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,133
but tim mccarren
and paula nakata

282
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,766
could hardly be more different.

283
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,167
A prostitute
and a corporate attorney.

284
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,800
Why would someone
target these two?

285
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,933
And why is she labeled "11"?

286
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,000
The numbers on the bodies
are working backwards.

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,199
It looks like we might have
a partial print

288
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,299
on the wedding band.

289
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,499
It's probably from the victim,
but you never know.

290
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,700
Let's hope
whoever did this

291
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,933
slipped up,

292
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,499
because i don't think
he's anywhere close

293
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,332
to finished yet.

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,100
We were so close.

295
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,666
We were going to
save everything.

296
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,566
Isabelle changed you.

297
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,033
You don't even...

298
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,167
know who you are anymore.

299
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,332
She didn't change me.

300
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:19,833
She showed me who i am.

301
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,033
I know myself
better than ever,

302
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,433
and i know exactly
what has to happen here.

303
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,433
Don't do this.

304
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,033
[Gasps]

305
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,067
[Rasping]: Shawn...

306
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:43,067
[coughs]

307
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,299
Marco?

308
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,199
Did you go home
last night?

309
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,067
Uh... no.

310
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,633
Uh, i was working
on your case.

311
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,299
It got late.

312
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,633
Cold.

313
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:06,633
We had a message

314
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,800
you wanted
to talk to us.

315
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Uh, yeah.

316
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,266
The print that they pulled

317
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:11,900
from paula nakata's
wedding band

318
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,599
wasn't hers.

319
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,067
Does it match the one
we found on tim mccarren's body?

320
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,232
It does indeed.

321
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:17,766
The print belongs

322
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,833
to a man named
darren piersahl.

323
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,199
Piersahl?

324
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,533
I never heard of him.

325
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm not surprised.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,133
See...

327
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,033
he is not a 4400.

328
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,299
Well, then he's not
the murderer.

329
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,033
Marco, you saw both bodies.

330
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,466
A 4400 killed these people.

331
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:35,199
It certainly looks that way,

332
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,433
but the fingerprint match

333
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,599
wasn't from
our database.

334
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,133
It was from
u.s. Military records.

335
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,133
Piersahl was
an army ranger

336
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,133
for seven years.

337
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,133
"Was"?

338
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,100
What's he doing now?

339
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,033
Not much.

340
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,866
According
to army records,

341
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,766
darren piersahl is dead.

342
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,433
He was killed in action
in iraq in 2005.

343
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,332
I'm wondering...

344
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,100
how could
an army sergeant

345
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,332
who's supposedly
been dead for a year

346
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,133
be using a 4400 ability

347
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,750
darren always wanted to be
a ranger.

348
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
It was his dream,

349
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,184
ever since he was old enough
to read.

350
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:16,349
I encouraged it.

351
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,683
I spent 20 years
in the service myself,

352
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,316
so when darren signed up,

353
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,783
it was like carrying on
the family legacy.

354
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,084
Why is ntac
so interested

355
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,783
in my son's death,
anyway?

356
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,817
It's part of an ongoing
investigation, mr. Piersahl.

357
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:31,950
Please,
anything you could tell us

358
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,950
would help.

359
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,717
Not long before he died,

360
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,817
i got a letter from darren.

361
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,650
He was excited.

362
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,550
Said he'd been accepted
into this elite training unit.

363
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,650
He couldn't tell me
much about it,

364
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,184
just that it meant
he was being transferred

365
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,383
off the front lines

366
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,850
and out of harm's way.

367
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,150
And he was
killed in action

368
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,249
soon after that?

369
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:53,917
Two weeks later.

370
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,683
The army told me

371
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,249
he'd been flying
a recon mission

372
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:00,316
in an oh-58 helicopter.

373
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,717
It got hit with an rpg.

374
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:05,216
They never did
find his remains.

375
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,650
I'm so sorry,
mr. Piersahl...

376
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,383
but you said
the army "told you"

377
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,249
he was flying a recon mission.

378
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:12,817
Did you have any reason
to doubt that?

379
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,383
Well, i thought the timing
was peculiar.

380
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:15,817
I mean,
i just got this letter from him

381
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,283
saying he was done fighting,

382
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,084
so i did some checking.

383
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,750
There were six soldiers

384
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,483
reported dead
in the crash that killed my son.

385
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:25,017
And why is that unusual?

386
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,516
Because an oh-58 flies
with a crew of four.

387
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,750
It can't hold six people.

388
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,583

389
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,450
A death under suspicious
circumstances?

390

There's something off here.

391

Even the kid's dad
knows it.

It's weird...
i'm not denying it...

our time with this, okay?

There are explanations

a cover-up.

396
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:45,483

My brother and i haven't always

what all these corpses
have in common.

484
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,717
All the victims
had the same mutation?

485
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,316
We did a genetic workup
on all three corpses.

486
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:41,216
Every one of them
has a slight alteration

487
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,717
of the 11th chromosome.

488
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,249
It's called
the starzl mutation.

489
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,416
That could be a coincidence.

490
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,616
Not likely.

The starzl mutation
is extremely rare.

492
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,150
The only documented cases
are in the seattle area.

493
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,550
See, there's two kinds
of mutations.

494
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,516
Some occur naturally.

495
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:56,650
You know, something goes wrong

00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,184
when the body
is building itself.

497
00:18:58,184 --> 00:18:59,483
Others are induced.

498
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,983
The genes are changed
by external factors.

499
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,117
The starzl mutation is induced.

500
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,883
That's right.

501
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,117

to treat their cancer patients.

504
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:10,850
The microswitches

505
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,983

the thing

507
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:14,249
so the dosages were all off.

508
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,283
How long
did this go on?

509
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:16,516
Just under five years.

510
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:17,483
Once the hospital
figured out

511
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,316
what they were doing,

512
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,383
they tested everyone

513
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,616
who had ever been
exposed to it.

514
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,950
In some cases,

515
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,316
the radiation induced
a small mutation.

516
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,349
The starzl mutation.

517
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,750
Yeah, they named it

518
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,383
after the company
that made the bad machine.

519
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,616
And the mutation's replicable.

520
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:31,650
People who got it

521
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,516
passed it on
to their kids,

522
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,717

523
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,184
our three victims.

00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:36,316
But they were all living
normal lives.

525
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,783
They were healthy.

526
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:38,917
Just like most mutations,

527
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,349
you can have it
and not even know.

528
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:41,850
After everything
went public,

529
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,084
the lawyers
came out to play.

530
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,349
There was
a class-action lawsuit.

531
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,450
Seattle presbyterian paid

532
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,583
a huge settlement

533
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,383

affected by the machine.

00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:51,383

which only occurs
around seattle,

538
00:19:58,017 --> 00:20:00,416
and has absolutely no effect
on its carriers.

00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,283

00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,616
Excellent question.

When you find out,
make sure you tell me.

there's a paper trail.

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,516
[Gasping]

547
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:46,516
You okay?

548
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,516
Shawn...

549
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,017
you have to stop healing me.

550
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,084
No, you're going to make it,
uncle tommy.

551
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,383
No, shawn, i'm not.

552
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:55,950
This is all my fault.

553
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,150
I should never
have talked you

554
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,750
out of marrying
isabelle.

555
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,850
No, that was my decision,
not yours.

556
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,050
I can't help thinking

557
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,216
that it didn't
have to end this way.

558
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:06,550
Everyone we love is dead.

559
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,983
I'm sorry.

560
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,249
The catastrophe is here.

561
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,316
Hey...
no, no, no.

562
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,717
Hold on, hold on,
hold on...

563
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:15,717
hold on...

564
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:16,917
[choking]

565
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,917
No! Let me go.

566
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,783
Let me go!

567
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:25,283
Save as many as you can, shawn.

568
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,983
You're lucky.

569
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,316
Until six weeks ago,

570
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:10,516
i hadn't pulled that file
in years.

571
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:11,717
If you'd asked me then,

572
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,084
it would have taken me hours
to find it.

573
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:14,216
What happened
six weeks ago?

574
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,050
Some guy in a suit
showed up.

575
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,450
He had a document with him

576
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,017
saying that the military
needed the file

577
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:21,349
for, uh, research
in the war on terror.

578
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,783
Yeah, there we go.
There it is.

579
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:24,583
That's the master list

580
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,917
of everyone we paid
in the starzl case.

581
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,216
This man,
can you tell me his name?

582
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,216
Yeah...

583
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,349
miles enright.

584
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,516
Why? You know him?

585
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,017
Not yet.

586
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,583
There's 123 people here.

587
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,249
123 people we know have
the starzl mutation.

588
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:41,483
And the numbers

589
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,983
we've been finding
on the dead bodies

590
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,416
correspond to where
they appear on the list.

591
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,184
Number 27, timothy mccarren.

592
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,084
Number 11, paula nakata.

593
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,583
And holly martins, 92.

594
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,683
So darren piersahl,
if he's the killer,

595
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,850
is working from the same list
we're holding.

596
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,917
But the order seems so random.

597
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,550
I mean, is he just killing them
as the opportunity arises,

598
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,017
or is there some method?

599
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:02,150
I'll try
and find a pattern.

600
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,650
Hey, um...

601
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,950
how's maia been?

602
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:07,683
She's okay.

603
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,316
She asks about you a lot.

604
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,550
Yeah?

605
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,950
I just checked out
miles enright.

606
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,750
He's a vice president
of research and development

607
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,550
at haspelcorp.

608
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,616
Dennis.

609
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,249
You've been
ignoring our calls.

610
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,017
I'm busy, tom.

611
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,950
Why don't you go
through my assistant?

612
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,850
Maybe we can talk
next week or so.

613
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,983
It's important,
ryland.

614
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,184
It's about darren piersahl,

615
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:32,349
and your company's program

616
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,084
to create a division
of the u.s. Military

617
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:35,750
with 4400 abilities.

618
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,767
I don't know, tom.

619
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,966
I've been working here
less than three months.

620
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,199
I still don't know where
the supply closets are,

621
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,133
and now you've got me
heading up a covert program

622
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:58,033
where i'm injecting promicin
into united states soldiers?

623
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,400
Six weeks ago,

624
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,999
the vice president
of research and development

625
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,066
acquired a list of everyone
with the starzl mutation.

626
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,199
Miles enright.
Maybe you know him?

627
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:09,932
Sorry. It's a big building.
I haven't met everybody yet.

628
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:11,033
Three people are dead.

629
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,366
Now, you need to tell us

630
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,033
everything you know
about darren piersahl

631
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:16,166
so we can bring him in
before he kills anyone else.

632
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,099
I've never heard of him,

633
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,799
and i've certainly
never heard of this...

634
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,966
what do you call it?

635
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:22,199
"Starzl mutation"?

636
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,533
This is your last chance
to cooperate

637
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,099
before we find piersahl.

638
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,600
If you help us now,

639
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,667
we'll make it look better
for your company later, dennis.

640
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,099
Well, how can i help you

641
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,866
when i have no idea
what you're talking about?

642
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,832
Now, if this program
existed...

643
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:41,033
and please understand,
i'm not saying it does...

644
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:44,033
you seem to think
that people would be shocked

645
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,199
to know that
it's out there.

646
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,667
Me, i think
they'd be grateful.

647
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,566
I think any good citizen
would be thankful

648
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:52,266
that his government
was working on this,

649
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,300
because you can be damn sure
our enemies are.

650
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,066
If everyone would be so happy,
why not just tell us about it?

651
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,033
As usual,

652
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,600
you have no idea
of what the stakes are.

653
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,832
Whoever controls
promicin

654
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,466
has a strategic
advantage

655
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,966
over the rest
of the world.

656
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:08,033
This is
another manhattan project, tom,

657
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:09,733
and they didn't close it down

658
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,832
because a couple of technicians
got radiation poisoning.

659
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,199
They kept on working,

660
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,733
and they were right
to do that.

661
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,466
It's made the world
a better place.

662
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:21,233
Not that you're admitting
that the program exists, right?

663
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,633
What program?

664
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,033
So if i go through
with it,

665
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,066
if i marry isabelle,

666
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,199
you and i
become enemies.

667
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,199
I kill you.

668
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,300
If i don't do it...

669
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,033
richard,
things are even worse.

670
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,500
People are dead.
A lot of people.

671
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,832
In the second vision,
your uncle said

672
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:50,899
that the catastrophe was here,
right?

673
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:52,233
The place looked
like a war zone.

674
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,099
What the hell
am i supposed to do?

675
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,700
Look, you can only deal
with the information you have.

676
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,700
In one future, i die.

677
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,033
In another,

678
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,500
it sounds like
thousands of people,

679
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,733
maybe millions,

680
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,366
are at risk.

681
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,166
That's no choice at all.

682
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,700
We're talking about your life.

683
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,767
The guy said each vision
was one possible future.

684
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,400
If you do marry
isabelle...

685
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,433
at least
we're going into it

686
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:15,667
with our eyes open.

687
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,999
Now that we know
what could happen,

688
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,899
we can change things.

689
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,433
Nothing's inevitable, right?

690
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,466
Let's hope not...

691
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:26,566
because believe me...

692
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:31,600
i don't want to die.

693
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,333
Meet staff sergeant
john shaffner.

694
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,233
Okay, so why are we meeting him?

695
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,799
He was one
of six fatalities

696
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,799
in the helicopter crash

697
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,366
that "killed" darren piersahl.

698
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,166
A helicopter
that seated only four.

699
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,166
Right.

700
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,500
Turns out john shaffner's family

701
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,266
never received his remains
either.

702
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,667
You know, there was really
a helicopter crash

703
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,199
that day in iraq,

704
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,500
but four families
got their kids' bodies back,

705
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,533
and two didn't,

706
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,633
so here's what i'm thinking...

707
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,333
you think piersahl
and shaffner

708
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,433
were recruited into
haspelcorp's training program

709
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,733
at the same time.

710
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,133
So they used the crash
to fake two deaths,

711
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,733
so that piersahl
and shaffner

712
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,500
could disappear
into the program

713
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,099
with impunity.

714
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,667
So we have a second member
of haspelcorp's program,

715
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,799
which is great,

716
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,832
but it doesn't get us

717
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,899
any closer
to darren piersahl.

718
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,366
Good point.
It doesn't, really.

719
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,266
Not until...

720
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:21,433
you look
at shaffner's dog tags.

721
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,533
This is shaffner's
military serial number.

722
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,433
Look familiar?

723
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:27,099
Should it?

724
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,166
27.

725
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,199
That's what the note we found
on tim mccarren said.

726
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,767
That's also where
we found his name

727
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:36,433
on the list of people
with the starzl mutation.

728
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:37,700
11.

729
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,033
That was paula nakata's number.

730
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,533
And holly martins
was 92 on the list.

731
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,733
There is a pattern.

732
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:42,767
He's picking the order

733
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:43,866
based on his buddy's
serial number.

734
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:44,932
Okay, but why?

735
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,533
Maybe it's a message,

736
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,366
maybe they're
doing it together,

737
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,466
but if he's consistent,

738
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:50,500
the next victim

739
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,700
will be number 38
on the starzl list.

740
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,166
Alex messina.

741
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,199
I already
checked him out.

742
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,166
He manages a bike store
in madrona.

743
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,667
Yeah, i recognize him.

744
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,333
He was in here
earlier today.

745
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,600
Did he say
anything to you?

746
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,866
It was kind of weird, actually.

747
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:07,899
He asked me if my name
was alex messina,

748
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,066
and he said it
like that.

749
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,099
You know,
the full name?

750
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:13,999
He wanted to know
if i could come out

751
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,066
and take a look at his bike.

752
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,500
He needed
to replace a part.

753
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,832
I told him
just to bring it in.

754
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:20,400
He said he'd come back
when we were less busy.

755
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,899
Send a tactical team over
right away.

756
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,366
Thanks.

757
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:31,667
If piersahl makes a move,
we'll be ready.

758
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,466
Tom.

759
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,533
It must be from piersahl.

760
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,333
Hey.

761
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,667
Do you like this color?

762
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,333
This place needs to be
a little more girly

763
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,166
if i'm going to be
living here.

764
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,099
Yeah, it looks great.

765
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,500
I think so, too.

766
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,233
I'm glad you're back.

767
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,199
If piersahl knows
we're on to him,

768
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,400
he'll change
his pattern of attack.

769
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
There's about
a dozen people

770
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,133
we can't find.

771
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,500
Let's hope we get to them
before piersahl does.

772
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,767
[Man]: Tom baldwin?

773
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:24,866
Yeah, who's asking?

774
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:27,533
My name is john.

775
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,066
John shaffner.

776
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,566
I was a volunteer
in the same program

777
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:31,799
darren piersahl was in.

778
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,966
The one
that drove him crazy.

779
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:34,966
Yeah, we know
who you are.

780
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,166
And we know about the program.

781
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,133
Good.

782
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,400
We were volunteers.
All of us.

783
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,733
I still remember
the sales pitch.

784
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,133
We'd be the elite,

785
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,333
a new type of soldier.

786
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,333
We had to give up
our lives,

787
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,400
forfeit our identities...

788
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,933
they said it was the only way.

789
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:59,534
The program had to operate
in complete secrecy.

790
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:01,333
When did you start
getting the injections?

791
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,500
Right away.

792
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,933
It started slow,

793
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,633
but about three weeks ago,
they started upping our dosages.

794
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,033
That's when guys started
to lose it.

795
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,167
Where did they
get their promicin?

796
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:10,866
I don't know,
but they seemed to have

797
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:11,933
plenty of it, though.

798
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,966
Darren was the first one
who could do stuff.

799
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,633
An ability.

800
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,200
He killed one of the instructors
by mistake.

801
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,933
It freaked him out.

802
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:19,833
You two escaped together?

803
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:20,800
Once we got out,

804
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,866
we pretty much went
our separate ways.

805
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:24,067
I had no idea
he was going do this.

806
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:25,300
So he's awol?

807
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,233
These murders aren't sanctioned
by anyone?

808
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:28,833
No, darren's
freelancing.

809
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,067
That's why they want him back
so bad.

810
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:31,566
He's compromising the program.

811
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,733
Our c.o. S, they told us
about the starzl mutation,

812
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,400
they told us
it could be a threat,

813
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,599
but they never told us

814
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,766
to kill anybody.

815
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,033
Then what is it?

816
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,766
Why does darren
want them dead so badly?

817
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,233
It's got something to do with...

818
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,534
babies.

819
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:44,633
So far,

820
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,200
any time a 4400
has a kid

821
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,866
with a member
of the regular population,

822
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,633
their babies are normal.

823
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,400
They don't make promicin.
They don't have abilities.

824
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,766
We know.
We've been tracking the births.

825
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:55,467
The starzl mutation
changes all that.

826
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:58,866
If a 4400 has a kid with someone
who has the mutation...

827
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:01,133
the baby would be
promicin-positive.

828
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,933
They'd have abilities.

829
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,000
How would the military
even know that?

830
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,866
Have they tried it?

831
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,067
I don't know,

832
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,400
but they seem pretty
goddamn sure it's true.

833
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,966
I know
this is going to sound crazy,

834
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,333
but darren
is a victim here, too.

835
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,167
They gave us so many stimulants.

836
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,566
They amped us up to kill,
and he snapped.

837
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,167
I don't know if he thinks
he's on a mission or something,

838
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,233
but i know
he needs to be stopped.

839
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,633
I'll do whatever i can
to help you find him.

840
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:23,933
<i>[Ryland]: so, what
do you think you know?</i>

841
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,500
Everything,
including the starzl mutation,

842
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,167
and i have to
give you credit...

843
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,133
if what you say is right,

844
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,200
it would explain

845
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,434
why the 4400
were sent back in 2004,

846
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,666
why they were all brought
to seattle...

847
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,333
this is the only place
the 4400 can reproduce

848
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,766
and have kids with abilities.

849
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,100
Any of this sound familiar?

850
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,599
I think i read the same theory
in a supermarket tabloid once.

851
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,833
We know about your enhanced
soldier program, dennis.

852
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,467
We have one of your people.

853
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,033
John shaffner
been showing up

854
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,400
for many roll calls
lately?

855
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:59,067
Well, as soon as
we have piersahl,

856
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,367
we're going public
with this,

857
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,033
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

858
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,434
All you can do

859
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:05,500
is make yourself
and this company

860
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,167
look slightly better

861
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,434
by cooperating with our efforts
to bring him in.

862
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:11,200
We want piersahl's
personnel file.

863
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,699
Everything you have.

864
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:15,000
If it's not in my hands
in 90 seconds,

865
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,167
john shaffner will be standing
in front of a bank of cameras

866
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,367
before lunch.

867
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,133
This could be something.

868
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,500
Maybe.

869
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,400
It reads like some kind
of personal statement.

870
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,167
An essay by piersahl.

871
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,666
Yeah, we had to do those
to get in the program.

872
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,067
They wanted us to write

873
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,267
about some goal
we achieved,

874
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,467
something
we were proud of.

875
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,534
This is all about

876
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:39,067
a volunteer program
that he did.

877
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,766
There was a patch of forest
that got cleared by a fire.

878
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:44,800
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a...

879
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,866
darren piersahl
was an eagle scout?

880
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,300
Yeah, he used to talk
about those woods

881
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,800
all the time.

882
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,167
When we were
in the middle of the program,

883
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,966
whenever things got really bad,

884
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:53,966
he used to tell me

885
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,566
that's where he'd go
in his head.

886
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:57,434
He'd imagine himself there.
It calmed him down.

887
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,699
This patch of forest,
any chance you know where it is?

888
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,733
[Camera clicking]

889
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,733
Maybe you could put
your arm around her, mr. Tyler.

890
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:13,833
That's great.

891
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,200
The magazine wants to get
a shot of the bride and groom.

892
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
Has anyone seen the groom?

893
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,033
Who gave you the key?

894
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,200
Your own bodyguard.

895
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,267
[Keys clatter]

896
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,566
You started a war,
richard.

897
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,699
You turned the 4400
into an army,

898
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,566
and you launched an attack
for no reason!

899
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,800
We didn't have a choice.

900
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,100
It had to be
a preemptive strike.

901
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,367
No choice?

Look at it!

904
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,966
It has to stop.

You don't even know
who you are anymore.

907

She didn't change me.

She showed me who i am.

909
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,267
I know myself
better than ever,

910
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,500

what has to happen here.

Sorry to barge in on you.
It's just...

down in the garden.

I'm fine.

921
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,599
I'm just...

922
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,000
a little overwhelmed.

doing here?

That's good.

That's good.
I need your help.

934

I'm never going to make it
all the way through this list

936
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,267
Darren, you don't have to
finish the list.

937
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,100
It's someone else's agenda.

938

You've got it all mixed up
in your head.

Come on with me.

940
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,566
There's some people
i want you to talk to.

941
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,666
They can help us.
"They"? Who are "they"?

No.

Wait!

948
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,666
We've got people
covering the access road.

949
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,699
We'll pin him down.

959
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,184
We lost shaffner.

960
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:54,217
Piersahl's dead.

961
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:55,350
He was on his way out

962
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,017
before we even
started fighting.

963
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:59,483
Piersahl had a stab wound
in his stomach.

964
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,683
I guess shaffner
didn't go down without a fight.

965
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,850
Yeah, well,
they're both gone,

966
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,917
and there's no one left
to talk about the program.

967
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,483
We still have evidence.

968
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:08,784
We can go after haspelcorp.

969
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:09,950
Expose everything.

970
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,217
Yeah, but it
would've been nice

971
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:12,450
to have a face
to put out there.

972
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,483
I mean, now all we have

973
00:38:13,483 --> 00:38:14,717
are accusations
and a paper trail.

974
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:16,450
And five dead bodies.

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,984

<i>to all the world,</i>

979

<i>but it should not
in any way be seen</i>

980
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,117
<i>as an offensive
maneuver.</i>

981
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,350
<i>We have evidence
suggesting</i>

982
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,416
<i>that other countries
have similar programs.</i>

983
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,251

<i>in the defense

<i>Now i'd like to introduce

so much of themselves</i>

a clever move, dennis.

where it's due.

make sure

1010

We're not denying
anything.

It's unfortunate
that one of my men went awol,

but he was
clearly deranged.

1015
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,550
I've got a whole team of doctors
standing by

1016
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,950
to testify to that effect.

1017
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,583
You created an assassin.

00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,084
It's a tragedy,

1019
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,950
and it's news, i'll admit that,

1020
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,350
but tomorrow morning,

1021
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,550
the piersahl case
will be below the fold

1022
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,884
on every newspaper,

1023
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:55,550
and all the headlines will be
about our program.

1024
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,817
That's the way i see it, anyway.

1025
00:39:58,817 --> 00:40:00,517
Who's feeding you
your information?

1026
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:01,583
You knew about
the starzl mutation

1027
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,817
before we did.

1028
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,817
You have a source
of promicin

1029
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:04,817
for your program.

1030
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,316
Who is it?

00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,917
You give me
too much credit, tom.

That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.

The soldiers you're creating...

1034
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:23,784
are you really going to use them
to defend the country?

1035
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:27,750
Or are you just going to
send them after the 4400?

1036
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,117
Is there a difference?
