1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,268
We're not a threat,
We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,535
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,308
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,205
This is lsabelle.

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,682
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone

6
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,878
for understanding what happened
to the 4400.

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,081
- Are you my mother?
- Your rapid aging

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,658
has caused her rapid aging.

9
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,761
The only way for you to live
is for me to die.

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,727
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,628
P.I. Promicin inhibitor.

12
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,961
We did it to them, Tom.

13
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,463
- We made them sick.
- We are in a war.

14
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,503
This is a message
from The Nova Group,

15
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,538
The second demonstration
of our capabilities

16
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,539
is planned for October 19th,

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,234
You think I'm gonna
write you a check?

18
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,401
I need it tomorrow.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,413
We couldn't even handle one when
she walked in and attacked the place.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,074
Now there's a whole team
of assassins, all with abilities?

21
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,345
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center

22
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,455
in case the government
ever came after us again.

23
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,783
You lied to me, Daniel.

24
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,823
You never said anything
about killing people.

25
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,451
You sold us out.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,591
You did the right thing
by calling me, Shawn.

27
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,091
You're a hero.

28
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,134
- Hey, I'm Tyler.
- Maia.

29
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,472
- Where are we?
- This is where they altered us.

30
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,404
Gave me the ability
to create the world

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,137
we've been living in
for the last eight years.

32
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,803
People see her, they see a woman.

33
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,347
And they might forget that inside,
she's just a little girl.

34
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,784
I'm glad she had you around
to be a friend.

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,786
You are ticklish.

36
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,363
Cut it out.

37
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,990
- That bothers me.
- It bothers you?

38
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,228
It didn't seem to bother you
a few minutes ago.

39
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,342
- I could hold you like this.
- You could hold me like this?

40
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,572
- Really?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,743
What about that?

42
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,691
Oh, don't answer it. Don't answer it.

43
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,985
I have to.
I'm still the boss around here.

44
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,924
I have to.

45
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,895
Richard, hey.

46
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,234
Sorry to bother you.
I was waiting for you in your office.

47
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,706
Oh, you know--

48
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,437
Yeah, sorry, I'm just running
a little late this morning. What's up?

49
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,604
Before Lily-- Before she passed,

50
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,410
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.

51
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,678
The healing work you do
was really important to her.

52
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,948
I remember.
I'm glad to have you aboard.

53
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,921
- What do you need?
- A better head for numbers.

54
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,925
I've been trying to decipher
these financial reports.

55
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,756
There's some
pretty big cash payments.

56
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,921
You signed the transfers,

57
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,930
I figured you might remember
what they were for.

58
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,765
No idea. I'm sorry, no idea.

59
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,237
Just checking.

60
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,901
See you soon.

61
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,315
Maybe we should tell him.

62
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,785
No. No, I don't think so.

63
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,582
We just...

64
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,317
We just gotta be more careful
from now on, okay?

65
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,292
Okay.

66
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,333
Thank you for doing this, Thomas.

67
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,995
I know an open house at the Center
isn't your favorite Sunday activity.

68
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,836
I love a good barbecue.

69
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,477
You've been spending
a lot of time here.

70
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,478
If this place is important to you,
it's important to me.

71
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,173
I don't believe you,
but I love you for saying it.

72
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,650
And don't be nervous, everyone here
is going to love you too.

73
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,346
So help me out here, Tom.

74
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,286
You say you love Alana,

75
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,293
and yet she's a 4400
and you're an NTAC agent.

76
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,956
I mean, if I were you
and I really loved her, I'd quit that job.

77
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,961
First of all, you're not me.
You don't know anything about me.

78
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,437
You don't know anything
about this relationship and frankly,

79
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,870
I doubt you know much
about NTAC.

80
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,307
Well, they did almost kill us all.

81
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,970
Thanks for the input, Ryan.
Nice chatting with you.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,112
I am so sorry, Thomas.
He's usually not that rude.

83
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,720
We've been here an hour.
I've had four conversations like that.

84
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,823
- You think we can call it a day?
- Alana?

85
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,559
I didn't realize your Thomas
was Tom Baldwin.

86
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,027
- Remember me?
- Heather Tobey.

87
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,166
Nice to see a friendly face.
How are you?

88
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,061
I couldn't be better.
Tom was my hero.

89
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,371
Oh, you mean Heather
was one of your assignments?

90
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,667
Yeah, about eight months ago.

91
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,366
Back when I first got my ability.

92
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,138
Heather, you seem great.
What are you up to?

93
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,613
I teach at the school here now.
It's a good match, huh?

94
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,116
Finally found a place where
they won't run me out on the rails

95
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,412
for being a 4400.

96
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,452
And now Alana and l
are gonna be working together.

97
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,250
Isn't that cool?

98
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,193
I've been offered a job
working with the children at the school.

99
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,996
But I haven't decided
if I'm going to take it yet.

100
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,164
I blew the surprise, didn't l?

101
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,144
So help me out here.
Who is Amy again?

102
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,405
- Is she a 4400?
- Everyone in my class is a 4400.

103
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,845
She wants me to come over tomorrow.
It's not a huge deal.

104
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,279
Oh, it's not?

105
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,012
I guess when you put it like that,
then there's no way I can say no.

106
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,985
- Where's your sweater?
- I left it upstairs.

107
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,783
Run and get it.
It's freezing by the water.

108
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,016
We're gonna miss the ferry.

109
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,253
- You're gonna forget me.
- Excuse me?

110
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,225
You're gonna forget me. I saw it.

111
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,132
Maia, do you mind explaining that?

112
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,601
Because frankly,
it sounds a little creepy.

113
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,139
It's okay. It's not your fault.

114
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,945
Maia, listen to me.
I would never forget you.

115
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,743
Not ever.

116
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,748
Come on, you know that, don't you?

117
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,951
I'll be right back.

118
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,015
Okay.

119
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,263
Maia, come on.

120
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,968
Come on, sweetie.
We're gonna miss the boat, literally.

121
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,638
- Maia, come here right now.
- Mommy, it's okay. It's fine.

122
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,175
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

123
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,336
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

124
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,644
I was just knocking on your door
when Maia came upstairs.

125
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,343
It's so great.

126
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,489
- Tell her.
- Tell me what?

127
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,992
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sara.
Sara Rutledge.

128
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,026
I'm Maia's sister.

129
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,420
That's Lemon. He was my dog.

130
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,263
I know. He slept on your bed,
every night, right until he died.

131
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,572
You really lived in my house?

132
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,365
22 White Oak Lane, Crescent City.

133
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:36,447
- My room was at the top of the stairs.
- I know. It was always your room.

134
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,608
Mom and Dad kept it all the same,
just for you.

135
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,548
They missed you so much.

136
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,055
Maia, I need you to give me
some time alone with Sara.

137
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,459
Did Daddy teach you to play poker?

138
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,288
- We played for Tootsie Rolls.
- Maia.

139
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,033
I think your mom needs
a word with me, sweetie.

140
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,178
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sandbag you.

141
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,543
I was gonna leave a note.

142
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,413
I've been trying to find you for years.

143
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,918
Every phone number out of date.

144
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,613
Every letter comes back
return to sender.

145
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,418
Guyana? The lvory Coast?

146
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,051
I've been hard to find.

147
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,663
Hard to find?
I didn't know if you were alive or dead.

148
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,732
Which, I'm guessing,
is why you never told Maia about me.

149
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,938
I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to say?

150
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,508
"Sweetheart,
you have an older sister,

151
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,341
but it doesn't seem like she's
terribly interested in meeting you"?

152
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,647
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,419
I should have called first.

154
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,923
I just felt like
I needed to do this in person.

155
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,562
I just want to know her.

156
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,358
That's all.

157
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,763
You think it's that easy?

158
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,062
There are a lot of people
who would do anything

159
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,704
to get close to a 4400.

160
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,501
Until you can prove to me
that you are who you say you are,

161
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,769
you're not seeing
my daughter again.

162
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,608
I understand.
I'm willing to take a DNA test.

163
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,306
That's a good start.

164
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,313
You didn't even tell me
you were thinking about teaching,

165
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,580
that the possibility existed.

166
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,021
To be honest, I was avoiding it.
I know how you feel about the Center.

167
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,787
No, I'm fine with the Center.
They're not fine with me.

168
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,756
What about your gallery?

169
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:38,461
I can still do all the buying
and Tina can handle sales.

170
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,165
Look, I'm sorry
if this seems just sudden.

171
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,366
I told them about my ability
at the Center,

172
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,374
and they thought
they could use it at the school.

173
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,910
You're gonna use your ability?

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Don't you think that's why
we came back here with these gifts?

175
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,140
To help other people?

176
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,046
Yeah, yeah. No, it sounds great.
I just didn't think that...

177
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,751
I mean, does it even work
with other people?

178
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,655
I did an experiment with Heather.

179
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,228
We went to Paris for lunch.

180
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,561
Don't worry,
I don't think my batteries run out.

181
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,001
I'll save my best work for you.

182
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,505
I promise.

183
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,703
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our experiment,

184
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,780
I guess you'd call it.

185
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,973
We've never tried
a healing this large,

186
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,348
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.

187
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,520
Before I begin,

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,684
I'd like to say that this foundation
was started by my late wife, Lily Tyler.

189
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,822
I'm proud to be carrying on
her work.

190
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,091
She's the reason
why we are all here today.

191
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,435
Well, her and a man
I'm about to introduce to you.

192
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,929
Shawn Farrell.

193
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,867
Thank you.

194
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:57,209
Okay, first off, kids,
I promise this is not gonna hurt.

195
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,452
Listen, I'd like to ask
everyone here a favor.

196
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,278
When you leave here today,

197
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,324
and you will be leaving
the hospital today,

198
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:12,226
please tell anyone that asks
that a 4400 made you better.

199
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,831
Made your children better.

200
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,832
Because we're not bogeymen,
we're here to help.

201
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,234
- So let's get this thing started.
- Traitor! Traitor to your own kind.

202
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,408
Next time it won't be paint.

203
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,674
You okay?

204
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,513
Yeah.

205
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,851
It's in her file.

206
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,283
Maia's parents had a baby
five years after she disappeared

207
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,150
and her name was Sara.

208
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,655
So it is possible.

209
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,419
No word at all for two years
and then she just shows up.

210
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,995
- You think she's the real deal?
- I don't know. Maybe.

211
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,495
What does your gut tell you?

212
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,565
Oh, it tells me that
she's not gonna see Maia again

213
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,827
until the DNA tests come back.

214
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,664
Smart gut.

215
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,198
Her name is Lindsey Hammond.

216
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,275
She disappeared
November 23rd, 1 979.

217
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,208
You know, just once I wish a 4400
would smile for their picture.

218
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,438
Is that too much to ask?

219
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,141
Since her return she's been living
with her stepfather.

220
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,477
Until yesterday, that is.

221
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,046
What, she's missing?

222
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,812
Well, her stepfather thinks
she ran away.

223
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,587
Take a drive out to her house.
See if we need to be worried.

224
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,422
That just came in.

225
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,960
The attack at the hospital
this morning wasn't random.

226
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,628
Somehow you've become a target
of the Nova Group.

227
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,832
Any idea why?

228
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,643
Two months ago,

229
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,209
someone called me.

230
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:42,150
They were trying to raise money
to start a defensive wing of the 4400.

231
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,380
I made a couple of contributions.

232
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,889
You gave money
to the Nova Group?

233
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,190
Shawn, they murdered
half a dozen people.

234
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,954
That was after.

235
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,689
Do you think I would have
given them money

236
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,697
if I thought that
they were gonna hurt anybody?

237
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,768
When they came back
asking for more, I said no.

238
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,566
You got the money
from the foundation, didn't you?

239
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,106
That's what all those signatures
were for.

240
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,107
You diverted money from my wife's
foundation to a terrorist group?

241
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,339
Richard, it was a mistake.
I know that.

242
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,450
Don't you think I know that?

243
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,945
I'll serve to you.

244
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,524
We have to try to keep it going
for as long as we can, okay?

245
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,698
Maia?

246
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,537
Where's Maia?

247
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,043
She's at a friend's house.
A girl from the class. Why?

248
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,374
Preliminary DNA came back.
Negative match.

249
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,744
Sara isn't Maia's sister.

250
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,149
Where's Maia?

251
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,786
They're in the yard.
Is everything okay?

252
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,832
Maia!

253
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,235
- She left.
- Where did she go?

254
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,495
She went with that lady. Her sister.

255
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,178
Her picture's already on the wire.
An AMBER Alert's been issued.

256
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,248
- We'll find her, Diana.
- I know we will.

257
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,045
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.

258
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,518
We're monitoring every tollbooth,
every intersection we can.

259
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,180
If Sara shows up on any of them,
we can be there in minutes.

260
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,258
You're gonna keep an eye
on things yourself, right?

261
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,327
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.
- Okay.

262
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,522
- Tom, what did the lab say?
- Nothing good.

263
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,133
They ran the fingerprints from
your apartment and the DNA samples

264
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,896
against every known database.
No names came up.

265
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,301
So she has Maia,
we have no idea who she is.

266
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,997
No.

267
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,911
She said I was going to forget her.

268
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,557
Mom really kept my room
just like I left it?

269
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,031
Sure she did.

270
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,467
She always believed
that you were gonna come home.

271
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,668
Maia, can I ask you a question?

272
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,734
Do you see the future more clearly

273
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,380
since you stopped taking
the inhibitor?

274
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:28,578
Well, at first I couldn't control it.
I thought I was going crazy.

275
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,656
But now I can see the future,
more when I want to.

276
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,555
It doesn't really
sneak up on me anymore.

277
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,697
- Not much anyway.
- That's great.

278
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,196
You're learning to focus your ability.

279
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,497
What if I asked you
to predict something right now?

280
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,731
Wait.

281
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,706
We can go now.

282
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,448
You are a very special girl.

283
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,693
What do you think?

284
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,089
This is your house?

285
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,230
I bought it so I can stay in Seattle.

286
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,096
We've spent enough time apart,
don't you think?

287
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,263
Come on, let me show you the inside.
There's a surprise.

288
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,143
Oh, my gosh.

289
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,041
It's just like my old room.

290
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,742
I told you Mom kept it the same,
else how would I know?

291
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,398
Sorry to interrupt.

292
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,938
Hoping I could have a word.

293
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,667
Matthew.

294
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,838
Come on in. What's on your mind?

295
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,012
I was brought into this organization
by Jordan Collier.

296
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,521
I didn't always know
what he had in mind for it,

297
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,684
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.

298
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,763
Six months after I came aboard,
he died.

299
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,127
My new boss was a 1 9-year-old boy.

300
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,002
This is about Shawn?

301
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,728
He's overwhelmed, Richard.

302
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,840
Running this Center
requires substantive decisions.

303
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,135
Decisions that he's not qualified
to make.

304
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,144
But you, on the other hand...

305
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,714
You were an officer.
You led men into battle.

306
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,681
Stop. Shawn runs things here.

307
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,447
I am not interested
in a palace coup.

308
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,284
I'm not talking about
getting rid of him.

309
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,651
I'm talking about power-sharing.

310
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,764
The two of you
make decisions together.

311
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,956
It's a way of helping him.

312
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,466
Giving him the benefit
of your experience.

313
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,538
This is all very flattering.

314
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,197
I'm not trying to flatter you.

315
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm trying to keep
this movement alive.

316
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,204
Think about it.

317
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,870
And before you say no,
I want you to tell me,

318
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,380
could you,
under any circumstances,

319
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,385
see yourself inadvertently
funding a terrorist attack?

320
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,558
Look familiar?

321
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,256
Maia's been drawing it a lot
the last few days.

322
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,492
You sure? It's all
through the margins of her journals.

323
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,035
Well, I've never seen it before,
but she likes butterflies.

324
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,573
It might just be a doodle.

325
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,834
You find anything else?
Anything we can use?

326
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,774
It's hard to say. I mean,
it's all stream of consciousness.

327
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,507
Predictions about big events right next
to tiny things in her everyday life.

328
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,412
And there's no dates.

329
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,886
Oh, did find out how I'm gonna die.

330
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,419
Yeah, that was interesting.

331
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,281
Don't worry, it's actually kind of cool.

332
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,693
She did mention a friend's house.

333
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,023
Just referred to the mom, though.
Mrs. Paspalis.

334
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,189
Amy Paspalis.
That's the house she was taken from.

335
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,526
Great, show us that page.

336
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,765
Spooky. I could spend the rest
of my career working on these things.

337
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,706
- Come on, Marco, just--
- Yeah, yeah.

338
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,867
Here.

339
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,640
"Mommy's coming to pick me up
from Mrs. Paspalis' house,

340
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,876
but I'm already gone.
I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."

341
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,776
Tyler Downing?

342
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,987
- lsn't he a 4400?
- He goes to school with Maia.

343
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,287
I told you, I didn't do anything to Maia.
I swear.

344
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,020
Look, nobody thinks
that you did anything.

345
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,764
I just need you
to try and remember.

346
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,467
Now, did she ever talk to you
about a circle?

347
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,065
Did she ever mention having visions
about the two of you?

348
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,936
No. I said already ten times,
I'm not lying.

349
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,805
Ma'am, I know you're worried
about your kid,

350
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,675
but you're scaring the crap
out of my brother.

351
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,939
Diana.

352
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,615
There's nothing here.
There's no sign of Maia or the woman.

353
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,014
"I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."
Tyler's here, so where is Maia?

354
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,180
I don't know.

355
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,259
Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.

356
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,554
Is it a street? Barnaby Circle?
There's a Circle Park--

357
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,756
We need to check them all, because
she's trying to tell me how to find her.

358
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,711
Sara?

359
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,217
Is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?

360
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,554
Sara?

361
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,629
Sara, the door won't open.

362
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,430
Sara?

363
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,175
You can yell all you want,
she won't come.

364
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,278
She never does.

365
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,473
Who are you?

366
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,239
I'm Lindsey.

367
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,186
I'm a part of her collection.

368
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,186
We all are.

369
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,592
Now you are too.

370
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,330
All of us are 4400s?

371
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,771
What is she gonna do to us?

372
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,204
Sell us to the highest bidder
or do experiments?

373
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,435
I mean, who knows?

374
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:31,248
It doesn't matter.
We're not gonna let it come to that.

375
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,762
Hello?

376
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,273
That was incredible.

377
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,515
Hi.

378
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,381
Oh, hi, Thomas.
I didn't hear you come in.

379
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,717
Any word about Maia?

380
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,485
Sorry to invade your house, Tom.
Alana and I were just practicing.

381
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,756
I think I might take that job
at the school.

382
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,863
Heather and l
were just trying something.

383
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,933
Don't be shy about it.

384
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,900
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.

385
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,300
We just watched Richard Nixon

386
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,941
fly away from the White House
after he resigned.

387
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,241
It's remarkable, huh?

388
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,842
Well, Alana's an amazing woman.

389
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,112
She certainly is.

390
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,659
Are you all right, Thomas?

391
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,556
I'm fine. I'm just...

392
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,657
I'm just worried for Diana.

393
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,632
She's strong. And so are you.

394
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,837
After Heather leaves,
you want me to take you somewhere?

395
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,035
It might calm you down some.

396
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,607
No, I think
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

397
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,181
Hit the investigation
fresh in the morning.

398
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,118
So things are going well
between you and Shawn?

399
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,955
Yeah, I think so.

400
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,563
We're having lots of sex.

401
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,524
Has he said, "l love you," yet?

402
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,294
No.

403
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,699
Do you think he should have?

404
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,042
Try this.

405
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,773
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.

406
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,281
Men can do things with their bodies

407
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,147
entirely unrelated
to their hearts and minds.

408
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,552
Shawn likes me. It's real.

409
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,983
Good.

410
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,559
Shawn's gonna be having
a difficult time these next few days.

411
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,561
He's gonna have
some decisions to make.

412
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,894
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.

413
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,696
You want me to use him?

414
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,773
Use him?

415
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,602
What does that even mean?

416
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,906
You're getting close to Shawn, right?
So he'll value your advice.

417
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,641
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.

418
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,614
I guess.

419
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,412
What do you want me
to say to him?

420
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,452
Just the truth.

421
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,955
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.

422
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:31,084
It's not a sign of weakness,
it's a display of strength.

423
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,054
Wear that.

424
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,363
Hey, kid,

425
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,974
you have to try to be quiet, okay?

426
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,303
I just wanna go home.

427
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,872
We all do,
but crying is not going to help.

428
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,875
Listen, we can do stuff they can't.

429
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,147
That's why they want us.
But maybe we can use it against them,

430
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,656
maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.

431
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,423
Everyone tell me
what you can do, okay?

432
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,122
My sister and me,

433
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,598
we can make water move.

434
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,202
Back and forth.

435
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,998
Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.

436
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,470
Diffusion.

437
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,598
Yeah.

438
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,938
We have to be together
to do it, though.

439
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,003
What about you, kid?

440
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,981
I do stuff with electricity. Currents.

441
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,282
I can make machines in my kitchen
stop working.

442
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,151
Okay, good, that will come in handy.

443
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,521
I can see things.

444
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,596
Things that are gonna happen.

445
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,196
Really? That's awesome.

446
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,960
Can you tell
if they're gonna keep us here?

447
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,836
Are they gonna let us go?

448
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,698
Come on, tell us.

449
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,543
We're not gonna be here long.

450
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,205
Why? Do we get to go home?

451
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,542
I don't think so.

452
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
Sorry I asked.

453
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,816
Listen, I don't know
about the rest of you,

454
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,154
but I'm gonna try to figure out
a way to get us out of here.

455
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,992
Are you guys up for it?

456
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:01,537
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Stop it! Let me go!

457
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,340
Help me! Let me go!

458
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:08,851
Help! Somebody! Let me go! Help!

459
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,417
Tyler Downing wasn't home

460
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,221
when his sister got back
from her waitressing shift last night.

461
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,661
My God,
that's the third 4400 kid missing.

462
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,391
No, try five.

463
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,734
Olivia and Duncan Germaine's
parents

464
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,339
thought they went on a camping trip
with their youth group.

465
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,566
It turns out they never showed.

466
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,112
Tom, update me, here.

467
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,773
What are we doing
to find this woman?

468
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,387
Well, Maia's journal said she was
inside the circle with Tyler Downing.

469
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,949
We've checked out every street
with the name Circle in it.

470
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,456
Skyline Circle Park,
Circle Theatre on First Hill.

471
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,253
There's nothing yet.

472
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,623
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.

473
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,923
We've already looked.

474
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,366
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in Denny Park.

475
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,299
- Maybe there.
- It's over here.

476
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,434
Hey, I thought you could use a jolt.

477
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,338
Thanks.

478
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,945
I didn't get much sleep last night.

479
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,648
Any, actually. This helps.

480
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,780
You were up all night?

481
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,217
You should go lay down
in the Theory Room for an hour.

482
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,182
Tom.

483
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,996
Diana, are you all right?

484
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,689
Look.

485
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,936
"I'm in the circle."

486
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,139
I don't believe this.

487
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,806
I tell you the truth
and you use it to kick me out?

488
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,178
No, Shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.

489
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,750
You've got an impossible job.

490
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,820
Jordan Collier left me
in charge of this place.

491
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,117
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.

492
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,788
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.

493
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,324
The Center
has a board of directors, Shawn.

494
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,729
And Collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.

495
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,234
They approved it because
that's what Jordan wanted, Matthew.

496
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,736
If Jordan was here, his thoughts
on succession might change

497
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,899
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the United States government.

498
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,340
You've made yourself and this place
a target for terrorists.

499
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,038
Shawn,

500
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,512
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,

501
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,313
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.

502
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,477
You need help.

503
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,316
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.

504
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,154
- I am.
- Really?

505
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,353
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.

506
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,394
- Tyler, you have to talk to us.
- No.

507
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,563
If we get out of the house, can you
make it so their cars can't start?

508
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,402
No, I'm not helping.

509
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,511
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl?

510
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,115
They took her away.
I don't wanna go away.

511
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:55,116
You will.
We all will if we don't do something.

512
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:35,090
Lindsey. Lindsey, are you okay?

513
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,920
Who are you?

514
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,292
What did they do to you?

515
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,268
Maia, do you wanna come
with me, please?

516
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,373
No.

517
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,338
It's okay, sweetie.
It's not so bad. I promise.

518
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,908
Tyler! Duncan!
Please, somebody help me!

519
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,053
Help!

520
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,297
Seattle P.D. has the south edge.
We'll take center and work east.

521
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,129
It would be nice if we knew
what we were looking for.

522
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,602
A message.

523
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,968
A sign.

524
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,110
Anything.

525
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,817
Do you like this?

526
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,783
You are seriously asking?

527
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:41,484
I knew you would.
I picked it out just for you.

528
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,825
Green's your favorite color, isn't it?

529
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,520
I can tell.

530
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,529
I know you now.

531
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,069
Isabelle, lsabelle.

532
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,734
I'm not really ready
for another round right now, okay?

533
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,471
What are you so worried about?

534
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,407
If you don't wanna share
your job, don't.

535
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,177
What are you talking about?

536
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,488
I can do things, Shawn.
Lots of them.

537
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,559
I figure out more every day.

538
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,025
If you wanna keep your job,
you can.

539
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,166
I can make it happen.

540
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,399
You can do whatever.
Who's gonna say different?

541
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,197
Thanks, I guess.

542
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,936
But why don't you just hold off
on the air strikes, okay?

543
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,009
We're talking about
your dad and Matthew here.

544
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,876
It's just an argument.

545
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,176
They're not the enemy.

546
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,918
Besides, they do have a point,
don't they?

547
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,579
I did screw up.

548
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,992
Okay.

549
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,855
Just so you know, it's your call.

550
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,060
Drink this.

551
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,897
It'll make you feel better.

552
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,344
You're frightened.

553
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,710
It's all right, I understand.
But you don't have to be.

554
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,783
We're not gonna hurt you.

555
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,643
Soon you won't
even be worried anymore.

556
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,083
I promise.

557
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,523
These are just to relax you.

558
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,788
They'll help you get ready.

559
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,892
Now, drink up, okay?
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.

560
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,438
No.

561
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,071
Maia.

562
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,372
They're doing it. They're helping.

563
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,093
Take Dexter south.
Swing back around for another pass.

564
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,289
- Wait, Tom. Stop. Stop.
- What?

565
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,269
It's those butterflies.

566
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,464
They're in Maia's journals.
She's here.

567
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,620
All right, let's go. Secure the area.

568
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,663
Maia.

569
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,373
- What is going on?
- Don't move!

570
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,204
Please.

571
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,410
Please, this house is for sale,
all the valuables are gone.

572
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,738
Is this a dream?

573
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,406
No, honey.

574
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,907
Remember the first time you
were taken away from your parents?

575
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,379
This is where we brought you.

576
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,383
- No, this isn't real.
- Yes, it is.

577
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,456
We've brought you back.

578
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,190
You've been here ever since
you walked through the front door

579
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,828
of my house.

580
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,486
You're in the future.

581
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,129
We had to bring you here, Maia.
You and your friends.

582
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,231
We need your help.

583
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,738
It'll all be over soon.

584
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,077
Please let me go.

585
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,776
I wanna go home.

586
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,786
I'm afraid you can't.
You're too important.

587
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,286
Sweetheart,

588
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,587
the experiment we tried is failing.

589
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,491
There's been too much interference.

590
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,599
The 4400
haven't changed the timeline.

591
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,536
The catastrophe, it's still coming.

592
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,208
We found a way to fix it.

593
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,844
You and your friends,

594
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,908
you're gonna save us all.

595
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,980
We found it all.
You know, the circle, the butterflies.

596
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,723
She's here.
I mean, she has to be here.

597
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,397
Come on, I'll take you home.

598
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,316
Sign here.

599
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,919
Can you sign here?

600
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,884
Thank you, Shawn.

601
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,461
I know this wasn't an easy decision.

602
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,394
Yeah, well,

603
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,370
we all want the same things, right?

604
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,201
You're a good man, Shawn.

605
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,440
It's an honor to be working with you.

606
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,819
Why are you giving this to me?

607
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,685
To thank you.

608
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,087
You did well.

609
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,759
Everything went smoothly
with Shawn.

610
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,961
I disobeyed you, Matthew.

611
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,629
I told Shawn he should keep his job.

612
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,702
I disobeyed you
and you know what?

613
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,037
Nothing happened.

614
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,406
There wasn't an earthquake.

615
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,511
I didn't melt.

616
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,311
I used to be scared of you.

617
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,783
But I don't think you have
any power over me at all, do you?

618
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,300
I didn't think so.

619
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,438
I'll do my own shopping
from now on, okay?

620
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,582
Okay, sweetheart,
we're ready to begin.

621
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,154
Don't cry.

622
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,949
You and the other children
we took,

623
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,186
we tested your abilities
and you are so special.

624
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,263
That's why you were chosen.

625
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,394
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

626
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,331
We're gonna put you all back.

627
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,233
Not the same year
we took you from, but earlier.

628
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,397
Much earlier.

629
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,839
We calculated wrong the first time.

630
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,774
We have to try again.

631
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,608
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.

632
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,052
I don't care.
I don't wanna go anywhere.

633
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,656
I wanna stay with my mom.

634
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,950
I know.

635
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,593
It's hard.

636
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,229
I can make the pain go away.

637
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,558
Before we put you back
in your new time,

638
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,393
we'll make you forget your mother,

639
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,560
Marco and your friends.

640
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,729
- Please, don't.
- They'll forget you too.

641
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,975
It's better this way.

642
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,772
There'll be no sorrow,
no pain, no loss.

643
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,175
As far as the world is concerned,

644
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:29,149
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1 946 and was never found.

645
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,220
That's a lie.

646
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,482
My mom won't ever forget me.

647
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,559
She will. It's happening already.

648
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,993
Now, just lie still.

649
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,030
All the hope we have rests with you.

650
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,604
No, don't do it, please.

651
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,537
Mommy!

652
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,631
This should be good.
