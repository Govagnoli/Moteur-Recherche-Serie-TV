1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,310
PREVIOUSLY ON THE 4400--

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,680
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,090
THE LIGHT IS GONE,AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
HAVE JUST SUDDENLY APPEARED.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,430
-WE'RE LETTING THEM GO.
-WE'RE LETTING THEM GO?

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,210
YOU DON'T HAVE A LEGAL RIGHTTO HOLD THEM.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,100
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,660
I WASN'T PREGNANT WHEN I WAS ABDUCTED,

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,470
BUT I WAS WHEN I GOT BACK.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,480
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,860
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,570
THAT BABY COULD BE THE KEY TO THE FUTURE,

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,310
AND IT HAS TO BE PROTECTED,AND I CAN DO THAT.

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,070
GO AHEAD. RUN!

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,100
THAT BABY BELONGS WITH ME.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,020
THIS IS  YOUR NEW HOUSE?

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,090
IT'S YOURS TOO.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,510
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOMENT FOR TOO LONG.

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,270
DIANA SKOURIS,

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,740
YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE 
IS HEREBY COMPLETE,LEGAL,AND BINDING.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,560
HER VISIONS STOPPEDABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO.

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,810
WE'RE NOT SURE WHY.

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,260
MRS. USHER NEXT DOOR IS GETTING A KITTEN.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,900
MOMMY'S BOSSES WILL BE PUNISHED FOR BETRAYING US.

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,380
IT WASN'T ME!

25
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,720
THAT CREATURE MADE ME    PULL THE TRIGGER!

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,220
GETTING DRESSED FROM THE TOP DOWN NOW?

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,810
THAT THE WAY THEY DO IT ON THE MARINERS?

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,090
MARINERS?

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,630
GARY'S GOT HIS EYES  ON THE SOX.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,080
NO,YOU MEAN THE SOX GOT THEIR EYES ON HIM.

31
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,130
HOW'S IT FEEL,ALL THOSE SCOUTS IN THE STANDS?

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,370
YOU BEND OVER TO TIE A SHOELACE,THEY MAKE A NOTE.

33
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,490
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE RESPECT,HUH?

34
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,240
YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE NEW JACKIE ROBINSON.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,020
FIRST 4400 TO MAKE THE BIG LEAGUES.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,200
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SCOUTS,MAN.

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,510
I'LL FLOAT YOU SOME RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,850
YOU JUST GET INTO YOUR RHYTHM,
FORGET THEY'RE EVEN OUT THERE,ALL RIGHT?

39
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,930
CAN'T BLAME HIM.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,530
SIX SCOUTS.

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,830
I'D BE AFRAIDI WAS GOING TO CHOKE.

42
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,170
I'M NOT GONNA CHOKE.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,600
BARNES CAN'T SERVE THEM  ANY BETTER THAN THAT.

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,640
JUST... JUST    GIVE ME A SECOND.

45
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,480
HE'S THROWING HIM A BEACH BALL.

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,570
HE'S SCARED,MAN.

47
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,140
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT?

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
WHAT A LOSER.

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,200
FOLLOW THROUGH.FOLLOW THROUGH.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,110
THIS TIME TRY TAKING THE BAT OFF YOUR SHOULDER.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,130
WHY DON'T YOU TRY KISSING MY ASS?

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,660
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,GARY?

53
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,090
NAVARRO!GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME. FOCUS.

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,650
I WANT TO SEE SOME CONTACT.

55
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,510

56
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,120
KID DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE'S 
READY FOR ROOKIE BALL.</i>

57
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,970

58
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,040

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,340
GO AHEAD. TAKE A SWING AT ME.

63
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,220
I'LL PLANT YOU WHERE YOU STAND.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,730
I AM NOT GOING TO HIT YOU!

65
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,780
WHO SAID ANYTHING   ABOUT HITTING,MAN?

66
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,530
THAT'S IT,NAVARRO.    YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,820
I WANT TO SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE AFTER PRACTICE.

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,660
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,010
DON'T TOUCH ME!

74
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,880
<i>THIS KID ISN'T READY,MAN.</i>

75
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,110
<i>THIS WAS A BIG WASTE OF TIME.</i>

76
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,560
<i>READY FOR THE BIGS,MY ASS.</i>

77
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,020

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,950
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG    WITH ME!

86
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,710
WELL,IT BEATS THAT DITCH IN THE WOODS.

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,580
NOT BY MUCH.

88
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,840
IT'S JUST   A DAY OR TWO.

89
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,850
LET ISABELLE  GET RESTED UP,

90
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,810
THEN WE'LL PUSH ON    THE REST OF THE WAY.

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,410
WE GOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TO WHITE BIRD?

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
NEW CAR...

93
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,360
TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM...

94
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,390
IT'S GOING    TO BE CLOSE.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,580
ALL THIS RUNNING AND HIDING,

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,920
SOMETIMES I FORGET WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,190
THREE DEAD MEN IN THE WOODS MIGHT DISAGREE.

98
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,260
DO YOU WANT TO SHOWER FIRST,OR SHOULD I?

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,770
YOU GO AHEAD.

100
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,490

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,840
THAT WAS YOU,WASN'T IT?

102
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,320
WHO STOPPED THOSE MEN    IN THE WOODS?

103
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,250
DADDY SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

104
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,400
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME,ARE YOU?

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,020
WHAT'S FUNNY?

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
MARMADUKE.

107
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,190
CAN WE GET A DOG?

108
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,450
OH,SMOOTH,HOW YOU SLID THAT IN THERE.

109
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,060
NO.

110
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,430

I'M GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU.    YOU'RE MY SISTER.

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,640
IT'S JUST... IT'S BEEN A WHILE,THAT'S ALL.

115
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,480
NO,WE'RE HERE,JUST HAVING BREAKFAST.

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,290
HANG ON A SEC.

117
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,960
MRS. LENNOX MUST'VE FORGOTTEN HER KEY.

118
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,520
I'LL GET IT.

119
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,640
NO,NO. NO,I'LL GET IT.  YOU JUST KEEP EATING.

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560

I HAVE A BOOTH.

133
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,130
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T    GOTTEN YOUR TICKETS YET.

134
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,920

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,790
HOW COME I NEVER MET YOU BEFORE?

145
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,500
-IT'S COMPLICATED. -WE'VE BEEN BUSY.

146
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,710

THIS COUCH LOOKS COMFORTABLE.

151
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,180
IT'S NOT AN EXECUTION,SHAWN.

152
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,690
LAST TIME I WAS ON STAGE
WAS MY FOURTH-GRADE  SPELLING BEE.

153
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,580

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,730
WHAT SAY    WE GET DOWN TO BUSINESS?

180
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,380
IAN DRAVITT.

181
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,030
FOUNDER AND CEO    OF EXECUTIVE PROJECTIONS,

182
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,370
A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION   BASED IN ZIMBABWE.

183
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,920
YOUR COMPANY WANTS TO DO 
BUSINESS IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY,

184
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,400
THEY'LL SHOW YOU  THE LAY OF THE LAND.

185
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,050
IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE--

186
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,120
YEAH,ON THE SURFACE,

187
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,970
BUT DRAVITT'S REAL MONEY COMES 
FROM MERCENARY ACTIVITY  AND ARMS DEALING.

188
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,920
SOLD GRENADE LAUNCHERS   TO THE I.R.A.,

189
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,210
WHITE PHOSPHORUS LANDMINES TO 
THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN PERU...

190
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,450
SO WHAT'S HE SELLING   TO COLLIER?

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,140
GOOD QUESTION,

192
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,240
BUT OUR OBSERVATION TEAMS CAN'T EVEN
 TELL YOU WHAT TIME COLLIER TAKES LUNCH.

193
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,360
BEYOND THE LOBBY,THAT PLACE IS A MYSTERY.

194
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,550
I MEAN,WE'VE SENT OUR AGENTS 
IN DISGUISED AS AIR CONDITIONING GUYS,

195
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,890
FIBER OPTICS REPAIRMEN--

196
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,330
YEAH,WE GET A BUG IN,
IT'S YANKED BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER.

197
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,040
PROBABLY SWEEPING THE PLACE    EVERY FEW HOURS.

198
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,420
AS FAR AS COLLIER'S POW-WOWS WITH DRAVITT...

199
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,050
ALL WE CAN DO    IS GUESS.

200
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,570
YOU THINK    HE'S STOCKPILING WEAPONS?

201
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,170
OH,ARMS,ANTHRAX--

202
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,740
NOTHING WOULD SURPRISE ME.

203
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,410
I MEAN,COLLIER'S ALL BUT SAID 
HE'S AT WAR WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,110
COULD BE LAYING DOWN 
A DEFENSE PERIMETER AROUND THE CENTER.

205
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,320
THAT WAY,IF WE EVER HAVE TO GO IN THERE,HE'LL BE READY.

206
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,420
THINK WACO.

207
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,420
JONESTOWN.

208
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,260
JARVIS.

209
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,650
I'LL SEND THEM DOWN.

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
MR. NAVARRO?

211
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,300
I'M AGENT SKOURIS.   THIS IS AGENT--

212
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
PLEASE... PLEASE,DON'T TALK.

213
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,680
IT'S TOO NOISY.

214
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,600
YOUR VOICES AND YOUR THOUGHTS,THEY JUST ALL BLEED TOGETHER.

215
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,480
THE E.R. REPORT SAID YOU WERE GOING ON ABOUT--

216
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,720
NO VOICES.

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,820
JUST CONCENTRATE   ON WHAT YOU WANT TO ASK ME,

218
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,060
AND I'LL HEAR YOU.

219
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,620
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

220
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,760
IT WAS DURING A GAME.

221
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,690
I COULD HEAR EVERYONE'S THOUGHTS.

222
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,580
AT FIRST,IT WAS JUST THE PITCHER,WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD,ACTUALLY...

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,660
BECAUSE I KNEW EVERYTHING  HE WAS GOING TO THROW BEFORE HE THREW IT.

224
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,740
WENT FIVE FOR FIVE.

225
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,180
TWO HOMERS,TWO SINGLES,AND A DOUBLE.

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,190
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT--

227
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,800
YEAH,IT WAS GREAT   WHEN IT STARTED,

228
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,540
BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

229
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,560
FIRST,IT WAS    EVERYONE ON THE TEAM,

230
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,140
AND THEN EVERYONE IN THE STANDS,

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,820
AND THEN,I DON'T KNOW,IT WAS JUST...

232
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,040
JUST EVERYONE.

233
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,570
IT'S LIKE  THIS OCEAN OF NOISE CRASHING AROUND IN MY HEAD.

234
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,690
I WANT SOMEONE   TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.

235
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,420
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

236
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,450
I WAS THIS CLOSE...

237
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,440
TO MAKING IT TO THE MAJORS  WHEN I GOT SNATCHED.

238
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,090
THIS TIME,I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

239
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,180
I HAVE TO MAKE IT.

240
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,370
WHAT,SO NAVARRO IS REALLY SOME KIND OF MIND READER?

241
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,100
I BELIEVE "TELEPATH" IS THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

242
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,350
WELL,CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE
 IF THE WORD MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,

243
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,330
BUT THE GUY DEFINITELY KNEW WHAT WE WERE THINKING.

244
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,870
INTERESTING GIFT.

245
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,100
I COULD THINK OF A FEW PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR IT.

246
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,040
DR. OSTMAN GAVE HIM SOME HALOPERIDOL.

247
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,250
IT CALMED HIM DOWN,QUIETED THE NOISE SOME.

248
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,710
SO HE CAN FUNCTION AS LONG AS HE'S ON  ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS?

249
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,360
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIT HIM  FOR ANY STRAITJACKET,

250
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,280
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HITTING ANY KNUCKLEBALLS EITHER,

251
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,790
WHICH IS ALL HE WANTS TO DO.

252
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,390
YEAH,I'LL PUT  NTAC MEDICAL ON IT.

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,410
IF THEY CAN HELP HIM,THEY WILL.

254
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,720
GREAT.

255
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,620
KYLE BALDWIN.

256
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,460
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

257
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,550
THERE IT IS.

258
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,660
BALDWIN...

259
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,260
NOPE.

260
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,650
YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER.

261
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,960
SURE I AM. I GOT IN LAST SEMESTER.

262
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,190
I JUST TOOK DEFERRED ADMISSION.

263
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,910
EXCEPT YOUR TUITION    HASN'T BEEN PAID.

264
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,820
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

265
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,050
MY DAD SENT A CHECK.

266
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,280
NOPE.

267
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,220
BALDWIN.

268
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

269
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,060
I'VE GOT NAVARRO'S   TRANSFER FORMS RIGHT HERE.

270
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,220
YOU SIGN THEM,HE'S ON HIS WAY TO NTAC MEDICAL.

271
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,630
YEAH,I WILL,BUT NOT JUST YET.

272
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,200
WHY NOT?

273
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,510
WELL,WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER AND IAN DRAVITT ARE UP TO.

274
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,020
A 4400 WHO CAN READ MINDS JUST WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

275
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,030
YOU WANT TO USE NAVARRO  AS A MOLE?

276
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,080
IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?

277
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,930
MM-HMM. D.C. CLEARED IT.

278
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,310
WELL,HOW ABOUT ETHICAL?

279
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,520
GUY'S ASKING US FOR HELP.

280
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,360
HELL,HE'S EVEN BEGGING US.

281
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,430
AND WE'LL HELP HIM.

282
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,790
BUT HE'S GOT TO HELP US FIRST.

283
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,560
WHAT IF HE SAYS NO?

284
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,140
THEN YOU'LL GET HIM   TO SAY YES.

285
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,990
EXCUSE ME.

286
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,090
CAN WE GET ONE MORE BLANKET?

287
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,850
THE ONE WE HAVE    IS KIND OF THIN.

288
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,360
YEAH,WELL,THEY'RE ALL KIND OF THIN,

289
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,610
BUT IF YOU WANT    TO BRING IT DOWN,I'LL SWITCH YOU.

290
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,910
OH,I THINK WE MIGHT NEED BOTH.

291
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,180
YOU MIGHT THINK YOU NEED THEM,

292
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,730
BUT YOU AREN'T   GOING TO GET THEM.

293
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,660
SEE,THERE'S ONLY SO MANY ROOMS  AND SO MANY BLANKETS.

294
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,790
AND YOU HAVE YOUR ALLOTMENT.

295
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,020
MY BABY IS COLD.

296
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,510
CAN I PLEASE  HAVE ONE MORE BLANKET SO SHE DOESN'T GET SICK?

297
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,410
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS.

298
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,390
I'M A SUCKER FOR A PRETTY FACE.

299
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,940
HE WASN'T VERY NICE TO US,WAS HE?

300
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,270
HERE.

301
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,360
THANK YOU

302
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,030
WHAT OF THAY CATCH ME?

303
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,350
WE'LL BE MONITORING YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY

304
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,740
WE PLANT A TINY TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER
BEHIND YOUR EAR UNDER THE SKIN

305
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,860
TAKES 10 MINUTES,NO SCAR

306
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,510
IF THINGS GO SOUTH
WE'LL BE IN THERE LIKE THE CAVALRY

307
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,350
WHEN I WAS A KID,MY,UH

308
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,770
MY FAVORITE SHOW WAS
<<THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.>>

309
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,620
30 YEARS,JUST GONE IN A SNAP

310
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,410
MY LITTLE BROTHER IS RETIRING

311
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,300
FROM THE TACOMA POLICE FORCE
AT THE END OF THE YEAR

312
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,210
HE'S 53

313
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,120
THE GUYS I PLAYED BALL WITH?

314
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,240
THE ONES THAT MADE IT TO THE MAJORS ARE... 

315
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,980
SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS AT CARD SHOWS NOW

316
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,470
THE GAME IS ALL I HAVE

317
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,340
YEAH,I GET THAT

318
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,250
WHAT,DID YOU PLAY BALL?

319
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,180
SENIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE

320
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,380
I BLEW MY KNEE OUT
TRYING TO SLIDE UNDER A TAG

321
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,730
WHAT POSITION?

322
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
THIRD BASE

323
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,960
ANOTHER INFIELDER,HUH?

324
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,970
YOU MISS IT?

325
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,570
ALL THE TIME

326
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,000
BUT WHAT WE DO HERE,GARY

327
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,210
WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO FOR US...

328
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,240
IT'S NOT THE WORLD SERIES

329
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,340
BUT IT'S PRETTY DAMN IMPORTANT

330
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,540
I DO THIS FOR YOU GUYS...

331
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,360
YOU'RE GONNA FIX ME,RIGHT?

332
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,340
YOU HAVE MY WORD

333
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,380
OKAY

334
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,190
SORRY ABOUT DINNER

335
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,160
NEW CASE

336
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,380
WELL,I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME

337
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,210
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SORRY ABOUT?

338
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,330
DINNER?

339
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
ASK ME HOW MY FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE WAS

340
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,600
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE?

341
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,740
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE

342
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
NOBODY PAID MY TUITION

343
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,580
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

344
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,250
OF COURSE I DID
THAT'S RIDICULOUS

345
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,920
I TRIED CALLING YOU A BUNCH OF TIMES

346
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,190
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR PHONE

347
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,250
I WAS IN MEETINGS ALL DAY

348
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,460
I KNOW I WROTE THAT CHECK

349
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,130
THAT'S GREAT,DAD

350
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,080
I'M SORRY,KYLE
I MUST HAVE FORGOT

351
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,610
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS

352
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,670
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

353
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,190
HERE. BRING IT IN TOMORROW

354
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,530
I'LL SEND A NOTE

355
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,900
OR I'LL TALK TO THE REGISTRAR MYSELF

356
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,000
WHATEVER YOU WANT

357
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,890
HERE

358
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,180
KYLE! DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME

359
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,140
JUST... LOOK

360
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,880
I ADMIT IT

361
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,670
I'M NOT DENYING IT,I SCREWED UP

362
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,680
BUT WORK'S BEEN A LITTLE CRAZY--

363
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,050
OH,THE JOB?

364
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,920
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT ONE

365
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,140
FINALLY FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES AROUND HERE

366
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,230
WHAT'S THIS?

367
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
LILY?

368
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,200
WHAT IS IT?

369
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,570
DID YOU SPEND ALL THE CASH
BUYING THIS STUFF?

370
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,270
THEN WHAT? TALK TO ME

371
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,500
THE CASH REGISTER  AT THE FRONT DESK...

372
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,550
WAS OPEN...

373
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,880
AND WE NEEDED FOOD

374
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,410
AND ISABELLE NEEDED DIAPERS

375
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,870
YOU STOLE MONEY?

376
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,050
IT'S NOT LIKE I PLANNED IT

377
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,970
I MEAN,I HAD TO BEG FOR A BLANKET

378
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,590
AND THE DRAWER WAS OPEN,SO...

379
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,830
HE LEFT YOU STANDING THERE
WITH THE CASH REGISTER OPEN?

380
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,950
NO,NO,HE CLOSED IT

381
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,970
AT LEAST I THOUGHT HE DID
I DON'T KNOW--

382
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,740
IT WASN'T OPEN,AND THEN--

383
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,170
AND THEN IT WAS OPEN

384
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,060
THAT STILL DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT

385
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,470
THAT'S NOT HOW I LIVE MY LIFE

386
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,630
HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND?

387
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,140
'CAUSE THIS ISN'T HOW I PLANNED
TO LIVE MY LIFE EITHER

388
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,080
LOOK,I KNOW IT WAS WRONG

389
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,130
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME IT WAS WRONG

390
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,690
STOP SHAKING YOUR HEAD

391
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,510
JUST EAT SOMETHING,OKAY?

392
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,370
IT'S SILLY FOR ALL THIS FOOD
TO GO TO WASTE

393
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,900
GO AHEAD

394
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,490
I'M NOT HUNGRY

395
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,870
HOW MUCH FUN WAS THAT?

396
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,830
I LIKED IT. THANK YOU

397
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,110
SO WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

398
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,810
YOUR NOTE JUST SAID "OUT."

399
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,320
LOTS OF PLACES
THE PIER,PIKE STREET

400
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,990
AND EVEN THE FERRY

401
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,750
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO--

402
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,100
YOU DIDN'T!

403
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,970
I TOLD YOU SHE'D FREAK!

404
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,640
RELAX,THEY'RE RUB-ONS

405
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,940
AS IN "FAKE."

406
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,810
BUT THEY'RE PRETTY,AREN'T THEY?

407
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,660
OH,YEAH,THEY'RE VERY PRETTY

408
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,690
NOW WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET STARTED ON YOUR HOMEWORK?

409
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,500
I'M IN TROUBLE

410
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,560
DO YOU AT LEAST LIKE THE SHIRT?

411
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,730
AND BY THE WAY--

412
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,810
YOU LIVE IN SEATTLE

413
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,240
AND YOUR KID'S NEVER
HEARD OF KURT COBAIN?

414
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,720
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,DI?

415
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,150
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE TO TEACH HER

416
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,720
ALL ABOUT TATTOOS
AND SUICIDAL ROCK STARS

417
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,830
AND BY THE WAY

418
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,320
WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO TAKE HER OUT OF SCHOOL?

419
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,560
I'M HER AUNT

420
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,500
I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED PERMISSION

421
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,440
WELL,IF YOU'RE GOING
TO SEND HER TEACHER HOME FOR THE DAY

422
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,130
YOU DO

423
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,460
SITTING AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE
ALL DAY LONG?

424
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,790
YEAH,THAT'S A BIG LOSS

425
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,920
WHAT ARE YOU KEEPING
THIS KID LOCKED AWAY FOR?

426
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,590
IF I WANTED YOUR OPINION
ON HOW I'M RAISING MY DAUGHTER

427
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,360
I'D ASK

428
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,220
MOMMY?

429
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,150
WHAT'S WRONG,SWEETHEART?

430
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,030
I THINK I HAVE TO THROW UP

431
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,750
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER TO EAT?

432
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,280
ANYTHING SHE WANTED

433
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,000

BUT OUR MAIN TARGET IS IAN DRAVITT

439
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,830

441
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,460
YOU HAVE A TWO-WEEK SUPPLY OF HALOPERIDOL

442
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,580

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,700

IN A COUPLE OF DAYS

444

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,490
HOW DID YOU KNOW I PLAYED BALL?

ALL THOSE YEARS LOST?

469
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,990

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,840
NO,NO,NO,NO,NO

533
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,390
NOT YET. NOT YET

534
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,620
MAYBE HE CAN TALK HIS WAY OUT OF IT

535
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,870
NOW WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

536
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,930
LET HIM GO

537
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,120
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL
WHO YOU LET IN YOUR MANOR,MY SON

538
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,730
WE DETAINED HIM
AS A PROFESSIONAL COURTESY

539
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,380
JORDAN,THESE GUYS ARE THUGS

540
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,040
NO NEED FOR NAME-CALLING

541
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,950
WE MERELY HAPPENED UPON THIS GENTLEMAN

542
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,860
IN THE PROCESS OF SPYING
ON THE TWO OF YOU

543
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,000
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU
THAT'S ALL

544
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,800
I MEAN,I SAW YOU GUYS WERE
HAVING AN ARGUMENT OR SOMETHING

545
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,330
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,INTERRUPT?

546
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,430
WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT?

547
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,530
BECAUSE IT'S NO BIG SECRET

548
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,100
I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE TALKING--

549
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,070
SHAWN,ENOUGH

550
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,150
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
I'M TIED UP A LOT OF THE TIME

551
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
GARY,IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

552
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,190
ANY OF MY STAFF... 
WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP

553
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,200
YEAH,SORRY
NEXT TIME I'LL KNOW BETTER

554
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,730
ALL RIGHT

555
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,250
GO ON BACK INSIDE

556
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,970
CAREFUL WHERE HE WANDERS

557
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,040
NO ONE'S GETTING
BETWEEN ME AND $30 MILLION

558
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,890
RICHARD?

559
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,370
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

560
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,230
THE POLICE

561
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,650
OH,MY GOD

562
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,960
I'M SO SORRY

563
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,320
I'LL TELL THEM I TOOK THE MONEY

564
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,180
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT

565
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,460
POLICE,OPEN UP

566
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,820
GIVE US A MINUTE!

567
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,070
OPEN UP. NOW!

568
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,730
THEY'RE NOT AFTER US

569
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,890
WE'RE OKAY

570
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,320
GUYS? YOU THERE?

571
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,370
GO AHEAD,GARY

572
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,350
YEAH,SORRY I'VE BEEN SO OUT OF TOUCH

573
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,770
THEY HAD ME IN THESE CLASSES ALL MORNING

574
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,490
I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN COLLIER ALL DAY

575
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,660
OR THAT OTHER GUY

576
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,710
WELL,THAT'S OKAY

577
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,180
YOU JUST GO WHERE THEY TELL YOU

578
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,110
YEAH,BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO KNOW MORE

579
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,950
ABOUT THAT MONEY  THAT COLLIER'S SHELLING OUT?

580
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,010
WHERE ARE MY MEDS?

581
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,800
GARY,WHAT'S WRONG?

582
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,940
MY MEDS,THEY'RE GONE.I DON'T--

583
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,500
UH,EXCUSE ME?

584
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,820
I,UH,I HAD A PRESCRIPTION

585
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,330
SOME TRANQUILIZERS IN MY ROOM

586
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,550
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE

587
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,260
YOU DON'T NEED THOSE

588
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,360
YOU'VE BEEN CONDITIONED
TO THINK YOU NEED THEM

589
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,830
TAKING ANYTHING THAT SUPPRESSES
YOUR NATURAL OPENNESS

590
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,850
IS COUNTERINTUITIVE TO OUR PROGRAM

591
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,700
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT THROUGH

592
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,980
THE NUTRITION AND PURIFICATION LECTURE AGAIN

593
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,350
DID YOU HEAR THAT,BALDWIN?

594
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,930
THEY TOOK THE HALOPERIDOL!

595
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,870
YES,GARY,I HEARD IT

596
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,420
YOU WANT TO ABORT?
YOU WANT TO WALK OUT OF THERE?

597
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,440
EVERYTHING IS JUST-- JUST--

598
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,660
GETTING LOUDER IN MY HEAD ALREADY

599
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,060
IT'S ALREADY GETTING WORSE

600
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,870
VOICES ARE STARTING
TO BLEED THROUGH THE WALLS

601
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,490
JUST CALM DOWN,GARY.

602
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,660
WE'LL COME AND GET YOU IF WE NEED TO.

603
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,870
IT'S YOUR CALL.

604
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,230
GARY,TALK TO ME.

605
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,700
OKAY. UM...

606
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,190
Y-Y-YOU GUYS  ARE GOING TO HOLD UP

607
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,700
YOUR END OF THIS DEAL,RIGHT?

608
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,300
YES. OF COURSE.

609
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,960
<i>OKAY,OKAY.</i>

610
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,590
I'LL,UH,I'LL HOLD UP MY END,

611
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,580
AND I'LL HANG IN    AS LONG AS I CAN.

612
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,360
GOOD. WE'LL HANG IN WITH YOU.

613
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,210
NOW,LISTEN,GARY,

614
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,700
SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE ON THIS CHANNEL 24/7,REMEMBER?

615
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,140
YEAH RIGHT 

616
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,730
RIGHT

617
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,590
I,UH,
I READ<THE SECRET SHARER>LAST NIGHT.

618
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,710
JUST LIKE YOUR SYLLABUS SAID. 
THAT'S A GOOD START.

619
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,480
WELL,NOT JUST THE FIRST 20 PAGES.

620
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,590
I GOT REALLY INTO IT
I READ THE WHOLE THING.

621
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,800
19TH-CENTURY NOVELLAS NOT QUITE 
THE HELL ON EARTH  YOU EXPECTED?

622
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,140
IT DEFINITELY WASN'T BORING.

623
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,560
I'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS,THOUGH.

624
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,530
OKAY,WELL,
I HAVE OFFICE HOURS WEDNESDAYS,ONE TO FOUR.

625
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,310
OKAY,YEAH,I'LL TRY TO STOP BY.

626
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,430
OR WE COULD RUN BY 
THE COOP  AND GRAB SOME COFFEE?

627
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,610
LIKE,RIGHT NOW?

628
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,740
I LIKE TALKING  ABOUT JOSEPH CONRAD.

629
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,160
IT'S WHY I PICKED THIS   FOR A LIVING.

630
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,180
WHERE DID YOU LEARN  TO DO ALL THIS?

631
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,710
MOM NEVER TAUGHT US  TO COOK.

632
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,020
I DON'T KNOW
I JUST LEARNED HOW.

633
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,170
HAD TO BE BETTER THAN YOU AT SOMETHING.

634
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,970
AUNT APRIL,DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS?

635
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,150
NOPE.

636
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,460
NO KIDS.

637
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,330
ARE YOU MARRIED?

638
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,280
I USED TO BE.

639
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,510
ASK YOUR MOM WHAT 
SHE THOUGHT OF MY EX-HUSBAND.

640
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,510
DON'T START.

641
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,310
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM?

642
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,470
NEITHER DID APRIL,APPARENTLY.

643
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,530
SHE ONLY STAYED  WITH TREVOR FOR WHAT,SEVEN MONTHS?

644
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,760
YOU WERE HOSTILE FROM DAY ONE.

645
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,530
YOU NEVER GAVE HIM   A CHANCE.

646
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,470
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK HE DESERVED    MUCH OF A CHANCE.

647
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,850
HE WAS... KIND OF A MORON.

648
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,100
HE WAS 22.

649
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,320
SHOW ME ONE GUY    WHO ISN'T A MORON AT 22.

650
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,340
HE KNEW   YOU HATED HIM,

651
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,930
AND THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT   ANY EASIER

652
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,160
FOR US TO STAY TOGETHER.

653
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:32,730
COME ON.

654
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,540
YOU CAN'T KEEP BLAMING THAT ON ME.

655
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,150
I MEAN,JUST GROW UP.

656
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,900
OKAY,THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

657
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,450
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD  IDEA TO COME HERE,

658
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,080
BUT OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG.

659
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,870
I'LL GO PACK.

660
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,420
THERE'S A LITTLE HOTEL   UP THE STREET.

661
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,310
NO!

662
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,980
IT'S OKAY,HONEY.    WE'LL STILL SEE--

663
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,390
BUT THE POWER'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE TONIGHT,

664
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,920
AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY LIGHTS.

665
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,940
WHAT IS SHE   TALKING ABOUT?

666
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,850
CAN I PLEASE BE EXCUSED?

667
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,150
MR. NAVARRO,IS SOMETHING WRONG?

668
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,580
THIS IS NO GOOD. I NEED MY HALOPERIDOL.

669
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,260
WHERE'S COLLIER?

670
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,690
MR. COLLIER'S IN A MEETING.

671
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,900
MR. NAVARRO?

672
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,000
MR. NAVARRO...

673
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,990
[DIANA]: <i>GARY,WHAT'S WRONG?</i>

674
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,940
[GARY]: <i>I JUST GOT</i>  <i>TO TALKTO COLLIER.</i>

675
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,920
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,GARY.

676
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,740
MR. NAVARRO--

677
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,480
HE'S IN A MEETING!

678
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,100
MAKE IT STOP.

679
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,820
PLEASE,MAKE IT STOP.

680
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,520
MAKE IT STOP.

681
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,230
I NEED MY MEDICATION.

682
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,330
WHATEVER'S EATING YOU,OLD SON,WE'LL MAKE IT STOP.

683
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,320
COUNT ON THAT.

684
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,960
A 4400 WHO CAN READ MINDS?

685
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,900
SO YOU DO HAVE AN ABILITY.

686
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,570
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED TO ME,GARY.

687
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,690
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

688
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,990
THAT THIS GUY KNOWS   WHAT I'M THINKING?

689
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,030
BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE ANYONE INSIDE MY HEAD BUT ME.

690
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,640
JORDAN,THIS GUY'S ONE OF US.

691
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,530
WE CAN'T JUST STAND HERE AND LET HIM GET KILLED.

692
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,910
NOBODY'S KILLING ANYONE.

693
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,330
FIRST WE DETERMINE WHAT OUR MAN HERE KNOWS

694
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,260
AND THEN WE DISCUSS HIS FATE.

695
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,890
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS I KNOW   THAT COULD GET YOU KILLED!

696
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,950
THAT COULD GET   ALL OF YOU KILLED.

697
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,290
CALL JARVIS.    TELL HER WE'RE GOING IN.

698
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,590
LOOK,IAN--

699
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,920
SHUT UP!

700
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,100
SHUT UP NOW!

701
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,450
HI. I'M EVAN.   WELCOME TO THE 4400 CENTER.

702
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,470
SECOND LEVEL'S NOT OPEN  TO VISITORS.

703
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,120
WE'RE NOT VISITORS.

704
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
HEY,LOOK,BUDDY,I'VE GOT A BADGE TOO,

705
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,210
AND THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

706
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,800
WHAT THE HELL'S    HE DOING TO HIM?

707
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,110
LET HIM GO,

708
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,940
OR SO HELP ME,

709
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,660
I'LL SPLATTER YOUR BRAINS

710
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,720
ALL OVER   YOUR HIGHLY POLISHED FLOOR.

711
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,590
NOW,THAT IS ENOUGH.

712
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,120
DROP THAT WEAPON! NOW!

713
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,630
HOW THE HELL  DID YOU GET IN HERE?

714
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,210
YOU DON'T SOUND SO HAPPY   TO SEE US.

715
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,340
WELL,NOW.    WHAT IN THE HELL IS THIS?

716
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,640
NTAC AGENTS.

717
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,440
I DON'T APPRECIATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERFERING IN MY BUSINESS.

718
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,200
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WHO YOU DO BUSINESS WITH.

719
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,210
THEY'RE NOT BUYING WEAPONS.

720
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,590
THEY'RE PLANNING A COUP OVERSEAS,SOME TINY COUNTRY.

721
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,760
YOU SENT A SPY IN HERE,UNCLE TOMMY?

722
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,240
GOOD JOB.

723
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,420
YOU ALMOST GOT US ALL KILLED.

724
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,870
YOU TOO,MR. DRAVITT.

725
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,170
WELL,IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

726
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,580
IF YOUR FRIEND'S IMPRESSIONS WILL STAND UP IN COURT.

727
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,700
I GUESS I'M THE ONE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL

728
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,780
WHO I DO BUSINESS WITH.

729
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,730
SHAWN,YOU CAN COME WITH US  IF YOU WANT.

730
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,210
GREAT.

731
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,710
I'LL TELL YOUR MOTHER YOU SAID HELLO.

732
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,260
GARY,YOU SHOULD HAVE    COME TO ME FIRST.

733
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,890
I'D HAVE TREATED YOU BETTER THAN THEY EVER WILL.

734
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,300
<i>WE'RE AT WAR HERE.</i>

735
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,580
<i>DON'T PICK THE LOSING SIDE.</i>

736
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,070
LOOK AT THE CUTE LITTLE BABY.

737
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,500
I THINK SOMEBODY WANTS TO TRY YOUR TOY,WALT.

738
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,430
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

739
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,040
HI.

740
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,200
HI.

741
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,110
PUT HER BACK IN THE CAR?

742
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,230
WHY?

743
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
NOW,PLEASE.

744
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,760
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

745
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,290
THAT LITTLE BOY WAS BEING SWEET WITH HER.

746
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,140
I JUST DIDN'T WANT    ANYBODY GETTING HURT.

747
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,950
HURT?    WHO'S GOING TO GET HURT?

748
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,060
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE TOY BACK?

749
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,000
WHAT'S GOING  TO HAPPEN THEN?

750
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,810
DON'T LOOK AT ME

751
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,400
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

752
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,820
THOSE THREE MEN  IN THE WOODS...

753
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,420
THEY WANTED US DEAD.

754
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,990
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.   THAT WAS ISABELLE.

755
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,740
WE BOTH KNOW IT,

756
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,070
AND THERE'S NO USE    IN PRETENDING OTHERWISE.

757
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,190
WHATEVER ISABELLE DOES,SHE DOES IT OUT OF LOVE FOR US.

758
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,560
SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER,RICHARD.

759
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,560
I KNOW SHE IS.

760
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,050
I LOVE HER RIGHT BACK,BUT SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE TOO,

761
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,650
AND I WISH TO GOD  I KNEW WHAT THAT WAS.

762
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,910
WHAT IS IT?

763
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,650
WHAT'S WRONG?

764
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,080
I'M FINE.

765
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,290
SO,WHAT?

766
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,330
SO COLLIER PLANNED TO SPEND   $30 MILLION

767
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,720
FUNDING MERCENARY ACTIVITY  IN SAO TOME?

768
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,390
THEY'VE HAD THREE COUPS SINCE    THEIR INDEPENDENCE IN '75.

769
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,450
MY GUESS?

770
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,650
COLLIER WAS TRYING  TO BUY NUMBER FOUR.

771
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,390
DID GARY HAPPEN TO HEAR

772
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,230
WHY COLLIER'S SO INTERESTED  IN AN ISLAND

773
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,460
OFF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA?

774
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,610
WITHOUT HIS MEDICATION,

775
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,670
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE GOT  THAT MUCH OUT OF HIM.

776
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,420
YEAH,BUT WE DO KNOW

777
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,310
THAT COLLIER THINKS HE'S HEADED TOWARDS A CONFLICT WITH SOMEONE

778
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,690
NTAC,THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT,I DON'T KNOW.

779
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,050
HE INSTALLS    A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT IN SAO TOME.

780
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,810
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PLACE TO GO  WHEN THINGS HEAT UP.

781
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,280
WHAT,LIKE A HOMELAND  FOR THE 4400?

782
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,330
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE A MAN FOR DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

783
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,660
THEY'RE NOT DELUSIONS

784
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,620
IF YOU CAN MAKE  THEM COME TRUE.

785
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,330
WE'RE ALWAYS  ONE STEP BEHIND COLLIER

786
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,620
BECAUSE WE KEEP SEEING HIM    AS SOME KIND OF CULT NUT.

787
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,830
WHAT WE SHOULD BE  ASKING OURSELVES IS,

788
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,310
BEFORE COLLIER WAS ABDUCTED,

789
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,660
DID HE EVER SET HIS MIND  TO SOMETHING

790
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,880
AND... NOT GET IT DONE?

791
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,340
THEY DIDN'T MAKE HIM ANY DUMBER IN THAT BALL OF LIGHT.

792
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,290
WELL,ANYWAY,WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER WAS THINKING.

793
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,130
GARY FOUND OUT   FOR US.

794
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,210
TIME TO TURN HIM OVER  TO NTAC MEDICAL,RIGHT?

795
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,750
SOON.

796
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,500
"SOON"?

797
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,760
THE NSA IS CC'D

798
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,280
ANY TIME WE REGISTER A NEW 4400 ABILITY.

799
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,570
THEY HAVE BEEN LEANING ON D.C.

800
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,330
TO BORROW GARY FOR AN OP  THEY'VE GOT PLANNED.

801
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,750
NO-- NO MORE CLOAK-AND-DAGGER STUFF.

802
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,840
HE'LL SIT IN ON A FEW CONFERENCES.

803
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,040
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH DIPLOMATS.

804
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,570
THEY DON'T ALWAYS SAY WHAT THEY THINK.

805
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,460
THAT WASN'T THE AGREEMENT    I MADE WITH HIM.

806
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,720
BUT TERMS HAVE CHANGED.

807
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,670
GARY'S TOO VALUABLE.

808
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,760
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

809
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,310
YOU'RE TURNING ME INTO A LIAR.

810
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,950
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE GAME    ALMOST 20 YEARS.

811
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:58,530
MY GUESS IS,

812
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,970
YOU'VE COMMITTED ALL THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS,

813
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,370
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.

814
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
I SHOULD HAVE LET HIM   STAY WITH COLLIER.

815
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,360
HE MIGHT HAVE USED HIM,BUT HE WOULD'VE HELPED HIM TOO.

816
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,650
DON'T YOU <i>EVER</i> USE ME AGAIN.

817
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,180
ALL I WANTED WAS TO PLAY BALL.

818
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,680
YOU GUYS PROMISED TO HELP,

819
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,380
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT,CAN YOU?

820
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,880
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE 4400.

821
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,000
IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT US.

822
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,870
YOU KNOW THAT BAR,MEL'S?

823
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,810
CORNER OF LANCASTER  AND THIRD?

824
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,880
YOU FEEL LIKE JOINING ME?

825
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,230
WE DON'T GO TO BARS.

826
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,260
WELL,I'M GOING TONIGHT,WITH YOU OR WITHOUT YOU.
