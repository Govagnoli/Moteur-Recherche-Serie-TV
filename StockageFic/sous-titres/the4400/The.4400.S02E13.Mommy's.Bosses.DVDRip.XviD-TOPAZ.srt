1
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:41,767
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

2
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,767
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,067
Previously on the 4400...

4
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,300
They just arrested a suspect

5
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,467
in the Collier killing.

6
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,134
Roy Marsden didn't kill
Jordan Collier.

7
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,168
And neither did you, Kyle.

8
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,467
Son of a bitch!

9
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,467
You go and you
tell your daddy

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,534
that he didn't kill anybody.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,834
If Maia's having visions,

12
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,168
you should know about it,

13
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,634
and you should know
what they are.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,500
Mommy's bosses
will be punished

15
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:03,500
for betraying us.

16
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:04,534
I want to go home.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,034
I know you do, honey,

18
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,634
but Dr. Hudson is going to take
very good care of you.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,333
Don't tell anyone
I can't heal.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,667
Sure.

21
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:12,634
What are you going to do?

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,201
What I have to.

23
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,467
If you're sick,

24
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,801
the responsible thing
is to report to NTAC,

25
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,700
but if you are well...

26
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,834
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,

27
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,700
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.

28
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,667
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood

29
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,801
of every 4400.

30
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,534
They even gave it a name.
They call it...

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,901
... "Promicin inhibitor".

32
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,001
Every time
they came to NTAC medical,

33
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,201
every checkup.

34
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,767
Your daughter
is the Rosetta Stone

35
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,634
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,367
We're her parents.
We decide.

37
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,901
Are you sure
you want to do this?

38
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,234
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,634
But if it comes down
to a choice

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,201
between the safety
of the American people

41
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,867
and the welfare
of the 4400,

42
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:51,801
Tom...

43
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,333
that's no choice at all.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,867
We tried being reasonable.

45
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,367
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.

46
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:23,168
Easy, McCullough.

47
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,433
Let me go! I'm not sick!

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,534
There's nothing wrong with me!

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,834
We know that,
but you're a 4400,

50
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,134
and everybody's
got to go in.

51
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,534
Come on...

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,534
Now, I don't want
to cuff you,

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,867
but if you run again,

54
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,400
you're going to
give me no choice.

55
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,834
"Quarantine"
is just a word to you guys.

56
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,767
Try living it.

57
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,634
Come on.

58
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:44,400
What are we
doing here, Diana?

59
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:45,534
This is so wrong.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,801
All right,
what do you suggest?

61
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,067
We walk into
the middle of NTAC,

62
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,234
and shout out,
"We did this.

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
We made them sick".

64
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,901
Yeah, yeah, that's good start.

65
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,734
We've got the medical records.
We can take them to Dennis.

66
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:56,300
You really think that Max Hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors

67
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,567
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400?

68
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:00,067
I mean, you really think
that they could do that

69
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,268
without approval?

70
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,600
Whose approval?

71
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,867
Dennis Ryland's, for one.

72
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,967
He was the head
of this division

73
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,234
when this whole thing
started.

74
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,767
I mean, you think
he didn't know?

75
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,467
Until we know
how far up this goes,

76
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:12,234
we've got to stay calm,
work quietly...

77
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,500
and watch our backs.

78
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,268
Don't tell me to calm down,
Lily.

79
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,934
How am I supposed to be calm

80
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,134
when my wife and daughter
left in the middle of the night?

81
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,634
We didn't leave you, Richard.

82
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,234
I just didn't feel
like Isabelle was safe there.

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,801
You've turned this
resisting quarantine

84
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,300
into your
personal mission.

85
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,801
NTAC turned it
into my personal mission

86
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,268
when they started
rounding us up.

87
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,367
And I admire
what you're doing,

88
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,001
but it's not my fight,

89
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,600
and I sure as hell won't let it
become Isabelle's fight.

90
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,300
Just tell me where you are.

91
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,567
Put my mind at ease.

92
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,700
I'll come see you.

93
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,168
Lily?

94
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm sorry.

95
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,467
I just feel like
it's better this way for now.

96
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,767
I'll call soon.

97
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,867
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.

98
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,834
911. Please state
the nature of...

99
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,234
I need an ambulance.

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,500
I'm... I'm sick.

101
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,934
I've got this...

102
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,134
Hello?

103
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,168
Hello?

104
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,567
Miss, are you there?

105
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,867
Never mind.

106
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,134
Think they're sharing
trade secrets?

107
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,333
Either that,

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,001
or she's asking
for her office back.

109
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,034
After you.

110
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,034
Thanks.

111
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,300
Nina.

112
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,400
Good to see you.

113
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,667
Thanks.

114
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,101
I wish the circumstances
were a little better.

115
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,433
We lost the first 4400s

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,001
to this thing
overnight.

117
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,667
Seven dead.

118
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,268
There'll be more
by day's end.

119
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,534
No word about a vaccine,
a cure?

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,433
I just got
off the phone with Hudson.

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,767
He said that they've worked
on a few things overnight.

122
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,567
I'm going to quarantine.

123
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,168
Diana...

124
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:28,400
I know this is frustrating,

125
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,234
but we've got
the best minds in the country,

126
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,268
in the world,

127
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,667
working on this.

128
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,234
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.

129
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,101
Alana could be next,

130
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,101
or Maia,

131
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,567
and still,

132
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:39,801
nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they?

133
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,168
We'll get it figured out.

134
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,201
Hey, sweetie.

135
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,067
It's me, Tom.

136
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,300
Who are you?

137
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,300
Who are you?

138
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,400
She was awake earlier.

139
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,333
Only for a few
minutes, though.

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,901
Did she say anything?

141
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,901
She talked about you.

142
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,600
Said you were going to
make everything okay.

143
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,433
I hope she's right.

144
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,234
Me too.

145
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,767
Let's go.

146
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,333
Where are we headed?

147
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,367
We've got
an appointment

148
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,867
with the good doctor
Hudson.

149
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,367
Diana, what...

150
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,667
what the hell
are you doing?

151
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,767
We've got some things
we need to talk about.

152
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,934
This guy your agents brought in,
Orson Bailey,

153
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,901
I think I can explain
how he developed this...

154
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,101
Jesus,
I can't even say the word.

155
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,901
Telekinesis.

156
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,168
Thank you.

157
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,467
The body produces four
main neurotransmitters.

158
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,867
They're like traffic cops
to the brain.

159
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,467
They control everything,
regulate everything.

160
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,433
Tell me something I don't know.

161
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.

162
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,234
We've never seen it before.

163
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,534
Nobody has.

164
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,134
I'm guessing
it factors into Bailey's ability

165
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,967
to bend spoons with his mind.

166
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,268
Let's just say Promicin

167
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,667
is basically a backstage pass

168
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,967
to the V.I.P. section of the brain.

169
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,600
He is using
parts of the cerebellum

170
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,400
no human has ever had access to.

171
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:44,834
I ran some tests
on the 4400s

172
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,268
who are still
in quarantine.

173
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,901
Every single one of them

174
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,901
is producing trace amounts
of Promicin.

175
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,201
So it's just a matter of time

176
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:55,333
before every 4400
develops telekinesis?

177
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,567
Promicin's behavior
is unpredictable.

178
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,734
They might not get telekinesis,

179
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:02,001
but they'll get something.

180
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,001
Put everything on paper.

181
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,001
I want to get
my talking points straight

182
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,467
before I try to explain this to D.C.

183
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,467
D.C. panicked.

184
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:11,867
I was ordered to work on a drug

185
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:12,767
to suppress
the production of Promicin

186
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,567
in the 4400.

187
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,734
Once I synthesized
the inhibitor,

188
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,268
we gave it to every 4400,

189
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,234
every time they came in
for a checkup.

190
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,534
But it doesn't even work.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,567
4400s are developing abilities
all the time.

192
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,067
A small percentage of them are,

193
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,667
but if it wasn't
for the inhibitor,

194
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:27,867
they'd all have them.

195
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,767
I know it didn't
work perfectly.

196
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,867
"Perfectly"?

197
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:33,034
Seven 4400s died last night.

198
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:34,834
It was your inhibitor
that did it.

199
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:36,034
You made them sick!

200
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,300
You think
I don't know that?

201
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,834
We weren't trying
to kill anyone.

202
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,801
We were preserving
the status quo,

203
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:41,767
doing a good thing.

204
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,201
I guess it backfired.

205
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,168
I am trying to undo it,

206
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,268
but if you want to
pull that trigger,

207
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,934
please, be my guest.

208
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,433
Maybe then
finally I'll get some sleep.

209
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,667
All right.

210
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,534
If you're not going to shoot me,
let me get back to work.

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,034
I don't want anyone else to die.

212
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,001
Alison?
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,367
They're going to
give Roy life.

214
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,700
They're going to
give him life,

215
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:18,700
and he's
going to take it.

216
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,667
What are you
talking about?

217
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,268
The state was going to go
for the death penalty,

218
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,934
and the public defender
convinced Roy

219
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,467
to take a plea bargain.

220
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:27,634
But they've got no case
against him.

221
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,734
My dad told me.

222
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,801
I don't know.

223
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:30,967
This lawyer,

224
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,134
he's handling, like,
10 different cases,

225
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,433
and he just
doesn't want to see

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,667
the inside
of a courtroom.

227
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,667
I don't know.

228
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,867
But he didn't do it, okay?

229
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,201
He didn't kill Jordan Collier.

230
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,234
You keep saying that.

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,400
Does your dad know something?

232
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,567
What?

233
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:44,400
Is there evidence
that they're hiding?

234
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,867
What?
You have to tell me.

235
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:47,201
If Roy takes this deal,

236
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,901
he can't even get parole
for 20 years.

237
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,234
He's not going to prison.

238
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,168
Why?

239
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,433
The 4400 came back August 14th.

240
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,201
Hudson discovered Promicin
October 11th.

241
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,700
So they probably gave

242
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,967
the first doses
of the inhibitor

243
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,500
sometime around
the end of the month.

244
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,567
But we have every
internal document

245
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,901
for october.

246
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,300
There's nothing
about any of this.

247
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,168
There's hardly even
a mention of Orson Bailey.

248
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,700
We both wrote reports
about him, Diana.

249
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,767
They're gone.

250
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,300
They were hoping

251
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,934
that was going to be
the only extrahuman ability

252
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,834
ever developed in a 4400.

253
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,667
If they destroy
all records of it...

254
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,134
nobody would ever know.

255
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,433
But this went to the top
of the food chain.

256
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,567
Here.

257
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:29,867
Britain, France, Korea...

258
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,001
... everywhere there's a sick 4400.

259
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,101
There has to be a paper trail.

260
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,467
Does it even matter?

261
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,901
I mean,
we could find a memo

262
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,500
signed by the entire
United Nations security council.

263
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,734
It's not going to cure anyone.

264
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,333
Diana, we delivered
confidential medical records

265
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,867
to Dr. Burkhoff.

266
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,467
We've got the so-called
"father of 4400 technology"

267
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:46,500
working on the case,

268
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,667
and you just
stuck a gun

269
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,333
to the head of NTAC's
medical director.

270
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,934
We've done everything we can

271
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,667
to get the right people
working on a cure.

272
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,333
That's if NTAC
even wants a cure.

273
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,134
Ryland's been talking
about people in D.C.

274
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,834
Who've been on a wartime footing
for months.

275
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:00,333
This is nothing
but a stroke of luck for them.

276
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,567
You think
they want them all dead?

277
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,901
I told you!

278
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,534
I told you
I wasn't safe here.

279
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,934
It's just a precaution, Kevin.

280
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,467
We think
you'll just be safer

281
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,234
if you move to
a less exposed location.

282
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,367
It's because
I told you

283
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,600
about that inhibitor
thing, right?

284
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,333
I spent six years
in a psychiatric hospital

285
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,767
suffering from paranoid
personality disorder.

286
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,067
As soon as I get out,

287
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,367
you two put me
smack in the middle

288
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,034
of a massive
conspiracy.

289
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,333
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning
all kinds of stories about NTAC.

290
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,700
Very interesting stuff.

291
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:30,634
Well, he can spin

292
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,534
all the theories
he wants,

293
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,801
just not here.

294
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,500
I'll make sure
he has a safe place to work.

295
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,467
I figured out what Promicin is.

296
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,268
That's the name they gave
the neurotransmitter,

297
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,834
right?

298
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,168
The one that gives the 4400
their abilities?

299
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:46,700
And if I can find
one 4400

300
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,967
that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor,

301
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,634
I think I can neutralize it.

302
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,268
Hey.

303
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,567
You scared me.

304
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,634
Why didn't you use
your key?

305
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,168
Oh, sorry.
My hands were full.

306
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:13,534
I brought you guys
some supplies.

307
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,901
You still like chocolate cherry?

308
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,934
That sounds great. Thank you.

309
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,268
Oh...

310
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,934
... you okay?

311
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,101
Yeah, just jumpy.

312
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,767
It's so quiet out here.

313
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:33,534
Yeah, a lot of places
have closed up for the season.

314
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,600
Oh, I thought that, uh...

315
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,500
maybe I could stay for
a little dinner or something.

316
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,467
You don't have to
get back home?

317
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,001
No, not really.

318
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,300
Carol's gone.

319
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
She found out

320
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,734
that you and I were talking.

321
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,734
Don't worry,
she doesn't know you're here,

322
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,268
but she got mad.

323
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,734
Brian, I'm sorry.

324
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,034
She'll stay away
for a few nights.

325
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,700
I'll stay on the couch
for a while...

326
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,867
but in the meantime,

327
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,500
Heidi's staying with a friend,

328
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,734
and I figured,
why eat alone?

329
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,101
Sure,

330
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,567
but I hope
you're not expecting much.

331
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,934
I haven't made pot roast
in a while.

332
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,134
You know, Lily,
the truth is...

333
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,268
I never
should have married Carol

334
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,300
in the first place.

335
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,500
What are you doing, Brian?

336
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:16,534
Come on.

337
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm alone.

338
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:18,967
You're alone.

339
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,367
You and Richard aren't happy.

340
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,901
That's not true.

341
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,268
We could have it back, Lily.

342
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,567
Don't, brian.

343
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,834
Why are you
fighting it?

344
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,433
Brian, stop it!
Let me go!

345
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,001
I don't want to hurt you, Lily!

346
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,634
Stop it!

347
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,767
You little bitch.

348
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,433
Hello?

349
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,268
Lily?
Are you okay?

350
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,567
Brian?

351
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,467
Yeah, I was going to
bring by some food.

352
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:08,001
Don't.

353
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,333
Something's not right here.

354
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,667
I haven't heard

355
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:17,634
from the safe house
in wheeling

356
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,067
for a day.

357
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,134
We have to assume
it's been compromised.

358
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,767
That's the third one
that's gone silent.

359
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,500
They're picking us off
one by one.

360
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,234
We might want to think
about fighting back.

361
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,634
We can do that, Richard.

362
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,467
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,

363
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:31,834
but once
we take that step,

364
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,300
there's no turning back.

365
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,534
Excuse me,

366
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,567
but shouldn't there be
bars on these windows?

367
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,867
The point is

368
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:38,901
to be unobtrusive,
Dr. Burkhoff.

369
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,467
Well, this seems

370
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,034
a little lax to me.

371
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,367
Most of you are 4400s.

372
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,801
I'm a collaborator.

373
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,367
You know what they do
to collaborators?

374
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,034
We need to get him working.

375
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,067
It calms him down considerably.

376
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,534
We cleared out a room for you.

377
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Anything you need,
just let us know.

378
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,834
What I need is a clean 4400,

379
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,134
one that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor.

380
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,034
I don't guess
you've got one of those, do you?

381
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,534
Actually, I might.

382
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,433
20 years,

383
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,667
I've never seen you pour a drink
on government property.

384
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,734
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.

385
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,700
Conscience bothering you,
Dennis?

386
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,201
Hell, yes...

387
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,534
... it is...

388
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,101
... and given the circumstances,
I'd say that's a good sign...

389
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,268
... but I'm trying to focus
on my job, Tom...

390
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,433
... and I need the same from you.

391
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,400
But sometimes when you...

392
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,134
you look for one thing,
you...

393
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,467
you learn something else.

394
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:56,901
You know how it is, Dennis.

395
00:16:56,967 --> 00:17:00,600
I know exactly what you mean.

396
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,001
I've learned some things
myself.

397
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,001
Open it.

398
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,001
Knowledge is a burden, huh, Tom?

399
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,667
Did you think

400
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,001
that I would release Kyle
from quarantine

401
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,634
and not keep an eye on him?

402
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,767
Why didn't you stop this?

403
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,234
Because I didn't know

404
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,767
exactly what Kyle
was going to do.

405
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,201
I just sort of let the future
play out.

406
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,134
Isn't that what
you're always talking about?

407
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,467
You set up Roy Marsden.

408
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,234
That was my gift to you, Tom.

409
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,433
Would you rather

410
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,600
I just turn these over
to my bosses?

411
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,067
I would rather
you be the friend...

412
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,667
you be the Ryland
I worked with for 20 years.

413
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,634
I haven't changed.

414
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,967
I have a tough job,
and I'm doing my best,

415
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,134
and as your boss,

416
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,600
and as your friend,

417
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,367
I expect support.

418
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,833
Kyle hated quarantine.

419
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,777
I wonder what you think of prison?

420
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,334
They know.

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,133
NTAC knows
you shot Collier.

422
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
What? How?

423
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,734
They've known all along.
They let it happen.

424
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,500
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.

425
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,467
I'm going to call
Alana's friends.

426
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:47,334
You're sending me to Spain?

427
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,601
If they come after you,

428
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,867
I need you to be ready
to leave right away.

429
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,701
Did you hear Roy Marsden's
being sent to jail for life?

430
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,734
They set him up.

431
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,734
But if I run...

432
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,467
... just one thing at a time, Kyle.

433
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,133
Let me worry about you,
then I will deal with Marsden.

434
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,267
So you want me
to start packing?

435
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,434
Yeah, Kyle!

436
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,233
Aren't you hearing me?

437
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,334
He committed suicide?

438
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,901
I know that Max was under
a lot of strain, but...

439
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,100
He had

440
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,233
all those people's lives
in his hands.

441
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,567
Maia's...

442
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,167
I know,

443
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,601
but Dr. Pinero's been
Hudson's number two

444
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,100
from the very beginning.

445
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,534
He knows everything
that Hudson knew.

446
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,434
We're still going to
beat this thing.

447
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,534
Good morning, Tom.

448
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,934
Nina.

449
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,201
Here.

450
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,468
I grabbed this
out of your mail cubby.

451
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:37,800
Did you hear
about Hudson?

452
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,067
Yeah.

453
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,167
You okay?

454
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:41,301
They're calling it
a suicide.

455
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,700
What are you calling it?

456
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,633
Tom, look at this.

457
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,667
It's from Max.

458
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,767
"Firewall memo".

459
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,800
What is that?

460
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,867
I don't know.

461
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,101
Why are you doing this,
Isabelle?

462
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,468
Mommy needs to know.

463
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,600
I brought you here
so we could be safe.

464
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,700
Don't you want that?

465
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,867
Lily, what's going on
out here?

466
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,967
You okay?

467
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,134
No. Go away!

468
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,568
I told you not to come here!

469
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,000
That's why I'm here.

470
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,434
Lily, please, let me in.

471
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,434
How do I know you're real?

472
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,434
What are you
talking about?

473
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,434
Of course I'm real.

474
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,600
Did Carol leave you?

475
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,900
Why would she leave me?

476
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,434
Lily, I'm coming in,
okay?

477
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,767
No. No!

478
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,900
No!

479
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,434
Lily... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

480
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:21,501
Lily...

481
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,401
put down the knife. Please.

482
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:24,834
I just came
to check on you guys,

483
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,301
make sure
you were okay.

484
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,667
Look, it's me.

485
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:29,667
Brian.

486
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,667
Put the knife down.

487
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:42,934
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want?

488
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,101
No!

489
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,301
Stop it, Isabelle!

490
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,034
Lily, I heard screaming.
What is going on?

491
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,434
Brian...

492
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,367
if you're real,
you've got to get me out.

493
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,367
Isabelle
doesn't want to be here.

494
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,867
Firewall...

495
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,134
it's a program,
a safety net.

496
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,334
That's how
you keep viruses

497
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,367
off your hard drive.

498
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, did you ever see a memo

499
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,000
with the word "firewall"
written in the subject line?

500
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,501
No, but I don't read
most of the memos

501
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,468
that circulate
around here anyway.

502
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,700
Look, how long
are you guys

503
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:18,867
going to be
working in here?

504
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,468
What, are they painting
your offices?

505
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,633
We need a little privacy, okay?

506
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,301
Tom, this memo,
whatever it is,

507
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,733
I doubt it ever went out
on a general distribution,

508
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,134
and every copy probably went
through the shredder

509
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:28,201
months ago.

510
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,534
So if there's no hard copy,

511
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,501
and if Marco is the only one
we even trust

512
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:32,034
to even
talk about it with,

513
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,367
then we're at a dead end.

514
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,534
We could always
march into Ryland's office

515
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,700
and ask him about it.

516
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:36,967
The guy does know memos.

517
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,534
When he was working here,

518
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,401
I must have thrown away,
like, 15 every day.

519
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,067
More like 20.

520
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,401
He liked to
keep his keyboard burning.

521
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,800
Who, Ryland?

522
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:44,667
Yeah.

523
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,667
He didn't type.

524
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:46,967
He used to
call me in sometimes

525
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:48,301
when he froze up
his computer.

526
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,034
Hunt-and-peck city.

527
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,767
Took him 10 minutes
to type in an email address.

528
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,900
Ryland dictated everything
to his secretary.

529
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,667
She had "L" level
security clearance.

530
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,733
Look.

531
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,501
"D.R. /J.O."

532
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:02,667
Everything says
"D.R. /J.O."

533
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,167
"D.R.", Dennis Ryland.

534
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,434
And "J.O." is Jane Orman.

535
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:06,700
She worked for him
for 22 years.

536
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,067
Did she stay in Seattle?

537
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:15,167
Say hi for me.

538
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:23,900
Lily.

539
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,934
You came back.

540
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,600
Are you all right?

541
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,633
I thought I was doing

542
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,667
the smart thing,

543
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:39,234
but Isabelle...

544
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,134
What happened?

545
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,633
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place...

546
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,900
I don't know.

547
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,934
Hey.

548
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,967
Did you miss daddy?

549
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,267
Yeah?

550
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,034
Well,
he missed you.

551
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:54,667
Both of you.

552
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,401
Listen, I'm, uh...

553
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:58,434
I'm going to take off.

554
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,568
Brian...

555
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,167
thank you...

556
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:03,000
for everything.

557
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,700
Hey, uh...

558
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,301
... do me a favor...

559
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,800
... forget this address...

560
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,401
... forget about all of us...

561
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:13,468
... and I'll forget...

562
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,000
... you drove off with my wife...

563
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,667
... in the middle of the night.

564
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,867
Good luck, Lil.

565
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,900
Hey, I've been
calling you all day.

566
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,834
There's a guy here
who thinks that Isabelle...

567
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,134
... excuse me.

568
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:30,201
Didn't anyone hear
that car pull up...

569
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,733
Is that her?

570
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,034
I think
there's somebody here

571
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,534
who wants to meet you.

572
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,700
This is Isabelle.

573
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,101
What are we
supposed to say?

574
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,468
"You know that
massive conspiracy

575
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:54,434
to suppress the abilities

576
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,733
of the 4400?

577
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,967
We were just kind of hoping

578
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,134
you would fill us in
on the particulars".

579
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:00,534
Yeah,
"And don't be nervous,

580
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,867
but we had to shake
a government tail

581
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:03,234
on the way here to do it".

582
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, sounds
like a start.

583
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,468
Tom Baldwin.

584
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:08,934
Long time, Jane.

585
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,501
Do you remember my partner,
Diana Skouris?

586
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:11,401
Of course.

587
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:12,867
Yeah. Hi.

588
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,468
I always wondered
who would show up.

589
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:16,700
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.

590
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:20,633
You're here about firewall,
right?

591
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,001
The inhibitor
hasn't been tested.

592
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,067
It is not ready.

593
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:36,101
One of the 4400

594
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,533
is a serial killer

595
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
who was using,
I don't know,

596
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,400
some kind
of mind control

597
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,368
to get people
to commit murder.

598
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,268
The inhibitor's ready.

599
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:45,533
This is wrong, Dennis.

600
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,167
We are beyond
right and wrong here!

601
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:49,600
There's no precedent for this.

602
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,667
Now, D.C.'s been advised
of the operation.

603
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:54,134
It's been approved
at the highest level.

604
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,834
There is nothing further
to discuss, is there?

605
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,634
I am not doing this.

606
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,934
I took it home with me
that night.

607
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:14,867
The next day,
I put in my notice.

608
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:15,968
I mean, you have to understand,

609
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,534
for two decades,

610
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,801
I thought that Dennis Ryland
was the finest man I ever met,

611
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:22,367
and after I read this,
I couldn't work for him anymore.

612
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,068
I kept telling myself
I should send it somewhere...

613
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,734
... the newspapers, or...

614
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,734
... I don't know...

615
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,068
... but the names

616
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,467
that signed off
on this...

617
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:31,834
... I was just a secretary.

618
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,734
What could I do
against those names?

619
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,133
It's all here.

620
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,001
Did you see the names?

621
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,233
When Maia said,

622
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,534
"mommy's bosses are
going to be punished",

623
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:41,634
I had no idea she meant

624
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:42,334
all the way up
the chain of command.

625
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,401
We can't go public yet.

626
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:44,468
What?

627
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:45,600
We can't go public yet.

628
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:46,800
Listen, the faster
this gets exposed,

629
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:47,667
the better it is
for Maia, Alana, Shawn...

630
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:48,800
... all of them.

631
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,000
No more secrets.

632
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,101
No more relying
on the people who did this

633
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,267
to find a cure.

634
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,334
At the very least,

635
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:54,134
they're going to
have to rescind

636
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:55,301
the quarantine order.

637
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,767
Diana,
Ryland's got something on me.

638
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,101
Ryland?

639
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,568
This entire memo
is over his signature.

640
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,568
What could he possibly
have over you?

641
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,568
He knows
Kyle killed Jordan Collier.

642
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:06,834
What?

643
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,367
That night on Highland Beach,

644
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,800
they put someone inside of him,
or some program...

645
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:10,967
... I don't know...

646
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,101
directing his actions,

647
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,501
and Ryland has evidence.

648
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm sorry, Tom,

649
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:19,967
but I can't just sit on this!

650
00:26:20,034 --> 00:26:21,401
Maia's getting sicker!

651
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:23,000
Just give me one hour, Diana.

652
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:25,101
Just one hour.

653
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
Please.

654
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,700
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, Kyle.

655
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,900
If I go through
with this,

656
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,034
they're going to
come after you,

657
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:37,301
and it doesn't matter

658
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,733
if you're in Spain
or Siberia.

659
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,967
I know, but with all those lives
at stake,

660
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,334
you have to do it.

661
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,334
Okay, I'm taking you
to the airport.

662
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,700
Dad...

663
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,167
I'm not going anywhere.

664
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,401
This actually makes it easier.

665
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:52,934
I didn't know
how I was going to tell you.

666
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,867
Tell me what?

667
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,434
I can't live like this anymore.

668
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:00,534
I can't live
knowing that guy is in jail.

669
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,700
I go through every day

670
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,633
trying to pretend
it's all normal,

671
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,000
but it's just a cover-up.

672
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,667
I can't let you do it, Kyle.

673
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,834
Marsden shot at me.

674
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,067
He, uh...
he shot at other cops too.

675
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,900
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.

676
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:21,301
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.

677
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,667
Look what it did
to your boss.

678
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,167
Ryland used to be your friend.

679
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:26,600
It's over, dad.

680
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,000
No more lies.

681
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:30,201
I can't do it anymore.
I just can't do it.

682
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,600
Okay? You can't stop me.

683
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,101
Okay?

684
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,234
Don't you do anything
until I get back.

685
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:40,700
You hear me?

686
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,367
This is the right thing,

687
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,201
the heroic thing,

688
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,767
and being a hero
comes with some perks.

689
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,767
You tell me
what I need to know,

690
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,501
I'll see that
you're transferred

691
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,067
to a private
quarantine facility

692
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,401
this afternoon.

693
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:03,834
You can
walk the grounds,

694
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
you can choose
your own meals...

695
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,633
what's wrong with that?

696
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:14,067
139 Lebanon Street.

697
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,700
That's where
they told me to go.

698
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:18,900
The inhibitor

699
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:20,800
is piggybacking
on glucose.

700
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,367
It enters the brain

701
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,600
through facilitated
diffusion.

702
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,167
It's a binding protein.

703
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,401
That's how
they did it...

704
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:28,434
I'll take your word for it.

705
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,733
But this serum

706
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,934
has pure Promicin in it.

707
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,633
It can neutralize the charge.

708
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,034
The inhibitor won't be able
to cross membranes anymore.

709
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:38,067
We can flush it
out of their systems.

710
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,401
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away?

711
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,600
Please.

712
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,867
Stop saying "disease".

713
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:44,834
For the last time,
it's a side effect.

714
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,034
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.

715
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,633
It'll happen
virtually instantly.

716
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,834
So this substance...

717
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,067
Promicin.

718
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,800
It's what makes you people
unique.

719
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,401
How did you get it
out of my daughter?

720
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,733
She has trace amounts of it

721
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,201
in her bloodstream.

722
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:02,234
Before the inhibitor,
you all did.

723
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:03,267
That's how they found it...

724
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:04,534
... in the first place...

725
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,234
... but...

726
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:08,167
... she's an infant.

727
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:11,301
I could only draw
enough blood...

728
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:14,067
to make one shot.

729
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:15,534
If you can get that
into quarantine,

730
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,134
one shot might be all you need.

731
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,201
Nina, where's Ryland?

732
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,734
A 4400 gave up
the Seattle safe house.

733
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,901
They're on their way
to take it down.

734
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Excuse me.

735
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,767
Please don't shoot.

736
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,034
Dr. Burkhoff,
why would we shoot you?

737
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,767
I have no idea,

738
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,901
but I'm feeling
a little insecure right now.

739
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,834
I brought something
for you.

740
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:53,500
Whatever you do, don't drop it.

741
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,334
Everybody in this house

742
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
is subject
to quarantine and arrest

743
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:08,001
under emergency order 74.

744
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:10,267
You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.

745
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:11,467
If not,

746
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:14,200
we'll come in and get you.

747
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,634
There's an army out there.

748
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,867
Ryland!

749
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,301
Call it off.

750
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:23,400
It's over.

751
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,600
Quarantine. Everything.

752
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,067
Agent Baldwin
is obstructing justice.

753
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,334
Arrest him.

754
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:31,134
I don't think so,
Dennis.

755
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:32,867
I know about firewall.

756
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:45,101
Keep your weapon on him.

757
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,667
You're really willing
to give up your son?

758
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,633
Kyle's turning himself in.

759
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,034
He can't live with the cover-up.

760
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,401
When I wrote that memo,

761
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:56,767
we had no idea where
the 4400 were from

762
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,967
or why they were
brought back.

763
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:01,134
Dr. Hudson
gave me information.

764
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,167
I acted on it, Tom.

765
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:06,134
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.

766
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,234
Hi.

767
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:18,367
I've got some
medicine for you.

768
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:19,867
To be honest with you,

769
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,600
I'd rather be giving this
to Maia,

770
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,967
but a crazy neuroscientist
told me

771
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:24,367
that that was not
the right thing to do,

772
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:25,867
so if you don't mind
holding still

773
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,534
for a minute...

774
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:32,967
you saw Orson Bailey
up close and personal.

775
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:34,501
Oliver Knox.

776
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,267
You know what these people
were capable of.

777
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,201
Hell, I attached your reports
to the memo

778
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,700
when I sent it to D.C.

779
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,700
But we learned better, Dennis.

780
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,101
Highland Beach?

781
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,234
"Save the future"?

782
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:48,067
Heartfelt message, Tom,

783
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:49,468
and while they were
giving it to you,

784
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:50,934
they were
programming your son

785
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,633
to commit murder.

786
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,900
Does that sound to you

787
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,201
like they were
guiding us toward eden?

788
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,367
I don't know,

789
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:57,733
but I sure as hell

790
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
don't want to go
where you're taking me.

791
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,700
Goddammit, Tom!

792
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,101
What does it even mean,
"save the future"?

793
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,633
Save the future how?

794
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,101
Kill us all?

795
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,334
Start over
with a smaller,

796
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:09,034
more evolved
population?

797
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,934
Is that an outcome
you can live with?

798
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,468
What can you
live with, Dennis?

799
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,067
Was Max Hudson really a suicide,

800
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,767
or did you pull
that little string too?

801
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,767
And what about me,
Dennis?

802
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,000
Because if you're
holding on to any hope

803
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,834
of keeping this covered up,

804
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,568
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground

805
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,934
right here and right now.

806
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:50,633
Tom, you're reducing
the fate of the planet

807
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,534
to a question
of your personal faith.

808
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,067
Without the inhibitor program,

809
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,800
who the hell knows
what'll happen?

810
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,167
Who the hell ever knows?

811
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:03,034
Very wise.

812
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:05,067
Pithy.

813
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,101
But if the world
turns out to be a place

814
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,234
of unchecked
4400 abilities,

815
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,834
I hope we don't live
to regret it.

816
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:18,201
Stand down!

817
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:19,934
We're done here.

818
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,634
You can all go home now.

819
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,534
Thomas.
Alana.

820
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,367
Alana.

821
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,567
What happened here?

822
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:22,634
A miracle.

823
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,068
Welcome home, baby.

824
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,333
Home...

825
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,901
I never even unpacked.

826
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,801
We'll take care of that
right now.

827
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,101
Where's Kyle?

828
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,367
I can't wait
to see him.

829
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,001
Yeah, I told him
you were coming home.

830
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,801
Hey, Kyle!
We're back!

831
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,534
Hey, Kyle.

832
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,001
Man, I never thought

833
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,367
I was going
to see you again.

834
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:27,001
You're okay, right?

835
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:31,233
I feel like I did
15 keg stands last night,

836
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,333
but yeah,
pretty much.

837
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,001
We all are.

838
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:36,400
Dr. Burkhoff
took blood samples

839
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,434
from the people that I healed.

840
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,967
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...

841
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,400
hey, you guys
kind of lucked out, huh?

842
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,667
"Lucked out"?

843
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:46,200
There's 23 of us dead,

844
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:48,200
and they don't even have
a final count yet.

845
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:50,867
I don't think that was
part of the plan,

846
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,034
you know?

847
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,467
That's not why
they brought us back.

848
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:55,700
This whole idea

849
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,134
that there's some kind
of plan...

850
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:58,568
I don't know.

851
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,501
I wish
I could believe that.

852
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:02,634
Just trust me when I say

853
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,367
that there's a plan,
it's important,

854
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,534
and every 4400 is a part of it.

855
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,733
Shawn...

856
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,967
I killed Jordan Collier.

857
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,234
What?

858
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,668
I bought a rifle,

859
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,134
I went up on that roof,
took out two government agents,

860
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,467
and then I shot him.

861
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,100
Remember
when I was in trouble?

862
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,367
Losing chunks of time?

863
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:20,501
That's what I was doing.

864
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:22,467
Planning out an assassination.

865
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:23,601
Why?

866
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,201
You think I know?

867
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,201
There's something inside me,
Shawn...

868
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,867
or someone.

869
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,467
It takes over.

870
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:31,900
Those people
who took you?

871
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,301
If they have a plan,

872
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,000
it includes
me killing Jordan Collier.

873
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,467
That's not true, Kyle!

874
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:37,867
Then why did they
make me do it?

875
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,034
Why did they
ruin my life?

876
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,234
I'm about
to go to prison

877
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:41,668
for the people
you worship.

878
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,833
You murdered Jordan?

879
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,367
I didn't mean...

880
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:47,167
I didn't even know
what I was doing, Shawn.

881
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:48,267
I'm sorry.

882
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:51,067
I'm so sorry.

883
00:36:51,134 --> 00:36:52,934
Kyle...

884
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,800
Stop... Shawn...

885
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:34,867
what are you doing?

886
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:35,733
Stop it.

887
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,700
You're killing me.

888
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:37,767
Shawn...

889
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,934
I'm freeing you.

890
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,334
Freeing.

891
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,567
Freeing...

892
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,201
Just hold on.

893
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,334
It's working.

894
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,268
Hold on.

895
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm going to get it out of you.

896
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:52,901
Just hold on.

897
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,934
Hold on, Kyle. It's working.

898
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,367
You really
didn't have to do this,

899
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:26,534
you know.

900
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:28,034
Actually...

901
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,734
I really think I needed to.

902
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,367
What?

903
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:37,901
Well, you're supposed to say,
"I wanted to".

904
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,534
Yeah.

905
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,601
Don't push your luck.

906
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,934
Whoa.

907
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,901
Uh, looks like they're talking

908
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:09,233
about charging these people
with murder.

909
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,434
Ryland. The whole crew.

910
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,068
Looks like
mommy's going to get

911
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,200
a whole bunch of new bosses.

912
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,100
Well, I hope they go away
for a very long time.

913
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,734
I'll be in the front row
at the hearings.

914
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,767
Guess I have to buy a suit.

915
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,001
I'm going to be
sitting next to you

916
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,834
until the whole thing
is over.

917
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,367
Nothing's over.

918
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,901
It's just starting.

919
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,734
Sweetie,
what are you talking about?

920
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:34,534
What's starting?

921
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:37,034
The war.

922
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:52,034
Kyle...

923
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,234
I'm ready.

924
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,834
Are you sure?

925
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:15,801
Yeah.

926
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:18,967
I'll come with you.

927
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:32,333
Isabelle?

928
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,667
Isabelle?

929
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,067
Isabelle?

930
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,034
Hello, Shawn.

931
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,333
I'm Isabelle.
