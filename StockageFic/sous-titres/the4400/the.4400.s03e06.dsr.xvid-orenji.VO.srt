1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,260
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,240
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,030
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,860
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,340
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,790
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,240
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,550
We're not a threat.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,110
We're salvation.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,560
The world will have to deal with us.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,970
Previously on the 4400...

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,450
my name is daniel armand.
You know who I am?

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,730
Of the nova group?

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,630
I called to arrange a truce
and to talk about shawn farrell.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,570
We need to discuss his future,

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,510
because unless you and i can come to some kind of an agreement,

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm not sure he's going to have one.

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,970
Believe me,I know which bench i dedicated to my husband and son.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,460
They died in a car accident shortly before I was abducted.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,490
Our enemies are more resourceful than we imagined,

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,010
and they've let loose a terrible evil into your time.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,130
This evil,there has to be some other way to deal with it.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,780
There is. You.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,310
(kill isabelle)
You are the other way.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,740
Oh,tom.Good. You're here.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,720
Yeah,just like always.

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,020
Well,come on,we need to get started.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,990
Started with what?

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,650
Diana,I have no idea what you're talking about.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,380
Sure you do.Come on,let's go.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,760
She's waiting.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,830
What is this?

33
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,510
I brought her in.You can just do it,and we can get on with our day.

34
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,610
"It"?

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,740
No...

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,560
no way,I'm not...

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,050
tom,you're supposed to do this.They told you so.

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,190
I know. It's just...

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,240
they didn't say why.

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,500
I don't think I can.Maybe I'm bad.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,630
Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,050
You can stop it.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,810
I could be responsible for millions of deaths,

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,810
unless you do something.

45
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,970
We've got a lot to do today.

46
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,560
It's all right,tom.I don't mind.

47
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,510
Come on.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,920
Take the needle.
Come on,tom.

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,050
Do it.

50
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,660
Do it.

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,570
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,830
I can't find it...

53
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,900
I can't find the bug...

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,960
I can't find it...

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,630
I know you're listening.

56
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,720
I know you put it somewhere inside of me.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,740
I'm going to find it.

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,270
I can't find it.

59
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,130
I can't find the bug.

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,420
I can't find it.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,190
I can't find the bug.

62
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,210
Inside me somewhere.

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,970
I know you're listening.

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm going to find it.

65
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm going to get an x-ray of my whole body...

66
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,050
maia's it!

67
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,410
Maia's it!

68
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,310
I'm going to get you,amy!

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
No,you won't!

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,860
Yes,I will!

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,390
maia...

72
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,530
maia,are you all right?

73
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,880
It hurts.

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,710
I can help you.

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,130
It's just a bump,shawn.

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,830
I can make it better.

77
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,660
It hurts...
you're getting better.

78
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,450
Hey! Let her go!

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,590
You're hurting her!

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,900
Somebody help!

81
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,330
Let go!

82
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,220
Help!

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,420
what's going on?
He's killing her!

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,640
Get him away!

85
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,380
Mr. Farrell,let go.

86
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,280
Stay away from her!

87
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,690
I don't understand.I was healing her.

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,810
I was making her better.

Sweetheart...

90
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,150
hey,mom.

91
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,890
How are you doing?

92
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,460
I'm okay.

93
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,550
Maia's vital signs are fine.

94
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,110
There's no lasting damage that I can detect.

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,530
At the moment,she's mostly just dehydrated.

96
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,340
Sweetheart...

97
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,890
mommy?

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,550
What is it?

99
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,170
Why...would shawn hurt me?

100
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,870
Oh,my god...

101
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,020
shawn did this?

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,140
He missed some meetings yesterday,but I had no idea it had gotten this bad.

103
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,760
How's shawn? Is he okay?

104
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,370
We don't know.

105
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,010
We called a psychiatrist for him.They're back in the bedroom now.

106
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,570
Well,I want to see him.He'll feel better.

107
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,830
Isabelle,not right now.

108
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,560
Let him be with the doctor for a while,okay?

109
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,890
Sorry.

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,830
This is my daughter,isabelle.

111
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,480
Isabelle,this is tom baldwin.

112
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,080
Shawn told me about you.

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,370
Hi.

114
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,540
Hi.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,390
You're staring at me.

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,930
Why?

117
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,810
How is he?

118
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,090
I gave him a sedative.He's sleeping right now.

119
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,440
Shawn is experiencing persistent and powerful auditory hallucinations.

120
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,780
They're contributing to his delusions.

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,550
Delusions?

122
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't understand.What's happening to him?

123
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Shawn's symptoms are...

124
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,740
well,I'm afraid they're consistent with the onset of disorganized schizophrenia.

125
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,030
But you're going to fix him,right?You're going to make him better.

126
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,210
Well,I've never seen a case quite like this.

127
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,010
Typically,schizophrenia has a gradual onset.

128
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,100
Patients slowly withdraw from the world as their symptoms get worse,

129
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,430
but with shawn,it's almost as if the disease was just turned on.

130
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,680
Last week,we got a phone call from daniel armand.

131
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,820
He said if we weren't willing to reach a compromise with nova,

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,420
he'd come gunning for shawn,

133
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,350
and now it's two days later,

134
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,180
and he just happens to come down with schizophrenia?

135
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,860
You think the nova group did this to shawn?

136
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,050
Well,we'll investigate it,

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,230
but until the matter is cleared up,

138
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,870
shawn just can't walk around free.

139
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
I mean,okay,he's probably a victim in this,

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,890
but his mental state has been compromised.

141
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,180
He can't control his ability.

142
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,280
Shawn is one of the leaders of this place.

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,550
People love him.

144
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,510
If he just disappears into the basement at ntac,

145
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,300
there's going to be a lot of unhappiness around here.

146
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,390
Nobody's talking about disappearing anyone.

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,100
You need to just distance yourself from the situation just for a second.

148
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,240
Now,we have an insane 4400 with a potentially lethal ability.

149
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,120
This is an ability that has turned against my daughter.

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,090
If you don't voluntarily remand him to a psychiatric hospital,

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,420
then I'll file a complaint for assault.

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,400
And take the decision out of your hands.

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,890
No!

154
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,050
You can't lock him up.This isn't his fault.

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,610
Isabelle,shawn is in trouble.He needs help.

156
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,330
I know he does,

157
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,270
and instead,you just want to abandon him?

158
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,620
He sacrificed for this place.

159
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,750
He told you not to talk to nova,

160
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,440
even if it meant they were going to come after him.

161
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,990
Now they did,and you just want to cut himoose?

162
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,160
We're not cutting him loose,we are protecting him.

163
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,320
Oh,by locking him up?

164
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,450
Isabelle...

165
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,070
that is not true,

166
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,480
and we are not having this discussion now.

167
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,970
This is not the place.

168
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,070
If you'll agree that shawn goes nowhere near a government facility,

169
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,150
we'll commit him to a private hospital until all this is cleared up.

170
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,440
How much did they tell you about what I do here at the school?

171
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,190
Um,not much.

172
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,120
You're some sort of guidance counselor,right?

173
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm something like that.

174
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,460
It's more like a therapist,I guess you could say.

175
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,800
I work with the students here using my ability.

176
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,630
All the kids here are 4400s,

177
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,610
which means you missed years of your families' lives.

178
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,680
Your parents had another child while you were gone,your brother curtis?

179
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah,before they got divorced.

180
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,070
I barely know him.

181
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,130
That's where I come in.

182
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,790
It's hard to explain,

183
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,590
but if you let me,

184
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,480
I can take you back to the years when you were gone.

185
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,600
You can meet your brother when he was a baby,

186
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,780
see him grow up,

187
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,850
and spend all the time you need with him,

188
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,370
and build the relationship you don't have.

189
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,820
Um... I'm sorry.

190
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,600
What,you want to take me back in time?

191
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,880
No.

192
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,510
We go into a world we create using both our minds,

193
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,890
and it will seem just as real as this one.

194
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,420
Look,uh...

195
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,050
no offense...

196
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,190
but maybe you should worry about helping yourself.

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,850
You think I need help?

198
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,820
You have this...

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,080
sadness inside you.

200
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,410
Not sadness,exactly.

201
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
I guess "rage" would be the best word.

202
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,230
It's because of what happened to your husband and son all those years ago.

203
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,330
You know about billy and paul?

204
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,820
They got killed in a hit-and-run.

205
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,850
The police never caught the guy.

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,350
You try to move on,and,uh...

207
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,890
I guess you kind of have,

208
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,270
but you still think about it every day.

209
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,880
And...

210
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,900
and there's still that rage.

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,420
How...how do you know all that?

212
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,520
Well,you have an ability...

213
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,710
and I have an ability.

214
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,910
Look,uh...

215
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,510
I'm sorry...

216
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm just not up for this.

217
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,750
So,uh...

218
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,080
is it okay if I go back to class?

219
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,490
You're right to be mad,you know.

220
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,820
The guy?

221
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,000
The driver?

222
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,150
He'S...kind of out there.

223
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,280
It's not fair.

224
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,000
But you did see shawn farrell on tuesday?

225
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,800
A home loan from the center.

226
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,940
And how did the meeting end?

227
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh,well,congratulations.

228
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,480
That's a really nice neighborhood.

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,510
No,no,mr. Donovan,thanks for your time.

230
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,550
We'll be in touch if we need anything further.

231
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,180
You know,your nephew is one of the leaders of the center.

232
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,310
He sees dozens of 4400s every day,

233
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,630
and the ones we've spoken to who have registered abilities with us,

234
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,630
they have minor stuff.

235
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,690
Nothing like the capacity to induce insanity,

236
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,010
and that's assuming that whoever did this

237
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,100
had to be in proximity to shawn to make it happen.

238
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,660
"Whoever"?

239
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,490
We basically know who did this.It was daniel armand.

240
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,210
Either he did it,or he gave the order.

241
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,010
Well,no,the truth is,

242
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,810
we don't actually know that shawn's condition is the result of an attack.

243
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,080
Nova's not claiming credit,

244
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,570
and shawn's exactly the right age for onset of schizophrenia.

245
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,460
So it's possible that we're looking for a crime,

246
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,810
and the only thing we'll find is a tragedy.

247
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,560
Then there's nothing we can do...

248
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,990
and I cannot accept that.

249
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,810
Nova threatened shawn,shawn got sick.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,050
For right now,that's all the cause and effect i need.

251
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
You're zachary?

252
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,680
Yeah,thanks for meeting me out here.

253
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,850
It's all right.

254
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,420
Matthew said you had something you wanted to discuss?

255
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,090
About six weeks ago,

256
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,130
a friend of mine from quarantine,

257
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,420
she asked me to meet her for dinner.

258
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,490
So I go,and...

259
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,000
and she's asking me all sorts of questions.

260
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,400
Now,she never came right out and said it,

261
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,290
but I swear she was feeling me out to see if I would join the nova group.

262
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,330
She was recruiting you?

263
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,100
I wouldn't be surprised if she was a member.

264
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,460
I mean,she used to bitch about the government all the time.

265
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,720
I guess she just finally got fed up--

266
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,350
zachary...

267
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,890
if you got a name,give it to me.

268
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,440
Jane nance.

269
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,130
Thank you for coming forward.

270
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,220
Hi.

271
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,910
Todd...

272
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,820
ms. Mareva.

273
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,070
What's up?

274
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,000
Those things you said about me.

275
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,310
They're very private.

276
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,560
How did you know?

277
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Sometimes,when I'm talking to somebody,

278
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,100
if they feel something real strong,

279
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,150
um,I feel it,too,

280
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
and then I know why they feel that way.

281
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,610
I see it.

282
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,750
So,uh...

283
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,080
you saw what happened to my family?

284
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,670
Not the whole thing.

285
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,430
I just get,like,fragments.

286
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,180
Um,I saw the two cars hit.

287
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,440
I saw this guy.

288
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,800
There were empty beer bottles by his seat.

289
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,950
He thought about getting out,

290
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,140
calling the cops.

291
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,280
I guess he changed his mind.

292
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,680
The man who hit them...

293
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,860
you know who he is?

294
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,980
Yeah.

295
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,880
I already wrote it down.

296
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,450
I figured you'd want it.

297
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,650
Keane driscoll...

298
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,640
security told me you were up here.

299
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,950
What are you doing?

300
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,920
I'm packing shawn's stuff.

301
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,490
I'm taking him out of that hospital.

302
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,720
Isabelle,I have to caution you against overreaction.

303
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,670
I know you're worried about shawn,

304
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,250
but all we have is a tip.

305
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,050
We might know the name of one person in the nova group.

306
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,720
What's my dad going to do with that?

307
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,260
Let me guess,call ntac?

308
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,580
What'll they do for shawn that I can't?

309
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,690
They're equipped to deal with 4400s.

310
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,520
Not as well as I am.

311
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,470
No.

312
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,660
Matthew,get out of my way.

313
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,580
What are you going to do?

314
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,270
We don't even know if that tip is any good,

315
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,960
and if this woman,jane nance,is in the nova group,

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,210
there's no guarantee that she's the one that's doing this to shawn.

317
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,060
Well,if she's not,she'll get me closer to the person who is.

318
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,710
She was recruited into nova,right?

319
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,120
So she'll know at least one name.

320
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,220
I'll find that person.

321
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,220
If they're not the one,they'll know a name,too,

322
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,520
and eventually,I'll find the person who's hurting shawn,

323
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,590
and I'll make him stop.

324
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,580
Wait.

325
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
Hey,wait.

326
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,710
Do you remember the first time i came to see you?

327
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,680
You were so sad.

328
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,750
You didn't know who you were,

329
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,100
why you grew up so fast,

330
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,520
why you were making your mother so sick,

331
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,780
and I told you,you were one of the lucky ones.

332
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,190
You have a purpose,a job to do.

333
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,770
I even told you what it was.

334
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,100
Do you remember?

335
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,770
Say it.

336
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,630
I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400.

337
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,560
That's right.

338
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,250
Not everyone from the future thinks they're a good thing.

339
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,100
Not everyone thinks they're going to save the world.

340
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,900
All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400
are supposed to prevent?

341
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,600
It's lies.

342
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
They are the catastrophe.All of them.

343
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,440
Your father,shawn,and if he's in trouble...

344
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,800
that's good for us.

345
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,290
So you keep telling me.

346
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,760
Goodbye.

347
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,300
No!I can't allow you to do this!

348
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,580
You're not ready to be on your own.You need me.

349
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
You need my guidance.

350
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,090
I don't think I do,matthew.

351
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,490
Today's graduation day.

352
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,280
abendson psychiatric
care facility

353
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,410
shawn?

354
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
Isabelle.

355
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,600
We have to go now,okay?

356
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,950
Isabelle...

357
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,470
isabelle...

358
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,380
my back teeth are melting,and...

359
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,450
They're going to run down my throat.

360
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,150
I can feel it.

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,810
it's okay.

362
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,780
I'm going to make you better.

363
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,450
Just come with me,okay?

364
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,040
Okay?

365
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,360
Her name is jane nance,

366
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,940
and she lives about 20 minutes away.

367
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,900
We think the tip is good.

368
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,370
If she really is a member of nova,

369
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,380
you can bet she'll be ready to defend herself,

370
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,030
so let's be careful.

371
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,950
Here you go,triton.

372
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,220
Here you go.

373
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah,you've been a very patient boy.

374
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,580
Fidget...

375
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,960
what did I tell you about sitting on the tv?

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,030
Not yet,herkie.

377
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,670
Who are you?

378
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,150
We all know what it's like to hit bottom.

379
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,650
We wouldn't be here if we didn'T.

380
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,280
It comes in a different way for each of us,that...

381
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,240
that moment when we realize our drinking is out of control.

382
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,560
I--

383
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,950
sorry to interrupt.

384
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,590
It's okay.

385
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,210
It's okay. Come on in.

386
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,370
Grab a seat.

387
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,400
I was just saying...

388
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,610
my name is keane,and I'm an alcoholic.

389
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,490
Hi,keane.

390
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,470
Jane nance!

391
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,250
Oh,my god.

392
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,060
What?

393
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,610
Get those animals away from her.

394
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,850
What the hell happened here?

395
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,860
It's like all these pets she keeps,they turned on her.

396
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,750
Maybe someone...

397
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,330
turned them on her.

398
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,480
He died very quickly.

399
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,710
It could have been a massive stroke,

400
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,110
maybe a coronary.

401
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,240
I'll call an ambulance,

402
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,960
and the coroner.

403
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,930
Mr. Tyler,those two ntac agents are here again.

404
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,980
They say they need to see you.

405
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,450
Look,mr. Tyler,isabelle broke shawn out of the hospital.

406
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,950
We know that for a fact,

407
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,590
and now we learn that matthew ross,

408
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,970
a 36-year-old man,

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,290
just happened to die of a stroke on the floor of shawn farrell's living room.

410
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,490
Within the hour,jane nance dies as well.

411
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,610
I mean,are you telling us that you don't see a connection?

412
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm telling you you're talking about my daughter.

413
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,460
She shouldn't have taken shawn,I'll admit that.

414
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,200
She can be immature sometimes,yes,but she is not a killer.

415
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,700
Any idea where isabelle may have taken shawn?

416
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,440
No,but if she calls,I'll try to convince her to come in,

417
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,270
and I'll let you know.

418
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,010
That's the best I can do.

419
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,120
Is there anything else?

420
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,170
See you. Thanks.

421
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,930
it's okay to be shy.

422
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,760
I remember my first meeting.

423
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,440
I didn't say anything,either.

424
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,690
I was...at rock bottom.

425
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,190
Embarrassed just to be breathing.

426
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,270
How long ago was that?

427
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,670
About nine years.

428
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,230
I,uh...

429
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,010
I was in a car accident.

430
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,760
Truth is,I can barely even remember it.

431
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,410
I came to...

432
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,860
and I knew...

433
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,810
I had to change my life.

434
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,370
So I did.

435
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,410
I've been leading these meetings for five years now.

436
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,600
How about you?You have a moment like that?

437
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,350
Diana,we opened a trace on shawn's cell phone.

438
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,600
Richard tyler's,too.

439
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,050
If isabelle calls,we'll be listening.

440
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,980
Does this girl scare you as much as she scares me?

441
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,370
I mean,never mind what she did or didn't do today.

442
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,350
You just meet her...

443
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean...

444
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,170
she looks like a normal kid.

445
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,470
Attractive,maybe a bit naive,but when she says something...

446
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,270
you realize she's looking at you like you're an ant,

447
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,310
and she's just deciding whether or not she's going to rip your legs off.

448
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,550
Every other 4400 had a past before they were taken,a history.

449
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,680
Not her.

450
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,250
She just...

451
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,560
kind of sprouted.

452
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
She's not even a 4400.

453
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,270
She's something else.A new category.

454
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
We got a hit on the apb.

455
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,920
Shawn's car was spotted headed east on forbes avenue.

456
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,710
That's in everett.Let's go.

457
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,010
Uh,diana,I need to make a stop at home first.

458
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,670
i'm not taking those.

459
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,020
I'm not taking those.

460
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,570
There's radio antennas inside of there,

461
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,710
and... and...

462
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,580
that's how they hear what I'm thinking.

463
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm not taking those.

464
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,290
shawn,there are no radio antennas.

465
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,920
They're just pills.They make you feel better.

466
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,830
The label says you're supposed to take them every four hours.

467
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Shawn,stop that!

468
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,750
Wait a minute.

469
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,300
There he is.

470
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,720
It's so late.

471
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,830
You scared me.

472
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,940
Sorry.

473
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,140
Someone called in a tip on shawn's car.

474
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,670
It was abandoned,though.

475
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,430
He's still missing.

476
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,900
everything okay?

477
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,200
Yeah.

478
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,200
I don't know.

479
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,480
No.

480
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,500
A boy at school,he has this gift.

481
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,850
He sees things,things that already happened.

482
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,280
He says he saw the...accident that killed billy.

483
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,250
Oh,my god.

484
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,700
Baby...

485
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,050
why would he tell you that?

486
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,800
Because...

487
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,600
he also gave me the name of the man who did it.

488
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,400
I went to see him,thomas.

489
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,800
You did what?

490
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,500
He was leading an A.A. Meeting.

491
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,470
He told me had a car accident while he was drunk nine years ago.

492
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,400
Alana,sweetie,if this really is the guy,

493
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,640
we'll look into it.
Based on what?

494
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,340
The visions of a 4400 who was a little kid when the accident happened?

495
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,900
Alana,please,don't go see this guy again.

496
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,210
It could be dangerous.

497
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,530
You should pick up,thomas.

498
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,930
Yeah,but...

499
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,010
are you sure you're okay?

500
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,580
I'm fine.

501
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,490
Better than your nephew,anyway.

502
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,900
Baldwin.

503
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,920
The place is owned by a 4400 named jorge molina.

504
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,570
The fire department found some burnt remains inside.

505
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,670
They think it's him.

506
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,830
What started the fire?

507
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,700
They're not sure.

508
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,050
Apparently,molina had a habit of leaving oily rags laying around the garage.

509
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,620
Someone in health and safety gave him a bunch of citations for it.

510
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,240
Said it was a fire hazard.

511
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,960
Guess they were right,huh?

512
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,250
Yeah,either that,or isabelle found the name of another member of the nova group.

513
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:34,790
Hello?

514
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,850
This will all be over soon,daddy.

515
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,720
Hello?

516
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,600
I found out who's doing this to shawn.

517
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,720
It's daniel armand.

518
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,140
Isabelle?

519
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,930
The last nova I talked to told me.

520
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,310
Isabelle,w-where are you?

521
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm just waiting for him to come home,

522
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,550
and then i'm going to make him stop.

523
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,920
Isabelle,if you know where armand is,we'll tell ntac.

524
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,700
They'll take care of it.

525
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm not stopping.

526
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,640
Daddy...

527
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,930
when all this is done,can I come home?

528
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,000
Will they let me,or...

529
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,740
am I in too much trouble?

530
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,400
I don't know.

531
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,280
Maybe.

532
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,640
If you stop now,maybe.

533
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,640
Just tell me where you're going so I can come meet you.

534
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,390
Okay.

535
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,380
Diana,we just intercepted a call to richard tyler's phone.

536
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,650
It was isabelle.
Where is she?

537
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,410
She's headed to an address in munhall.

538
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,670
She says daniel armand is there.

539
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,900
you'd better not be hurting him.

540
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,560
I'm not.

541
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,670
It's almost done.

542
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,390
Isabelle...

543
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,570
shawn?

544
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,960
Are you okay?

545
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,530
Yeah,I think so.

546
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,250
What happened?I don't remember anything.

547
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,300
What's armand doing here?

548
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,740
He was hurting you.

549
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,440
He broke your mind.

550
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,790
That's his ability.But I made him stop.

551
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,080
He's yours now.

552
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,220
You can do what you want.

553
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,790
Now she wants you to kill me.

554
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,140
I'm not killing anybody,isabelle.

555
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,440
If you don't,she will.

556
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,310
Is that true?

557
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,220
I did what I had to do to make you better,

558
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,350
and what does it matter anyway?

559
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,730
You're not sick anymore.

560
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,270
I know,I know.

561
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,560
Thank you,but it's over.

562
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,720
It's over.

563
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,570
I'm better.We have armand.

564
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,240
Let's just go.We can walk away.

565
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,180
You don't really know this girl at all,do you?

566
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,920
You think she's one of us?

567
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,010
Don't listen to him,isabelle.

568
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,390
Stop talking.
She's not,shawn.

569
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,170
She killed her way across town to find me,

570
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,690
and there's no way she's walking away.

571
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,940
I said,stop talking now.

572
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,320
Don't,isabelle.

573
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,730
Don't!

574
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:45,750
For the record,daniel,I didn't kill your people,not exactly.

575
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,760
All I did was turn their abilities against them.

576
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,700
And what do you do again?

577
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,730
Oh,right.

578
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,450
You make people crazy.

579
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,940
No...

580
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,170
isabelle...

581
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,390
isabelle,stop it!

582
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,820
Stop it!

583
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,840
They want to take my organs out.

584
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,260
All of them.

585
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,140
They're halfway done.

586
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,030
They're halfway done...

587
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,290
why did you do that to him?

588
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,660
He was still a threat to you,shawn.

589
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,580
If we just left,

590
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,750
what's to keep him from attacking you again?

591
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,690
Everything I did,I did to make you better.

592
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,020
I don't regret any of it.

593
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,510
If I had to kill a hundred people,I would have.

594
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,720
Who are you?

595
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,330
If anyone gets any resistance from the girl or daniel armand,

596
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,830
xxx

597
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,370
tom?

598
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,070
Anything to add?
No,let's move.

599
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,550
Stop!

600
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,340
Can't do that,mr. Tyler,we need to end this.

601
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,500
Look,if you go in there with your guns out,

602
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,290
this can end badly for everybody.

603
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,170
Let me talk to isabelle.

604
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,440
See if I can get her to come out quietly.

605
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,760
You guys got the place surrounded,right?

606
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,900
If I'm gone more than five minutes,

607
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,080
you can just come in anyway.

608
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,910
Isabelle?

609
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,530
Shawn?

610
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,180
Richard.

611
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,540
you've got to talk to her.

612
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,240
You've got to talk to her.

613
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,000
She wants to fight them.

614
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,410
She's going to get everyone killed.

615
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,600
Daddy!

616
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,270
We can get past them.

617
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,430
You can help me.

618
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,640
We can get the guns out of their hands,right?

619
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,850
No,isabelle.We're not here to fight the government.

620
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,070
Not today.

621
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,550
I don't have a choice.

622
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,200
Yes,you do.

623
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,520
Walk out there with me.

624
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,500
You're going to get in trouble for breaking shawn out of the hospital.

625
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,550
But we can deal with it.

626
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,280
I don't know what happened with matthew and the others,

627
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,790
but we can deal with that,too,

628
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,050
but if you go after those agents,that is it.

629
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,080
You are an enemy of the government.

630
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,200
They will catch you eventually.

631
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,560
They will put you away forever.

632
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,940
I don't care how strong you are,

633
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,090
and there won't be anything i can do about it.

634
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,830
All this...

635
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,060
I did it to save shawn,and he hates me now.

636
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,950
Isabelle...

637
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,720
isabelle...

638
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,450
I don't hate you.

639
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,460
He's just scared,that's all.We all are.

640
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,160
Let's go.

641
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,070
They're coming out!

642
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,040
Shawn!

643
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,970
Are you all right?
Yeah,yeah.

644
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,850
Daniel armand's inside.

645
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,490
He's all yours.

646
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,100
So this is what feels like to watch someone get away with murder.

647
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,460
If there's no evidence of foul play.

648
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,400
How can there be a murder?

649
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,970
As for the deaths,shawn doesn't remember anything.

650
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,520
There's no witnesses,so officially,we don't have a case.

651
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,200
Yeah,but...

652
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,390
she did it,

653
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,250
and I can't help but think when all this is over she's going to do a lot more.

654
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,420
Their names were billy and paul.

655
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,590
Paul was my husband.

656
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,860
Billy was our son.

657
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,920
They were killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1997.

658
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,430
The same year you hit bottom.

659
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,230
Everything.

660
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,040
You killed them.

661
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,650
Look,I told you before.

662
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,190
Nine years ago...

663
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,290
I was a different man.

664
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,980
Something happened.

665
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,060
Something...

666
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,000
terrible...

667
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,370
and I had a choice.

668
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,820
I could end my life,

669
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,730
or I could try to live it better,

670
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,230
and I decided to live,

671
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,520
and I did do better.

672
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,850
I dedicated myself to it.

673
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
I mean,look around!

674
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,890
I help people.

675
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:32,090
You do,and you probably feel like that's enough.

676
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,720
I bet you you go days,

677
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,780
whole weeks,even,

678
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,750
without ever thinking about that other man and what he did.

679
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,650
I think about it every day.

680
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,130
It never goes away for me...

681
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:56,320
and I'm going to make sure it never goes away for you,either.

682
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,220
I won't let you forget them.

683
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,460
I'm fine,daddy.

684
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,660
They treated me fine.

685
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,380
I just need...

686
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,070
a little time alone,okay?

687
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,630
Isabelle...

688
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,740
you know,sometime very soon,

689
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,150
we're going to have to talk about matthew,about all this.

690
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,710
How did you get in here?

691
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,440
shut the door.

692
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,010
We need to talk.

693
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,750
About what?

694
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,660
Some people want me to kill you.

695
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,100
I was hoping you could tell me why.

696
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,130
Who gave you that?

697
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,990
Long story.

698
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,780
Let's just say the woman who left it for me,she called you evil.

699
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,500
Said if humanity was going to survive,

700
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,700
you had to die.

701
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,540
What,you think that's funny?

702
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,200
No.

703
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,320
It's just,it seems like a lot of people have opinions about me.

704
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,430
Either I'M...the savior,

705
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,440
or I'm the end of the world.

706
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,980
It's nice to have options,I guess.

707
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,510
That man,matthew?

708
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,610
The one who had a stroke?

709
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,670
He came to me right after I grew up.

710
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,120
He said I was supposed to do all kinds of things.

711
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,220
Destroy the 4400.

712
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,160
Kill them all.

713
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,090
He told me it was the only way to save the world.

714
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,950
I told him no.

715
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,190
I might have been concei in the future,

716
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,580
but I'm not their puppet.

717
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,910
He didn't like that.

718
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,630
He's not around anymore.

719
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,220
Neither are those members of the nova group.

720
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,360
Those people wterrorists.

whoever told you that I'm bad,

725
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,050
that I'm some sort of walking armageddon,is wrong.

726
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,810
I turned my back on all that.

727
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,220
I'm not a murderer,and you know what?

728
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,920
I don't care how much I scare you,I don't think you are,either.

729
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,140
You don't know me.

730
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,710

the end of the human race,

735
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,960
or whatever the hell it is they call me.

736
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,030
I won't move.

737
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,030

738
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,630
No.

739
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,880
Not yet.

740
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,150
Not until I'm sure.

741
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,380
And you're not a murderer.

742
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,990
It's okay.

743
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,780
You should take that with you in case you change your mind.

744
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,130
You better hope I don'T.
