1
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,201
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,570
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,146
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,441
Do you know who I am?

5
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,609
As soon as I am free, you and the world
will know what I know.

6
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,948
My son is in prison.
You're the one who can get him out.

7
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,090
Did you kill me?

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,386
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,552
You're gonna get married. I saw it.

10
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,493
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?

11
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,326
Someone just told me
that I met the woman

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,468
that I'm supposed to be with,
and I can't ignore it.

13
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,898
He broke up with me!

14
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,737
- I've done bad things.
- You are the enemy.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,306
Tell me What to do, I'll do anything,

16
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,841
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.

17
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,776
They won't be able to hide for long.

18
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,811
Dr. Burkhoff's
not exactly inconspicuous.

19
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,311
We are proud
to announce the existence

20
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,453
of this Enhanced Soldier program,

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,555
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s

22
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,523
to develop extra-human abilities
in the defense of the United States,

23
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,185
You have a source of promicin
for your program, Who is it?

24
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,628
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,826
The soldiers, are you really gonna
use them to defend the country?

26
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,732
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?

27
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,929
Is there a difference?

28
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,143
Mr. Collier, you've been doing
quite a bit of press since your...

29
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,405
Resurrection.

30
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,242
I suppose some people
are calling it that.

31
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,816
And in every interview, you've been
making the same statement

32
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,316
over and over again.

33
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,978
The war for the future
will be fought in the past.

34
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:08,219
Exactly. And by past,
do you mean now, today?

35
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,357
It's our shared burden. Yes.

36
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,058
And this war, it's one between
the 4400s and the non-4400s?

37
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,535
No, This is a War
between good and evil,

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,339
And it has already started,

39
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,875
Good people,
4400s and non-4400s,,,

40
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,272
Come on, Kyle. Dinner's ready.

41
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,415
-...have made incredible sacrifices,
- I'll be right there.

42
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,313
And they knoW they Will be called on
to sacrifice even more,

43
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,011
They're among the first to knoW
the cost of this struggle,

44
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:41,855
because for better or Worse,
all our lives are different noW,

45
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,053
Profoundly different,

46
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,260
That's What Wars do,
They change us,

47
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,164
But the stakes,,,

48
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,370
Well, the stakes are nothing less
than the fate of mankind.

49
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,912
But Why does there need to be
a War at all?

50
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,887
I've seen the future,
and it's a bleak one,

51
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,653
The human race is old,
It's sick, it's dying,

52
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:17,728
What's left of civilization is controlled
by a brutal and poWerful elite

53
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,331
Who have effectively
shut themselves off

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,195
in the World's last city

55
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,360
While the rest of humanity
struggle for survival

56
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,132
in the surrounding Wasteland,

57
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,970
- Sounds pretty hopeless,
- Doesn't it?

58
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,969
But there is hope.

59
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,814
There is alWays hope
and it rests With us,

60
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,750
We can change the future,
but We must start noW, today,

61
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,084
Everything crucial
to the World's survival, its prosperity--

62
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,126
The resources of this planet:
food, Water, energy,

63
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:53,823
The genetic materials of life itself,
--already, even as I speak,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,130
are being gathered up and controlled
by a poWerful and isolated feW,

65
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,934
This must stop, We must stop it,

66
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:18,386
Our enemies are strong,
and they groW stronger daily,

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,127
And they Will go to any lengths
to maintain their dominance,

68
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:28,996
to confine us to our current path,
a path leading only to disaster.

69
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,605
Only to the catastrophic future
that awaits us.

70
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,540
We must band together to fight this,

71
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,203
this evil amongst us.

72
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,751
An evil that would destroy us all.

73
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,323
We won't have another chance.

74
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,251
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know what happened, okay?

75
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,588
One minute I'm going over
the bulletins with Havemeyer.

76
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,823
Next thing I know, I got drool all over
my shirt, and Havemeyer's snoring.

77
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,899
So you're saying the night shift
just fell asleep?

78
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,468
Fell asleep, passed out.
I don't remember.

79
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,298
- What the hell is going on?
- Good question.

80
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,771
I've got an entire building full of agents
who can't remember a damn thing.

81
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,172
And while they were napping,
every member of the Nova Group

82
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,245
in NTAC custody
walked out the front door.

83
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,642
Yeah, walked, ran, flew.

84
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,874
No way of knowing since they erased
the security tapes.

85
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,952
But every 4400 downstairs gets
injected with the promicin inhibitor.

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,213
So none of them
could've used their abilities to escape.

87
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,584
They must have had help.
Someone on the outside, a 4400.

88
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,952
No, more than one.

89
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,890
Someone to knock our people out,
another to disable the security system.

90
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,896
So we talking sympathizers
or members we've never caught?

91
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,830
Either way, it looks like someone's
putting the Nova Group back together.

92
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,227
Paul Newbold has the ability
to raise or lower body temperature.

93
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,599
Tina Richardson,
she wipes memories.

94
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,673
She can make you forget
what you had for breakfast,

95
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,331
or she can erase your entire life.

96
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,171
Then there's my old friend
Boyd Gelder,

97
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,177
who can take over your entire life.

98
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,576
The ultimate impersonator.

99
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,446
Any one of these people is capable
of wreaking serious havoc.

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,917
Well, they've done it before.

101
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,648
We have to assume someone broke
them out so they could do it again.

102
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,493
The Nova Group has a lot of scores
to settle, starting with your nephew.

103
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,460
I called Shawn.
The 4400 Center's already a fortress.

104
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,259
But he'll make sure
to kick it up a level.

105
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,231
Dennis Ryland's gotta be high
on their hit list.

106
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,302
Yeah, and Alana and Kyle.

107
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,962
Boyd came after my family before.

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,836
Go. I'll send some agents over
to watch your house.

109
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,814
It's him. Here we go.

110
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,145
- Can we ask you one question, sir?
- Agent Baldwin, one more question.

111
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,287
Agent Baldwin,
why won't your son make a statement?

112
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,218
Did someone pay him
to shoot Jordan Collier?

113
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,221
Did he always know Collier
was alive?

114
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,825
Just one question.

115
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,693
So how long are we gonna be stuck
in here, a few days, couple of months?

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,030
Hopefully not too long.

117
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,469
We caught Boyd Gelder once,
we'll track him down again.

118
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,631
In the meantime, Kyle,
you need to stay close to home.

119
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,539
Don't go anywhere
unless it's absolutely necessary.

120
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,703
That shouldn't be too bad.

121
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,147
After all, you could still be in prison,
I could still be living on the run.

122
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,753
Compared to that,
staying close to home is kind of nice.

123
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,481
And before you know it,
you'll be heading back to school.

124
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,056
She has a point, Kyle.

125
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,227
Did you see those registration forms
I left for you?

126
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,022
If you like, I could--

127
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,324
You know, I could run them over
to the admissions office.

128
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,695
I'm not sure I'm ready
to go back to school.

129
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,836
If you wanna wait a semester,
that's up to you.

130
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,667
But I figured, you know,
going back to school

131
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,638
will help things get back to normal.

132
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,038
Dad, have you looked outside?

133
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,705
- That's not going to happen.
- Kyle, you just have to be patient.

134
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,249
Dad, I know you're trying to help,

135
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,386
but Jordan Collier came back
from the dead.

136
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,249
No one's ever gonna forget that.

137
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,219
As long as they remember
Jordan Collier,

138
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,450
they're gonna remember
the guy who shot him.

139
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,831
I warned Nina Jarvis.

140
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,229
I told her that NTAC
was totally unprepared

141
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,063
for the threat posed by these people.

142
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,432
Did she listen? No.

143
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,235
And here's the result.

144
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,741
NTAC is literally asleep
at their desks,

145
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,905
while the most dangerous 4400s
stroll out the door.

146
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,879
We're talking about the Nova Group.

147
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,679
Violent terrorists.
This isn't about the 4400.

148
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,221
Tom, I'm sure you'll agree that
that distinction's become meaningless.

149
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,326
Every one of the 4400
has developed an ability.

150
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,725
That means every 4400
is a potential enemy.

151
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,627
You know, my daughter's in the
5th grade. She isn't anyone's enemy.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,427
Children grow up, Diana.

153
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,470
Look, Dennis, we don't know
what the Nova is planning.

154
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,469
But they have targeted you before.

155
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,666
Now, NTAC is ready to offer you
any protection you might need.

156
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,004
Well, that's very generous, Tom.

157
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,806
But if my memory serves me,

158
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,949
the Nova Group
made two attempts on my life

159
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,811
while I was under NTAC protection.

160
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,748
Two unsuccessful attempts.

161
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,911
Don't sound so disappointed.

162
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,789
Would you come in a moment,
please?

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,451
This time I'm arranging
for my own security.

164
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,123
Hello.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,299
We were just discussing the newest
threat posed by the Nova Group.

166
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,136
Oh, there is no threat.

167
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,536
Not while I'm around anyway.

168
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,711
Your uncle,
he actually saw them together?

169
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,909
My daughter and Ryland?

170
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,351
At least now we know
where she's been for the last week.

171
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,117
Jordan should have talked to us
before he made her leave.

172
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,491
It was like he delivered her
right to Ryland.

173
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,865
I don't know about that.

174
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,196
If she's the source
of Ryland's promicin,

175
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,836
that means that she was working
with him

176
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,631
Iong before she left the Center.

177
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,204
Maybe one of us could talk to her

178
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,638
and make sure she knows
who she's working with.

179
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,504
When my daughter's
made up her mind,

180
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,839
there's no changing it.
You know that.

181
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,909
I'm sorry, Richard.

182
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,685
All her life, I've been trying
to see something good in lsabelle.

183
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,320
Some kind of light,
something to nurture.

184
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,564
Maybe I've just been
wasting my time...

185
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,264
...because it's never been there.

186
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,604
Maia, I'm home.

187
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,379
I didn't get a chance
to get to the store.

188
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,949
I thought we could order in a pizza.

189
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,609
Don't worry about me. I already ate.

190
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,619
Oh, I can see that.

191
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,219
Why won't he call me back?

192
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,257
Who? Ben?

193
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,025
I left him five messages.

194
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,733
I just want him to know
that I forgive him, you know?

195
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:49,273
It's probably my fault.
I probably pushed him away.

196
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,945
Well, sitting here blaming yourself
is not helping.

197
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,050
Do you think he met someone else?

198
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,358
You need to get up, take a shower,
change your clothes.

199
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,123
And let's all go out to dinner.

200
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,994
What if he calls?

201
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,939
Answer my cell, okay?

202
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,800
Sure.

203
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,843
And if he calls, be nice to him.

204
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,844
Because when we
get back together,

205
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,949
I do not want there to be
any weirdness between the two of you.

206
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,654
Hi, honey.

207
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,695
We had a deal.
No video games before dinner.

208
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,663
- Maia.
- I needed a break.

209
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,827
- From what?
- Aunt April.

210
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm sorry, sweetie.

211
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,238
She hasn't stopped from the second
I came home from school.

212
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,809
She keeps asking me
if they're gonna get back together.

213
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,144
Well, you're gonna have to go easy
on your Aunt April.

214
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,876
She's going through
a really rough time.

215
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,579
But you and Ben,
you were supposed to be together.

216
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,524
Maybe if you told her
about what I saw...

217
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,887
Somehow I don't think
that's gonna make her feel better.

218
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,859
Well, she's gonna know
about you two sooner or later.

219
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,400
I mean, you are going to invite her
to your wedding.

220
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,834
What do you think?

221
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,871
You look remarkable. I'm impressed.

222
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,012
Jordan?

223
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,346
Are we interrupting something?

224
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,011
No. Not at all.
Is everything okay?

225
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,987
Not really.
We just talked to my Uncle Tommy.

226
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,820
He told us that lsabelle
and Dennis Ryland

227
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,222
are working together.

228
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,588
I see.

229
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,569
Jordan, did you hear
what I just told you?

230
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,666
Kicking lsabelle out of here
may not have been the best decision.

231
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,672
While lsabelle was here,
she was a threat.

232
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,174
Her alliance with Dennis Ryland

233
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,904
simply makes it clear
where her loyalty lies.

234
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,405
And clarity's a good thing, yes?

235
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,178
But we still have preparations to make
around this place just to be safe.

236
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,342
Yeah.

237
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,148
It's not only lsabelle and Ryland
out there.

238
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,790
We also have Nova Group
to worry about.

239
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,553
The Nova Group is no longer
our enemy, isn't that right?

240
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,696
We don't have a problem with you.

241
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,232
Not anymore.

242
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,729
Shawn, Richard,
have you met Boyd Gelder?

243
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,465
As you can see,
he's quite the impersonator.

244
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,609
What's one of the Nova doing here?

245
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,438
He is a 4400, Shawn.
Where else should he be?

246
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,380
And besides,
I went to a great deal of trouble

247
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,813
to get him and his friends
out of NTAC.

248
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,786
Jordan, this is crazy.

249
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,621
I put my life on the line
trying to protect this place from Nova.

250
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,786
And now we're the ones
that break them out from NTAC?

251
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,057
- What were you thinking?
- That we have a war to fight.

252
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,167
That Nova is a powerful weapon,
which until now,

253
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,734
has lacked proper guidance.

254
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,599
Jordan, they're terrorists.
They kill people.

255
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,433
They did what needed doing.

256
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,074
They chose action
over accommodation.

257
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,006
Not supporting that choice
was a failure, Shawn.

258
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,373
Oh, so I made a mistake
by not backing the Nova Group?

259
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,105
I am saying
you should have been a leader.

260
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,945
These people are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the greater good.

261
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,053
They're the kind of soldiers
we need in this fight.

262
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,281
They're one of the biggest
reasons why people are scared of us.

263
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,755
If we invite them in here,
we become part of the Nova Group.

264
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,191
And everything you've been preaching
since you've been back

265
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,695
about cooperation and unity
between 4400s and non-4400s?

266
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,333
It's never gonna happen.

267
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,866
Richard?

268
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,103
We're running
a big risk here, Jordan.

269
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,966
We're playing for big stakes.

270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,871
If NTAC finds out we were involved
in the breakout, it'd be bad.

271
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,308
You're sure you covered your tracks?
They're someplace safe?

272
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,175
Along with the 4400s
who helped free them.

273
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,373
They won't be found.

274
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,984
No, no, no, just because
we're not gonna get caught

275
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,053
doesn't make this okay, Richard.

276
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,688
No, tell me
you're not buying into this.

277
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,289
I'm just being realistic.

278
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,723
The fact is we are
more vulnerable than ever.

279
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,125
Isabelle's with Ryland now.

280
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,356
It's only a matter of time
before those soldiers of his

281
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,730
are out there developing abilities.
Jordan is right.

282
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,238
We're playing for big stakes now.

283
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,778
Another month?
That's completely unacceptable.

284
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,856
The initial volunteers
were showing abilities within days.

285
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,552
That's correct, but as you recall,
there were problems. Deaths.

286
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,527
Since the Piersahl incident, we've
scaled back the pace of the promicin.

287
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,097
I never authorized that.

288
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,167
I guaranteed this country
the protection of enhanced troops.

289
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,065
I won't be made a liar by you.

290
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,865
Increase the dosage.

291
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,441
I'll have another shipment of promicin
sent over from Haspel Corp. today.

292
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,840
I don't know why we're wasting time
building an army.

293
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,241
We won't need one.

294
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,575
You're a very powerful
young woman, lsabelle.

295
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,014
But you're still one person.

296
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,176
Think of it as backup.

297
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,084
Well, if that makes you feel
more secure.

298
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,088
But by now, Collier knows
we're working together.

299
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,523
He won't wait a month
to come after us.

300
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,629
If we give those soldiers
the maximum dose of promicin,

301
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,289
how long
before they develop abilities?

302
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,866
Anywhere from two to three days.

303
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,231
Make it two. Why wait?

304
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,929
You heard the lady.

305
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,701
I'll be staying on base
to monitor your progress.

306
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,147
Kyle.

307
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,146
- There he is.
- Hey.

308
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,880
Yes.

309
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,421
Look at you, man. You look great.
I can't believe you're standing here.

310
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,223
We have to celebrate,
we gotta do something.

311
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,389
Yeah, that sounds good.

312
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,500
First I need to ask a favor of you.

313
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,065
Name it.

314
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,934
It's good to see you, Kyle.
I was hoping we could talk.

315
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,308
It's really you, isn't it?

316
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,435
You're alive.

317
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,248
It took a while to believe it myself.

318
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,144
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

319
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,014
There's nothing to be sorry about.

320
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,746
My death had to happen.

321
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,281
I've seen you on TV.

322
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,121
You seem so sure that what we all
went through means something.

323
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,191
I wish I could understand it
the way you do.

324
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,525
To me, it all seems like a waste.

325
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,328
My death was part of a bigger plan.

326
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,539
I know you suffered for it,
and that was unfair.

327
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,439
But everything you did, Kyle,
including my assassination,

328
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,643
was part of that plan.

329
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,109
You have no idea
how important you are.

330
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,354
Tell me we could spend
the whole night together.

331
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,424
I really think that Maia
should be there when I tell her.

332
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,002
That way at least she can explain
the whole prediction thing.

333
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,469
Well, so much for afterglow.

334
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,474
Please tell me you weren't thinking
of April the whole time.

335
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,044
No. I wasn't.

336
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,450
You're right.

337
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,449
We should tell her.

338
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,055
I should do it.
She should hear it from me.

339
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,553
That would be like hiding
behind you.

340
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,356
And I admit that sounds good
right now,

341
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,591
but I'll just only hate myself
even more.

342
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,901
I just wish I knew what to say.

343
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,368
Tell her the truth, you know.

344
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,070
We didn't plan this.

345
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,268
We didn't even want it,
but it happened.

346
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,941
We fell in love.

347
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,181
Isn't it a bit early
to be using that word?

348
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,376
What would you call it?

349
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,881
Oh, God.

350
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,057
It's true.

351
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,021
Two weeks, and I'm in love.

352
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,455
It's a good thing.

353
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,797
I know it is. I mean, it should be.

354
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,974
But I'm in love and I can't enjoy it.
How pathetic is that?

355
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,806
- What's all this?
- I have a lot of time on my hands.

356
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,918
I thought someone
should benefit from it.

357
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,185
Not you. Kyle.

358
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,723
I'm making penne arrabiata.

359
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,554
I'll bet you he hasn't had it
in a while.

360
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,892
- Where is Kyle?
- He'll be home any minute.

361
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,499
He went out? After I told him not to?

362
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,830
He drove to Northmount,
wanted to register for some classes.

363
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,064
That's great.

364
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,538
How did he get past the reporters?

365
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,540
They don't even know he's gone.

366
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,236
I made a pitcher of iced tea
and some sandwiches,

367
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,675
and I brought it out to them.

368
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,807
And I distracted them
while Kyle slipped out the back.

369
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,511
We planned the whole thing together.
It was fun.

370
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,622
I'm glad someone had a good day.

371
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,090
I take it you didn't have
a good day at work.

372
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,095
No. We talked to the family
of every prisoner we lost.

373
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,256
No one has heard or seen anything.

374
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,368
I mean, not that they'd give up
their loved ones so easily.

375
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,504
And then there's always the 4400
who broke them out.

376
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,801
Excuse me, honey.

377
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,909
We haven't made much headway
on that front either.

378
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,606
Kyle's gonna be a happy man.

379
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,113
You think we would've heard
something about a 4400

380
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,946
who can override
a state-of-the-art security system

381
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,214
or cut off oxygen
to a whole building full of people.

382
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,857
I had a student at the Center.

383
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,656
When he first came to school,
he had some problems.

384
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,129
Teachers and the other children
kept having headaches

385
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,996
and fainting when he was around.

386
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,502
It turns out that it was something
about his ability

387
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,164
to change the level of oxygen
in the blood.

388
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,908
Alana, this student,
what was his name?

389
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,272
Michael Lawrence?

390
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,937
You think he had something to do
with the prison break? He's 1 6.

391
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,583
His ability matches up
to what happened to our agents.

392
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,241
And Boyd Gelder isn't much older.

393
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,819
Now, we've spoken
to Michael's father.

394
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,683
He says he hasn't seen his son
in a week.

395
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,619
Shawn, is it possible
there's a new Nova cell

396
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,986
operating out of the Center?

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,027
Well, if there were, don't you think
they would've come after me by now?

398
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,528
Well, they still might.
We don't know what they're planning.

399
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,360
You mind if we talk
to some of the students?

400
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,058
See what they can tell us
about Michael?

401
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,930
Yeah, talk to whoever you like.

402
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,969
Listen, Shawn.

403
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,066
Look, I appreciate this.

404
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,177
You know, it really helps to have
someone here we can work with.

405
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,110
I hope that doesn't change
now that Collier's back.

406
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,041
All right.

407
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,051
Michael Lawrence's ability
is unique, useful,

408
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,555
and he controls it
with a great deal of accuracy.

409
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,159
Why wouldn't I make use of him?

410
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,296
Because he's a 1 6-year-old kid
you just turned into a felon.

411
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,989
Shawn, that boy allowed us
to neutralize a building

412
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,600
full of NTAC agents
without hurting anyone.

413
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,932
I think that showed great restraint,
given the urgency of our needs.

414
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,095
What needs, Jordan?

415
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,867
What's so important that we need
to get into bed with the Nova Group?

416
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,068
Come on, I ran this place
while you were gone.

417
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,509
I think I deserve to know
what you're planning.

418
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:06,981
Ryland's Enhanced Soldier program?
We're going to destroy it.

419
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,319
Destroy how?

420
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,451
With Nova's help,
we'll attack the Army base

421
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,851
where the experiment's conducted.

422
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,548
Take out the lab, the training facility.

423
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,924
And when we find the soldiers
getting promicin, neutralize them.

424
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,699
Attack a military installation?
Jordan, are you insane?

425
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,063
That's how you sound right now.

426
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,330
I don't care what you think
you saw while you were gone.

427
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,669
This is the real world.
Jordan, listen to me.

428
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,675
Do you know how many people
would die on both sides?

429
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,779
We have no choice.

430
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,678
Once those soldiers
develop 4400 abilities,

431
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,882
it will be too late.

432
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,362
There's a gas station.
It's on a highway.

433
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,030
Next to it there's a road sign.

434
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,127
- Can you read the sign?
- Trying.

435
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,206
Something about
a petrified tree stump.

436
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,335
It's the biggest one in the state,

437
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,809
Afraid that's all of it.

438
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,541
That's the thing
with this remote viewing.

439
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,549
I never quite see everything.

440
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,688
That ought to be enough
to find them.

441
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:29,629
Gas and a quart of oil
comes to 53 even.

442
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,234
Okay.

443
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,163
I hope you can take some time
and visit Newfield's claim to fame.

444
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,742
There's not another stump like it
on the whole West Coast.

445
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,937
We're just passing through.

446
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,708
If I go back the way I came,
will I find the highway?

447
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,681
Oh, she can help you with that.

448
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,645
He wants to get right back
on the highway.

449
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,848
Well, that's easy.

450
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,188
But first I think you should visit
the Newfield stump.

451
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,392
They have
a really nice gift shop there.

452
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,391
The town could sure use
your business.

453
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,395
Yeah.

454
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,642
- I just follow the sign?
- That's right.

455
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,337
And there's a nice diner
along the way.

456
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,209
All the pies are baked fresh.

457
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,078
It sounds good. I'll check that out.
Thank you.

458
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,617
You won't be disappointed.

459
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,128
Those pies come in on a truck.

460
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,928
They need the business.

461
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,872
Dr. Burkhoff, Ms. Doerner.

462
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,211
I'm Jordan Collier.

463
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,215
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.

464
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,115
How is your research coming?

465
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,425
Keeps my nights interesting.

466
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,921
Mr. Collier, we've made a nice life
for ourselves.

467
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,258
This is a good place for us.

468
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,732
And we like to think that we make
things a little better by being here.

469
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,334
Please don't ruin it.

470
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,906
Were it up to me,
you'd live here happily many years.

471
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,739
But right now,
I need your ability and your intellect.

472
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,381
Oh, hey, sweetie.

473
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,017
I think
it's Grilled Cheese Wednesday.

474
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,318
Where's your Aunt April?

475
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,357
Please don't be mad.

476
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,659
Why would I be mad?

477
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,730
You didn't.

478
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:50,534
I thought it would make her feel better,
knowing about my vision.

479
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,177
That it's not her fault
that Ben likes you more.

480
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,906
And did it make her feel better?

481
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,481
No, not really.

482
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,647
She's in your room.

483
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,087
April?

484
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,922
In here.

485
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,828
You're out of tissues.

486
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,004
There's more
under the bathroom sink.

487
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:33,048
You know, one of the reasons
that I liked Ben in the first place

488
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:37,177
was because I thought, "Here's a guy
my sister would approve of.

489
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,285
Finally."

490
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,760
Well, you were right.

491
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,157
This was it.

492
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:51,166
My one chance to settle down
with the right guy.

493
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,167
Except it turns out
he's your right guy.

494
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,967
Oh, God, April.
This whole thing with Ben.

495
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,876
I mean, we never meant
for it to happen.

496
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,612
I know that doesn't help much.

497
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,515
I know I'll meet another guy.
I always do.

498
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:20,086
Meeting them, sleeping with them,
going to the Fetish Ball with them.

499
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,495
That's not the problem.

500
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,395
Finding one that wants to go
to the Fetish Ball with me

501
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,063
year after year.

502
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,701
That's the problem.

503
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,412
Ben's willing to go
to the Fetish Ball with you?

504
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,381
He was considering it.

505
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,787
Look, Di, I wish I could hate you.

506
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,552
I really do.

507
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,121
But I'm too busy hating me.

508
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,725
I'm such a loser.

509
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,695
No. No, you're not.

510
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,896
Yes, I am.

511
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,507
I'm gonna live alone
and I'm gonna die alone.

512
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:10,740
And all I'm ever gonna be to anyone
is Aunt April, the loser.

513
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,561
Hey, Kyle. You got a second?

514
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,826
Yeah, just getting rid
of some old stuff.

515
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,665
Come on, Dad.
I was 9 when I got that.

516
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,177
Yeah, I remember the day.

517
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,809
Listen, Kyle, you know,
once you go back to school,

518
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,315
I thought I'd float you some cash.

519
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,816
That way you can get
your own place.

520
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,046
so you can have some privacy,
some independence.

521
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,156
I saw Jordan Collier yesterday.

522
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,118
- You went to the Center. Why?
- I had to see him.

523
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,629
We talked.
He helped me realize some things.

524
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,595
What things?

525
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,901
Well, I'm not going back to college,
for one.

526
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,164
Dad, just listen to me. Hear me out.

527
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,707
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.

528
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,744
That night on the beach
when Shawn was taken,

529
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,940
it should have been me.

530
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,548
If he hadn't pushed me
out of that beam of light,

531
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,949
- I would've been one of them.
- Yeah, but you're not.

532
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,249
Kyle, your life can be
whatever you want it to be.

533
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,051
You just have to be willing
to move forward.

534
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,093
Ever since I woke up from that coma,
I thought I was moving forward.

535
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,254
But Jordan helped me realize
all I was doing was running away.

536
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,559
He told you that?
He told you not to go to college?!

537
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,532
No, Dad, he just listened to me.

538
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,938
I figured it out on my own.

539
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,333
So, what do you do now, Kyle?

540
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,809
You put on a blue blazer
and become one of his disciples?

541
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,675
Give tours at the Center?
Answer phones?

542
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,077
Maybe.

543
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,850
I'm gonna do what you do, Dad.

544
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,381
I'm gonna help the 4400
any way I can.

545
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,529
I'm sorry. I agree with Jordan
on this one, Shawn.

546
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,926
How can you say that?

547
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,589
If we attack that Army base,

548
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,894
it's like declaring war
on the United States government.

549
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,300
Maybe, but it seems to me
we have been in an undeclared war

550
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,133
with the government
ever since we got back.

551
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,571
Locking us in quarantine,
shooting us up with the inhibitor.

552
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,371
Disappearing any of us
they seem threatened by.

553
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,777
All Jordan is doing is bringing
the conflict out into the open.

554
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,610
Jordan is gonna sacrifice
thousands of lives.

555
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,275
It's gonna be for nothing.
We're gonna lose.

556
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,354
If you have another way,

557
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,457
something concrete
that makes us safer,

558
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,327
I'm willing to listen.

559
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,797
Oh, my God.

560
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,163
I didn't think so.

561
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,170
Okay, can you give us a hint
what this is about?

562
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,575
You said it was urgent.

563
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:08,158
The Nova members that escaped,
I know what they're planning.

564
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,618
I know who their leader is.

565
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,787
Okay.

566
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,335
Shawn, I'm gonna need a name.

567
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,242
Jordan Collier.

568
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,781
You must think I'm insane.

569
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,682
Only a psychopath
would declare war on the U.S. Army.

570
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,321
Well, then we're all in agreement.

571
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,150
I assure you, I am not crazy.

572
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,522
I am not planning any attack
on a government installation.

573
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,526
So you're saying
Shawn made all this up?

574
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,962
Why would I do that?
Jordan, just tell the truth, okay?

575
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,464
You can't cover this up.

576
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:55,168
I told you a story, Shawn,
to see if you would pass it along.

577
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,331
It was a test.

578
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,476
And I'm afraid you failed.

579
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,544
I've been away from this place
for a long time.

580
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,080
In the days ahead,
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.

581
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,082
I needed to know who I could trust.

582
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,446
And who I couldn't.

583
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,520
Sorry to embarrass you
like this, Shawn.

584
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,156
It was the only way to be sure.

585
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,189
And what about the breakout
at NTAC?

586
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,725
You had nothing to do with that?

587
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,692
- I did not.
- That is a lie! That's a lie!

588
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,230
I saw Boyd Gelder
standing in this office

589
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,924
with my own two eyes.

590
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,166
Richard was here with me.
He saw him too. Richard?

591
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,272
I don't know
what you're talking about, Shawn.

592
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:32,869
Richard?

593
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,071
As far as I know,
Boyd Gelder has never been here.

594
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,114
So you're saying
in spite of all of Collier's denials,

595
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,350
this base is still the subject
of a possible Nova attack?

596
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,461
It's possible, yes.

597
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,223
And you came all this way
to warn me?

598
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,833
- I'm touched, Tom.
- Just doing my job, Dennis.

599
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,434
It's nothing personal.

600
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,299
Collier knows you're here,
so this place is no longer secure.

601
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,463
Your little experiment
needs a new home.

602
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,132
I say let them come. If Collier
wants a fight, we'll give him one.

603
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,902
She's right, you know.

604
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,876
Collier talks a good game.

605
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Unity, fighting together
to save the future.

606
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,981
People actually believe he means it.
It's pathetic.

607
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,555
But an attack will expose the 4400
for what they really are:

608
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,216
The enemy.
You see, Tom? I was right all along.

609
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,555
It comes down to survival.

610
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,789
Us against them.

611
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,593
You sure you wanna be at ground zero
for this one, Dennis?

612
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,636
Defending the human race?

613
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,105
Where else would I be?

614
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,804
We're staying right here.

615
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:52,017
How did it feel,
turning your back on me?

616
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,722
I was just trying to save lives.

617
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,883
Yours included.

618
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,657
You know,
maybe if you'd told me everything,

619
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,596
treated me with a little respect,
we could have worked things out.

620
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,864
But, no, you were too busy
manipulating me like always.

621
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,205
You know, Jordan,
while you were gone, I ran this place.

622
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,573
And I did a pretty good job of it too.

623
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,077
Now you're back. You and l?
It's like nothing's changed.

624
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,982
You make all the decisions
and I play catch up five steps behind.

625
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,180
It used to be ten.

626
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,488
Shawn, I need you to believe in me.

627
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,161
You know what I think, Jordan?

628
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,024
I think that this whole messiah thing
has gone to your head.

629
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:42,104
I'm no messiah.
More like John Brown.

630
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,367
John Brown? Isn't he the guy
that tried to free all the slaves?

631
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,512
He surrounded himself with people
who believed as he did,

632
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,512
were willing to do anything
for their cause.

633
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,810
And that kind of devotion
can change the world.

634
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,784
They killed John Brown, Jordan.

635
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,084
They killed me too.

636
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,527
Mr. Ryland, I was told
we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.

637
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,728
We have a security situation.

638
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,806
NTAC intelligence has gotten word

639
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,034
that Jordan Collier
may be planning a move against us.

640
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,113
I wanna transfer all the promicin
out of Haspel Corp. for safekeeping.

641
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,547
I want every vial packed and ready
for shipment as soon as possible.

642
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,345
Yes, sir.

643
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,587
Give us a hand here.
We've got a lot of crates to move.

644
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,928
I want them loaded up
as soon as possible.

645
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,541
We'll take it from here.

646
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,276
The military base
was never Collier's target.

647
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,784
He wanted to divert us
from his real goal.

648
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,940
The promicin.

649
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,451
Had enough stored to create
a whole army of enhanced soldiers.

650
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,250
Before Collier's done, you'll wish
you had that army for protection.

651
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,016
I wonder what he's gonna do
with all of it.

652
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,060
Destroy it. He doesn't want
anyone else to develop abilities.

653
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,493
He wants to keep us weak
so no one can fight back.

654
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,132
Sounding a little paranoid, Dennis.

655
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,858
Collier's a fanatic, Tom.

656
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,868
He's capable of anything. You'll see.

657
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,210
So you're saying
you wanna break up?

658
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,405
I don't want to.

659
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,573
Well, then let's not.

660
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,786
Look, I know how bad you feel.

661
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,789
I feel bad too,
but I also feel really good.

662
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,891
Isn't that worth holding on to?
Trying at least?

663
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,088
Well, I'm trying. Believe me.

664
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,194
It is like we're never alone.

665
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,303
There's you, me and April,
and she's the one crying.

666
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,973
Yeah, I think I need to leave.

667
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,076
Oh, great.
Now April and I are both crying.

668
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,236
No. Look, I didn't mean for good.

669
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,746
You can't get rid of me that easily.

670
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,185
But I do have a job to do in London.

671
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,050
It's five days, so it'll give us some time
to think things over.

672
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,157
Five days?

673
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,851
- Wanna come?
- No.

674
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,757
Yes.

675
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,262
Just leave. Please.

676
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,904
Hey.

677
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,940
I'll call you as soon as I get back,
okay?

678
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,186
Oh, just so you know.

679
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,386
Even if Maia
never made any prediction...

680
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,395
...I'd still think
we're meant for each other.

681
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,254
Hey, Kyle! Alana!

682
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,755
Thomas.
I've been trying to reach you.

683
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,950
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Kyle's leaving.

684
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,926
- What?
- He's upstairs packing.

685
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,235
- Kyle, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm glad you're home.

686
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,235
I would've hated to leave
without saying goodbye.

687
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,930
Where are you going?

688
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,575
Did Collier send that limo?

689
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,233
I've got a job.

690
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,505
I'm gonna travel around the country
for a little while.

691
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,272
Hold these workshops
at the 4400 Centers.

692
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,940
Talk about my life,
everything that's happened to me.

693
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,087
- Spread the word.
- Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?

694
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,348
You know, think this over?
We can talk about this.

695
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,287
There's nothing to talk about.

696
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,262
I'm gonna miss you, Dad,
but I gotta do this.

697
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,991
I just got you home.

698
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,035
You said I should move forward.
That's what I'm doing.

699
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,899
Be happy for me.

700
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,266
I'm trying, Kyle.

701
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,834
I'm really trying.

702
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,381
I gotta get going.

703
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,856
I really gotta get going.

704
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,263
Here.

705
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,359
- Let me help you.
- Thanks, Dad.

706
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,504
- It's beautiful.
- lsn't it?

707
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,830
They're going to be looking for it.

708
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,532
We gotta get rid of it soon.

709
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,201
I don't understand.
Why take it at all?

710
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,509
Why not just destroy it there?

711
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,542
We're not going to destroy it.

712
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,220
All right. I'll ask the question.

713
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:12,256
What are we gonna do
with 1 7,432 units of promicin?

714
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,928
We're going to give it away.

715
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,458
To whom?

716
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,806
To everyone.
