1
00:00:02,077 --> 00:00:03,828
Previously on "The 4400".

2
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:14,239
We're not sure what happened.
Something's out there.

3
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:18,117
The light has gone and
thousands of people have appeared.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,370
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.

5
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:24,958
You'll be one of the teams investigating
what happened to the returnees.

6
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:27,794
We're letting them go.

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,838
We have no right to hold them.

8
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:33,424
I'm Warren Lytell.
HomeSec mentioned I was coming.

9
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,426
I'm here to clean up your mess.

10
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:39,931
There's gonna be a change around here.
Be part of it or get swept aside.

11
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:45,353
I'll provide a safe haven for any 4400.
You'll be our first residents.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,565
- I'm in love with Richard.
- Why would I break you up?

13
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:52,110
If you're on the job, I feel safe.
So does the baby.

14
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:55,572
Two happy residents. That's a start.

15
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,284
Maia Rutledge, aged eight.
Disappeared in '46.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,037
She makes predictions.
Once they come true,

17
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:06,791
she's removed from quarantine
by one of our field agents.

18
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,627
You can't bring Maia
back to school any more.

19
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,213
We have to consider the other students.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,923
- It'll be OK.
- It's not OK.

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,676
Somebody will make everything better.

22
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,429
Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17.

23
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,932
Disappeared in April of 2001.
It's a little thin.

24
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,810
Me breaking up with Danny
is not about you.

25
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,895
OK.

26
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:32,066
I need to ask you a few questions.

27
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,361
I don't know what happened.
I just put my hands on him.

28
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,654
Woke up...

29
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,324
Don't touch me.

30
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,660
I recognise you
but I don't know who you are.

31
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:45,246
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking.

32
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,582
- For what?
- For me.

33
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:51,419
I finally understand.
They're not the strangers.

34
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:53,796
I am.

35
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,967
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.

36
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:13,649
Kyle.

37
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,195
I'm not Kyle.

38
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:21,574
- Then who are you?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:28,456
- I need more screens.
- OK.

40
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:34,754
Your son is experiencing
a dissociative disorder.

41
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,882
That's common
for newly awakened coma patients.

42
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,511
He feels disconnected
from his personality.

43
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:46,015
We knew he'd need to adjust
but he doesn't know who he is.

44
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:50,394
This is frustrating but you did
the right thing bringing him back here.

45
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,271
Yeah.

46
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,359
- So what now?
- We need to do another cranial MRI.

47
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,487
They'll be here in an hour
to take him downstairs.

48
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:02,323
I know this is difficult, Tom.

49
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,993
But Kyle's come this far.
We can't give up now.

50
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,873
I think I've got the exact change.

51
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,045
Hello, cutie.

52
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,298
Thanks.

53
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:24,011
- How long have you known that man?
- Tony? About two years.

54
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:27,723
- He's nice.
- He's very nice.

55
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,394
- Why do you say that?
- He's going to fall in love today.

56
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,729
Tony? My God. Good for him.

57
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,898
- It's not with me, is it?
- Nope.

58
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,693
I didn't think so.

59
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,453
Is there something else, Maia?

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,001
- How long am I going to be like this?
- Like what?

61
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,421
I don't want to know things
before they happen.

62
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:01,674
I want to be normal, like I used to be.

63
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:06,053
It's gonna be OK, sweetie.

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,891
- Besides, who's normal anyway?
- You are.

65
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:13,269
Huh! You want to know a secret?

66
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,355
Normal people like me...

67
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:21,402
...they just wish
they were special, like you.

68
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,696
Put the television back on.

69
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:29,410
Kyle, when you came home you spent
all that time looking through your books.

70
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:32,997
Then the maps, now the TV.
What are you looking for?

71
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,875
Maybe we can help you look, too.

72
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,643
Come here.

73
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,565
- You should go and get some rest.
- I'm not leaving him.

74
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:06,572
All right. I'll go and grab some stuff.
Be back in a half hour, OK?

75
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:37,645
What are you doing? Leave him alone!

76
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,272
Who are you people?
I'm calling Security.

77
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,942
I'm Agent Lytell.
I work with your husband.

78
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,736
I don't care who you work with.

79
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:50,199
Tell Tom I figured it out.
I know where I have to be.

80
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,037
Don't worry. He's gonna be safe.

81
00:05:55,204 --> 00:06:00,084
The government's gonna be supervising
his medical care from now on.

82
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:11,465
You snatched that kid from a hospital?
What were you thinking?

83
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:15,118
He's the only witness to an abduction.

84
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,079
He can't remember his own name.

85
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,040
Then we'll help him remember.

86
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,959
His mother's upset. It's understandable.

87
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:25,796
- But DC sent me...
- Tom!

88
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,507
- Where's my son?
- Whoa!

89
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:32,844
- Get your hands off me.
- I'll ask you one more time.

90
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:38,016
- Ryland? You wanna help me?
- It's a tough call.

91
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,977
- Where's Kyle?
- All right, Tom.

92
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,397
- Put the gun away.
- Dennis...

93
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,983
Tom, put the gun away.

94
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,780
- You should have let me pull the trigger.
- I was tempted.

95
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,616
But shooting Lytell won't get Kyle back.

96
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:57,536
It'd make me feel a hell of a lot better.

97
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,831
Why Kyle?
Why didn't he go after Shawn?

98
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,750
Our doctors went over Shawn
dozens of times.

99
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,003
- Kyle's new territory for them.
- New territory?

100
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,464
- That's my son.
- I know that.

101
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:13,218
- Can't you call DC?
- What good would that do?

102
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,012
DC put Lytell here in the first place.

103
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,266
- They're backing his play.
- So we do nothing?

104
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,269
- I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back.
- When?

105
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:26,064
For Christ's sake, I don't know.
I just heard an hour ago.

106
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:28,233
I don't know where Lytell put him.

107
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,486
Not good enough, Dennis.

108
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,573
I'm not sitting around
while you play phone tag.

109
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,827
- I'm getting my son. Get your hands off.
- Tom!

110
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,996
We go back a long way.

111
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:45,250
If you try to go around me on this,
none of it matters.

112
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,255
I know.

113
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,803
Tom, what happened
between you and Lytell?

114
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,097
Ask Ryland.

115
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:00,974
Tom!

116
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,897
- Tom!
- What?

117
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,608
- If you're in trouble, I need to know.
- Why?

118
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:13,445
- Cos I might be able to help.
- Just stay out of it, all right?

119
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,573
Drive the car.

120
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,789
Blood work looks fine,
the RH factor levels are normal

121
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:27,083
and your calcium's OK.

122
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,171
So how do you feel, Lily?

123
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,799
- It's hard sometimes.
- That's to be expected.

124
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,679
Now, where was I?

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,185
Oh, right. I'll have to draw
some more amniotic fluid.

126
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,230
Why? Is something wrong?

127
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,027
What kind of genetic anomaly?

128
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:58,531
All I know is she wants to grow
one of the baby's chromosomes in a lab.

129
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,537
It'll be OK.

130
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:23,473
It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes.
Either of you play golf?

131
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,851
- I'm afraid not.
- That's too bad.

132
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:29,854
Listen, about that doctor you sent us to.

133
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,942
Roxanne Kern. She's the best OBGYN
in the Pacific northwest.

134
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:38,613
You're in good hands. So how did
that support group meeting go?

135
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,992
- It went well, thank you.
- Nobody complain about the catering?

136
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,454
I have to admit,
the lobster sushi was a great idea.

137
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,790
You see? You just have to trust me.

138
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,502
Your girlfriend has quite an imagination.

139
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:57,006
She thought I was trying
to steal her away from you.

140
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,552
- Can you believe that?
- Er... not really.

141
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,724
I like your confidence.
See? You were worried about nothing.

142
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,856
I wasn't worried.

143
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:28,121
- We've gotta tell him.
- I'll do it. It should be me.

144
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,498
When?

145
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,668
Soon.
I can't take all this sneaking around.

146
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:40,967
- Besides, I miss seeing you.
- I miss you, too.

147
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,604
You suspected that Shawn had these
abilities since his coming home party

148
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,856
and you never told me.

149
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,817
- I never told Linda.
- You're divorcing her.

150
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,986
- I'm your partner.
- I know.

151
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:04,282
When we were assigned to the 4400,
you were calling them viruses.

152
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,784
Have you noticed any change in me?

153
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:10,330
Maybe because I have one of them
living in my apartment.

154
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,920
- Point taken.
- I would have told you.

155
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,130
I heard you, all right?

156
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:23,468
- Can we continue the reprimand later?
- Fine.

157
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,890
- What are we going to do about Kyle?
- "We"?

158
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,142
Of course "we".

159
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,897
We are gonna go find him
and bring him home.

160
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:38,107
Then we better get to work.

161
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,781
Mr Collier is not available right now.

162
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:50,994
I'll have him return your call.
Thank you, Dr Kern.

163
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,497
Dr Kern, the OBGYN?

164
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:57,876
- Mm-hm.
- Jordan about to have a baby?

165
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,253
- I wouldn't know.
- Huh.

166
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,633
Here's the security logs
he asked to see.

167
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,885
I'll put them on his desk.

168
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,472
Can I see Jordan's phone logs
for the last couple of weeks?

169
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,808
What for?

170
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:18,104
He's been receiving
some threatening mail.

171
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:21,358
I want to crosscheck it
with his incoming calls.

172
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:27,155
It doesn't leave this office.

173
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:39,292
I need to see Dr Kern right now.

174
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,962
Mr Tyler, she can't be disturbed.

175
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,471
- Mr Tyler!
- This won't take long. Dr Kern.

176
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:47,641
- She's busy.
- Does Lily have an appointment?

177
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:51,937
No. Why do you call Jordan Collier
every time she comes to see you?

178
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:57,776
- My phone habits don't concern you.
- I think they do.

179
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:01,613
What does Collier know
about Lily's baby that she doesn't?

180
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:06,118
Sickle cell anaemia?

181
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,496
How can my baby have the trait
for sickle cell anaemia?

182
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:14,918
Unless the father's black.

183
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,714
Maybe he is.

184
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,968
- What are you saying, Richard?
- I don't know.

185
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:28,431
Maybe whoever took us
used me as some kind of donor.

186
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:33,603
The question is, why would Jordan
have Dr Kern keep this from us?

187
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,357
The baby's carrying the sickle cell trait.

188
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:41,987
That brings us closer.
Maybe he doesn't want that to happen.

189
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:44,447
Maybe.

190
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:47,534
I think it's time me and him had a talk.

191
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,749
Michelle Hickock, returnee number 938.

192
00:14:54,916 --> 00:15:00,088
She's coming in at 4:00 for counselling
and I want to see her afterwards, OK?

193
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,099
He's logged on.

194
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,935
Lytell's on the network. You good to go?

195
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,939
Tom really appreciates you helping him.

196
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,610
I'm not doing it for Tom.

197
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,303
Come on.

198
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,477
Kyle's being held at the quarantine
Centre, building 9, sub-basement 3.

199
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:57,979
That's great. I owe you.

200
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,274
OK. Well...

201
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:05,653
- Marco, thanks for your help.
- No worries.

202
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,449
- You ready to roll?
- We should wait for the nightshift.

203
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:12,744
- They're half staff.
- OK. I'll pick you up at 4:00.

204
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:14,954
See you.

205
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:24,881
This is the place. It's just outside
of the city in West Belleview.

206
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:27,133
The seller won't be there?

207
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,512
He's in Spain. Another realtor told me.

208
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,223
- It'll be a perfect safe house.
- Set it up.

209
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,810
- Make sure you're not followed.
- I'm being watched?

210
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,354
If I was Lytell, I'd keep an eye on you.

211
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,648
Check your mirrors and stay cool.

212
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:44,692
I never thought I'd have to use
what you taught me.

213
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:47,362
You'll do fine.

214
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,699
- I'll get Kyle and I'll meet you up there.
- I'll be waiting.

215
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:54,452
- You be careful.
- I will.

216
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:08,133
They're nice, huh? I remember how
much you told me you liked moonstones.

217
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,178
I do. But I can't accept these.

218
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,475
Why not? I mean, I got them for you.

219
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:24,607
Come on, Nikki.
Look, I know I messed up.

220
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:29,487
- Didn't Shawn talk to you?
- What does he have to do with it?

221
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,537
Nikki?

222
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:48,590
- Hey.
- Maia ready?

223
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:52,343
Maia's talking
with one of your colleagues.

224
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:59,809
Some of the clothes look funny.
And the cars.

225
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,479
But I don't know.
Video games are kind of fun.

226
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:06,232
Did you like the video games
at quarantine?

227
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,277
I hardly ever got a chance to play.

228
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:13,448
Lytell, what are you doing here?

229
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:17,285
Just talking with Maia.
I thought it was time we met.

230
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:22,916
- Stay away from her.
- That's not really your call, is it?

231
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,836
Maia, it was nice talking with you.

232
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,297
We'll do it again soon.

233
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:40,058
I don't like him.
And he doesn't really like me either.

234
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:43,186
Well, don't you worry about him.

235
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:47,857
- Are you sure?
- Oh! You listen to me, Maia.

236
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:53,571
I am absolutely sure. I am not gonna let
anything bad happen to you. Hear me?

237
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:56,032
- All right?
- OK.

238
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:10,171
Jordan, do you have a minute?

239
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:13,383
I know why you're here.

240
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,886
Roxanne Kern called me
as soon as you left her office.

241
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,934
I hope you and Lily aren't blowing this up
into something bigger than it is,

242
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,686
cos a doctor's
trying to get on my good side.

243
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:30,775
We appreciate everything you've done,
from the house to my job.

244
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:34,362
Our lives have been a lot more
comfortable since we met.

245
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,449
- You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you?
- It's time you back off.

246
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:41,119
Let us run our own lives.

247
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:46,082
Whatever you want.

248
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,168
Tell Lily I said hi, will you?

249
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:55,049
I'll do that.

250
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:04,475
- You good to go?
- Just give me a sec.

251
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:13,234
Gloria, don't answer the door
to anyone you don't know, OK?

252
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,611
Cool.

253
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:19,699
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah. I'll be back before you wake up.

254
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,079
OK.

255
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,790
Better go. Bye.

256
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:35,423
- Diana.
- Don't worry.

257
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,467
- You'll find him.
- Find who?

258
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:42,513
Your son, Kyle.

259
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,558
He's the answer.

260
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,815
- The answer to what?
- Everything.

261
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:19,667
I want to see Kyle Baldwin, please.

262
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:28,425
- You're not on the list.
- I'm a friend of the family.

263
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:31,011
I want to know that he's all right.

264
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:34,431
He's not even one of the 4400
and his father works with me

265
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:39,937
and if you could just give me something
I could tell him cos...

266
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:44,650
Come on, we're both supposed
to be on the same side, right?

267
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:49,988
- I'll see what I can find out.
- Thank you so much. That's great.

268
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:54,201
You won't even have a headache
when you wake up.

269
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:57,204
Well, maybe a little headache.

270
00:21:58,038 --> 00:21:59,998
Come on in.

271
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:03,961
Kyle. Hey, buddy. It's me, buddy.

272
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,095
- Highland Beach.
- What about it?

273
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:16,140
- That's where I have to go.
- Highland Beach.

274
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:20,894
Let's get you out of here first.
Come on. Up.

275
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:25,190
We got him.
He's sitting right here next to me.

276
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,319
He's about the same.
No worse, anyway.

277
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:31,864
See you in a little while.

278
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,410
- How far away is this safe house?
- It's about 30 miles.

279
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:38,662
Your mom's waiting for you, buddy.

280
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:44,168
No. Highland Beach.

281
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:46,086
- Hey!
- Kyle! Let go!

282
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,297
- Kyle!
- Highland Beach!

283
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:51,592
- Let go! Let go!
- Calm down!

284
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:56,180
- We have to go there now.
- What's at Highland Beach?

285
00:22:56,346 --> 00:23:00,684
- That's where Shawn disappeared.
- I have to go back there.

286
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:03,854
Just calm down, buddy. Just...

287
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:08,150
- If that's what you want, we'll take you.
- Are you sure about that?

288
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,445
Kyle's the answer, right?

289
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,367
Two agents are operating outside us.

290
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:22,623
I noticed. It's because you pulled
the Baldwin kid out of the hospital.

291
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,502
- DC wouldn't see it that way.
- DC decided to send you here.

292
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,424
Are we gonna bring him in or not?

293
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,885
Find him.

294
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,932
These people are coming
to the next meeting.

295
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:43,602
It's bigger than the last
so we may need a couple more tables.

296
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,897
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

297
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,484
Lily.

298
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:52,736
Can I see you for a minute?

299
00:23:55,572 --> 00:24:00,827
- I have a few errands to run.
- This won't take long.

300
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,045
Where did you get this?

301
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:15,509
I've been doing security checks on
everyone who's moved into the complex.

302
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:18,303
Don't look shocked, Lily.

303
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,600
A lot of people would love
to see me fall on my face here.

304
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:27,979
A scandal like this would allow them
to force me out of the company.

305
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:32,067
- Richard wouldn't do this.
- I'd have thought so, too.

306
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:35,237
I guess we were both wrong.

307
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:42,911
Do you really think this is going
to change the way I feel about him?

308
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:45,288
That's up to you.

309
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:49,292
But Lily...
you really have to ask yourself...

310
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:54,715
Is this the man
you want raising your baby?

311
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:59,428
Aren't you gonna say something?

312
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:03,765
It was my 23rd birthday.

313
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:07,352
A bunch of guys from the barracks
invited me out to a bar.

314
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,272
- You don't drink.
- Didn't then either.

315
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:13,900
But it was a big deal
them asking me to come along.

316
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:19,406
In those days, Negroes and whites
didn't do much socialising.

317
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:23,452
So I went.

318
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,621
It was kind of nice, you know?

319
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:33,086
Then this woman started
coming onto me. People started staring.

320
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:37,799
So I figured it was time
for me to get out of there.

321
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:46,266
She followed me outside
and asked me to go home with her.

322
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,477
I declined respectfully.

323
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:54,107
That's when she started screaming.

324
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:58,695
- That's all that happened?
- That's all it took in 1945.

325
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:02,616
But the statement the woman made
to the police. I mean...

326
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:06,620
- It's so detailed.
- But Lily, none of it's true.

327
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:10,498
If I hadn't been exonerated
of those charges,

328
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:15,462
would the air force have sent me
to flight school? Made me a pilot?

329
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:20,967
The woman lied.
The charges got dropped.

330
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:29,309
- Why would Jordan bring this up?
- He wants you doubt me.

331
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:32,270
Doubt us.

332
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:38,235
Do you?

333
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,916
We've gotta pack
whatever we can in five minutes.

334
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,628
We're getting out of here.

335
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,464
They're heading west on Sandburg.

336
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,300
There are no freeways in that direction.

337
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:09,391
Highland Beach. That's where they're
going. Have my car brought around.

338
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:14,312
I don't care what you do, just keep your
mouth shut and stay out of my way.

339
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:21,820
Come on, Mom. Are you serious?
The movies? Like, you and me?

340
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:25,407
Is that so weird? We used to go
to the movies all the time.

341
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:28,702
When I was six.

342
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:31,371
Shawn!

343
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,456
You prick!

344
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:36,042
- Danny!
- Danny!

345
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:39,421
- Listen to me...
- You goddamn freak!

346
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:41,798
Danny, stop this!

347
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:46,261
Boys, please! Danny, Shawn, stop!

348
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:49,055
Stop blaming me for Nikki!

349
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:52,517
Don't you see
it's over between you two?

350
00:27:56,479 --> 00:28:00,108
That's enough! Shawn, stop it!
You're killing him!

351
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:04,863
- What did you do?
- I didn't mean to do anything!

352
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:10,493
- Danny!
- Get away from him!

353
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:16,249
Shawn?

354
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,878
- I heard you guys shouting.
- Don't touch me.

355
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:22,005
What?

356
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,340
Don't touch me.

357
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:32,056
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.

358
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:36,603
But I can't stay here
and you can't come where I'm going.

359
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,646
Shawn...

360
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:44,402
I love you, Nikki.

361
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:49,574
- I love you.
- What are you doing? Shawn!

362
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:53,328
No! Stay here and talk about this.

363
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:57,707
Shawn! Shawn, what are you doing?

364
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,751
Shawn!

365
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:21,773
- What's all this?
- What's it look like?

366
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,151
Have you thought about
what you're doing?

367
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:28,488
- It is dangerous outside those gates.
- We'll risk it.

368
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:32,450
- Lily, think about the baby.
- What has the baby to do with this?

369
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:35,536
That baby could be the key to the future

370
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:39,040
and I can protect it
better than Richard or anyone.

371
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,881
- Lily, get in the car.
- I can't let you do that.

372
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:49,217
Stay away from her.

373
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,010
Argh!

374
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,387
Go ahead! Run!

375
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:40,101
It won't do you any good.

376
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:44,731
I will find you.

377
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:47,734
That baby belongs with me.

378
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,136
Kyle!

379
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:13,686
Kyle, we've been walking for ten
minutes. What are you looking for?

380
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:16,772
Maybe we can help you, Kyle.

381
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:20,651
This is where we found him.

382
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:32,830
We're running out of time.

383
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,916
Kyle, I brought you here like you asked.

384
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:40,212
But if there's something you need to do,
you better do it fast.

385
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,423
I belong here.

386
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,384
I tried really hard and...

387
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:50,514
no matter what I've done,
which way I've turned, it just...

388
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,434
It sucks.

389
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:57,479
I need to clear my head
and get away for a while.

390
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:03,235
I guess what I'm asking
is if I could stay here for a while.

391
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:07,323
Shawn, you're one of the 4400.

392
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:11,827
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay here as long as you want.

393
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:15,289
That's great, man. Thanks. Thank you.

394
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:23,630
So, erm... tell me a little bit more
about this ability of yours.

395
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:32,890
- Any idea where we're headed?
- I'll know it when I see it.

396
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:36,435
He's gonna come after us.

397
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:45,611
The baby likes that.

398
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:52,701
You know...
It really wouldn't be so bad, would it?

399
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:55,454
If you were the father?

400
00:32:57,581 --> 00:33:00,709
No, it wouldn't be bad at all.

401
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:20,938
That's their car. Let's go.

402
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:26,026
Listen, these are not criminals.
They're two of our own.

403
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:30,447
Keep your gun holstered. There's no
cause for anybody to get hurt.

404
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:35,744
Kyle, they're coming for you.
They want to take you away.

405
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:39,081
They're too late.

406
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:08,652
- Kyle!
- No! Tom, don't!

407
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:27,379
Kyle?

408
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:29,631
Tom.

409
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:37,764
- You're not my son, are you?
- No.

410
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:42,644
Kyle was meant to be a channel,
a way to communicate.

411
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:45,814
- Communicate with who?
- With you.

412
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,360
To guide you in your dealings
with the returnees.

413
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:56,408
But something went wrong.
Shawn interrupted the process.

414
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:03,540
That's what put him in a coma.

415
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:06,001
He was like that for three years.

416
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:08,378
Tom!

417
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:14,926
Tom.

418
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,185
Tom.

419
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:42,204
Who are you? What are you?

420
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:44,831
I'm human.

421
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:50,170
- Like you.
- No. You're nothing like me.

422
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,589
I come from a different time.

423
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:55,092
That is all.

424
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,679
Your future.

425
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:05,769
Is that where you took them?

426
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:10,899
My nephew and all the others?

427
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,777
- We needed them.
- For what?

428
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,822
To survive.

429
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:21,701
Skouris.

430
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:25,622
Skouris!

431
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,928
In my time, humanity is dying out.

432
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:47,978
You mean it's all going to end?
Everything?

433
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:50,939
- What is going on?
- Kyle brought us out here.

434
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:55,235
- Like he knew it was going to happen.
- Maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin.

435
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:59,114
He said he wasn't.
Maybe he's telling the truth.

436
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:03,034
Tom? Tom, are you all right?

437
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:07,372
We've got to do something. He could
take Baldwin with him. Or kill him.

438
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:10,876
Nobody's doing anything
until we know what's going on.

439
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:17,465
Only those we took could prevent
the catastrophe from happening.

440
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:21,678
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.

441
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:25,348
Why here? Why now?

442
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:29,477
Because history tells us
this is where the path to oblivion began.

443
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:34,774
And the people you took are gonna stop
that from happening? How?

444
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:38,403
They've begun their work.
And you have begun yours.

445
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,865
- Tom, come on.
- Do something or I will.

446
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:43,491
I need you out of there.

447
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:47,245
I don't understand.
What are we supposed to do?

448
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:51,917
- You have to help them.
- How?

449
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:55,128
Go!

450
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,299
How?

451
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,014
You're bleeding.

452
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:22,864
Oh, God. Get an ambulance. Now!

453
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:25,116
Kyle! Kyle!

454
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:28,912
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

455
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:33,166
Kyle! Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!

456
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:37,087
Stay with me! Look at me! Look at me!
Stay! Stay!

457
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:38,797
No! No!

458
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:42,509
Kyle! Kyle! Look at me! Look at me!

459
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:45,970
Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!

460
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,556
Stay with me! Come on! Come on!

461
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:00,652
- No!
- Tom...

462
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:53,246
- Dad?
- Kyle!

463
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,665
What are you doing here?

464
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:58,334
- Where's Shawn?
- Kyle?

465
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:02,547
- I can explain about the beer.
- No!

466
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:06,426
Forget the beer.
You don't have to explain anything.

467
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:09,846
What's going on?

468
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:14,809
Tom. Tom.

469
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:17,270
What did you see?

470
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:28,823
I got you, Kyle.

471
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:08,112
The baby.

472
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:11,074
It's time?

473
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:21,626
I'll get the car.
