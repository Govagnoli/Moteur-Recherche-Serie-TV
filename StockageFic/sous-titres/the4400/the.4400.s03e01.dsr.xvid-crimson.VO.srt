<i>We're not a threat.</i>

2
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,234
<i>We're salvation.</i>

3
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,534
The world
will have to deal with us.

4
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:43,567
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...

5
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:44,901
[jarvis]: What,
so navarro was really

6
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,601
some kind
of mind-reader?

7
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,067
I believe "telepath"
is the word you're looking for.

8
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,734
Just concentrate

9
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:51,868
on what you want
to ask me

10
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,234
and i'll hear you.

11
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,934
The guy definitely knew
what we were thinking.

12
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,601
[Jarvis]: I could think of a few
practical applications for it.

13
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,934
[Collier]: You should have
come to me first.

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,234
I'd have treated you better
than they ever will.

15
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,767
<i>We're at war here.</i>

16
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,734
<i>Don't pick the losing side.</i>

17
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:05,300
There's a synthetic substance

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,734
present in the blood
of every 4400,

19
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,801
and they call it
"promicin inhibitor."

20
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:12,801
But ntac's been
studying the 4400

21
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:13,968
ever since
they got back.

22
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:14,534
They should have
known about this...

23
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:15,467
they do know.

24
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,067
I was ordered to work on a drug

25
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,934
to suppress
the production of promicin.

26
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,601
Once i synthesized
the inhibitor,

27
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,367
we gave it
to every 4400.

28
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,501
If it comes down
to a choice

29
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,467
between the safety
of the american people

30
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,167
and the welfare
of the 4400,

31
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,400
tom...

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,868
that's no choice at all.

33
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:32,734
If you're holding on
to any hope

34
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,501
of keeping this covered up,

35
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,434
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground

36
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:38,300
right here and right now.

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Marco]:
Every male in this building

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,033
has got a gallon of adrenaline

39
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,567
coursing through his veins
right now,

40
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,467
and most of them are armed.

41
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,300
A 4400 nearly took down

42
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,901
a fortified
government facility

43
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,634
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

44
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,234
I wasn't pregnant
when i was abducted,

45
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,634
but i was when i got back.

46
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,067
[Richard]: You've seen
what she's capable of,

47
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,601
what she can do
when she feels threatened.

48
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,400
Did you know
isabelle has connections

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,667
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain

50
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,634
that have never
been seen before?

51
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:05,667
[Matthew]: You are the stewards
of the future.

52
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,634
Your daughter
is the rosetta stone

53
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,133
for understanding

54
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,133
what happened to the 4400.

55
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,934
Isabelle...

56
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,601
isabelle!

57
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,133
Hello, shawn.

58
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,334
I'm isabelle.

59
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,834
The world has changed.

60
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,534
Everything is different now.

61
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:34,634
The promicin inhibitor program
was an international effort.

62
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,167
Its goal

63
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,467
was to prevent the coming
of a world

64
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,334
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.

65
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,467
In short,

66
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,868
we were doing
everything we could

67
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,367
to prevent the 4400

68
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:48,300
from developing
extrahuman capabilities.

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,501
We believed that,
without the inhibitor program,

70
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,033
<i>these abilities would show up</i>

71
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,534
<i>in virtually</i>
<i>every single one of the 4400.</i>

72
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,834
<i>I don't think i need to explain</i>
<i>to this committee</i>

73
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>why that would be</i>
<i>something less</i>

74
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,133
<i>than a best-case scenario.</i>

75
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,968
<i>Overnight, normal human beings</i>
<i>like you and i</i>

76
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,701
<i>and all the institutions</i>
<i>we've come to rely on</i>

77
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,534
<i>would be obsolete.</i>

78
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,767
<i>The program wasn't perfect.</i>

79
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:17,834
<i>People got sick.</i>

80
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:18,968
<i>Some died.</i>

81
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,234
<i>That was not our intent.</i>

82
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,267
<i>But now it's gone,</i>

83
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,167
<i>and the future</i>
<i>that we were trying to prevent</i>

84
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,701
<i>is here,</i>

85
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,067
<i>and we are not ready.</i>

86
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,033
<i>I believe it comes down</i>
<i>to a question of power.</i>

87
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,534
<i>Who is going to hold it?</i>

88
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,033
<i>Us...</i>

89
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,334
<i>or them?</i>

90
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,534
Because, believe me...

91
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,000
it's going to come down...

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,133
to us against them.

93
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,234
Shawn, you're not
making any sense.

94
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,434
Just tell me what's
wrong with isabelle.

95
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,901
I told you,
i can't explain.

96
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,534
Is she sick?
Is she hurt?

97
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,567
You'll see
for yourself.

98
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,434
Dad.

99
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,200
W-who the hell is this?

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,601
Where's isabelle?

101
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,801
I am your daughter.

102
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm isabelle.

103
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,100
L-i don't get it.

104
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,400
Something happened.
I... i changed.

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,734
I don't know how.

106
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,067
She just
walked in here.

107
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,200
She knew my name.

108
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
She seems to know
about you and lily.

109
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,234
I don't know

110
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:30,667
what game
you're playing here,

111
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:31,934
and i don't care.

112
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,534
Richard... richard.

113
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,601
Lily.

114
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,601
Lily!

115
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,501
Lily?

116
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,567
Is isabelle with you?

117
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,667
Lily...

118
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,133
lily.

119
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,767
Are you all right?

120
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,400
Oh, richard,
i must have fainted.

121
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,067
Is isabelle with you?

122
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,701
Who are you?

123
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,300
Where's my wife?

124
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,467
Richard, what are you
talking about?

125
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm lily, your wife.

126
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,934
Why are you
looking at me like...

127
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,701
oh, my god.

128
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,067
Ma'am, i don't know who you are.

129
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,767
Oh...

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,567
oh, my god.

131
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,634
No!

132
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:44,634
Your blood pressure
is elevated...

133
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:47,067
but i suppose
that's to be expected.

134
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,567
Heart, lungs, reflexes...

135
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,801
all within the normal range.

136
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,734
Doctor,
you call this normal?

137
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,567
Richard, i want
to see isabelle.

138
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,801
Where is my daughter?

139
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,234
She's right outside.

140
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,901
I'll bring her in
in a minute.

141
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,601
I realize
how alarming this must be,

142
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,033
but at least
you can take some solace

143
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,334
in the fact that your wife

144
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,234
is a perfectly healthy
older woman.

145
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,167
If i had to guess,
i'd say she's about 75.

146
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,734
I'm 29...

147
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,267
and i don't understand.

148
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:13,734
Please help me understand.

149
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,367
How could
this happen?

150
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,767
Maybe it's a reaction

151
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,067
to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor,

152
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,901
but truthfully,
i don't know.

153
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,434
There is a condition
called progeria.

154
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,467
It's associated
with rapid aging.

155
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,834
So this kind of thing

156
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,300
has happened before?

157
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,234
Mr. Tyler...

158
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,067
when your wife fainted
this morning,

159
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,667
she was a young woman.

160
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,667
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

161
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,234
she was 50 years older.

162
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,501
I can guarantee you...

163
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,367
this is a first.

164
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,200
Excuse me.

165
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:54,934
Are you okay, dr. Burkhoff?

166
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,934
Fine.
Not enough sleep, that's all.

167
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,501
Research.

168
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,133
Well, what do we do now?

169
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,567
Is there any way
to reverse this?

170
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,267
I wish i knew.

171
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,434
I need...

172
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:07,534
to do some thinking.

173
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,701
Are you my mother?

174
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,934
Isabelle?

175
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,801
Every day,
the 4400 are changing

176
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,133
and getting stronger.

177
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,968
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,

178
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,334
we're wringing our hands

179
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,667
and trying to determine
who knew what when.

180
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,534
I will save this committee
the trouble and expense

181
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,400
of a long investigation.

182
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,133
The inhibitor program
was my idea.

183
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,868
I was proud to lead it.

184
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:13,300
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,067
If there's blame
to be assigned,

186
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,534
it's mine.

187
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,934
Mine alone.

188
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,801
Yeah, i know kyle
doesn't want to see me.

189
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,167
Is there some way
we can force him to?

190
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,267
I'm his father.

191
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,200
I want to know
how he's doing.

192
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,501
Look, i realize you're trying,

193
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,501
but it'll be months
before he goes to trial.

194
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,033
I mean, you really think

195
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,467
people are going to let ryland
position himself

196
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,133
as some kind
of patriotic martyr?

197
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,234
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.

198
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,434
Well, he says
it was accidental.

199
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:40,834
A significant percentage
of this country

200
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:41,968
believes him.

201
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,234
Try "overwhelming."

202
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,501
You guys listened
to talk radio lately?

203
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,067
The calls
are like 90% in his favor.

204
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,467
You can buy a "free
dennis ryland" t-shirt

205
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,767
within a block of here.

206
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,033
Maybe they should put him up

207
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,067
for the nobel peace prize.

208
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,300
Just tell him
i need to see him.

209
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,567
We don't have to talk
about the case.

210
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,634
I just have to see my son.

211
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,534
Just ask him one more time,
okay?

212
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,634
And...
and tell him we love him.

213
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,767
Give him some time, thomas.

214
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,701
Kyle needs to live
with his choice for a while.

215
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,534
We're back.

216
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,167
Tom...

217
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,133
break's over.

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,634
Ladies and gentlemen,

219
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:38,434
i'd like to call the proceedings
to order.

220
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,367
Everyone just
take your seats.

221
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,801
We can get started.

222
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,834
Members of the press,
i was including you

223
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,300
in that "ladies
and gentlemen"

224
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,367
designation.

225
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,367
Thank you.

226
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,901
Mr. Ryland,

227
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,601
i'd like to pick up
the questioning

228
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,100
where we left off.

229
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,567
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead

230
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,133
for the promicin inhibitor
program.

231
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,267
Is that right, sir?

232
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,334
Yes, sir.

233
00:09:58,334 --> 00:09:59,634
It was my program all the way.

234
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,667
So this committee
is to understand

235
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,767
that your department
was able to plan and implement

236
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,234
an international
conspiracy

237
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,968
without some
cabinet-level approval?

238
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:10,968
That's correct.

239
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:12,300
I was given
a broad mandate

240
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,834
in my duties

241
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,300
as head of ntac.

242
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,801
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate,

243
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:20,000
so there was no need
to seek outside approval.

244
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,300
Excuse us, everybody.

245
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,534
Did you hear that?

246
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,267
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.

247
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,667
No, no, not that.
Something else.

248
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,267
Just set that
approval issue

249
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,033
to the side
for the moment.

250
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,534
Did you ever
discuss the project

251
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,267
with anyone outside of ntac?

252
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,267
I mean, someone
somewhere

253
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,734
must have taken an interest

254
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,133
in what you people
were doing over there.

255
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,701
[Whispering]

256
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a simple question,
mr. Ryland.

257
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:54,300
Surely it can't be
that difficult to answer.

258
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:03,734
If i could have your attention
up here, mr. Ryland...

259
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,167
[gasping]

260
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,100
Security!
Stop that man!

261
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:17,868
Get some protection
around ryland.

262
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,100
Stay here. I'll be right back.

263
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,901
We need
an ambulance!

264
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,133
Stand back, please!
Back! Get back!

265
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,601
Hey!

266
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,167
Stop! T.j.!

267
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,100
Someone get these photographers
out of here.

268
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,934
Stay over there.

269
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,934
I don't understand what i did.

270
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:07,534
Would somebody please
tell to me what i just did?

271
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,868
Hang on, dennis.

272
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,801
The ambulance
is coming.

273
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,667
Yeah, it was her.

274
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,801
The blood we picked up
at the scene

275
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,267
matches the dna
in our records.

276
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,200
That was t.j. Kim
running from the courthouse.

277
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,467
When she hit this place,

278
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,567
t.j. Drove
every man in the building

279
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,934
into a homicidal rage.

280
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,467
Now it sounds
like she just zapped one guy.

281
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,367
She's learning
to control what she can do.

282
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,701
They all are.

283
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:39,100
Ever since we took them
off the inhibitor,

284
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,467
they're either
developing abilities

285
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,834
or they're refining
the ones that they've got.

286
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,534
So they are getting
more dangerous.

287
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,167
I guess ryland
was right.

288
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,934
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.

289
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,300
Save the point-
counterpoint.

290
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,634
At the moment,

291
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:50,834
we've been tasked
with two jobs...

292
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:51,934
we track down t.j. Kim.

293
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,400
What's the second job?

294
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,934
We are to protect
ryland's co-conspirators

295
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,601
from any
further reprisals.

296
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,934
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?

297
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,133
The entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing

298
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,367
into her own personal
slasher film.

299
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,667
If t.j.
Gets to ryland again...

300
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,868
or any of them...

301
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,100
before we can
bring her in,

302
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,367
people are going to
start to wonder

303
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,601
if the united states government

304
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,300
is capable
of protecting its citizens,

305
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,834
and that's the beginning
of chaos.

306
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,934
Back to work, please.

307
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,567
Tom...

308
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,467
in case you're wondering,

309
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,601
dennis is still
in surgery.

310
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:36,133
They say that it is
touch and go.

311
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:04,834
[Shawn]: It's okay.

312
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:05,834
Give me your hands.

313
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:06,868
Try and relax.

314
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,267
Relax.

315
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,000
Is it better?

316
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,200
Much better.

317
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,567
For now.

318
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,367
When this thing first came on,

319
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,300
it was bad,
but at least she was healthy.

320
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,634
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema...

321
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,100
it seems like every day
there's something new.

322
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,801
I'll come help her every day.

323
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,000
Listen,

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
we've got everyone
working on this.

325
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,434
We're going to
figure it out.

326
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,400
Is my mother okay?

327
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,767
Uh, yeah.

328
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,567
She had a little problem.

329
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,300
Shawn fixed it.

330
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,968
It's all
in the wrists.

331
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,567
Can i see her?

332
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,834
Please?

333
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,167
Mom?

334
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,200
[Weakly]: Isabelle.

335
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,501
Come here.

336
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:31,801
Is there anything i can do?

337
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,534
No, i'm... i'm fine.

338
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,467
Really.

339
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,834
Sit down.

340
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,901
You were such a beautiful baby.

341
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,734
I used to hold you

342
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,367
all day long.

343
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,334
I knew exactly
what you were feeling.

344
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,934
What you wanted.

345
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,934
We were so close.

346
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,868
I'm sorry for
growing up so fast.

347
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,601
I didn't mean to.

348
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,667
I didn't want to.

349
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,000
Neither did i.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,234
The crazy thing is

351
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,501
i keep thinking
about patty.

352
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,801
Ryland's wife.

353
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,167
I feel like i should
call her or something,

354
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,334
help her through this.

355
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,501
Maybe you should.

356
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,667
You and ryland
were friends

357
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,801
for a long time.

358
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,834
It's okay to be conflicted.

359
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,133
Well, ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed.

360
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,167
Shawn, too.

361
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,033
The guy knew

362
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,200
that kyle was stalking
jordan collier

363
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
and he did nothing.

364
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I'd say that trumps friendship.

365
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,501
You have so much
on your mind.

366
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,701
Kyle, ryland, the 4400s...

367
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,801
i need to get you
away from here.

368
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:37,567
Away from your problems.

369
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah, well, that sounds nice,

370
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,701
but i can't go anywhere.

371
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,968
I'm starting an investigation

372
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,334
in the morning.

373
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,968
What if i told you

374
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,000
i could take you away

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,467
between now and then?

376
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,367
My ability.

377
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:55,767
Since i'm off the inhibitor...

378
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,834
i think i can control it now.

379
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,801
What, you mean you want to...

380
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,801
you want to take me
into another dream world?

381
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,100
Alternate reality...

382
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,234
i don't even know
what to call it.

383
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,501
Call it a vacation.

384
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,901
A week, a year...

385
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,200
as long as we want.

386
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,701
All that in the space
of a few moments.

387
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,801
Should we try it?

388
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,334
Right here?

389
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,868
Now?

390
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,100
Well, what...

391
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,667
what do we do?

392
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,267
We're already doing it.

393
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,000
There's no one
on the beach.

394
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,834
It's all ours, thomas.

395
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,434
So's the hotel.

396
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,834
And we can stay here
for as long as we like.

397
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,567
There is no jet lag.

398
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,367
That sounds perfect.

399
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,133
It feels perfect, too.

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,434
The door's open. Come in.

401
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,634
Whoa.

402
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,901
What? What is it?

403
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,167
Uh, you're naked.

404
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,501
I'm more comfortable
this way.

405
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,100
I haven't really
gotten used to them.

406
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
Clothes.

407
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,367
I have a bathrobe.

408
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:39,901
Is this better?

409
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,901
Almost.

410
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,133
I never met anybody

411
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,534
that read the encyclopedia
from cover to cover before.

412
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:06,667
Oh, i'm not finished.

413
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,400
We just delivered those to you
yesterday.

414
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,801
Okay, you're a fast reader.

415
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,200
That's really cool.

416
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,334
Um, listen,

417
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,501
they're looking for you
down in the labs.

418
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,534
You're like an hour late.

419
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,501
They sent you to get me?

420
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,033
Aren't you in charge?

421
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,567
Well, yeah,
more or less.

422
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,200
You know,
i go where i'm needed.

423
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,300
They were scared of me,
weren't they?

424
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,234
Pretty much.

425
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,400
That's all right.

426
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
I think even my parents
are frightened of me.

427
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,567
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.

428
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,834
I think they're just confused.

429
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:36,934
I don't blame them.

430
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,334
It's mostly how i feel, too.

431
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,734
I...

432
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,734
don't understand
what happened to me.

433
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,868
I don't understand what happened
to my mother.

434
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:47,400
And i'm trying to read
and learn things, but...

435
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,501
mostly, i just...

436
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:52,033
i still feel lost.

437
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:55,267
See, now you sound
like a real 4400.

438
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:58,501
But i'm not a 4400...

439
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:03,033
not like my mother
and father...

440
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,067
or you.

441
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,334
Looks like i'm going to live.

442
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:14,400
Sorry to disappoint you, tom.

443
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,267
Why'd you ask me to see me,
dennis?

444
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,300
I hear
that you and skouris

445
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,167
are in charge
of the investigation.

446
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,300
Yeah, we know who did it.

447
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,567
We'll find her.

448
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:29,067
T.j. Kim attacked thuildx weeks ago.

449
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,934
No one's
tracked her down yet.

450
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,634
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, dennis.

451
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,868
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?

452
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,667
Other 4400s

453
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,734
who feel the same way
about the government

454
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:43,701
she does?

455
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,133
When we catch her,
we'll ask.

456
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,567
Will you?

457
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:50,200
I want to make sure

458
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,968
you're going to
take this thing

459
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,901
as far as it goes, tom,

460
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:56,934
the same way you did
when you came after me...

461
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,534
and i want my people
protected.

462
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,701
They were acting
under my orders.

463
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:06,200
They're under guard.

464
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,734
So was the courthouse
when kim attacked.

465
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:14,234
I'd feel better
if you brought them in.

466
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,601
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.

467
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,801
There were no takers.

468
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:22,234
<i>I guess no one</i>
<i>wanted to cooperate</i>

469
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,534
<i>with the organization</i>

470
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,133
<i>that was working</i>
<i>to put you in prison.</i>

471
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,434
<i>We had to fight</i>

472
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,000
<i>just to get them</i>
<i>to let us post agents</i>

473
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
<i>outside their houses.</i>

474
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,267
Crockett!

475
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,734
You ready
to go for a walk, boy?

476
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,133
Come on, crockett.
Let's go.

477
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,734
They wanted no part of us.

478
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,000
They all seemed confident

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,767
that t.j. Kim
was acting alone.

480
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,501
Crockett?

481
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,868
What's wrong?
It's me.

482
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,803
[Jarvis]: This arrived
15 minutes ago.

483
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,870
[Distorted voice]:
<i>This is a message</i>

484
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,471
<i>from the nova group.</i>

485
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,937
<i>We are the defensive wing</i>
<i>of the 4400.</i>

486
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,371
<i>Today, the world has seen</i>

487
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:34,638
<i>what happens to those</i>
<i>who try to harm us.</i>

488
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:37,870
<i>A second demonstration</i>
<i>of our capabilities</i>

489
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,471
<i>is planned for october 19th.</i>

490
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,970
<i>A new era dawns.</i>

491
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,571
Defensive wing, huh?

492
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,437
What happens when they
decide to play offense?

493
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:45,870
I guess we find out
in five days.

494
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,237
They didn't even say
what they want.

495
00:22:47,237 --> 00:22:48,737
No demands,
no room for compromise.

496
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:50,037
We don't even know

497
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,204
how many 4400s
are in this nova group.

498
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,504
We couldn't even handle one

499
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:54,638
when she walked in
and attacked the place.

500
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:56,404
Now there's a whole team
of assassins out there,

501
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:58,104
all with abilities?

502
00:22:58,104 --> 00:22:59,404
They've got someone
who can kill you

503
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:00,604
by lowering your
body temperature.

504
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:01,737
Don't forget
the beastmaster.

505
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:02,870
What?

506
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,171
That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.

507
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:05,271
Well, i've been
all over the files,

508
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:07,137
and none of these abilities

509
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,504
have been registered
with us.

510
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:09,703
They're off
the inhibitor now.

511
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:10,604
We can't even pretend

512
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:11,670
to have
a comprehensive list

513
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,037
of what these people
can do.

514
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:14,404
Is anyone feeling...

515
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,803
a little overmatched here?

516
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,237
You two remember gary navarro?

517
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:29,471
Hey, gary.

518
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:31,237
Been a while.

519
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,970
You're right, baldwin.

520
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,703
I do think you two sold me out.

521
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:38,237
It really bothered me
for a while,

522
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:40,371
but now i understand it's just
standard operating procedure.

523
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:41,404
Well, i guess

524
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:42,204
that mind reading thing

525
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,304
is working
pretty well, huh?

526
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,137
Better than ever, actually.

527
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,571
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful

528
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,104
to the national security agency.

529
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,770
They have agreed
to let us borrow him

530
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,404
while we investigate
the nova group.

531
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:52,770
So you're clear
on what we're doing here?

532
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,604
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.

533
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,703
Do you have a problem
with that?

534
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:57,703
Not at all.

535
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,437
It won't be my first time.

536
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,803
So...

537
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:04,304
can we get started?

538
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:17,803
Never heard of the nova group.

539
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:19,337
Between ntac
and this place,

540
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,538
but i trust you realize
how serious this is.

541
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:24,371
Believe me, if i knew anything,
i would tell you.

542
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:25,171
Well, do you mind
if the three of us

543
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,171
walk around the place,

544
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:27,638
talk to some people?

545
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:28,837
You and your pet mind-reader?

546
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:30,171
No, i can't
let you do that.

547
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,404
These people haven't
done anything wrong,

548
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,137
and i won't let you
invade their privacy,

549
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,737
and i actually can't believe

550
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:36,471
that you brought
this guy here again.

551
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:39,004
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?

552
00:24:39,004 --> 00:24:41,271
Getting
a clear signal?

553
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,770
You see anything you like
up there?

554
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,137
As far as i can tell,
he's not hiding anything.

555
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,604
I have a lot of work to do.

556
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,337
If i hear anything,
i'll give you a call.

557
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:55,104
For now,
that's the best i can do.

558
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,604
Sorry about my nephew.

559
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,638
Why?

560
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,137
Well, he was kind of rude
back there.

561
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:12,404
I get that kind
of stuff a lot.

562
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:13,870
I don't take it personally.

563
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,904
Do you mind
if i ask you...

564
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,803
you've sort of implied

565
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:18,538
that you've pursued 4400s
in the past.

566
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:20,371
What exactly do you do
for the nsa?

567
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,638
Overseas stuff, mostly.

568
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,237
But, like, what?
Give me an example.

569
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:26,371
They fly me someplace.

570
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,070
I approach the subject,

571
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,171
find out what he's thinking,

572
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,070
and i tell the people
i work for,

573
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,104
who then fly me home,

574
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:33,404
where i live
comfortably.

575
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:35,337
What happens to the subject?

576
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,371
I don't ask.

577
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,037
That's good.

578
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:53,437
The neural pathway
comparisons

579
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,538
are particularly
illuminating.

580
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:55,404
Make sure
you understand them

581
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,404
before you move on.

582
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:57,437
Dr. Burkhoff,

583
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:59,571
i don't understand
any of this.

584
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,703
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.

585
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:03,803
Every time one of hers
turns off,

586
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:05,171
one of mine turns on.

587
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:06,737
Exactly...

588
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:08,070
and what's true for neurons

589
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,070
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways...

590
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,437
there is a...

591
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:16,304
one-to-one
correspondence

592
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,904
between the amount you lost

593
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,371
and the amount you gained.

594
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,237
So all this is just a way
of saying i'm doing this to her?

595
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:22,870
The correlation

596
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,904
is too precise
to be random.

597
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:27,237
Your rapid aging

598
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,770
has caused her rapid aging.

599
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,471
How do we stop it?
Put me back to the way i was.

600
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:33,770
I'm afraid i can't.

601
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,437
So, what do we do about it?

602
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:37,371
There is a possibility

603
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,037
that if the aging agent
were eliminated

604
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:41,171
that lily
might be restored

605
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:42,104
to her normal self.

606
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:43,037
The aging agent?

607
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,171
He means me.

608
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,471
I'm killing you.

609
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,304
The only way
for you to live

610
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:48,904
is for me to die,
isn't that right?

611
00:26:48,904 --> 00:26:50,070
Don't answer that,
dr. Burkhoff.

612
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,104
Thank you for your time.

613
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,137
We're done here.

614
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:56,271
Where are you going?

615
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:59,404
We're not discussing this.

616
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,070
Not now.

617
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,237
Not ever.

618
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,437
It's true, isn't it?

619
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,504
I think so.

620
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,304
But it's only a theory.

621
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:25,037
Guys, i went over this
six weeks ago

622
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:26,004
with the men in black.

623
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,037
Humor us.

624
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:29,037
I went on two dates
with t.j. Kim.

625
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,304
I cut it off.

626
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:31,538
Girl had a lot of baggage.

627
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:32,737
How long ago was that?

628
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:34,037
Uh, two months ago?

629
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,970
Look, if i'd known
there'd be government agents

630
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,703
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,

631
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:39,538
i would've taken notes,

632
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:42,571
hey, so listen...

633
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,371
all this stuff
about october 19th...

634
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,104
you guys think it's serious?

635
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:49,670
Like, should i be
getting out of town?

636
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,538
I don't think
that's the answer.

637
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,937
As far as we know,

638
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,538
you're as safe here
as anywhere else.

639
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,004
That kid was lying...

640
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,870
or at least he wasn't
telling you everything.

641
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,538
The whole time
you were talking to him,

642
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:04,237
he was thinking
about an address.

643
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,304
331 reynolds avenue.

644
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,037
Looks like it's clear.

645
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,937
Nobody's home.

646
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:25,604
Nobody's been for home
for a while, i'd say.

647
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,037
Look at this.

648
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:30,437
That's
the government report

649
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:31,571
on the return of the 4400.

650
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:33,538
I tried to
read this once.

651
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:35,271
Kind of dry.

652
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,904
Yeah.

653
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:39,538
Looks like someone

654
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:42,004
made it right through
to the end.

655
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,104
Wesley hauser.

656
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:51,737
Wesley hauser.

657
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:52,670
Wesley hauser.

658
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,837
Who the hell is wesley hauser?

659
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:56,970
[Jarvis]: Hauser was a marine.

660
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,803
Did two tours of duty
in vietnam.

661
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,571
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.

662
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,737
Disappeared in '75.

663
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:04,770
Once he got
out of quarantine,

664
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,004
he never checked
back in with us.

665
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:06,837
Guy's been living
off the grid

666
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:08,304
for almost two years.

667
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,037
Which means he never
went on the inhibitor,

668
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:12,538
so who knows
what he's capable of by now.

669
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:14,371
Hauser was disillusioned
with the government

670
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:15,471
before he disappeared,

671
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,638
and i wouldn't say
we've done much

672
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:17,970
to win him over
since he's been back.

673
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,104
When he was
in quarantine,

674
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,770
he was housed in barracks 3.

675
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,070
Same building as t.j. Kim.

676
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,770
An agitator.
An organizer.

677
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,070
A radical.

678
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,371
Sounds like we have
our second member

679
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:27,404
of the nova group.

680
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:29,937
[Telephone rings]

681
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,703
Baldwin.

682
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,538
You're kidding me.

683
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,638
All right. I know.
Put him through.

684
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:38,770
Says he's wesley hauser.

685
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,104
No way.

686
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:43,904
Yeah, hello.

687
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,604
<i>How'd you like my apartment?</i>

688
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:47,437
Well, to be honest,

689
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,538
it felt a little empty
without you there.

690
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,037
<i>I'm on a tight schedule.</i>
<i>Lot to do before next week.</i>

691
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,670
Sound like you have
interesting plans,

692
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,870
so why don't we get together
someplace,

693
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,004
talk them over?

694
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,371
<i>No more talking.</i>

695
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:58,670
<i>There's nothing to say.</i>

696
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,803
<i>Your time is ending.</i>

697
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:02,803
<i>Ours begins on october 19th.</i>

698
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,337
come on, let me go.

699
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:09,537
Why'd you run

700
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,704
when we asked you
about hauser, huh?

701
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:13,237
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.

702
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:14,404
We've got it on camera.

703
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:15,638
So?

704
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:16,870
The guy had
a lot of good war stories.

705
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,970
Doesn't make us best friends.

706
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,070
So why did you run?

707
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,937
Because when i see
ntac agents,

708
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:21,337
i run the other way.

709
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:23,371
You people
almost killed us all.

710
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,337
Can you blame me?

711
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:30,371
Turn around.
Turn around.

712
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,803
We done here?

713
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:37,104
Get out of here.

714
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,004
Call me sensitive,

715
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:43,537
but i felt like
saying to him,

716
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:44,970
"we exposed the inhibitor.

717
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,437
We saved your life."

718
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:52,937
You guys just
don't really get it,

719
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:54,070
do you?

720
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,604
It's not just
that guy.

721
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,738
Every 4400

722
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,104
we've talked to today,

723
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:59,104
they're scared of you,

724
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:00,271
or they
don't trust you,

725
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:01,404
or they hate you.

726
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,537
Look, i'm sorry,
but the days

727
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:03,571
when you could expect

728
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,037
friendly conversation
from these people,

729
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,304
they're gone.

730
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:09,037
You're the bad guys now.

731
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:11,104
Get used to it.

732
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,170
I'm just warning you,

733
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,638
motherhood's
no cakewalk.

734
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,304
Since when
are you an expert?

735
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:28,404
I'm only saying
she landed on twins.

736
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:30,070
Kind of a big
responsibility...

737
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,504
especially when
she's trying to get by

738
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:32,671
on a teacher's salary.

739
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,437
What are you
going to name them?

740
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:35,770
I don't really want
to play anymore.

741
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,504
Is that okay?

742
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,337
What's wrong, sweetheart?

743
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:41,571
Nothing, except...

744
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:43,404
i know marco's going to win,
i'm going to come second,

745
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:47,004
and you're going to end up alone
with no money.

746
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,037
Don't be jealous.

747
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,537
He's smarter than you,
but mom likes you better.

748
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:58,970
Uh...

749
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,970
So, uh, who's...
who's smarter than me?

750
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,437
Who knows?

751
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:09,304
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.

752
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,004
You know, in some ways,
she was better off

753
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,337
on the promicin
inhibitor.

754
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,970
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.

755
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,638
All she wants to do

756
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,471
is record what she sees
in those notebooks.

757
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:21,070
It's like some kind
of compulsion.

758
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:24,504
Well...

759
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:26,770
think about it
for a minute.

760
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,170
Every morning,

761
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,937
she wakes up and...

762
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,504
knows pretty much what's coming.

763
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:32,903
She's already lived
the whole day

764
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,104
once in her head,

765
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:35,170
and by the time

766
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,404
something
actually does happen,

767
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:37,571
it's like a rerun.

768
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,537
I hate watching reruns.

769
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,304
Yeah. Try living one.

770
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:44,504
Hey, what about kevin burkhoff?

771
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,037
Maybe he can
figure out a way

772
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,937
for maia to control her visions.

773
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:49,937
He is brilliant.

774
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,170
I don't say this
about many people,

775
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,671
but he is smarter than me.

776
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,837
I know you.

777
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:00,903
Well, of course you do.

778
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:02,104
It's diana skouris.

779
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:03,070
You work at ntac.

780
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,571
I'm not here on business.

781
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,970
I'm here
about my daughter maia.

782
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,271
The precog.

783
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,970
What about her?

784
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,204
She's still 10, right?

785
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:12,803
She's not 65 now, is she?

786
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:14,604
Interesting guess.

787
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,803
Kind of wide of the mark,
though.

788
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:19,371
Good.

789
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,803
Might as well come on in.

790
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:28,304
Thank you.

791
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:33,371
Oh, sorry
about the clutter.

792
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:34,870
I fired the maid last week.

793
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,004
She was always cleaning.

794
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:45,604
Excuse me.

795
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:49,970
So...

796
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,638
your daughter.

797
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,204
What's troubling her?

798
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:01,537
I'll let you do it.

799
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,471
I caused all this, right?

800
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,604
And getting rid of me

801
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,104
is the only way
to save my mother.

802
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,371
No...

803
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,337
that's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

804
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:09,870
Shh.

805
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,037
No, it wasn't.

806
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:12,537
I don't want her
to die either,

807
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:13,770
so i'll let you do it.

808
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,571
I'll...
i'll even shut my eyes.

809
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,671
Isabelle...

810
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,404
i would never hurt you.

811
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:23,037
Why?

812
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,604
I don't understand.

813
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,704
It's the only way to save her.

814
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:26,770
We don't know that,

815
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,837
and i won't make a choice

816
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:29,137
between the two of you.

817
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,170
"Won't" or "can't"?

818
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:46,271
Sorry.

819
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,237
I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.

820
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:49,604
Oh, that's okay.

821
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:51,337
It's not my desk.

822
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:54,937
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?

823
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:56,571
Assuming
this place is still standing

824
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,803
on october 20th,
yeah.

825
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:59,137
Maybe we should talk
to jarvis.

826
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,638
Get you a room
of your very own.

827
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:02,870
That's fine with me.

828
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:05,571
To tell you the truth,

829
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:07,271
i could use
a little bit of a buffer zone.

830
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,304
This problem you're having
with your daughter's...

831
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:14,070
precog ability?

832
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,437
I keep wanting
to give you my opinion,

833
00:36:17,437 --> 00:36:19,371
but i don't want to intrude.

834
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:21,070
So you are...

835
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,070
listening to my thoughts.

836
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,937
You and baldwin.

837
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,170
I can't help it.

838
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,137
I try to tune you guys out,

839
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:30,837
but every now and then,
something leaks through.

840
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:33,970
I'll try to keep that in mind.

841
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,404
You said you had an opinion
about maia.

842
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:40,671
What is it?

843
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:42,504
When i first...

844
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:45,404
developed this thing of mine,

845
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,271
i was a basket case.

846
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,437
You saw me.

847
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:50,638
I truly thought
i was going insane,

848
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:53,604
so i fought against it,

849
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:55,770
and that just
made it worse.

850
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,404
I had to give in to it,

851
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,337
let it
take control of me,

852
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:01,104
and then, slowly,

853
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:04,537
i learned
how to take control of it.

854
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,137
Listen, your kid
stops fighting,

855
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,471
and eventually,

856
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,903
it'll become
like seeing or hearing

857
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,537
or any other sense.

858
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,704
She won't even
think about it.

859
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:17,170
It's just a part
of who she is.

860
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,004
That's how it worked
for me, anyway.

861
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,337
Thank you.

862
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,704
Diana.

863
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:30,970
We just got a call
from the seattle police.

864
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,870
Someone down there
read our apb.

865
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,704
They know exactly
where hauser is.

866
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,304
You guys are lucky,
actually.

867
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:40,738
In another day or two,

868
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,504
we would have buried him
in potter's field.

869
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:44,104
Buried who?

870
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:45,471
Him.

871
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,037
I always read the apb memos

872
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,537
when they circulate
in the police department.

873
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:51,037
Kind of a hobby.

874
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:52,738
Gets boring in here.

875
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,471
Anyway, there was
a description

876
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:55,704
of a regimental tattoo

877
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:56,803
on the memo for hauser.

878
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:59,037
82nd airborne.
"Death from above."

879
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,537
I remember it from a john doe

880
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,204
they brought in here
three weeks ago.

881
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:04,738
This guy drowned
in the harbor.

882
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,604
A lot of veterans
have that tattoo.

883
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:08,070
Do a lot of veterans

884
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,937
look exactly like
the mug shot you circulated?

885
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:11,870
Don't believe me?

886
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,471
Take a look
for yourselves.

887
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,004
Say hello
to wesley hauser.

888
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,840
Hauser died

889
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,408
two and a half weeks
before ryland was attacked.

890
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:24,141
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.

891
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,341
And that copy
of the 4400 report

892
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,774
with all his notes over it?

893
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:29,007
For all we know,

894
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,707
that could have been a plant.

895
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,508
Somebody wanted us distracted.

896
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:34,274
They deliberately
put us on the trail

897
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:36,007
of some phantom member
of the nova group.

898
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,740
I mean, how did we first
find out about hauser?

899
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,840
T.j.'s old boyfriend.
He gave us the address.

900
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,573
No, he was thinking it.

901
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,907
At least,
according to gary, he was.

902
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,508
Gary navarro
put us onto wesley hauser.

903
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:10,840
Get in.

904
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:18,807
You lied to me, daniel.

905
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:21,907
You never said anything
about killing people.

906
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,673
We were protecting you, shawn.

907
00:39:23,673 --> 00:39:26,374
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.

908
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:27,640
[Woman groaning]

909
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:34,041
What is she doing here?

910
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,640
She's dying.
She needs your help.

911
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,774
I told you,
i don't want

912
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,707
anything more
to do with you.

913
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,540
The nova group
was supposed to protect us.

914
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,207
That's why i gave you money,
daniel.

915
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:43,640
That's why i gave you money.

916
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,074
Not to start
a terrorist organization!

917
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:47,107
We'll talk about your concerns
later.

918
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:48,408
She's got a stomach wound,

919
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:49,074
and it's infected.

920
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:50,307
She needs you right now,

921
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,907
or she's not
going to make it.

922
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,341
Shawn, she's a 4400.

923
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:56,107
If we don't
help each other,

924
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:58,141
what hope do we have?

925
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,207
Give me your hand.

926
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,874
What are you doing here?

927
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,041
You're awake.

928
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,840
Good.

929
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,174
It's important
that you know it was me.

930
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:48,474
I'm the guy who killed you.

931
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:02,807
[Monitor beeping]

932
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:13,207
[Man on radio]: <i>med post.</i>

934
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:16,508
Yeah, he just
walked by.

935
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:17,474
Why?

936
00:42:17,474 --> 00:42:18,474

937

Hey! Stop!

938
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,474
Go. I'll check on ryland.

939
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:24,907
He's seizing.

940
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,374
He's bradying down.

941
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:27,907
I need a crash cart
and ativan.

942
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:29,207
Find dr. Danoff.

943
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,640
Now!

944
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:40,241
Stay right there, gary.

945
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:47,241
Isabelle.

946
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,508
Isabelle!

947

Oh, god.

948
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:51,940
Somebody call an ambulance!

949
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:54,807
What's everybody
standing around for?

950
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:56,607
Somebody call an ambulance!

951
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,640
They're on
their way!

952
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:04,341
Somebody call an ambulance...

953
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:21,774
what am i?

954

[Daniel]:
<i>It's miraculous, shawn.</i>

955
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:29,307
I watch you
heal someone, and...

956
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:32,441
it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.

957
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,807
They hate us

958
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:35,707
because you're
killing them, daniel.

959
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:38,807
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.

960
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:40,540
You make it sound

961
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,441
like we acted out of
some sort of blood lust.

962
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:47,774
These were precise,
tactical strikes, shawn,

963
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:49,707
and you
and every other 4400

964
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,774
are ultimately much safer
because of them.

965
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:53,207
You killed people.

966
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:55,274
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

967
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:56,640
I gave you money

968
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,974
to start a defensive arm
for the center

969
00:43:57,974 --> 00:43:59,640
in case the government
ever came after us again.

970
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,774
It was a precaution.

971
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,408
And all we've done

972
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:03,774
is taken
precautionary measures.

973
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:04,874
Shawn, do you think
that because

974
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:06,174
their inhibitor program
was exposed

975
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:08,607
that the government's
just going to leave us in peace?

976
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,974
No, they know
we've gotten stronger,

977
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:12,607
which threatens
their hold on power,

978
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:14,307
which increases their need
to eliminate us.

979
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:17,007
So we strike first?

980
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:19,474
Is that it?

981
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,807
Is that what happens
on the 19th?

982
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,707
Look, shawn,

983
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:26,640
you do great work
at that center of yours.

984
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,974
You just focus on that.

985
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:30,107
I don't want to distract you.

986
00:44:30,107 --> 00:44:31,474
Knowledge can be a burden.

987
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,573
And thanks
for helping t.j. Out.

988
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,141
You're a hero
to your own people.

989
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:41,840
Never forget that.

990
00:44:44,508 --> 00:44:45,840
Yeah.

991
00:44:49,207 --> 00:44:50,408
It did not work,
you know.

992
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:51,707
Ryland was o.d.'ing,

993
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:53,607
but the doctors
pulled him out of it.

994
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,540
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.

995
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,573
Well, i'm sure
you're as disappointed as i am.

996
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:00,807
Don't worry.

997
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:01,807
We'll get him.

998
00:45:01,807 --> 00:45:03,940
Let's talk about
wesley hauser.

999
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,640
You first met him
in quarantine.

1000
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,907
I liked wes.

1001
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:10,074
He was 10 kinds of crazy,

1002
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,774
but his heart was
in the right place.

1003
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:13,274
I guess he was bipolar
or something,

1004
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:14,874
but he never
took medication.

1005
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,041
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.

1006
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,573
I used to visit him
down at the docks.

1007
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,607
You know, give him food,
a little money.

1008
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:22,974
So when did you decide
to kill him?

1009
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:26,274
Wes, he didn't need my help
with that.

1010
00:45:26,274 --> 00:45:29,408
He drank about
three bottles of mad dog a day.

1011
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:34,940
One morning about a month ago,
i went down to see him, and...

1012
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,508
i found him by the dumpster.

1013
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:38,640
Dead.

1014
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,141
And somewhere

1015
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:41,508
in the middle
of your grieving process,

1016
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:42,540
you figured he'd make
a handy decoy.

1017
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,441
Hauser wouldn't
have minded.

1018
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:47,374
Going back
to his marine corps days.

1019
00:45:47,374 --> 00:45:48,774
So when i found him,

1020
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:51,673
i said a word or two
over his body,

1021
00:45:51,673 --> 00:45:54,974
and i pushed him
into elliott bay.

1022
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:56,740
So how long have you been
working with this nova group?

1023
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,207
Did someone approach you,

1024
00:45:58,207 --> 00:45:59,508
or was the whole thing
your idea?

1025
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:01,740
Tell me...

1026
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,174
you and this girlfriend
of yours...

1027
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:06,174
is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to?

1028
00:46:06,174 --> 00:46:08,074
Or is she actually
taking you into these...

1029
00:46:08,074 --> 00:46:09,807
i don't know.
What do you call it?

1030
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:11,508
Fantasy worlds?

1031
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,907
Oh, and this guy marco...

1032
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:17,241
does he know

1033
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,508
that you're too...

1034
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:20,874
embarrassed
to tell your partner

1035
00:46:20,874 --> 00:46:23,740
that you two have been dating?

1036
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,673
Done showing off?

1037
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:27,074
Why don't you tell us

1038
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:29,408
what's going to happen
on october 19th?

1039
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:32,508
I guess you're going to have to
find yourself another telepath.

1040
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:41,508
Good luck with that.

1041
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,607
So you got nothing out of him?

1042
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:44,007
Well, he told us
about hauser,

1043
00:46:44,007 --> 00:46:45,074
but as far as
the nova goes,

1044
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:46,274
it's going to take time
to break him down.

1045
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:47,474
How much time?

1046
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,573
He's a telepath.

1047
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:49,508
He knows what
we're thinking.

1048
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:50,341
A little longer
than usual.

1049
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,607
Okay, so it's not easy,

1050
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:52,907
but gary navarro

1051
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:54,640
has a level-seven
security clearance.

1052
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,740
We have to assume
that he's been using it

1053
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,874
to funnel
national secrets

1054
00:46:56,874 --> 00:46:57,940
to the nova group.

1055
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,274
We need to know what he knows.

1056
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,441
Now.

1057
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:01,640
He'll talk.

1058
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,774
Gary's been
inside our heads

1059
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:04,174
for a year.

1060
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:05,774
I think i know how to
get inside of his.

1061
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:11,807
Careful with this.

1062
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:13,441
Matthew.

1063
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,341
I didn't expect
to see you back

1064
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:17,640
for a couple of weeks.

1065
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,441
The nova group revised
my calendar for me.

1066
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,840
Wiped it clean, actually.

1067
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,774
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400

1068
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:25,774
when some of them

1069
00:47:25,774 --> 00:47:27,441
are boasting
about their body count.

1070
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:28,673
I suppose.

1071
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:29,707
How's lily?

1072
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:31,174
Any improvement
since i left?

1073
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:32,840
If anything,
she's getting worse.

1074
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,374
Sorry to hear that.

1075
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:36,141
Isabelle?

1076
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:37,241
She tried
to kill herself

1077
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,640
this morning.

1078
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:41,740
She jumped off the roof.

1079
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,074
A few minutes later,

1080
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:44,840
she was walking around
like nothing happened.

1081
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,241
I got to tell you,
matthew...

1082
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,241
