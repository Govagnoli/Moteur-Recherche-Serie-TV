1
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:43,311
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:45,193
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.

3
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,881
Roy Marsden didn't kill
Jordan Collier.

4
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:47,937
And neither did you, Kyle.

5
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:49,309
Son of a bitch !

6
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,716
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.

7
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,474
If Maia's having visions, you should know about it,
and you should know what they are.

8
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:58,456
mommy's bosses will be
punished for betraying us.

9
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,948
I want to go home.

10
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:03,506
I know you do, honey, but Dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you.

11
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,490
Don't tell anyone i can't heal.

12
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,512
Sure.

13
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,613
What are you going to do ?

14
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:08,916
What i have to.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,578
If you're sick, the responsible
thing is to report to ntac,

16
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,936
but if you are well...
walking into quarantine is an easy step,

17
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:19,355
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.

18
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,345
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood of every 4400.

19
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,330
They even gave it a name.
They call it...

20
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,607
"promicin inhibitor."

21
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:31,066
Every time they came to ntac
medical, every checkup.

22
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:34,657
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding what happened to the 4400.

23
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,254
We're her parents. We decide.

24
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,874
Are you sure you want to do this ?

25
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,934
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.

26
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,693
But if it comes down to a choice

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,077
between the safety of the american people
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom...

28
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:49,258
that's no choice at all.

29
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:52,734
We tried being reasonable.
In 10 hours, we start rounding them up.

30
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,578
Easy, McCullough.

31
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,114
Let me go ! I'm not sick !
There's nothing wrong with me !

32
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:23,164
We know that, but you're a 4400,
and everybody's got to go in.

33
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:23,923
Come on...

34
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,536
now, i don't want to cuff you,

35
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:28,119
but if you run again,
you're going to give me no choice.

36
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:31,654
"Quarantine" is just a word to you guys.

37
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,817
Try living it.

38
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:35,423
Come on.

39
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,771
What are we doing here, Diana ?
This is so wrong.

40
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,097
All right, what do you suggest ?
We walk into the middle of ntac,

41
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:45,167
and shout out, "we did this.
We made them sick."

42
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:48,765
Yeah, yeah, that's good start. We've got the
medical records. We can take them to Dennis.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,331
You really think that Max Hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors

44
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,838
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400 ? I mean,

45
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,341
you really think that they could
do that without approval ?

46
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,248
Whose approval ?

47
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,921
Dennis Ryland's, for one. He was the head of
this division when this whole thing started.

48
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,565
I mean, you think he didn't know ?

49
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,511
Until we know how far up this goes,
we've got to stay calm,

50
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,732
work quietly...

51
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,259
and watch our backs.

52
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:21,308
Don't tell me to calm down, Lily.

53
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:24,020
How am i supposed to be calm when my wife
and daughter left in the middle of the night ?

54
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,857
We didn't leave you, Richard.

55
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:28,111
I just didn't feel like
Isabelle was safe there.

56
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,176
You've turned this resisting quarantine
into your personal mission.

57
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,263
Ntac turned it into my personal mission
when they started rounding us up.

58
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,504
And i admire what you're doing,
but it's not my fight,

59
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,437
and i sure as hell won't let it
become Isabelle's fight.

60
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:44,042
Just tell me where you are.
Put my mind at ease. I'll come see you.

61
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:45,721
Lily ?

62
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,804
I'm sorry. I just feel like
it's better this way for now.

63
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:51,789
I'll call soon.

64
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,880
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.

65
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:23,562
- 911. please state the nature of...
- No...

66
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,650
i need an ambulance.
I'm... i'm sick.

67
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:28,070
I've got this...

68
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:29,668
Hello ?

69
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,113
Hello ?

70
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:33,050
Miss, are you there ?

71
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,823
Never mind.

72
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,719
Think they're sharing trade secrets ?

73
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:53,065
Either that, or she's asking
for her office back.

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,234
- After you.
- Thanks.

75
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:02,867
Nina.

76
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:04,504
Good to see you.

77
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,088
Thanks. I wish the circumstances
were a little better.

78
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,152
We lost the first 4400s
to this thing overnight.

79
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,350
Seven dead.

80
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,054
There'll be more by day's end.

81
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,597
No word about a vaccine, a cure ?

82
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,108
I just got off the phone with Hudson. He said
that they've worked on a few things overnight.

83
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,389
I'm going to quarantine.

84
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,234
Diana...

85
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,134
i know this is frustrating,

86
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,960
but we've got the best minds in the country,
in the world, working on this.

87
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,754
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.

88
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,586
Alana could be next,
or Maia,

89
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,655
and still, nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they ?

90
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:36,369
We'll get it figured out.

91
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,905
Hey, sweetie.

92
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,948
It's me, Tom.

93
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,860
Who are you ?

94
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:01,927
Who are you ?

95
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,761
She was awake earlier.

96
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,485
Only for a few minutes, though.

97
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,117
Did she say anything ?

98
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,514
She talked about you.

99
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,833
Said you were going to
make everything okay.

100
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,191
I hope she's right.

101
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,634
Me too.

102
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,781
Let's go.

103
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:38,541
Where are we headed ?

104
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,924
We've got an appointment
with the good doctor Hudson.

105
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,261
Diana, what...

106
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,727
what the hell are you doing ?

107
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,840
We've got some things
we need to talk about, Max.

108
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,766
We may have what
they have too soon.

109
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:58,372
This guy your agents
brought in, rOrson Bailey,

110
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:00,721
i think i can explain
how he developed this...

111
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,957
jesus, i can't even say the word.

112
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,366
Telekinesis.

113
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,082
Thank you.

114
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:10,354
The body produces four main neurotransmitters.
They're like traffic cops to the brain.

115
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,571
They control everything,
regulate everything.

116
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,273
Tell me something i don't know.

117
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,291
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.

118
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,545
We've never seen it before.
Nobody has.

119
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,373
I'm guessing it factors into Bailey's ability
to bend spoons with his mind.

120
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:28,341
Let's just say promicin is basically a backstage
pass to the v. i. p. Section of the brain.

121
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,842
He is using parts of the cerebellum

122
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,885
no human has ever had access to.

123
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:36,220
I ran some tests on the 4400s
who are still in quarantine.

124
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:39,484
Every single one of them
is producing trace amounts of promicin.

125
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:44,145
So it's just a matter of time
before every 4400 develops telekinesis ?

126
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,728
Promicin's behavior is unpredictable.

127
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,594
They might not get telekinesis,

128
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,792
but they'll get something.

129
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,115
Put everything on paper.

130
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,903
I want to get my talking points straight
before i try to explain this to D. C.

131
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,406
D. C. Panicked.

132
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:04,173
I was ordered to work on a drug to suppress
the production of promicin in the 4400.

133
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,993
Once i synthesized the inhibitor,

134
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:09,454
we gave it to every 4400,
every time they came in for a checkup.

135
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:12,754
But it doesn't even work.
4400s are developing abilities all the time.

136
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,797
A small percentage of them are,

137
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,644
but if it wasn't for the inhibitor,
they'd all have them.

138
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,239
I know it didn't work perfectly.

139
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:20,201
"Perfectly ?"

140
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,613
Seven 4400s died last night.

141
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,149
It was your inhibitor that did it.
You made them sick !

142
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:28,306
You think i don't know that ?
We weren't trying to kill anyone.

143
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,230
We were preserving the status quo,
doing a good thing.

144
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:32,662
I guess it backfired.

145
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,741
I am trying to undo it,

146
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:38,109
but if you want to pull that trigger,
please, be my guest.

147
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,927
Maybe then finally
i'll get some sleep.

148
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,294
All right.

149
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,607
If you're not going to shoot me,

150
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,509
let me get back to work.

151
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,315
I don't want anyone else to die.

152
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,576
Alison ?
What are you doing here ?

153
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,243
They're going to give Roy life.

154
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,474
They're going to give him life,
and he's going to take it.

155
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,059
What are you talking about ?

156
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:13,393
The state was going to go for
the death penalty, and the

157
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,941
public defender convinced Roy
to take a plea bargain.

158
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,985
But they've got no case against him.
My dad told me.

159
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:21,587
I don't know. This lawyer,
he's handling, like, 10 different cases,

160
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,877
and he just doesn't want to see
the inside of a courtroom. I don't know.

161
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,595
But he didn't do it, okay ?
He didn't kill Jordan Collier.

162
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:31,010
You keep saying that. Does your
dad know something ? What ?

163
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,323
Is there evidence
that they're hiding ?

164
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,366
What ? You have to tell me.

165
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,407
If Roy takes this deal,
he can't even get parole for 20 years.

166
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,882
He's not going to prison.

167
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:49,267
Why ?

168
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:52,623
The 4400 came back august 14th.

169
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,877
Hudson discovered
promicin october 11th.

170
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:58,235
So they probably gave the first doses of the inhibitor
sometime around the end of the month.

171
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:02,471
But we have every internal document for october.
There's nothing about any of this.

172
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,491
There's hardly even
a mention of Orson Bailey.

173
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,121
We both wrote reports about him,
Diana. They're gone.

174
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:12,375
They were hoping that was going to be the only
extrahuman ability ever developed in a 4400.

175
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,348
If they destRoy all records of it...

176
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,745
nobody would ever know.

177
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,857
But this went to the top of the food chain.
Here. Britain, France, Korea...

178
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,889
everywhere there's a sick 4400.
There has to be a paper trail.

179
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:22,945
Does it even matter ?

180
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:26,071
we could find a memo signed by the entire
united nations security council.

181
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,966
It's not going to cure anyone.

182
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:31,348
Diana, we delivered confidential
medical records to Dr. Burkhoff.

183
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,702
We've got the so-called

184
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,543
"father of 4400 technology"
working on the case,

185
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,667
and you just stuck a gun
to the head of ntac's medical director.

186
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:42,025
We've done everything we can
to get the right people working on a cure.

187
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:44,078
That's if ntac even wants a cure.

188
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:47,424
Ryland's been talking about people in D. C.
who've been on a wartime footing for months.

189
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,902
This is nothing but
a stroke of luck for them.

190
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,640
You think they want them all dead ?

191
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,827
I told you !
I told you i wasn't safe here.

192
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,705
It's just a precaution, Kevin.

193
00:11:57,741 --> 00:12:00,711
We think you'll just be safer
if you move to a less exposed location.

194
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,218
It's because i told you
about that inhibitor thing, right ?

195
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:10,244
I spent six years in a psychiatric hospital
suffering from paranoid personality disorder.

196
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,054
As soon as i get out, you two put me smack
in the middle of a massive conspiracy.

197
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,969
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning all kinds of stories
about ntac. Very interesting stuff.

198
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,693
Well, he can spin all the theories
he wants, just not here.

199
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,710
I'll make sure he has
a safe place to work.

200
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:26,105
I figured out what promicin is.

201
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,670
That's the name they gave the neurotransmitter, right ?
The one that gives the 4400 their abilities ?

202
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:38,117
And if i can find one 4400 that
hasn't been exposed to the inhibitor,

203
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,946
i think i can neutralize it.

204
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,646
Hey.

205
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:55,381
You scared me.

206
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,518
Why didn't you use your key ?

207
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,984
Oh, sorry. My hands were full.

208
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,496
I brought you guys some supplies.

209
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,362
You still like chocolate cherry ?

210
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,077
That sounds great. Thank you.

211
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,458
Oh...

212
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,214
you...

213
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,186
you okay ?

214
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,842
Yeah, just jumpy.

215
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:18,873
It's so quiet out here.

216
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,451
Yeah, a lot of places have
closed up for the season.

217
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:26,854
Oh, i thought that, uh...

218
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,602
maybe i could stay for
a little dinner or something.

219
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,187
You don't have to get back home ?

220
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:33,427
No, not really.
Carol's gone.

221
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,950
She found out
that you and i were talking.

222
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:39,509
Don't worry, she doesn't know
you're here, but she got mad.

223
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:41,259
Brian, i'm sorry.

224
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,447
She'll stay away for a few nights.

225
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll stay on the couch for a while...

226
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:47,885
but in the meantime,

227
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:50,515
Heidi's staying with a friend,
and i figured, why eat alone ?

228
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,490
Sure,

229
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:55,280
but i hope you're not expecting much.
I haven't made pot roast in a while.

230
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,587
You know, Lily, the truth is...

231
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,846
i never should have married
Carol in the first place.

232
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,208
What are you doing, Brian ?

233
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,968
Come on. I'm alone.
You're alone.

234
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,928
You and Richard aren't happy.

235
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,346
That's not true.

236
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:12,978
We could have it back, Lily.

237
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:16,125
- Don't, Brian.
- Why are you fighting it ?

238
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,978
Brian, stop it ! Let me go !

239
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,796
- I don't want to hurt you, Lily !
- Stop it !

240
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:25,293
You little bitch.

241
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,517
Hello ?

242
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:46,738
Lily ?

243
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:48,112
Are you okay ?

244
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:49,133
Brian ?

245
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:53,326
Yeah, i was going to
bring by some food.

246
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,402
Don't.

247
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,478
Something's not right here.

248
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,835
I haven't heard from the safe
house in wheeling for a day.

249
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,643
We have to assume it's been compromised.

250
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,619
That's the third one that's gone silent.

251
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,881
They're picking us off one by one.
We might want to think about fighting back.

252
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,583
We can do that, Richard.

253
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,296
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,

254
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,761
but once we take that step,
there's no turning back.

255
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:25,836
Excuse me, but shouldn't there
be bars on these windows ?

256
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,949
The point is to be
unobtrusive, Dr. Burkhoff.

257
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:28,677
Well,

258
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,120
this seems a little lax to me.

259
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,563
Most of you are 4400s.
I'm a collaborator.

260
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,280
You know what they do
to collaborators ?

261
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,133
We need to get him working.
It calms him down considerably.

262
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,851
We cleared out a room for you.
Anything you need, just let us know.

263
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:46,427
What i need is a clean 4400, one that
hasn't been exposed to the inhibitor.

264
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:48,364
I don't guess you've got
one of those, do you ?

265
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,830
Actually, i might.

266
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:18,705
20 years, i've never seen you
pour a drink on government property.

267
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,204
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.

268
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,262
Conscience bothering you, Dennis ?

269
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,256
Hell, yes...

270
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,994
it is...

271
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,563
and given the circumstances,
i'd say that's a good sign,

272
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,861
but i'm trying to focus
on my job, Tom...

273
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:38,643
and i need the same from you.

274
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,332
But sometimes when you...

275
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,941
you look for one thing, you...

276
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,747
you learn something else.
You know how it is, Dennis.

277
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,649
I know exactly what you mean.

278
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,520
I've learned some things myself.

279
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:57,817
Open it.

280
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,314
Knowledge is a burden, huh, Tom ?

281
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:18,422
Did you think that i would release Kyle from
quarantine and not keep an eye on him ?

282
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,201
Why didn't you stop this ?

283
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,888
Because i didn't know
exactly what Kyle was going to do.

284
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:28,305
I just sort of let the future play out.
Isn't that what you're always talking about ?

285
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:29,688
You set up Roy Marsden.

286
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,708
That was my gift to you, Tom.

287
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:34,091
Would you rather
i just turn these over to my bosses ?

288
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,146
I would rather you be the friend...

289
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:40,282
you be the Ryland i worked
with for 20 years.

290
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,161
I haven't changed.

291
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:44,016
I have a tough job,

292
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:46,376
and i'm doing my best,

293
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:48,525
and as your boss,

294
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:50,084
and as your friend,

295
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,057
i expect support.

296
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,626
Kyle hated quarantine.

297
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,826
I wonder what he thinks of prison.

298
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,276
They know.

299
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,167
Ntac knows you shot Collier.

300
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,259
What ? How ?

301
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,925
They've known all along.
They let it happen.

302
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,792
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.

303
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,835
I'm going to call Alana's friends.

304
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,068
You're sending me to Spain ?

305
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,944
If they come after you, i need you
to be ready to leave right away.

306
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,676
Did you hear Roy Marsden's
being sent to jail for life ?

307
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:40,862
They set him up.

308
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:41,883
But if i run...

309
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,596
just one thing at a time, Kyle.

310
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:46,215
Let me worry about you,
then i will deal with Marsden.

311
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,694
So you want me to start packing ?

312
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,761
Yeah, Kyle !
Aren't you hearing me ?

313
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:01,868
<i>I confess to the murder of Jordan Collier</i>

314
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,685
He committed suicide ?

315
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:06,031
I know that Max was
under a lot of strain, but...

316
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,037
he had all those people's
lives in his hands. Maia's...

317
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,000
i know,

318
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:13,170
but Dr. Pinero's been Hudson's number
two from the very beginning.

319
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,976
He knows everything that Hudson knew.

320
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,725
We're still going to beat this thing.

321
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,557
- Good morning, Tom.
- Nina.

322
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:21,316
Here.

323
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,978
I grabbed this out of your mail cubby.

324
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,606
Did you hear about Hudson ?

325
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,021
Yeah. You okay ?
They're calling it a suicide.

326
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,322
What are you calling it ?

327
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,277
Tom, look at this.
It's from Max.

328
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,827
"Firewall memo."

329
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,342
What is that ?

330
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:38,878
I don't know.

331
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,766
Why are you doing this, Isabelle ?

332
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,563
Mommy needs to know.

333
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,344
I brought you here so we could be safe.
Don't you want that ?

334
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:49,162
Lily, what's going on out here ?
You okay ?

335
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,910
No. Go away !
I told you not to come here !

336
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,286
That's why i'm here.

337
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:54,860
Lily, please, let me in.

338
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,233
How do i know you're real ?

339
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:57,924
What are you talking about ?
Of course i'm real.

340
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,063
Did carol leave you ?

341
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,449
Why would she leave me ?

342
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,160
Lily, i'm coming in, okay ?

343
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:03,898
No. No !
No !

344
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,585
Lily... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

345
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:08,325
Lily...

346
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:10,004
put down the knife. Please.

347
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:12,540
I just came to check on you guys,
make sure you were okay.

348
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,275
Look, it's me.

349
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:16,379
Brian.

350
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,023
Put the knife down.

351
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,531
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want ?

352
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,526
No !

353
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,151
Stop it, Isabelle !

354
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,581
No !

355
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,209
Lily, i heard screaming.
What is going on ?

356
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:45,204
Brian... if you're real,
you've got to get me out.

357
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:47,528
Isabelle doesn't want to be here.

358
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,679
Firewall... it's a program, a safety net.
That's how you keep viruses off your hard drive.

359
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:58,199
Okay, did you ever see a memo with the
word "firewall" written in the subject line ?

360
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:03,238
No, but i don't read most of the memos
that circulate around here anyway.

361
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:06,995
Look, how long are you guys going to be working
in here ? What, are they painting your offices ?

362
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,439
We need a little privacy, okay ?

363
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,171
Tom, this memo, whatever it is, i doubt it
ever went out on a general distribution,

364
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,555
and every copy probably went
through the shredder months ago.

365
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,398
So if there's no hard copy, and if
Marco is the only one we even trust

366
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,508
to even talk about it with,
then we're at a dead end.

367
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,046
We could always march into Ryland's
office and ask him about it.

368
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,468
The guy does know memos.

369
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,383
When he was working here, i must have
thrown away, like, 15 every day.

370
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:29,377
More like 20. He liked to keep
his keyboard burning.

371
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,621
Who, Ryland ?

372
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,373
Yeah.

373
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,825
He didn't type. He used to call me in
sometimes when he froze up his computer.

374
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,480
Hunt-and-peck city.

375
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,723
Took him 10 minutes to type
in an email address.

376
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:42,186
Ryland dictated everything to his secretary.
She had "l" level security clearance.

377
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:45,321
Look.

378
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,928
"D. R. / J. O."

379
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,473
Everything says "d. R. / J. O."
"D. R.," Dennis Ryland.

380
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,348
And "J. O." is Jane Orman.
She worked for him for 22 years.

381
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:54,686
Did she stay in Seattle ?

382
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,404
Say hi for me.

383
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:10,541
Lily.

384
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:12,631
You came back.

385
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,414
Are you all right ?

386
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,267
I thought i was doing
the smart thing,

387
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,147
but Isabelle...

388
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:27,660
what happened ?

389
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:31,488
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place... i don't know.

390
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:34,451
Hey.

391
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,705
Did you miss daddy ?

392
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:38,971
Yeah ?
Well, he missed you.

393
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:40,709
Both of you.

394
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,547
Listen, i'm, uh...
i'm going to take off.

395
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:45,521
Brian...

396
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:48,832
thank you... for everything.

397
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,594
Hey, uh...

398
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:53,249
do me a favor...

399
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:58,932
forget this address,
forget about all of us,

400
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:01,891
and i'll forget you drove off with
my wife in the middle of the night.

401
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,095
Good luck, Lil.

402
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:13,923
Hey, i've been calling you all day.
There's a guy here who thinks that Isabelle...

403
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,330
excuse me. Didn't anyone
hear that car pull up...

404
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,454
is that her ?

405
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,373
I think there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

406
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:29,821
This is Isabelle.

407
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,950
What are we supposed to say ?
You know that

408
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:42,402
massive conspiracy to suppress
the abilities of the 4400 ?

409
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:45,631
We were just kind of hoping
you would fill us in on the particulars.

410
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:49,400
Yeah, and don't be nervous, but we had to shake
a government tail on the way here to do it.

411
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:51,161
Yeah, sounds like a start.

412
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:51,949
Hmm...

413
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,403
Tom Baldwin.

414
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,836
Long time, Jane.

415
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:57,808
Do you remember my
partner, Diana Skouris ?

416
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,170
- Of course.
- Yeah. Hi.

417
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,943
I always wondered
who would show up.

418
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,096
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.

419
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,679
You're here about firewall, right ?

420
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:09,848
Come on in.

421
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,979
The inhibitor hasn't been tested.
It is not ready.

422
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:22,429
One of the 4400 is a serial killer
who was using, i don't know,

423
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:26,901
some kind of mind control to get people
to commit murder. The inhibitor's ready.

424
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,357
This is wrong, Dennis.

425
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:32,342
We are beyond right and wrong here !
There's no precedent for this.

426
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,457
Now, D. C.'s been advised
of the operation.

427
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:40,130
It's been approved at the highest level.
There is nothing further to discuss, is there ?

428
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,703
I am not doing this.

429
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,592
I took it home with me that night.

430
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,893
The next day, i put in my notice.

431
00:24:57,928 --> 00:24:59,648
I mean, you have to understand,
for two decades,

432
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:02,733
i thought that Dennis Ryland
was the finest man i ever met,

433
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:05,314
and after i read this, i couldn't
work for him anymore.

434
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,540
I kept telling myself i should send it
somewhere... the newspapers, or...

435
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,020
i don't know...

436
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:14,272
but the names that signed off on this...
i was just a secretary.

437
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,202
What could i do against those names ?

438
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:19,467
It's all here.

439
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,134
Did you see the names ?

440
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:23,236
When Maia said, "mommy's bosses
are going to be punished,"

441
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:25,449
i had no idea she meant
all the way up the chain of command.

442
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,580
We can't go public yet.

443
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:27,120
What ?

444
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:28,271
We can't go public yet.

445
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,911
Listen, the faster this gets exposed, the better
it is for Maia, Alana, Shawn... all of them.

446
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:35,328
No more secrets. No more relying on
the people who did this to find a cure.

447
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,018
At the very least, they're going to have
to rescind the quarantine order.

448
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,979
Diana, Ryland's got
something on me.

449
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:41,588
Ryland ?

450
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,686
This entire memo is over his signature.
What could he possibly have over you ?

451
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:48,760
He knows Kyle killed
Jordan Collier.

452
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:49,699
What ?

453
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:54,043
That night on highland beach, they put someone
inside of him, or some program... i don't know...

454
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,601
directing his actions,
and Ryland has evidence.

455
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:03,094
I'm sorry, Tom,
but i can't just sit on this !

456
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,726
Maia's getting sicker !

457
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,605
Just give me one hour, Diana.
Just one hour.

458
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,120
Please.

459
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:17,258
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, Kyle.

460
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,160
If i go through with this,
they're going to come after you,

461
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:21,473
and it doesn't matter
if you're in Spain or Siberia.

462
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:24,199
I know, but with all those lives
at stake, you have to do it.

463
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,736
Okay, i'm taking you to the airport.

464
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:27,546
Dad...

465
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:29,988
i'm not going anywhere.

466
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:36,412
This actually makes it easier.
I didn't know how i was going to tell you.

467
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:38,079
Tell me what ?

468
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,850
I can't live like this anymore.

469
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:43,831
I can't live knowing
that guy is in jail.

470
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:49,139
I go through every day trying to pretend
it's all normal, but it's just a cover-up.

471
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,502
I can't let you do it, Kyle.

472
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,451
Marsden shot at me.
He, uh... he shot at other cops too.

473
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:01,071
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.

474
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:04,347
You try to bury stuff like
this, it changes you.

475
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,989
Look what it did to your boss.

476
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,969
Ryland used to be your friend.

477
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:12,926
It's over, dad. No more lies.
I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it.

478
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:15,169
Okay ? You can't stop me.

479
00:27:16,073 --> 00:27:16,883
Okay ?

480
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:22,070
Don't you do anything
until i get back.

481
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,172
You hear me ?

482
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,796
This is the right thing,

483
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,393
the heroic thing,

484
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,869
and being a hero comes
with some perks.

485
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:41,352
You tell me what i need to know,

486
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:45,544
i'll see that you're transferred to
a private quarantine facility this afternoon.

487
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,867
You can walk the grounds,
you can choose your own meals...

488
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:50,403
what's wrong with that ?

489
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:57,601
139 Lebanon street.

490
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,506
That's where they told me to go.

491
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:04,640
The inhibitor
is piggybacking on glucose.

492
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:09,078
It enters the brain through facilitated
diffusion. It's a binding protein.

493
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:10,345
That's how they did it...

494
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,520
i'll take your word for it.

495
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:12,964
But this serum

496
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:16,499
has pure promicin in it.
It can neutralize the charge.

497
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:20,766
The inhibitor won't be able to cross membranes
anymore. We can flush it out of their systems.

498
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:22,496
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away ?

499
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:23,541
Please.

500
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:26,135
Stop saying "disease."

501
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,503
For the last time, it's a side effect.

502
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:31,802
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.

503
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,575
It'll happen virtually instantly.

504
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:34,655
So

505
00:28:34,902 --> 00:28:35,841
this substance...

506
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:36,745
promicin.

507
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,905
It's what makes you people unique.

508
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:40,570
How did you get it out
of my daughter ?

509
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:41,756
She has

510
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,233
race amounts of it
in her bloodstream.

511
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,912
Before the inhibitor, you all did.

512
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,894
That's how they found it
in the first place...

513
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,350
but...

514
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,865
she's an infant.

515
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,964
I could only draw enough blood...

516
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:56,700
to make one shot.

517
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,613
If you can get
that into quarantine,

518
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,056
one shot might be all you need.

519
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,537
Nina, where's Ryland ?

520
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:10,937
A 4400 gave up
the seattle safe house.

521
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,440
They're on their way
to take it down.

522
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,277
Excuse me.

523
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:20,956
Please don't shoot.

524
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,903
Dr. Burkhoff, why
would we shoot you ?

525
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,308
I have no idea, but i'm feeling
a little insecure right now.

526
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,058
I brought something for you.

527
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:32,782
Whatever you do, don't

528
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:34,731
drop it.

529
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:47,292
Everybody in this house
is subject to quarantine and arrest

530
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,582
under emergency order 74.

531
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,311
You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.

532
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,624
If not, we'll come in and get you.

533
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:55,387
Oh...

534
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:57,275
There's an army out there.

535
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,062
Ryland !
Call it off.

536
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:05,328
It's over.

537
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,725
Quarantine. Everything.

538
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,578
Agent Baldwin is obstructing
justice. Arrest him.

539
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,995
I don't think so, Dennis.

540
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,081
I know about firewall.

541
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,410
Keep your weapon on him.

542
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,191
You're really willing
to give up your son ?

543
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,231
Kyle's turning himself in.

544
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,579
He can't live with the cover-up.

545
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,592
When i wrote that memo,

546
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:37,566
we had no idea where the 4400 were
from or why they were brought back.

547
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:41,838
Dr. Hudson gave me information.
I acted on it, Tom.

548
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,989
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.

549
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,135
Hi.

550
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,717
I've got some medicine for you.

551
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,912
To be honest with you,
i'd rather be giving this to Maia,

552
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,632
but a crazy neuroscientist told me that
that was not the right thing to do, so

553
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,532
if you don't mind holding still
for a minute...

554
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:11,121
you saw Orson Bailey
up close and personal.

555
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,152
Oliver Knox.

556
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:15,782
You know what these people
were capable of.

557
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:19,351
Hell, i attached your reports
to the memo when i sent it to D. C.

558
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:21,535
But we learned better, Dennis.

559
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:24,329
Highland beach ?
"Save the future ?"

560
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,854
Heartfelt message, Tom,

561
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:31,171
and while they were giving it to you, they were
programming your son to commit murder.

562
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,965
Does that sound to you like
they were guiding us toward eden ?

563
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:37,500
I don't know, but i sure as hell
don't want to go where you're taking me.

564
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:39,014
Goddammit, Tom !

565
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,756
What does it even mean,
"save the future ?"

566
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,705
Save the future how ?

567
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:47,838
Kill us all ? Start over with a smaller,
more evolved population ?

568
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:49,634
Is that an outcome
you can live with ?

569
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:51,206
What can you live with, Dennis ?

570
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:54,564
Was Max Hudson really a suicide,
or did you pull that little string too ?

571
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,632
And what about me, Dennis ?

572
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:00,025
Because if you're holding on to any
hope of keeping this covered up,

573
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,195
you're going to have to start by putting me
in the ground right here and right now.

574
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:31,226
Tom, you're reducing the fate of the planet
to a question of your personal faith.

575
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:34,690
Without the inhibitor program,
who the hell knows what'll happen ?

576
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,003
Who the hell ever knows ?

577
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:40,021
Very wise.

578
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,524
Pithy.

579
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:45,704
But if the world turns out to be a place
of unchecked 4400 abilities,

580
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,721
i hope we don't live to regret it.

581
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:53,815
Stand down !

582
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:56,247
We're done here.

583
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,062
You can all go home now.

584
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,354
- Thomas.
- Alana.

585
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:55,502
Alana.

586
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:56,557
Thomas...

587
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,766
What happened here ?

588
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,823
A miracle.

589
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,191
Welcome home, baby.

590
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:29,048
Home...

591
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:31,467
i never even unpacked.

592
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,379
We'll take care of that right now.

593
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,951
Where's Kyle ?
I can't wait to see him.

594
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:39,903
Yeah, i told him you were coming home.
Hey, Kyle ! We're back !

595
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,951
Hey, Kyle.

596
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:00,861
Man, i never thought
i was going to see you again.

597
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,221
You're okay, right ?

598
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:07,800
I feel like i did 15 keg stands last night,

599
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:10,962
but yeah, pretty much.
We all are.

600
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:15,471
Dr. Burkhoff took blood samples
from the people that i healed.

601
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:18,500
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...

602
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,437
hey, you guys kind of lucked out, huh ?

603
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:25,134
"Lucked out ?" There's 23 of us dead,
and they don't even have a final count yet.

604
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:28,163
I don't think that was part
of the plan, you know ?

605
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,640
That's not why
they brought us back.

606
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:34,312
This whole idea that there's
some kind of plan... i don't know.

607
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,578
I wish i could believe that.

608
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:39,606
Just trust me when i say
that there's a plan,

609
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:42,964
it's important,
and every 4400 is a part of it.

610
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,822
Shawn...

611
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:46,722
i killed Jordan Collier.

612
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:48,354
What ?

613
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:52,911
I bought a rifle, i went up on that roof, took out
two government agents, and then i shot him.

614
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:56,164
Remember when i was in trouble ? Losing
chunks of time ? That's what i was doing.

615
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,136
Planning out an assassination.

616
00:35:59,153 --> 00:35:59,869
Why ?

617
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:03,509
You think i know ? There's
something inside me, Shawn...

618
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,812
or someone.

619
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,327
It takes over.

620
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:08,957
Those people who took you ?
If they have a plan,

621
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:10,857
it includes me killing Jordan Collier.

622
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,407
That's not true, Kyle !

623
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:14,943
Then why did they make me do it ?
Why did they ruin my life ?

624
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:17,744
I'm about to go to prison
for the people you worship.

625
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:19,687
You murdered Jordan ?

626
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:20,987
I didn't mean...

627
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,028
i didn't even know what
i was doing, Shawn. I'm sorry.

628
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,236
I'm so sorry.

629
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:28,173
Kyle...

630
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,891
Stop... Shawn...
what are you doing ? Stop it.

631
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:09,406
You're killing me. Shawn...

632
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,930
i'm freeing you.

633
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,626
Freeing...

634
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:19,005
just hold on.
It's working.

635
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:22,473
I'm going to get it out of you.

636
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,118
Just hold on.

637
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,243
Hold on, Kyle. It's working.

638
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:59,080
You really didn't have
to do this, you know.

639
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,020
Actually...

640
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,932
i really think i needed to.

641
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,705
Ha...

642
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:06,909
What ?

643
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:07,755
Well,

644
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:10,843
you're supposed to say,
"i wanted to."

645
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:12,170
Oh, oh...

646
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:14,785
Yeah.

647
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,093
Don't push your luck.

648
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:33,280
Whoa.

649
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:37,880
uh,

650
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:42,259
looks like they're talking about
charging these people with murder.

651
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:43,962
Ryland. The whole crew.

652
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,656
Looks like mommy's going to get
a whole bunch of new bosses.

653
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,812
Well, i hope they go away for a very long time.
I'll be in the front row at the hearings.

654
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:52,761
Guess i have to buy a suit.

655
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:55,383
I'm going to be sitting next to you
until the whole thing is over.

656
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,915
Nothing's over.

657
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:03,473
It's just starting.

658
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,866
Sweetie, what are you talking about ?

659
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,146
What's starting ?

660
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,177
The war.

661
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:24,976
Kyle...

662
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,077
i'm ready.

663
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,783
Are you sure ?

664
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:45,871
Yeah.

665
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:50,567
I'll come with you.

666
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:03,789
Hello ?

667
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:06,677
Isabelle ?

668
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,792
Isabelle ?

669
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,188
hello, Shawn.

670
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:24,656
I'm Isabelle.
