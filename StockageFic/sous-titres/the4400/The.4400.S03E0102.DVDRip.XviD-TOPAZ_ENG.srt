1
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,437
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,577
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,613
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,649
What? So Navarro Was really
some kind of mind reader?

5
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,082
I believe "telepath" is the word
you're looking for.

6
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,916
Just concentrate
on what you wanna ask me,

7
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,284
and I'll hear you.

8
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,948
He definitely knew
what we were thinking.

9
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,117
I can think of a feW
practical applications for it,

10
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,922
You should've come to me first,

11
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,031
I'd have treated you better
than they ever Will,

12
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,724
We're at War here,
Don't pick the losing side,

13
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,737
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400.

14
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,774
They call it promicin inhibitor,

15
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,808
NTAC's been studying the 4400
since they got back.

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,502
- They should've known.
- They do know.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,979
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress the production of promicin.

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,278
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.

19
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,115
But if it comes down to a choice

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,484
between the safety
of the American people

21
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,857
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom,
that's no choice at all.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,590
Because if you're holding on to
any hope of keeping this covered up,

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,167
you're gonna have to start by putting
me in the ground right here, right now.

24
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,701
Every male in this building
has got a gallon of adrenaline

25
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,501
coursing through his veins right noW,
and most of them are armed,

26
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,942
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,638
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

28
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,684
I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

29
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,342
but I was when I got back.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,817
You've seen What she's capable of,

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,649
What she can do
When she feels threatened,

32
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,450
You knoW Isabelle has connections

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,684
between the right
and left hemispheres of her brain

34
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,089
that have never been seen before,

35
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,695
You are the steWards of the future,

36
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,297
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone

37
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,160
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.

38
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,065
Isabelle?

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,398
Isabelle!.

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,375
Hello, Shawn. I'm lsabelle.

41
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,879
The world has changed.

42
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,579
Everything is different now.

43
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,985
The Promicin lnhibitor Program
was an international effort.

44
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,158
Its goal was to prevent
the coming of a world

45
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,263
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.

46
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,922
In short, we were doing
everything we could

47
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,561
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extra-human capabilities.

48
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,503
We believe
that without the inhibitor program,

49
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,109
these abilities Would shoW up
in virtually every one of the 4400,

50
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,146
I don't think I need to explain
to this committee

51
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:07,013
Why that Would be something less
than the best-case scenario,

52
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,386
Overnight, normal human beings
like you and I,

53
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,286
and all the institutions
We've come to rely on

54
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,622
Would be obsolete,

55
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,061
The program Wasn't perfect,
People got sick, Some died,

56
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,534
That Was not our intent,

57
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,841
But noW it's gone,

58
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,367
And the future that We Were trying
to prevent is here,

59
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,036
and We are not ready,

60
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,677
I believe it comes doWn
to a question of poWer,

61
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,386
Who is going to hold it?
Us or them?

62
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:50,155
Because, believe me, it's going
to come down to us against them.

63
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,464
Shawn, you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with lsabelle.

64
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,939
I told you, I can't explain.

65
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,975
Is she sick? Is she hurt?

66
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,238
You gotta see for yourself.

67
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,413
Dad.

68
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,652
Who the hell is this?
Where's lsabelle?

69
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,080
I am your daughter. I'm lsabelle.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,651
- I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.

71
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,560
Something happened. I changed.
I don't know how.

72
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,132
She just walked in here.

73
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,394
She knew my name. She seems
to know about you and Lily--

74
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,867
Stop.

75
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,964
I don't know what game
you're playing here, and I don't care.

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,601
Richard. Richard...

77
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,640
Lily.

78
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,646
Lily.

79
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,444
Lily?

80
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,651
Is lsabelle with you?

81
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,722
Lily? Lil--

82
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,695
Lily, are you all right?

83
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,494
Oh, Richard. I must've fainted.

84
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,135
Is lsabelle with you?

85
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,736
Who are you? Where's my wife?

86
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,399
Richard, what are you talking about?

87
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,344
I'm Lily, your wife.

88
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,981
Why are you looking at me like--?

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,144
- Oh, my God.
- Ma'am, I don't know who you are.

90
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,656
Oh, my God.

91
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,699
No!.

92
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,075
Your blood pressure is elevated.

93
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,012
But I suppose that's to be expected.

94
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,849
Heart, lungs, reflexes,
all within the normal range.

95
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,715
Doctor, you call this normal?

96
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,792
Richard, I wanna see lsabelle.
Where is my daughter?

97
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,895
She's right outside.
I'll bring her in in a minute.

98
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,759
I realize how alarming this must be.

99
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,764
But at least you can take
some solace in the fact

100
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,062
that your wife is a perfectly healthy
older woman.

101
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,206
If I had to guess,
I'd say she's about 75.

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,104
I'm 29, and I don't understand.

103
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,269
Please, help me understand.
How could this happen?

104
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:26,044
Maybe it's a reaction to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor.

105
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,914
But truthfully, I don't know.

106
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,990
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.

107
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,458
So this kind of thing
has happened before?

108
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,224
Mr. Tyler, when your wife
fainted this morning,

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,389
she was a young woman.

110
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,660
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

111
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,067
she was 50 years older.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,438
I can guarantee you, this is a first.

113
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,109
Excuse me.

114
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,815
- Are you okay, Dr. Burkhoff?
- I'm fine. Not enough sleep, that's all.

115
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,580
Research.

116
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,817
Well, what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?

117
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:13,296
I wish I knew.
I need to do some thinking.

118
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,773
Are you my mother?

119
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,019
Isabelle?

120
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,148
Every day, the 4400 are changing
and getting stronger.

121
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,753
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,

122
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,652
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.

123
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,654
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.

124
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,196
The inhibitor program was my idea.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,932
I was proud to lead it.

126
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,333
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.

127
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,237
If there's blame to be assigned,
it's mine.

128
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,206
Mine alone.

129
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,403
Yeah, I know Kyle
doesn't wanna see me.

130
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,071
Is there some way
we can force him to?

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,878
I'm his father.
I wanna know how he's doing.

132
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,212
Look, I realize you're trying,

133
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,322
but it'll be months before he goes
to trial, I'm not gonna wait that long.

134
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,890
Do you really think people
are gonna let Ryland position himself

135
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,287
as some kind of patriotic martyr?

136
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,294
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.

137
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,658
He says it was accidental.

138
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,027
A significant percentage
of this country believes him.

139
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,761
Try overwhelming.
You guys listen to talk radio lately?

140
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,098
I mean, the calls are, like,
90 percent in his favor.

141
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,798
You can buy a "Free Dennis Ryland"
T-shirt within a block of here.

142
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,205
Maybe they should put him up
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

143
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,108
Just tell him I need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.

144
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,875
I just have to see my son.

145
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,315
Just ask him one more time, okay?

146
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,514
And tell him we love him.

147
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,851
Give him some time, Thomas.

148
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,088
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.

149
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,528
We're back.

150
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,966
Tom, break's over.

151
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,448
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to call the proceedings to order.

152
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,854
Everyone, just take your seats
so we can get started.

153
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,084
Members of the press,
I was including you

154
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,425
in that "ladies and gentlemen"
designation, thank you.

155
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:05,130
Mr. Ryland, I'd like to pick up
the questioning where we left off.

156
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,431
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead

157
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,303
for the Promicin lnhibitor Program,
is that right, sir?

158
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,671
Yes, sir.
It was my program all the way.

159
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,508
So this committee is to understand
that your department

160
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,843
was able to plan and implement
an international conspiracy

161
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,980
without some
Cabinet-level approval?

162
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,385
That's correct.
I was given a broad mandate

163
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,049
in my duties as head of NTAC.

164
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,855
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate.

165
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,295
So there was no need
to seek outside approval--

166
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,464
- Excuse us, everybody.
- Did you hear that?

167
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,301
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.

168
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,705
No, not that. Something else.

169
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,078
Just set that approval issue to the side
for the moment.

170
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,841
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of NTAC?

171
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,215
I mean, someone, somewhere,
must have taken an interest

172
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,084
in what your people
were doing over there.

173
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,747
- Listen to me.
- What? What's wrong?

174
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,553
- A simple question, Mr. Ryland.
- What do you mean, "What's wrong"?

175
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,962
Surely, it can't be that difficult
to answer.

176
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,667
If I could have your attention
up here, Mr. Ryland.

177
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,860
You need to relax, Miles.

178
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,173
Security!. Stop that man!

179
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,119
Get some protection on Ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.

180
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,555
We need an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!

181
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,217
Stand back, please. Back. Back.

182
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,726
Hey!

183
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,245
Stop! T.J.!

184
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,989
Someone get these photographers
out of here.

185
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,530
You stay with him.

186
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,032
I don't understand what I did.

187
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,695
Would somebody please tell me
what I just did?

188
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,871
Hang on, Dennis.
The ambulance is coming.

189
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,645
Yeah, it was her.

190
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,618
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the DNA in our records.

191
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,519
That was T.J. Kim running
from the courthouse.

192
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,990
When she hit this place,
T.J. drove every man in the building

193
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,287
into a homicidal rage.

194
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,794
Now it sounds like
she just zapped one guy.

195
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,525
She's learning to control
what she can do. They all are.

196
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,293
Ever since we took them off
the inhibitor,

197
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,027
they're either developing
new abilities,

198
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,069
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.

199
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,300
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess Ryland was right.

200
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,103
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.

201
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,212
Okay, save the point-counterpoint.

202
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,177
At the moment,
we've been tasked with two jobs.

203
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,318
We track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?

204
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,282
We are to protect Ryland's
co-conspirators

205
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,512
from any further reprisals.

206
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,622
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?

207
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,090
Well, the entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing

208
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,694
into her own personal slasher film.

209
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,396
If T.J. gets to Ryland again, or any
of them, before we can bring her in,

210
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,966
people are gonna start to wonder
if the United States government

211
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,625
is capable of protecting its citizens.

212
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,162
And that's the beginning of chaos.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,301
Back to work, please.

214
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,374
Tom.

215
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:45,281
In case you're wondering,
Dennis is still in surgery.

216
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,290
They say that it is touch-and-go.

217
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,217
It's okay. Give me your hands.
Try and relax.

218
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,619
Relax.

219
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,007
Is it better?

220
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,647
Much better.

221
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,913
For now.

222
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,192
When this thing first came on,
it was bad,

223
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,626
but at least she was healthy.

224
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,629
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema.

225
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,427
Seems like every day,
there's something new.

226
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,126
I'll come help her every day.

227
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,896
Listen, we got everyone
working on this.

228
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,334
We're gonna figure it out.

229
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,704
- Is my mother okay?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,008
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.

231
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,307
It's all in the wrists.

232
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,941
Can I see her?

233
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,082
Please?

234
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,223
Mom?

235
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,870
Isabelle.

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,134
- Come here.
- Is there anything I can do?

237
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,113
I'm fine. Really. Sit down.

238
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,820
You were such a beautiful baby.

239
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,423
I used to hold you all day long.

240
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,288
I knew exactly what you were feeling,
what you wanted.

241
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,993
We were so close.

242
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,895
I'm sorry for growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.

243
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,002
I didn't want to.

244
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,999
Neither did l.

245
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:23,143
Crazy thing is, I keep thinking
about Patty, Ryland's wife.

246
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,182
I feel like I should call her
or something, help her through this.

247
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,150
Maybe you should. You and Ryland
were friends for a long time.

248
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,149
It's okay to be conflicted.

249
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,815
Yeah, well, Ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed. Shawn too.

250
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,656
The guy knew that Kyle was stalking
Jordan Collier and he did nothing.

251
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,559
I'd say that trumps friendship.

252
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,829
You have so much on your mind.

253
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,465
Kyle, Ryland, the 4400s.

254
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,903
I need to get you away from here,
away from your problems.

255
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,567
Yeah, well, it sounds nice.
But I can't go anywhere.

256
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,271
I'm starting investigation
in the morning.

257
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,348
What if I told you
I could take you away

258
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,781
between now and then?

259
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,183
My ability.

260
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:10,192
Since I'm off the inhibitor,
I think I can control it now.

261
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,887
What, you mean you wanna--?

262
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,363
You wanna take me into another
dream world? Alternate real--?

263
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,367
- I don't even know what to call it.
- Call it a vacation.

264
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:23,372
A week. A year. As long as we want.

265
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,069
All that in the space
of a few moments.

266
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,878
Should we try it?

267
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,343
What, right here? Now?

268
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,548
- What do we do?
- We're already doing it.

269
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,063
There's no one on the beach.

270
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,603
It's all ours, Thomas, so is the hotel.

271
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,503
We can stay here
for as long as we like.

272
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,507
There is no jet lag.

273
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,943
That sounds perfect.
It is perfect too.

274
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,800
The door's open. Come in.

275
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,442
What? What is it?

276
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,814
- You're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.

277
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,646
Haven't really gotten used
to them. Clothes.

278
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,720
I have a bathrobe.

279
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,162
Is this better?

280
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,228
Almost.

281
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,993
Just--

282
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,518
Never met anybody
that read the encyclopedia

283
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,986
- from cover to cover before.
- Oh, I'm not finished.

284
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,150
I just delivered those
to you yesterday.

285
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,520
Okay, you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.

286
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,657
Listen, they're looking for you
down in the labs.

287
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,858
You're like an hour late.

288
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,862
They sent you to get me?

289
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,907
- Aren't you in charge?
- Well, yeah, more or less.

290
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,542
You know, I go where I'm needed.

291
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,207
They were scared of me,
weren't they?

292
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,745
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.

293
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,542
I think my parents are frightened of me.

294
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,707
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.

295
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,011
I think they're just confused.

296
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,088
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel too.

297
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,918
I don't understand
what happened to me.

298
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,219
I don't understand
what happened to my mother.

299
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:02,261
And I'm trying to read and learn things,
but mostly, I just--

300
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,365
I still feel lost.

301
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,600
See, now you sound like
a real 4400.

302
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,132
But I'm not a 4400.

303
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:17,445
Not like my mother and father,
or you.

304
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,651
Looks like I'm gonna live.

305
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,751
Sorry to disappoint you, Tom.

306
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,585
Why'd you ask to see me, Dennis?

307
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,427
I hear that you and Skouris
are in charge of the investigation.

308
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,796
Yeah. We know who did it.
We'll find her.

309
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,103
T.J. Kim attacked this building
six weeks ago.

310
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,105
No one's tracked her down yet?

311
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,642
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, Dennis.

312
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,144
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?

313
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:55,719
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?

314
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,445
When we catch her, we'll ask.

315
00:20:58,824 --> 00:20:59,848
Will you?

316
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:06,189
I wanna make sure you're gonna take
this thing as far as it goes, Tom.

317
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,300
The same way you did
when you came after me.

318
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,803
And I want my people protected.

319
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,032
They were acting under my orders.

320
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,198
They're under guard.

321
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,039
So was the courthouse
when Kim attacked.

322
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,381
I'd feel better if you brought them in.

323
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,445
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.

324
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,180
There were no takers.

325
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,256
I guess no one Wanted to cooperate

326
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,827
With the organization
that Was Working to put you in prison,

327
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,554
We had to fight
just to get them to let us

328
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,699
post agents outside their houses,

329
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,132
Crocket, are you ready to go
for a walk, boy?

330
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,398
Come on, Crocket. Let's go.

331
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,039
They wanted no part of us.

332
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,109
They all seemed confident
that T.J. Kim was acting alone.

333
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,573
Crock?

334
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,218
What's wrong? It's me.

335
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,315
This just arrived 1 5 minutes ago.

336
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,226
This is a message
from the Nova Group,

337
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,262
We are the defensive Wing
of the 4400,

338
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,591
Today, the World has seen

339
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,030
What happens to those
Who try to harm us,

340
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,193
A second demonstration
of our capabilities

341
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,737
is planned for October 1 9th,

342
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,373
A neW era daWns,

343
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,872
Defensive wing, huh?

344
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,805
What happens
when they decide to play offense?

345
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,640
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't say what they want.

346
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,645
No demands.
No room for compromise.

347
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,011
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this Nova Group.

348
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,052
We couldn't handle one when she
walked in here and attacked the place.

349
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,782
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there, all with abilities?

350
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,984
They got someone who can kill you
by lowering your body temperature.

351
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,719
Don't forget the beast master.

352
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,955
What? That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.

353
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,258
I've been all over the files,

354
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,901
and none of these abilities
have been registered with us.

355
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,003
They're off the inhibitor now.
We can't even pretend

356
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,332
to have a comprehensive list
of what these people can do.

357
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,238
Is anyone else feeling
a little overmatched here?

358
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,649
You two remember Gary Navarro?

359
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,619
Hey, Gary. Been a while.

360
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,891
You're right, Baldwin.

361
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,926
I do think you two sold me out.

362
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,621
It really bothered me for a while,

363
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,063
but now I understand
it's just standard operating procedure.

364
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,702
Well, I guess that mind-reading thing's
working pretty well, huh?

365
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,894
Better than ever, actually.

366
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,971
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful

367
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,937
to the National Security Agency.

368
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,805
They've agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the Nova Group.

369
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,206
You're clear on what we're doing?

370
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,008
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.

371
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,117
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.

372
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,818
It won't be my first time.

373
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,686
So can we get started?

374
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,421
Never heard of the Nova Group.
Not until this morning, anyway.

375
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,065
Now I gotta go on television
in an hour

376
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,565
and explain that the Center
had nothing to do with this.

377
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:31,724
Shawn.

378
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,728
I know there's a lot of history
between NTAC and this place.

379
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,897
But I trust you realize
how serious this is.

380
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,703
Believe me, if I knew anything,
I would tell you.

381
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,176
Well, do you mind if the three of us
walk around the place,

382
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,247
- talk to people?
- You and your pet mind reader?

383
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,815
No, I can't let you do that.

384
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,508
These people
haven't done anything wrong.

385
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,085
I won't let you invade their privacy.

386
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,882
And I actually can't believe
that you brought this guy here again.

387
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,852
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?

388
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,189
Are you getting a clear signal?
See anything you like up there?

389
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,561
As far as I can tell,
he's not hiding anything.

390
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,966
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything, I'll give you a call.

391
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,369
For now, that's the best I can do.

392
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,014
Sorry about my nephew.

393
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,289
- Why?
- He was kind of rude back there.

394
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,018
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.

395
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,286
You mind if I ask you--?

396
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,125
You've sort of implied
that you've pursued 4400s in the past.

397
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,358
What exactly do you do
for the NSA?

398
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,629
- Overseas stuff, mostly.
- But like what? Give me an example.

399
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,763
They fly me someplace.

400
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,568
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking.

401
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,438
And I tell the people I work for,

402
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,806
who then fly me home
where I live comfortably.

403
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,743
What happens to the subject?

404
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,782
I don't ask.

405
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,058
That's good.

406
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,723
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.

407
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,801
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.

408
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,970
Dr. Burkhoff,
I don't understand any of this.

409
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,734
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.

410
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,571
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.

411
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,973
Exactly.

412
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,910
And what's true for neurons

413
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,482
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways.

414
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,082
There is a one-to-one
correspondence

415
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,157
between the amount you lost
and the amount you gained.

416
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,590
So all this is just a way
of saying I'm doing this to her?

417
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,288
The correlation is too precise
to be random.

418
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:45,129
Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.

419
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,464
How do we stop it?
Put me back the way I was?

420
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,107
- I'm afraid I can't.
- So, what do we do about it?

421
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,837
There is a possibility
that if the aging agent were eliminated,

422
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,481
that Lily might be restored
to her normal self.

423
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,174
- The aging agent?
- He means me.

424
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,614
I'm killing you.

425
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,254
The only way for you to live
is for me to die. Isn't that right?

426
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,083
Don't answer that, Dr. Burkhoff.

427
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,522
Thank you for your time,
but we're done here.

428
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,095
Where are you going?

429
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,965
We're not discussing this.

430
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,327
Not now.

431
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,695
Not ever.

432
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,769
- It's true, isn't it?
- I think so.

433
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,719
But it's only a theory.

434
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,156
Guys, I went over this six weeks ago
with the men in black.

435
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,418
Humor us.

436
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,722
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
Then I cut it off.

437
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,888
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?

438
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,431
About two months ago.

439
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,364
If I'd known there would be
government agents

440
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,697
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,

441
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,930
I would've taken notes.

442
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,768
Hey, so listen.
All this stuff about October 1 9th,

443
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,537
you guys think it's serious?

444
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,647
I mean, like,
should I be getting out of town?

445
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,278
I don't think that's the answer.

446
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,886
As far as we know,
you're as safe here as anywhere else.

447
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,255
That kid was lying. Or at least
he wasn't telling you everything.

448
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,918
The whole time
you were talking to him,

449
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,620
he was thinking about an address.

450
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,732
331 Reynolds Avenue.

451
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,079
Looks like it's clear. Nobody's home.

452
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,945
Nobody's been home for a while,
I'd say.

453
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,448
Look at this.

454
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,557
It's the government report
on the return of the 4400.

455
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,920
I tried to read this once.

456
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,653
Kind of dry.

457
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,423
It looks like someone made it
right through to the end.

458
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,507
"Wesley Hauser."

459
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:10,238
- "Wesley Hauser. Wesley Hauser."
- Who the hell is Wesley Hauser?

460
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,441
Hauser was a Marine.
Did two tours of duty in Vietnam.

461
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,850
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.

462
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,114
Disappeared in '75.

463
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,417
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in.

464
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,686
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.

465
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,796
Which means he never went
on the inhibitor.

466
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,932
So who knows
what he's capable of by now.

467
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,567
He was disillusioned with the
government before he disappeared.

468
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,295
I wouldn't say we've done much
to win him over since he's been back.

469
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,769
When he was in quarantine,
he was housed in barracks three,

470
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,464
same building as T.J. Kim.

471
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,470
An agitator. An organizer. A radical.

472
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,806
Sounds like we have our
second member of the Nova Group.

473
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,117
Baldwin.

474
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,946
You're kidding me.

475
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,052
All right. All right. I know.
Put him through.

476
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,516
- He says he's Wesley Hauser.
- No way.

477
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,892
Yeah, hello?

478
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,725
HoW'd you like my apartment?

479
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,198
Well, to be honest, it felt a little empty
without you there.

480
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm on a tight schedule,
A lot to do before next Week,

481
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,305
Sounds like you have interesting plans.
Why don't we get together someplace,

482
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,739
- talk them over?
- No more talking,

483
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,210
There's nothing to say,
Your time is ending,

484
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,212
Ours begins October 19th,

485
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,279
Come on. Let me go.

486
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,286
Why'd you run
when we asked you about Hauser?

487
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,721
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.

488
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,761
- We've got it on camera.
- So...?

489
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,399
The guy had a lot
of good war stories.

490
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,558
- Doesn't make us best friends.
- So why did you run?

491
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,135
Because when I see NTAC agents,
I run the other way.

492
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,173
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?

493
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,008
Turn around. Turn around.

494
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,319
- Are we done here?
- Get out of here.

495
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,558
I mean, call me sensitive,

496
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,951
but I felt like saying to him,
"We exposed the inhibitor.

497
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,392
We saved your life."

498
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,630
You guys just don't really get it,
do you?

499
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,396
It's not just that guy.

500
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,700
Every 4400 we've talked to today,
they're scared of you.

501
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,941
Or they don't trust you.
Or they hate you.

502
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,141
I'm sorry, but the days
when you could expect

503
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,907
friendly conversation
from these people, they're gone.

504
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,442
You're the bad guys now.

505
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,749
Get used to it.

506
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,789
Now, I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.

507
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,026
Since when are you an expert?

508
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:49,196
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility.

509
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,865
Especially when she's trying to get by
on a teacher's salary.

510
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,171
- What are you gonna name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.

511
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,940
- Is that okay?
- Oh, what's wrong, sweetheart?

512
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,944
Nothing,
except I know Marco's gonna win,

513
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,714
I'm gonna come second, and you're
gonna end up alone with no money.

514
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,651
Don't be jealous.

515
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,992
He is smarter than you,
but Mom likes you better.

516
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,463
So who's smarter than me?

517
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,704
Who knows?

518
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,844
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.

519
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,242
In some ways she was better off
on the promicin inhibitor.

520
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,542
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.

521
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,987
All she wants to do is record
what she sees in those notebooks.

522
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,683
It's like some kind of compulsion.

523
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,854
Well, think about it for a minute.

524
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:50,056
Every morning she wakes up
and knows pretty much what's coming.

525
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,767
She's already lived the whole day
once in her head.

526
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,996
By the time
something actually does happen,

527
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,162
it's like a rerun.

528
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,471
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah, try living one.

529
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,079
Hey, what about Kevin Burkhoff?

530
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,545
Maybe he can figure out a way
for Maia to control her visions.

531
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,217
- He's brilliant.
- I don't say this about many people,

532
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,322
but he is smarter than me.

533
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,351
I know you.

534
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,657
- Of course you do. It's Diana Skouris.
- You work at NTAC.

535
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,564
I'm not here on business, though.
I'm here about my daughter, Maia.

536
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,666
The precog. What about her?

537
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,400
She's still 1 0, right?
She's not 65 now, is she?

538
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,877
Interesting guess.

539
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,037
- Kind of wide of the mark, though.
- Good.

540
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,979
Might as well come on in.

541
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,353
Thank you.

542
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,962
- Oh, sorry about the clutter.
- That's okay.

543
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,725
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.

544
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,068
Excuse me.

545
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,236
So your daughter,

546
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,805
what's troubling her?

547
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,812
I'll let you do it.

548
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,043
I caused all this, right?

549
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,817
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.

550
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:25,978
No.

551
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,057
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

552
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,589
No, it wasn't.

553
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,125
I don't want her to die either.

554
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,196
So I'll let you do it.
I'll even shut my eyes.

555
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,858
Isabelle, I would never hurt you.

556
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,361
Why?

557
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,205
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.

558
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,364
We don't know that.

559
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,636
And I won't make a choice
between the two of you.

560
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,811
Won't or can't?

561
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,920
Sorry. I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.

562
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,431
Oh, that's okay. It's not my desk.

563
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,530
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?

564
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,104
Assuming this place is still standing
on October 20th, yeah.

565
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:20,233
Maybe we should talk to Jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.

566
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,503
That's fine with me.

567
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,914
To tell you the truth,
I could use a little bit of a buffer zone.

568
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,683
This problem you're having
with your daughter's precog ability.

569
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,383
I keep wanting to give you
my opinion.

570
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,960
But I don't want to intrude.

571
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,690
So you are listening to my thoughts.

572
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,502
You and Baldwin. I can't help it.

573
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,794
I try to tune you guys out,

574
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,439
but every now and then
something leaks through.

575
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,340
I'll try to keep that in mind.

576
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,282
You said you had an opinion
about Maia. What is it?

577
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,981
When I first developed
this thing of mine,

578
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,654
I was a basket case. You saw me.

579
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,258
I truly thought I was going insane.

580
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,155
So I fought against it.

581
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,396
And that just made it worse.

582
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,830
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me.

583
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,997
And then slowly,
I learned how to take control of it.

584
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,905
Listen, your kid stops fighting,

585
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:30,446
and eventually it'll become like seeing,
or hearing, or any other sense.

586
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,310
She won't even think about it.

587
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,819
It's just a part of who she is.

588
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,650
That's how it worked for me,
anyway.

589
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,696
Thank you.

590
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,027
Diana, we just got a call
from Seattle police.

591
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,034
Someone down there read our APB.
They know exactly where Hauser is.

592
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,140
You guys are lucky, actually.
In another day or two,

593
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,369
we would've buried him
in the potter's field.

594
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,945
- Buried who?
- Him.

595
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,480
I always read the APB memos

596
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,050
when they circulate
in the police department.

597
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,811
Kind of a hobby.

598
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,352
Gets boring in here.

599
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,154
Anyway, there was a description
of a regimental tattoo

600
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,383
on the memo for Hauser.

601
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,119
82nd Airborne.
"Death From Above."

602
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,821
I remember it from a John Doe
they brought in here three weeks ago.

603
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,730
This guy drowned in the harbor.

604
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,198
Well, a lot of veterans
have that tattoo.

605
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,532
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?

606
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,074
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.

607
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,877
Say hello to Wesley Hauser.

608
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,454
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before Ryland was attacked.

609
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,615
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.

610
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:52,559
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?

611
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,221
For all we know,
that could've been a plant.

612
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,696
Somebody wanted us distracted.

613
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,266
They deliberately put us on the trail

614
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,370
of some phantom member
of the Nova Group.

615
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,028
How did we first find out
about Hauser?

616
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,197
T.J.'s old boyfriend
gave us the address.

617
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,933
No, he was thinking it.

618
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,211
At least according to Gary he was.

619
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,905
Gary Navarro put us
on to Wesley Hauser.

620
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,127
Get in.

621
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,971
You lied to me, Daniel.

622
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,241
You never said anything
about killing people.

623
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,544
No, we were protecting you, Shawn.

624
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,950
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.

625
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,723
- What is she doing here?
- She's dying. She needs your help.

626
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,991
I told you, I don't want anything more
to do with you.

627
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,794
The Nova Group
was supposed to protect us.

628
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,698
That's why I gave you money,
Daniel.

629
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,840
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!

630
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,440
We'll talk about your concerns later.

631
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,372
She's got a stomach wound
and it's infected.

632
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,274
She needs you right now
or she's not gonna make it.

633
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,382
Shawn, she's a 4400.

634
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,610
And if we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?

635
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,888
Give me your hand.

636
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,211
What are you doing here?

637
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,144
You're awake. Good.

638
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,555
It's important
that you know it was me.

639
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm the guy who killed you.

640
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,944
Med post, do you have a 20
on Gary Navarro?

641
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,221
- Yeah, he just walked by. Why?
- Get him,

642
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,827
Hey. Stop!

643
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,895
Go. I'll check on Ryland.

644
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,727
He's seizing. He's bradying down.

645
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,997
I need a crash cart and Ativan.
Find Dr. Danoff. Now!

646
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,014
Stay right there, Gary.

647
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,649
Isabelle.

648
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,484
Isabelle. Oh, God!

649
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,182
Somebody call an ambulance!

650
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,060
What's everybody
standing around for?

651
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,528
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- They're on their way.

652
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,699
- Somebody call an ambulance.
- Dad.

653
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,351
What am l?

654
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,616
It's miraculous, ShaWn,

655
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,620
When I watch you heal someone,

656
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,789
well, it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.

657
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,928
They hate us
because you're killing them, Daniel.

658
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,800
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.

659
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:08,076
You make it sound like we acted out
of some sort of blood lust.

660
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,212
These were precise,
tactical strikes, Shawn.

661
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,180
And you and every other 4400

662
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,080
were ultimately much safer
because of them.

663
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,550
You killed people.

664
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,349
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

665
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,651
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center,

666
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,657
in case the government
ever came after us again.

667
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,886
It was a precaution.

668
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,088
And all we've done
is taken precautionary measures.

669
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,098
Shawn, do you think that because
their inhibitor program was exposed,

670
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,862
that the government's just gonna
leave us in peace?

671
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,871
They know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,

672
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,668
which increases their need
to eliminate us.

673
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,072
So we strike first?

674
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,838
Is that it?

675
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,106
Is that what happens on the 1 9th?

676
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,314
Look, Shawn.

677
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,953
You do great work
at that center of yours.

678
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,285
You just focus on that.

679
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,857
I don't wanna distract you.
Knowledge can be a burden.

680
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,926
And thanks for helping T.J. out.

681
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,466
You're a hero to your own people.

682
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,568
Don't forget that.

683
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,339
Yeah.

684
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,371
It did not work, you know.

685
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,777
Ryland was OD'ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.

686
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,814
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.

687
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,952
Well, I'm sure
you're as disappointed as I am.

688
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,088
Don't worry, we'll get him.

689
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:30,383
Let's talk about Wesley Hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.

690
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,252
I liked Wes.

691
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,489
He was ten kinds of crazy,
but his heart was in the right place.

692
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,033
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.

693
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,398
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.

694
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,101
I used to visit him
down at the docks.

695
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,969
You know, give him food,
a little money.

696
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,804
So when did you decide to kill him?

697
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:51,243
Wes, he didn't need
my help with that.

698
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,679
He drank about three bottles
of Mad Dog a day.

699
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:58,554
One morning, about a month ago,
I went down to see him,

700
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,988
and I found him by the dumpster,
dead.

701
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,151
And somewhere in the middle
of your grieving process,

702
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,660
you figured
he'd make a handy decoy.

703
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,422
No, Hauser wouldn't have minded it.

704
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,693
I mean, he hated people like you
going back to his Marine Corps days.

705
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,971
So when I found him,
I said a word or two over his body.

706
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,335
And I pushed him into Elliot Bay.

707
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,637
So how long you been working
with this Nova Group?

708
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,905
Did someone approach you?
Was the whole thing your idea?

709
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,448
Tell me.
You and this girlfriend of yours.

710
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,519
Is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to,

711
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,382
or is she actually taking you
into these...?

712
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,714
I don't know. What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?

713
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,189
Oh, and this guy, Marco.

714
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,800
Does he know that you're too

715
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,198
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?

716
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,036
Done showing off?

717
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,738
Why don't you tell us what's
gonna happen on October 1 9th?

718
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,877
I guess you're gonna have
to find yourself another telepath.

719
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,549
Good luck with that.

720
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,822
- So you got nothing out of him?
- He told us about Hauser.

721
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,585
But as far as the Nova goes,
it's gonna take time to break him down.

722
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,422
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.

723
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,689
- He knows what we're thinking.
- Longer than usual.

724
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:15,923
Okay, so it's not easy.

725
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,897
But Gary Navarro
has a Level 7 security clearance.

726
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,297
We must assume he's been using it

727
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,233
to funnel national secrets
to the Nova Group.

728
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,772
We need to know what he knows.
Now.

729
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,500
He'll talk.

730
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,144
Gary's been inside our heads
for a year.

731
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,177
I think I know
how to get inside of his.

732
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,845
- Careful with this, please.
- Matthew.

733
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,751
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple weeks.

734
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,689
Nova Group provides
my calendar for me.

735
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,160
Wiped it clean, actually.

736
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,162
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400

737
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,494
when some of them are boasting
about their body count.

738
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,135
I suppose.

739
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,396
How's Lily?
Any improvement since I left?

740
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:59,030
- If anything, she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.

741
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,642
Isabelle?

742
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,439
She tried to kill herself
this morning.

743
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,679
She jumped off the roof.

744
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,751
A few minutes later, she was walking
around like nothing happened.

745
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,909
I gotta tell you, Matthew.

746
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,114
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really glad you're back.

747
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,910
Hello, lsabelle.

748
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,350
Hello. Who are you?

749
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:47,289
My name is Matthew Ross.
I work closely with Shawn.

750
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:51,685
I'm an adviser to the 4400.
May I come in?

751
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,195
I understand
there was an incident this morning.

752
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,169
You attempted to harm yourself.

753
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,407
I see.

754
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,142
You had no right to do that!

755
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,151
Don't you understand who you are?

756
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,483
What you're here to do?

757
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,625
- No.
- Well, I do.

758
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,727
I know everything about you.
I know why you're here,

759
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,056
and I know
what you're supposed to do.

760
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,663
Sit.

761
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,994
And I'll tell you a story.

762
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,335
You'll like it.

763
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,302
It's about your past
and it's about your future.

764
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,016
I know you went
to a lot of trouble to get this.

765
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,051
- Thank you.
- But...?

766
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,779
I'm not sure
I wanna send Maia to a school

767
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,151
that only teaches 4400s.

768
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,455
It sounds like a great way to get her to
withdraw even further from the world.

769
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:03,895
Just pretend it's got nothing to do
with the 4400 for a second.

770
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,331
It's a good school.
You know, topnotch faculty.

771
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,063
The facilities are great.
And it's all free.

772
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,935
The 4400 Center picks up
the whole tab.

773
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,600
They even have a class
on how to manage your abilities.

774
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,708
Just give me some time
to think about it, okay? It's a big step.

775
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,716
I was kind of hoping
Dr. Burkhoff would have,

776
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,615
I don't know,
a magic pill or something.

777
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,519
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?

778
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:33,152
You know that promicin serum
that he invented that saved everybody?

779
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,767
Well, I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.

780
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,458
Well, he's a researcher, right?

781
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,434
He's probably injecting into, what?
Mice? Guinea pigs?

782
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,234
The only animals I saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.

783
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,242
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself, do you?

784
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,479
That's ridiculous,

785
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,548
I am not injecting myself
with the promicin serum.

786
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,947
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

787
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,746
I'm injecting myself

788
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,857
with a modified version
of the promicin serum.

789
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,858
Dr. Burkhoff, I have to ask you this:

790
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,320
Have you stopped taking
your medication?

791
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,830
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.

792
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,897
Once the course of treatment
is finished,

793
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,509
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

794
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,906
And then I will be the first

795
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,207
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

796
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,748
The first of many.

797
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,115
You're talking about the next step
in human evolution.

798
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,846
Do you think
the world's ready for that?

799
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:35,514
The world is never ready for change.
You have to force it on them.

800
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,593
Isn't that why the 4400
were brought back?

801
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,959
Isn't that why the future
woke me up?

802
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,029
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude

803
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,866
in, excuse me, but-- In a dump.

804
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,009
These are hardly sterile
working conditions.

805
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,666
You could help me with that.

806
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,710
You have a scientific background,
right?

807
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,849
I have graduate degrees
in microbiology and epidemiology.

808
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:02,985
Good. That'll be handy.

809
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,020
I need someone
to monitor my progress

810
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,317
as the changes continue.

811
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,723
Changes?

812
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,364
I think it's an exciting first step,
don't you?

813
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,476
I was thinking, next time,
we could make a world

814
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,807
where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier,
never went to prison,

815
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,808
the inhibitor scandal
never happened.

816
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,679
Sounds nice.

817
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,444
Although I have to tell you,
at the moment,

818
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,350
I'm not really feeling a need
to be transported

819
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,855
to some kind of fantasy world.

820
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,253
As long as this water stays hot,

821
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,954
things are A-okay with me
right here and now.

822
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,125
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.

823
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,290
I'll take a rain check.

824
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:56,997
I'm going to a seminar
at the 4400 Center tomorrow.

825
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,973
It's about what
we can expect physically

826
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,509
now that we're off the inhibitor.

827
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,648
Is everything okay? You're not
having any problems, are you?

828
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,546
No, I feel fine. I feel great, actually.

829
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,721
Well, then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?

830
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,917
I don't. I wanna go. I'm curious.

831
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,063
But why? You never wanted
to go to the Center before.

832
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,755
Why start now?

833
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,632
I never felt the need
to be around other 4400s before.

834
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,863
Now you do?

835
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,168
It's just a seminar, Thomas.

836
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,642
Yeah, okay.

837
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,738
I get it.

838
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,450
Do you recognize those names?

839
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,759
They're 4400s.
All of them foreign nationals.

840
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,793
Alesandro Ortiz from Venezuela.

841
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,933
Ismael Namir from Libya.
Chitra Singh from lndonesia.

842
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,931
They've all gone missing
in the past year.

843
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,729
That's one year.

844
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,668
That's about as long as you've worked
for the NSA, isn't it, Gary?

845
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,564
We checked your travel records.

846
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,041
You left Venezuela two days
before Ortiz disappeared.

847
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,340
Same thing in Libya, lndonesia.
Everyone on that list.

848
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,914
You were there. They went away.

849
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:17,576
What exactly did you do
for the NSA, Gary?

850
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,781
There's an arms race going on,
isn't there?

851
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,548
Only now it's with 4400s.

852
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,592
These people, I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.

853
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,887
And the NSA couldn't stand by

854
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:30,499
while foreign and potentially
hostile governments developed what?

855
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,635
Human weapons
of mass destruction?

856
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,559
Is this list complete, huh?

857
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,036
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

858
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,040
- I did not kill anyone.
- Oh, no, no, no.

859
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,939
You got the right people
in the right ZlP code

860
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,602
because you were living back home.

861
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,105
What did you say? Oh, yeah.

862
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,844
"Very comfortably
when the actual dirty work was done."

863
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,118
And that's why you went across
to the Nova Group, isn't it, Gary?

864
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,624
Because you just couldn't live
with yourself.

865
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:03,856
The NSA told me
that I was helping my country.

866
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,795
They didn't fill in the blanks.

867
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,233
I had to do that myself.

868
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,100
You felt used.

869
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,212
They made you a weapon
against your own people.

870
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,746
So when did you figure it out?

871
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,408
What's up? Who are these guys?

872
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,315
This is Agent Wood
and Dr. Boll of the NSA.

873
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,685
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.

874
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,818
First of all, no more sitting.

875
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,224
What's going on here?

876
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:37,389
- Brought in by whom?
- Gary Navarro tried to kill me.

877
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,829
I made a phone call.

878
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,469
You should be in jail right now,
Dennis.

879
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,834
- I still have a few friends, Tom.
- I had him talking.

880
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,999
- I was making progress.
- Not fast enough.

881
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,907
The members of Gary's cell
know he's been taken.

882
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,571
They're already changing
their plans.

883
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,845
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.

884
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,217
- October 1 9th is three days away.
- Yeah.

885
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,120
I know you find this
hard to believe, Tom,

886
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,659
but we are on the same side.

887
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,297
We have the same goal.

888
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,161
Those agents are tools.

889
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,593
Use them.

890
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,037
You're sitting in my spot.

891
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,513
Sorry.

892
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:31,245
It's okay.
There's room for two people to sit.

893
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,686
You've got Stalin, Pol Pot
and the Marquis de Sade?

894
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,093
Did you finish all the fun books?

895
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,801
Well, I'm interested
in learning more about evil.

896
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,496
Everybody's scared of me.
So I thought, what if they're right?

897
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,898
- What if I'm bad?
- Why would you think that?

898
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,508
Sometimes, I think
I feel it inside of me,

899
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,147
Iike, I could be capable of anything.

900
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,776
Everyone's capable of anything.

901
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:05,011
- Believe me, I know.
- How?

902
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,616
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah, of course I have.

903
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:09,986
Will you tell me about them?

904
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,685
Okay.

905
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,833
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?

906
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,027
Some people would call that
a major betrayal.

907
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,466
A lot of hurt feelings.

908
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,908
- This man did much worse than that.
- Well, I'm not a dictator.

909
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,342
But I've done the big kind of bad too.

910
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,503
I can't say much about it,

911
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,344
but I gave some money
to some people.

912
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,679
They used it for something
really, really wrong.

913
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,379
And I don't think
that they're finished.

914
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,190
- Well, can you stop them?
- I could turn them in.

915
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,725
The thing is, so far, they've
only gone after bad people.

916
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,420
- People that tried to kill me.
- Tried to kill all of us.

917
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,327
So if they've only gone
after bad people,

918
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,459
- then doesn't that make them good?
- Maybe.

919
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,732
I don't know.

920
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,375
We're relating now, aren't we?

921
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,179
I read about this.

922
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,817
Yeah, we are.

923
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,061
How was it for you?

924
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,465
I liked it.

925
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,000
We talked.

926
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,661
It helped me understand
good and evil.

927
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,800
According to you, you get to pick.

928
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,170
It's a choice.

929
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,272
I have it right, don't l?

930
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:42,774
Yeah, you do.

931
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,554
I can't open my hand.

932
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,392
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.

933
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,863
Arthritis, I can handle.

934
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,142
Feels good.

935
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,562
You're like a human heating pad.

936
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,433
I like that.

937
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:36,504
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.

938
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,164
Seriously, you better?

939
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,775
Yeah.

940
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,606
I've been trading e-mails

941
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,774
with somebody
down at the Mayo Clinic.

942
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:52,911
He says we should go to Sweden
and try this experimental treatment.

943
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,089
Here.

944
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,258
What's this?

945
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,251
Open it.

946
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,861
Can you believe that the Air Force
lets you do that now?

947
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,733
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an F-1 6.

948
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,641
It says here
I get to take the controls.

949
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,748
I talked to the guy
who was in charge of the program

950
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,214
and I told him about
your background as a pilot,

951
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:26,822
and he said he would let you drive
for 30 seconds.

952
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,049
Lily, I was a pilot in 1 950.

953
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,353
That's why it's only 30 seconds.

954
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,456
Happy birthday, Richard.

955
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,827
Thanks, but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.

956
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,799
Richard, I'm not going to be here
in six weeks.

957
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,809
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

958
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,411
You and I have both known
for a while.

959
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,915
Richard, I'm dying.

960
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,618
Lily,

961
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,620
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.

962
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,315
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.

963
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,918
- He'll keep you healthy.
- He can't.

964
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,028
Not anymore.

965
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,374
Are all these people 4400s?

966
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,142
Some are.
Some just wish they were.

967
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,251
Why would they want that?

968
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,713
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.

969
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,016
Are you a 4400?

970
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,488
No, sweetie. Are you?

971
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,923
Well, it is an honor to meet you.

972
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,526
- Are you here to take our seminar?
- No. We're here to look at the school.

973
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,602
We have an appointment
with Ms. Tobey.

974
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,567
I'll get her right away.

975
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:53,072
In the meantime, would you sign in
and register your ability?

976
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,075
We're creating a database.

977
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,380
You sure you wanna do this?

978
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,454
I wanna meet kids like me.

979
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,527
My name is Alana Mareva.

980
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,754
I have to admit,

981
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:18,423
I was pretty hesitant
about coming here today.

982
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:24,402
I was lucky. My life was pretty much
intact when I was returned.

983
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,508
I never thought much
about being a 4400.

984
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,643
But when we all got sick,

985
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:38,150
and seeing everyone together
in quarantine,

986
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,582
it made me feel like
I had been denying a part of myself.

987
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,287
So here I am.

988
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,454
And I'm glad I came.

989
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,473
Anything you wanna tell me?

990
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,485
Gary.

991
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,417
Let's end this.

992
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,227
I'll let you sit down.

993
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,894
Who contacted you first?

994
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,565
Just give me a name.

995
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,132
Oh, man.

996
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,046
So how about it?

997
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,219
October 1 9th is two days away.

998
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,321
Now, you got something
to tell me or not?

999
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,863
Suit yourself.

1000
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,167
One of our members
has been compromised.

1001
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,203
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.

1002
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,431
What, so you call me?

1003
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,667
For all I know,
NTAC is monitoring this line.

1004
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,368
Well, we're gonna have
to go underground.

1005
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,603
It's gonna cost money.

1006
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,639
You think I'm just gonna write you
a check?

1007
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,248
You can arrange it
hoWever you Want,

1008
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,441
I need it tomorrow.

1009
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,416
I will see you at the usual spot,
at the usual time.

1010
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:22,280
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.

1011
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,309
Talk to me, Gary.
What do you got to say, man?

1012
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,639
Talk to me! Talk to me.

1013
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,441
I need names.

1014
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,421
Give me a name!

1015
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,755
- Talk to me, Gary.
- Daniel Armand.

1016
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,095
Daniel Armand.

1017
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,330
Daniel Armand.

1018
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,507
Okay. That's a start.

1019
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,279
- Who else?
- That's it.

1020
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,676
He was my only contact.

1021
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:24,616
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.

1022
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:27,449
I'm sorry. I'm just having
a hard time believing that's true.

1023
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,922
His pulse is tachy at 21 0.
Systolic's up to 240.

1024
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,084
- We need to lay off.
- We've only got one name.

1025
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,991
Can't put him under again.
Not for a few hours.

1026
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,998
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry. He's my responsibility.

1027
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,760
No. No.

1028
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,498
No, he's not. He's ours.
And he's done for the day.

1029
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:57,643
Okay, so he's back.
It's not like we weren't expecting this.

1030
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,548
No. Relax.

1031
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,747
He won't get anywhere
near lsabelle.

1032
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,621
We'll find him, and we'll deal with it.

1033
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:09,691
You made a mistake.

1034
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,993
- You got the wrong person.
- I have to go. I don't think I do.

1035
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,831
Those things you told me,
those things you said I'm going to do.

1036
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,337
That's not me. I have a choice.

1037
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,633
And I don't know who you are,

1038
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,936
and I don't know how you think
you know so much about me,

1039
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:25,012
- but you're wrong.
- lsabelle,

1040
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,507
I understand
why you're having trouble adjusting.

1041
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,348
Growing up is hard,
but don't be angry at the messenger.

1042
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,782
It's not my plan.

1043
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:38,257
I'm just here to help facilitate,
to help you reach your full potential.

1044
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,695
Think of me as a favorite uncle.

1045
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,195
No. No, I don't have any uncles.

1046
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:45,924
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.

1047
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:49,663
That's fair enough.
You can always opt out.

1048
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,734
You can even try saving
your mother if you like.

1049
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:55,799
How?

1050
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,028
- What is that?
- Open it.

1051
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,836
There aren't a lot of things
that'll hurt you, lsabelle.

1052
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:25,496
But that right there, that'll do the job.

1053
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,871
If you can't accept the fact
that your life

1054
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,944
is vastly more important
than your mother's,

1055
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,603
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.

1056
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,746
And Lily? Who knows?

1057
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,046
Maybe she'll wake up
and be a young woman again.

1058
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:47,223
- Will it really save her?
- I don't know. It's a gamble.

1059
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:51,093
But if you can't live
with who you are, then don't.

1060
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,337
Sorry about that.

1061
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,542
I knew it. I knew it.

1062
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:12,447
I knew I had a clean cup
somewhere.

1063
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:15,249
Now, where are the filters?

1064
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,484
- It's okay. I don't need coffee.
- I swear I just saw them.

1065
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,595
Do you mind
if I just use paper towels?

1066
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:24,357
- Kevin, if I do this...
- If you do it?

1067
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,096
You're already doing it.

1068
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:29,860
You're here, right?

1069
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,769
If I monitor you
throughout this experiment,

1070
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,500
I need you to know one thing.

1071
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,137
If it gets to a point
where your life is in danger,

1072
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,178
I am cutting this off.

1073
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,543
I will not stand by
and watch you die.

1074
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,918
Well, I would hope not,
because I'm too valuable.

1075
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,950
I think this is gonna be fun.

1076
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:55,860
I haven't really worked with anyone
for quite some time.

1077
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,330
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

1078
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,960
So...

1079
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,531
Wanna draw some blood?

1080
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,741
Nina.

1081
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:17,212
We were just downstairs. The guard
on duty said Wood signed Gary out.

1082
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,513
Gary was transferred
to an NSA-run facility.

1083
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,485
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.

1084
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,057
And someone at the Pentagon
signed an order overriding us.

1085
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,887
Apparently,
they feel we lack experience

1086
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,460
in high-pressure interrogation.

1087
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,654
And who do you think put
that little bug in their ear?

1088
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,767
I don't know if it was Ryland or not.
But we had our shot at Navarro.

1089
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,095
Now, tomorrow is October 1 9th.

1090
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,397
We are a day away
from an announced terrorist attack.

1091
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,097
The NSA thinks
they can get him to talk.

1092
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,574
- So where are they taking him?
- They didn't share that information.

1093
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,543
This is so wrong.
This is the only place in the country

1094
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,012
that's at least somewhat equipped
to handle 4400s.

1095
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,414
Do you think
that I didn't tell him that?

1096
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,611
They weren't interested.

1097
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,867
- lsabelle.
- Hi.

1098
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,007
May I come in?

1099
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:17,774
Are you going somewhere?

1100
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,108
I saw Dad putting luggage
into his car.

1101
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:24,810
Oh, we're just gonna try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.

1102
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,921
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

1103
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,080
No, it's all right. Thank you.

1104
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,788
Now, if there's anything that you need,
you can talk to Shawn.

1105
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,951
He's...

1106
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:37,223
He'll be looking out for you, okay?

1107
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,527
And...

1108
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,470
I wanna give you this.

1109
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:49,744
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.

1110
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,880
Her name was Lily too.

1111
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,645
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.

1112
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,489
I remember.

1113
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:06,255
- I used to like to bite on it.
- And my finger too.

1114
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,756
You can wear it if you want.

1115
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:12,627
I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.

1116
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:18,333
It doesn't fit me anymore,
and I'd hate to lose it.

1117
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,967
I'll keep it safe for you.

1118
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,439
I know you will.

1119
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,847
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.

1120
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,480
I wish we had more time together.

1121
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,024
Well, when do you think
you'll be back?

1122
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,317
It's hard to say.

1123
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,619
Goodbye, lsabelle.

1124
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,332
Bye.

1125
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,031
Thank you very much.
I'll take her from here.

1126
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,828
Thank you.

1127
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,831
Okay,

1128
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,374
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?

1129
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,235
- How'd it go over?
- Oh, fine.

1130
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,644
I had it easy. I got to lie.

1131
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,648
You're the one
who has to tell her the truth.

1132
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,953
What's going on?

1133
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,198
What's happening?

1134
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,204
We'll get him.

1135
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,647
Funny, that's the exact same thing
Navarro said about you.

1136
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:44,979
So far, he's wrong.

1137
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,054
He never should've been moved
in the first place.

1138
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,053
- There was no reason.
- There was every reason.

1139
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,692
You're too soft, Tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.

1140
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,589
No, I had him, Dennis! You lost him.

1141
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,256
Sunset's in four hours.

1142
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,400
At this point, we can't even say
with 1 00% certainty

1143
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,159
that it's gonna rise again
in the morning.

1144
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,802
And the one guy
who can tell us is gone.

1145
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,837
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.

1146
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,640
Yeah, I know. You keep saying that.

1147
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,355
Hey, Shawn.

1148
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,684
- You got something for me?
- Where's Daniel?

1149
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,385
Busy. He sent me.

1150
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,960
- No, no, no. That's not how we work.
- Today it is.

1151
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,293
You can trust me.

1152
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,404
You saved my life. I owe you.

1153
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:41,075
Come on. Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.

1154
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,710
Thanks.

1155
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,578
Listen,
if there's ever anything you need--

1156
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:59,383
You sold us--

1157
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:06,725
Get in there, get in there.

1158
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,167
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1159
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,970
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.

1160
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,306
No, you did the right thing
by calling us, Shawn.

1161
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,607
Seriously.

1162
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,949
You're a hero.

1163
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,809
One minute to go.

1164
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:52,740
Just tell me one thing.
Are we as prepared as we can be?

1165
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,883
The entire country's
on level-red terror alert.

1166
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,883
All commercial air traffic
has been suspended for the day.

1167
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:01,022
The National Guard
has been deployed to likely targets.

1168
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,553
"Likely targets." Kind of a broad term.

1169
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,556
I wish T.J. could've narrowed
that down for us.

1170
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:09,686
Well, me too. But we have to keep her
sedated to inhibit her ability.

1171
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,323
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.

1172
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,429
So now we wait.

1173
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,802
Anyone else feel like they're staring
at a doomsday clock?

1174
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,250
Well, that's it.

1175
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,517
October 1 9th.

1176
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,618
Looks like the world's still here.

1177
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,025
For the moment, anyway.

1178
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,083
Oh, my God!

1179
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:09,182
- What? What happened?
- It's the Nova Group.

1180
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,121
Certainly, "miracle"
is an imprecise term,

1181
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,261
but I'm not sure hoW else
to describe it,

1182
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:14,417
To repeat:

1183
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:17,224
I'm broadcasting live from
the Nubian Desert, north of Khartoum,

1184
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,891
Where overnight,
a thousand-acre patch of barren sand

1185
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,300
has somehoW been transformed
into fertile Wheat fields,

1186
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,067
Scientists are at a loss
to explain the conversion,

1187
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:30,268
but tests confirm that the Wheat
is real and edible,

1188
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,572
There hasn't been food growing
in that part of the world

1189
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,443
since before the birth of Christ.

1190
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,811
They make us all terrified,

1191
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,148
and then rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.

1192
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,722
Our station
has just received a statement

1193
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:46,554
from the radical 4400 organization
knoWn as the Nova Group,

1194
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:50,357
claiming responsibility
for this morning's transformation,

1195
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:53,000
You are Witnesses to the beginning
of a neW era,

1196
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,033
What happens next is up to you,

1197
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:58,730
The 4400 can be mankind's
greatest ally,

1198
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:01,341
or its most dangerous adversary,

1199
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,207
Don't kid yourself. It's an attack.
An act of aggression, anyway.

1200
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,575
They just showed everyone
that they can change the world,

1201
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:10,240
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

1202
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:36,603
- Hello?
- I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn.

1203
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:40,270
- Daniel.
- I realize you're still a young man,

1204
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:43,683
But I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

1205
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,310
Keith, I'm broadcasting live
from the Nubian Desert,,,

1206
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,879
It's okay, Kyle. Daddy's...

1207
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,493
Daddy's here. I'm right here.

1208
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,919
I'm right here.

1209
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,622
Just go to sleep.

1210
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,344
Hey, I'm Tyler.

1211
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,283
Maia.

1212
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,648
Lily,

1213
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,994
We are here.

1214
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:48,702
- Hasn't changed much, has it?
- No.

1215
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,231
We were so happy here.

1216
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,035
Just you and me, and the baby.

1217
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,638
It was so much simpler.

1218
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:03,783
- Would you like to head on inside?
- No, not just yet.

1219
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,620
No, let's stay out here for a while.

1220
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,950
It's so peaceful.

1221
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,938
Remember When you Went
into labor?

1222
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,612
I could hardly get the car into gear.

1223
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:43,790
But you gave me directions
to the hospital.

1224
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,551
How did you stay so calm?

1225
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,988
Lily?
