1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,580
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
proudly presents</font>

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,410
All at once they were returned

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,550
<font color="#ffff00">sync:gagegao
-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font>

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,410
With no memory of where they've been

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,000
They haven't aged a day

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,790
And some have returned with new abilities

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
All are trying to reconnect....

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,410
...with a life interrupted

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,420
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,540
The world will have to deal with us.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,690
Previously on the 4400...

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,600
What,so navarro was really some
kind of mind-reader?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,040
I believe "telepath" is the
word you're looking for.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,030
Just concentrate on what you want
to ask me and I'll hear you.

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,110
The guy definitely knew what we were thinking.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,280
I could think of a few practical
applications for it.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
You should have come to me first.
I'd have treated you better than they ever will.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,580
We're at war here.
Don't pick the losing side.

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,620
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400,

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,550
and they call it "promicin inhibitor."

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
But ntac's been studying the 4400 ever
since they got back.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,530
- They should have known about this--
- they do know.

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,870
I was ordered to work on a drug to
suppress the production of promicin.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,240
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,890
If it comes down to a choice
between the safety

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,460
of the american people and the
welfare of the 4400,

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,140
tom...

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,630
that's no choice at all.

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,490
If you're holding on to any hope
of keeping this covered up,

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,870
you're going to have to start by putting
me in the ground right here and right now.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,090
Every male in this building has
got a gallon of adrenaline

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,480
coursing through his veins right now,
and most of them are armed.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,740
A 4400 nearly took down a fortified government
facility and walked away without breaking a sweat.

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,390
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,720
You've seen what she's capable of,
what she can do when she feels threatened.

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,350
Did you know isabelle has connections
between the right and left

38
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,960
hemispheres of her brain that have
never been seen before?

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,810
You are the stewards of the future.

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,520
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding wh happened to the 4400.

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,320
Isabelle...

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,820
isabelle!

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,040
Hello,shawn.
I'm isabelle.

44
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,430
<font color="#ffff00">4400
Season 03 Episode 01-02</font>

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,340
The world has changed.

46
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,670
Everything is different now.

47
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,250
The promicin inhibitor program was
an international effort.

48
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,190
Its goal was to prevent the coming of a world

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,370
dominated by a tiny fraction of the population.

50
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,890
In short,we were doing everything we could

51
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,780
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extrahuman capabilities.

52
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,280
We believed that,without the inhibitor program,

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,580
these abilities would show up
in virtually every single one of the 4400.

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,150
I don't think I need to explain to ts committee

55
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,470
why that would be something
less than a best-case scenario.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,560
Overnight,normal human beings like you and i

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,320
and all the institutions we've
come to rely on would be obsolete.

58
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,080
The program wasn't perfect.
People got sick.Some died.

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,560
That was not our intent.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,420
But now it's gone,

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,450
and the future that we were
trying to prevent is here,

62
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,500
and we are not ready.

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,650
I believe it comes down to
a question of power.

64
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,800
Who is going to hold it?

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,240
Us...or them?

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,460
Because,believe me...

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,650
it's going to co down...
to us against them.

68
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,430
THREE WEEKS EARLIER

69
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,490
Shawn,you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with isabelle.

70
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,700
I told you,I can't explain.

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,080
Is she sick?
Is she hurt?

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,360
You'll see for yourself.

73
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,580
Dad.

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,860
W-who the hell is this?
Where's isabelle?

75
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,430
I am your daughter.
I'm isabelle.

76
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,580
- I-I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.

77
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,740
Something happened.I... I changed.
I don't know how.

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,280
She just walked in here.She knew my name.
She seems to know about you and lily.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,340
Stop.

80
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,950
I don't know what game you're playing here,
and I don't care.

81
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,590
Richard... richard.

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,940
Lily.

83
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,360
Lily!

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,250
Lily?

85
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,550
Is isabelle with you?

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,800
Lily--

87
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,190
lily.
Are you all right?

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,410
Oh,richard,I must have fainted.

89
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,180
Is isabelle with you?

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Who are you?
Where's my wife?

91
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,500
Richard,what are you talking about?

92
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm lily,your wife.

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,230
Why are you looking at me like--

94
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,730
oh,my god.

95
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,530
Ma'am,I don't know who you are.

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,410
oh,my god.

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,220
No!

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,580
Your blood pressure is elevated...

99
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,760
but I suppose that's to be expected.

100
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,910
Heart,lungs,reflexes...

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,510
all within the normal range.

102
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,420
- Doctor,you call this normal?
- Richard,I want to see isabelle.

103
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,460
- Where is my daughter?
- She's right outside.

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,750
I'll bring her in in a minute.

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,860
I realize how alarming this must be,

106
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,880
but at least you can take some
solace in the fact that

107
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,130
your wife is a perfectly
healthy older woman.

108
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,090
If I had to guess,I'd say she's about 75.

109
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,030
I'm 29...
and I don't understand.

110
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,550
Please help me understand.
How could this happen?

111
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,090
Maybe it's a reaction to being
taken off the promicin inhibitor,

112
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,130
but truthfully,I don't know.

113
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,910
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.

114
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,330
So this kind of thing has happened before?

115
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,220
Mr. Tyler...

116
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,400
when your wife fainted this morning,
she was a young woman.

117
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,290
When she woke up less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.

118
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,290
I can guarantee you...

119
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,780
this is a first.

120
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,750
Excuse me.

121
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,270
- Are you okay,dr. Burkhoff?
- Fine.

122
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,200
Not enough sleep,that's all.
Research.

123
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,270
Well,what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?

124
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,620
I wish I knew.
I need...

125
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,350
to do some thinking.

126
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,140
Are you my mother?

127
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,110
Isabelle?

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
PRESENT DAY

129
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,800
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,070
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.

131
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,340
The inhibitor program was my idea.

132
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,630
I was proud to lead it.

133
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,100
The men on this board were simply
following my orders.

134
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,890
If there's blame to be assigned,it's mine.

135
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,490
Mine alone.

136
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,380
Yeah,I know kyle doesn't want to see me.

137
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,970
Is there some way we can force him to?
I'm his father.
I want to know how he's doing.

138
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,910
Look,I realize you're trying,
but it'll be months before he goes to trial.

139
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,080
xxxxxxxxxx

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,350
I mean,you really think people
are going to let ryland

141
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,040
position himself as some kind of
patriotic martyr?

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,910
The man headed a conspiracy that
caused 28 deaths.

143
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,680
Well,he says it was accidental.

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,810
A significant percentage of this
country believes him.

145
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,650
Try "overwhelming."
You guys listened to talk radio lately?

146
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,100
The calls are like 90% in his favor.

147
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,980
You can buy a "free dennis ryland"
t-shirt within a block of here.

148
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,250
Maybe they should put him up for
the nobel peace prize.

149
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,110
Just tell him i need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.

150
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,770
I just have to see my son.

151
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,160
Just ask him one more time,okay?

152
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,210
and tell him we love him.

153
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,880
Give him some time,thomas.

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,730
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.

155
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,680
We're back.

156
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,330
Tom...
break's over.

157
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,530
Ladies and gentlemen,I'd like to
call the proceedings to order.

158
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,950
Everyone just take your seats.
We can get started.

159
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,500
Members of the press,I was including you in that
"ladies and gentlemen" designation.Thank you.

160
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,360
Mr. Ryland,

161
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,110
I'd like to pick up the questioning
where we left off.

162
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,230
You insist that you alone gave the go-ahead for
the promicin inhibitor program.Is that right,sir?

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,730
Yes,sir.
It was my program all the way.

164
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,550
So this committee is to understand that
your department was able to plan

165
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,990
and implement an international conspiracy
without some cabinet-level approval?

166
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,040
That's correct.I was given a broad mandate
in my duties as head of ntac.

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I felt that the project fell within that mandate,

168
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,970
so there was no need to seek outside approval.

169
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,490
Excuse us,everybody.

170
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,510
Did you hear that?

171
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,180
Well,yeah,the microphones went haywire.

172
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,770
No,no,not that.
Something else.

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,340
Just set that approval issue to
the side for the moment.

174
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,420
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of ntac?

175
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,950
I mean,someone somewhere must have taken an interest
in what you people were doing over there.

176
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,590
It's a simple question,mr. Ryland.

177
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,690
Surely it can't be that difficult to answer.

178
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,240
If I could have your attention up here,
mr. Ryland...

179
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,730
Security!
Stop that man!

180
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,020
Get some protection around ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.

181
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,160
We need an ambulance!
Stand back,please!Back! Get back!

182
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,450
Hey!

183
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,680
Stop! T.J.!

184
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,000
Someone get these photographers out of here.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
Stay over there.

186
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,030
I don't understand what I did.

187
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,530
Would somebody please tell to me
what I just did?

188
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,590
Hang on,dennis. The ambulance is coming.

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,950
Yeah,it was her.

190
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,540
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the dna in our records.

191
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,810
That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse.

192
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,430
When she hit this place,T.J. Drove
every man in the building into a homicidal rage.

193
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,760
Now it sounds like she just zapped one guy.

194
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,790
She's learning to control what she can do.
They all are.

195
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,640
Ever since we took them off the inhibitor,

196
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,380
they're either developing abilities or
they're refining the ones that they've got.

197
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,510
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess ryland was right.

198
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,200
I'll be sure to mention that to my daughter.

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,420
Save the point-
counterpoint.

200
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,550
At the moment,we've been tasked with two jobs--

201
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,390
we track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?

202
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,810
We are to protect ryland's
co-conspirators from any further reprisals.

203
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,920
So we arrest them,and now we're their bodyguards?

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,150
The entire country just saw a 4400 turn a government
hearing into her own personal slasher film.

205
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,440
If T.J.Gets to ryland again--
or any of them--before we can bring her in,

206
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,650
people are going to start to wonder if the united states
government is capable of protecting its citizens,

207
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,680
and that's the beginning of chaos.

208
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,220
Back to work,please.

209
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,440
Tom...

210
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,960
in case you're wondering,dennis
is still in surgery.

211
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,290
They say that it is touch and go.

212
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,710
It's okay.Give me your hands.
Try and relax.

213
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,680
Relax.

214
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,170
Is it better?

215
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,050
Much better.

216
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,980
For now.

217
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,830
When this thing first came on,it was bad,
but at least she was healthy.

218
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,640
Now she's had diabetes,emphysema...
it seems like every day there's something new.

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,530
I'll come help her every day.

220
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,410
Listen,we've got everyone working on this.
We're going to figure it out.

221
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,390
- Is my mother okay?
- Uh,yeah.

222
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,260
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.

223
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,510
It's all in the wrists.

224
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,060
Can I see her?

225
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,040
Please?

226
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,780
Mom?

227
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,420
Isabelle.

228
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,440
Come here.

229
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,780
Is there anything I can do?

230
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,740
No,I'm-- I'm fine.

231
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,500
Really.

232
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,440
Sit down.

233
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,040
You were such a beautiful baby.

234
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,710
I used to hold you all day long.

235
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,340
I knew exactly what you were feeling.
What you wanted.

236
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,570
- We were so close.
- I'm sorry for growing up so fast.

237
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,750
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to.

238
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,280
Neither did I.

239
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,740
The crazy thing is i keep thinking about patty.

240
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,330
Ryland's wife.

241
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,430
I feel like I should call her or something,
help her through this.

242
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,770
Maybe you should.
You and ryland were friends for a long time.

243
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,290
It's okay to be conflicted.

244
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,990
Well,ryland's little experiment almost
got you killed.
Shawn,too.

245
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,730
The guy knew that kyle was stalking
jordan collier and he did nothing.

246
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,380
I'd say that trumps friendship.

247
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,420
You have so much on your mind.

248
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,060
Kyle,ryland,the 4400s...

249
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,160
I need to get you away from here.
Away from your problems.

250
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,930
Yeah,well,that sounds nice,
but I can't go anywhere.

251
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,410
I'm starting an investigation in the morning.

252
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,510
What if I told you i could take
you away between now and then?

253
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,600
My ability.

254
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,030
Since I'm off the inhibitor...

255
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,030
I think I can control it now.

256
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,200
What,you mean you want to...

257
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,900
you want to take me into another dream world?
Alternate reality--I don't even know what to call it.

258
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,020
Call it a vacation.
A week,a year...

259
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,030
as long as we want.

260
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,250
All that in the space of a few moments.

261
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,030
Should we try it?

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,350
Right here?
Now?

263
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,360
Well,what...
what do we do?

264
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,280
We're already doing it.

265
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,780
- There's no one on the beach.
- It's all ours,thomas.

266
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,400
So's the hotel.
And we can stay here for as long as we like.

267
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,470
- There is no jet lag.
- That sounds perfect.

268
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,880
It feels perfect,too.

269
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,910
OCTOBER 14

270
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,420
The door's open. Come in.

271
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,280
What? What is it?

272
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,910
- Uh,you're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.

273
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,080
I haven't really gotten used to them.
Clothes.

274
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,940
I have a bathrobe.

275
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,900
Is this better?

276
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,810
Almost.

277
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,220
I never met anybody that read the
encyclopedia from cover to cover before.

278
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,250
- Oh,I'm not finished.
- We just delivered those to you yesterday.

279
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,870
Okay,you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.

280
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,340
Um,listen,they're looking for you down
in the labs.You're like an hour late.

281
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,790
They sent you to get me?

282
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,760
Aren't you in charge?

283
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,130
Well,yeah,more or less.
You know,I go where I'm needed.

284
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,150
They were scared of me,weren't they?

285
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,580
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.

286
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,680
I think even my parents are frightened of me.

287
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,160
I don't think your mom and dad are scared
of you.I think they're just confused.

288
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,180
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel,too.

289
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,520
I...

290
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
don't understand what happened to me.

291
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,710
I don't understand what happened to my mother.

292
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,210
And I'm trying to read and learn things,but...

293
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,600
mostly,I just...

294
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,230
I still feel lost.

295
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,980
See,now you sound like a real 4400.

296
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,130
But I'm not a 4400...

297
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,470
not like my mother and father...

298
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,990
or you.

299
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,230
Looks like I'm going to live.

300
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,300
Sorry to disappoint you,tom.

301
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,300
Why'd you ask me to see me,dennis?

302
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,860
I hear that you and skouris are
in charge of the investigation.

303
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,410
Yeah,we know who did it.
We'll find her.

304
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,380
T.J. Kim attacked thuildx weeks.
No one's tracked her down yet.

305
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,900
We got a little sidetracked cleaning
up your mess,dennis.

306
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,620
Did you ever think that maybe she has help?

307
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:43,070
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?

308
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,660
When we catch her,we'll ask.

309
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,780
Will you?

310
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,220
I want to make sure you're going to take
this thing as far as it goes,tom,

311
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,170
the same way you did when you came after me...

312
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,950
and I want my people protected.

313
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,090
They were acting under my orders.

314
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,440
They're under guard.

315
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,670
So was the courthouse when kim attacked.

316
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:13,460
I'd feel better if you brought them in.

317
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,730
We offered sanctuary to every single conspirator.

318
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,900
There were no takers.

319
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,150
I guess no one wanted to cooperate
with the organization

320
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,110
that was working to put you in prison.

321
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,710
We had to fight just to get them to let
us post agents outside their houses.

322
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
Crockett!
You ready to go for a walk,boy?

323
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,910
Come on,crockett.
Let's go.

324
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:40,030
They wanted no part of us.They all seemed
confident that T.J. Kim was acting alone.Crockett?

325
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,890
What's wrong?

326
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,700
This arrived 15 minutes ago.

327
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,250
This is a message from the nova group.

328
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,130
We are the defensive wing of the 4400.

329
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,870
Today,the world has seen what happens
to those who try to harm us.

330
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,620
A second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.

331
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,850
- A new era dawns.
- Defensive wing,huh?

332
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,690
What happens when they decide to play offense?

333
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,510
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't even say what they want.

334
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,180
No demands,no room for compromise.

335
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,310
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this nova group.

336
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,950
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked in and attacked the place.

337
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,570
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there,all with abilities?

338
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,700
They've got someone who can kill
you by lowering your body temperature.

339
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,060
- Don't forget the beastmaster.
- What?

340
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,830
That dog got pissed off pretty quick.

341
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,770
Well,I've been all over the files,and none of
these abilities have been registered with us.

342
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,960
They're off the inhibitor now.We can't even pretend
to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do.

343
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,800
Is anyone feeling...
a little overmatched here?

344
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,380
You two remember gary navarro?

345
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,200
Hey,gary.

346
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,070
Been a while.

347
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,720
You're right,baldwin.

348
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,770
I do think you two sold me out.

349
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,700
It really bothered me for a while,but now I
understand it's just standard operating procedure.

350
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,490
Well,I guess that mind reading
thing is working pretty well,huh?

351
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,780
Better than ever,actually.

352
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,850
Gary's telepathic abilities have been
very useful to the national security agency.

353
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,640
They have agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the nova group.

354
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,110
So you're clear on what we're doing here?

355
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,040
You want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400s.

356
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.

357
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,370
It won't be my first time.

358
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,610
So...
can we get started?

359
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,330
Never heard of the nova group.xxxxxxxxxx

360
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,460
xxxxxxxxxxxx

361
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,510
xxxxxxxxxx Between ntac and this place,

362
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,460
but I trust you realize how serious this is.

363
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,320
Believe me,if I knew anything,I would tell you.

364
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,810
Well,do you mind if the three of us walk
around the place,talk to some people?

365
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,550
You and your pet mind-reader?
No,I can't let you do that.

366
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,500
These people haven't done anything wrong,
and I won't let you invade their privacy,

367
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,370
and I actually can't believe that
you brought this guy here again.

368
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,430
How much do they pay you to spy on
your own kind?Getting a clear signal?

369
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,350
You see anything you like up there?

370
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,810
As far as I can tell,he's not hiding anything.

371
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,820
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything,I'll give you a call.

372
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,410
For now,that's the best I can do.

373
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,640
Sorry about my nephew.

374
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,430
Why?

375
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,220
Well,he was kind of rude back there.

376
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,960
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.

377
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,250
Do you mind if I ask you...

378
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,970
you've sort of implied that you've
pursued 4400s in the past.

379
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,160
What exactly do you do for the nsa?

380
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,930
Overseas stuff,mostly.

381
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,970
But,like,what?
Give me an example.

382
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,700
They fly me someplace.

383
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,570
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking,

384
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,580
and I tell the people i work for,who then
fly me home,where I live comfortably.

385
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,440
What happens to the subject?

386
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,360
I don't ask.

387
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,000
That's good.

388
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,610
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.

389
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,960
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.

390
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,950
Dr. Burkhoff,I don't understand any of this.

391
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,640
A bunch of her neurons don't work anymore.

392
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,410
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.

393
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,900
Exactly...

394
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,690
and what's true for neurons is
true for muscle fibers,synaptic pathways...

395
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,060
there is A...

396
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,110
one-to-one correspondence between the
amount you lost and the amount you gained.

397
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,640
So all this is just a way of saying
I'm doing this to her?

398
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,140
The correlation is too precise to be random.

399
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,540
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.

400
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,230
How do we stop it?
Put me back to the way I was.

401
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,950
- I'm afraid I can'T.
- So,what do we do about it?

402
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,550
There is a possibility that if the aging agent

403
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,410
were eliminated that lily might be
restored to her normal self.

404
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,760
- The aging agent?
- He means me.

405
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,090
I'm killing you.The only way for you
to live is for me to die,isn't that right?

406
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,370
Don't answer that,dr. Burkhoff.
Thank you for your time.We're done here.

407
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,870
Where are you going?

408
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,690
We're not discussing this.

409
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,920
Not now.Not ever.

410
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,950
- It's true,isn't it?
- I think so.

411
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,540
But it's only a theory.

412
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,020
Guys,I went over this six weeks
ago with the men in black.

413
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,190
Humor us.

414
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,550
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
I cut it off.

415
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,500
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?

416
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,360
Uh,two months ago?

417
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,430
Look,if I'd known there'd be government agents

418
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,650
showing up every other day to ask me about her,

419
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,410
I would've taken notes,

420
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,530
hey,so listen...

421
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,420
all this stuff about october 19th...
you guys think it's serious?

422
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,730
Like,should I be getting out of town?

423
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,900
I don't think that's the answer.As far as
we know,you're as safe here as anywhere else.

424
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,220
That kid was lying...
or at least he wasn't telling you everything.

425
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,390
The whole time you were talking to him,
he was thinking about an address.

426
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,780
331 reynolds avenue.

427
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,840
Looks like it's clear.
Nobody's home.

428
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,940
Nobody's been for home for a while,
I'd say.

429
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,420
Look at this.

430
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,250
That's the government report on
the return of the 4400.

431
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,510
I tried to read this once.
Kind of dry.

432
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,020
Yeah.Looks like someone made it
right through to the end.

433
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,990
Liies!!!

434
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,830
Wesley hauser.

435
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,150
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.

436
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,270
Who the hell is wesley hauser?

437
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,290
Hauser was a marine.
Did two tours of duty in vietnam.

438
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,910
He led protests against the war after he
got home in '72.Disappeared in '75.

439
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,320
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in with us.

440
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,480
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.

441
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
Which means he never went on the inhibitor,

442
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,680
so who knows what he's capable of by now.

443
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,330
Hauser was disillusioned with
the government before he disappeared,

444
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,980
and I wouldn't say we've done much to
win him over since he's been back.

445
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,610
When he was in quarantine,he was housed
in barracks 3.Same building as T.J. Kim.

446
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,410
An agitator.An organizer.
A radical.

447
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,260
Sounds like we have our second
member of the nova group.

448
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,980
Baldwin.

449
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,140
You're kidding me.
All right. I know.Put him through.

450
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,320
- Says he's wesley hauser.
- No way.

451
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,570
- Yeah,hello.
- How'd you like my apartment?

452
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,090
Well,to be honest,it felt a little
empty without you there.

453
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm on a tight schedule.
Lot to do before next week.

454
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,920
Sound like you have interesting plans,
so why don't we get together someplace,talk them over?

455
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,270
No more talking.
There's nothing to say.

456
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,520
Your time is ending.
Ours begins on october 19th.

457
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,210
come on,let me go.

458
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,310
Why'd you run when we asked
you about hauser,huh?

459
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,220
You two used to eat together in quarantine.
We've got it on camera.

460
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,740
So?The guy had a lot of good war stories.
Doesn't make us best friends.

461
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,920
So why did you run?

462
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,600
Because when I see ntac agents,
I run the other way.

463
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,010
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?

464
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,150
Turn around.
Turn around.

465
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,130
- We done here?
- Get out of here.

466
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,800
Call me sensitive,
but I felt like saying to him,

467
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,480
"we exposed the inhibitor.We saved your life."

468
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,790
You guys just don't really get it,do you?
It's not just that guy.

469
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,400
Every 4400
we've talked to today,they're scared of you,

470
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,640
or they don't trust you,or they hate you.

471
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,530
Look,I'm sorry,but the days when you could expect
friendly conversation from these people,they're gone.

472
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,280
You're the bad guys now.

473
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,810
Get used to it.

474
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,360
I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.

475
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,480
Since when are you an expert?

476
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,580
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility...

477
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,220
especially when she's trying to get
by on a teacher's salary.

478
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,360
- What are you going to name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.

479
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,520
- Is that okay?
- What's wrong,sweetheart?

480
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,210
Nothing,except...

481
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,640
I know marco's going to win,I'm going to come second,
and you're going to end up alone with no money.

482
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,500
Don't be jealous.
He's smarter than you,but mom likes you better.

483
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,170
So,uh,who's--
who's smarter than me?

484
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,600
Who knows?

485
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,090
I'm not even sure she knows exactly.

486
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,960
You know,in some ways,
she was better off on the promicin inhibitor.

487
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,410
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.

488
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,730
All she wants to do is record what
she sees in those notebooks.

489
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,790
It's like some kind of compulsion.

490
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,270
Well...
think about it for a minute.

491
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,500
Every morning,she wakes up and...
knows pretty much what's coming.

492
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,170
She's already lived the whole
day once in her head,

493
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,560
and by the time something actually
does happen,it's like a rerun.

494
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,310
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah. Try living one.

495
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,060
Hey,what about kevin burkhoff?

496
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,090
Maybe he can figure out a way for
maia to control her visions.

497
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,530
He is brilliant.

498
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,670
I don't say this about many people,
but he is smarter than me.

499
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,720
- I know you.
- Well,of course you do.It's diana skouris.

500
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,320
- You work at ntac.
- I'm not here on business.

501
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,070
I'm here about my daughter maia.

502
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,940
The precog.
What about her?

503
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,190
She's still 10,right?
She's not 65 now,is she?

504
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,860
Interesting guess.
Kind of wide of the mark,though.

505
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,550
Good.

506
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,440
Might as well come on in.

507
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,120
Thank you.

508
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,030
- Oh,sorry about the clutter.
- That's all right.

509
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,500
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.

510
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,040
Excuse me.

511
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,000
So...

512
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,910
your daughter.

513
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,020
What's troubling her?

514
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,080
OCTOBER 15

515
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,360
I'll let you do it.

516
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,580
I caused all this,right?

517
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,210
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.

518
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,250
- No...
- that's what you were thinking,wasn't it?

519
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
No,it wasn'T.

520
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,120
I don't want her to die either,
so I'll let you do it.I'll...

521
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,930
- I'll even shut my eyes.
- Isabelle...

522
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,850
I would never hurt you.

523
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,940
Why?

524
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,510
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.

525
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,020
We don't know that,and I won't
make a choice between the two of you.

526
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,940
"Won't" or "can't"?

527
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,070
Sorry.
I don't mean to invade anyone's space.

528
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,910
Oh,that's okay.
It's not my desk.

529
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,490
But it looks like you'll be here for
a while now,huh?

530
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,400
Assuming this place is still standing
on october 20th,yeah.

531
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Maybe we should talk to jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.

532
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,430
That's fine with me.

533
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,470
To tell you the truth,I could use a
little bit of a buffer zone.

534
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,230
This problem you're having with your daughter'S...

535
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,860
precog ability?

536
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,100
I keep wanting to give you my opinion,
but I don't want to intrude.

537
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,160
So you are...

538
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,210
listening to my thoughts.

539
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,300
You and baldwin.
I can't help it.

540
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,050
I try to tune you guys out,but every now
and then,something leaks through.

541
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,850
I'll try to keep that in mind.

542
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,400
You said you had an opinion about maia.
What is it?

543
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,770
When I first...

544
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,840
developed this thing of mine,
I was a basket case.You saw me.

545
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,210
I truly thought i was going insane,
so I fought against it,

546
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,720
and that just made it worse.

547
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,260
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me,

548
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,960
and then,slowly,I learned how to
take control of it.

549
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,020
Listen,your kid stops fighting,
and eventually,

550
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,560
it'll become like seeing or hearing
or any other sense.

551
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,440
She won't even think about it.

552
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,260
It's just a part of who she is.

553
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,500
That's how it worked for me,anyway.

554
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,160
Thank you.

555
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,400
Diana.We just got a call from the seattle
police.Someone down there read our apb.

556
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,870
They know exactly where hauser is.

557
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,890
You guys are lucky,actually.

558
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,320
In another day or two,we would have
buried him in potter's field.

559
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,800
- Buried who?
- Him.

560
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,980
I always read the apb memos when they
circulate in the police department.

561
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,330
Kind of a hobby.
Gets boring in here.

562
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,380
Anyway,there was a description of a
regimental tattoo on the memo for hauser.

563
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,000
82nd airborne.
"Death from above."

564
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,170
I remember it from a john doe they
brought in here three weeks ago.

565
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,890
This guy drowned in the harbor.

566
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,240
A lot of veterans have that tattoo.

567
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,900
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?

568
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.

569
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,670
Say hello to wesley hauser.

570
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,310
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before ryland was attacked.

571
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,320
Obviously,that wasn't him on the
phone the other day.

572
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,370
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?

573
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,010
For all we know,that could have been a plant.

574
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,490
Somebody wanted us distracted.

575
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,100
They deliberately put us on the trail
of some phantom member of the nova group.

576
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,840
I mean,how did we first find out about hauser?

577
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,960
T.J.'S old boyfriend.
He gave us the address.

578
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,300
No,he was thinking it.

579
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,010
At least,according to gary,he was.

580
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,840
Gary navarro put us onto wesley hauser.

581
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,900
Get in.

582
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,770
You lied to me,daniel.

583
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,980
You never said anything about killing people.

584
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,430
We were protecting you,shawn.

585
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,160
If we tell you in advance,you're culpable.

586
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,550
- What is she dohere?
- She's dying.She needs your help.

587
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,780
I told you,I don't want anything more
to do with you.

588
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,390
The nova group was supposed to protect us.
That's why I gave you money,daniel.

589
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,480
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!

590
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,340
We'll talk about your concerns later.
She's got a stomach wound,and it's infected.

591
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,240
She needs you right now,
or she's not going to make it.

592
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,120
Shawn,she's a 4400.

593
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,590
If we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?

594
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,900
Give me your hand.

595
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,480
What are you doing here?

596
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,390
You're awake.
Good.

597
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,530
It's important that you know it was me.

598
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,990
I'm the guy who killed you.

599
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,900
Med post.
Do you have a 20 on gary navarro?

600
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,860
Yeah,he just walked by.
Why?

601
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,410
- Get him!
- Hey! Stop!

602
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,750
Go. I'll check on ryland.

603
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,440
He's seizing.
He's bradying down.

604
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,340
I need a crash cart and ativan.
Find dr. Danoff.

605
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,100
Now!

606
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,750
Stay right there,gary.

607
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,690
Isabelle.
Isabelle!

608
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,160
Oh,god.
Somebody call an ambulance!

609
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,370
What's everybody standing around for?
Somebody call an ambulance!

610
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,590
They're on their way!

611
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,170
- Somebody call an ambulance--
- dad...

612
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,090
what am I?

613
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,180
It's miraculous,shawn.

614
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,290
I watch you heal someone,and...

615
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,560
it makes me wonder why they
hate us so much.

616
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,750
They hate us because you're killing them,
daniel.

617
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,680
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.

618
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,180
You make it sound like we acted out of
some sort of blood lust.

619
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,860
These were precise,tactical strikes,shawn,

620
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,030
and you and every other 4400 are
ultimately much safer because of them.

621
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,960
You killed people.That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

622
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,600
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center in case

623
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,550
the government ever came after us again.

624
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,790
It was a precaution.

625
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,230
And all we've done is taken
precautionary measures.

626
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,280
Shawn,do you think that because
their inhibitor program

627
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,110
was exposed that the government's
just going to leave us in peace?

628
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,610
No,they know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,

629
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,730
which increases their need to eliminate us.

630
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,840
So we strike first?

631
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,550
Is that it?

632
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,400
Is that what happens on the 19th?

633
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,090
Look,shawn,you do great work at
that center of yours.

634
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:32,240
You just focus on that.I don't want to
distract you.Knowledge can be a burden.

635
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,250
And thanks for helping T.J. Out.

636
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,770
You're a hero to your own people.
Never forget that.

637
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,380
Yeah.

638
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,210
It did not work,you know.

639
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,350
Ryland was O.D.'Ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.

640
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,310
He'll be awake within a couple of hours.

641
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,580
Well,I'm sure you're as
disappointed as I am.

642
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,110
Don't worry.
We'll get him.

643
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,530
Let's talk about wesley hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.

644
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,360
I liked wes.

645
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,210
He was 10 kinds of crazy,but his heart
was in the right place.

646
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,770
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.

647
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,940
After quarantine,he lived on the streets.

648
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,720
I used to visit him down at the docks.
You know,give him food,a little money.

649
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,550
So when did you decide to kill him?

650
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,990
Wes,he didn't need my help with that.

651
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,740
He drank about three bottles of mad dog a day.

652
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,310
One morning about a month ago,
I went down to see him,and...

653
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,710
I found him by the dumpster.

654
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,670
Dead.

655
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,470
And somewhere in the middle of your grieving
process,you figured he'd make a handy decoy.

656
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,260
Hauser wouldn't have minded.

657
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,430
XXXXXXXX Going back to his marine corps days.

658
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,840
So when I found him,I said a word
or two over his body,

659
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,910
and I pushed him into elliott bay.

660
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,200
So how long have you been working
with this nova group?

661
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,420
Did someone approach you,or was the
whole thing your idea?

662
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,830
Tell me...
you and this girlfriend of yours...

663
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,280
is it like a role-playing thing you get up to?

664
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,870
Or is she actually taking you into these...

665
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,190
I don't know.What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?

666
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,910
Oh,and this guy marco...

667
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,970
does he know that you're too...

668
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,140
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?

669
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,830
Done showing off?

670
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,810
Why don't you tell us what's
going to happen on october 19th?

671
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,090
I guess you're going to have
to find yourself another telepath.

672
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,190
Good luck with that.

673
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,460
So you got nothing out of him?

674
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,440
Well,he told us about hauser,but as far as the
nova goes,it's going to take time to break him down.

675
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,350
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.He knows what we're thinking.

676
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,700
- A little longer than usual.
- Okay,so it's not easy,

677
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,680
but gary navarro has a level-seven
security clearance.

678
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,000
We have to assume that he's been using it to
funnel national secrets to the nova group.

679
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,380
We need to know what he knows.
Now.

680
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,270
He'll talk.

681
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,100
Gary's been inside our heads for a year.
I think I know how to get inside of his.

682
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:11,840
Careful with this.

683
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,470
Matthew.

684
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,590
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple of weeks.

685
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,220
The nova group revised my calendar for me.

686
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,850
Wiped it clean,actually.

687
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,060
It's difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400

688
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,710
when some of them are boasting about
their body count.

689
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,940
I suppose.

690
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,210
How's lily?
Any improvement since I left?

691
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,530
- If anything,she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.

692
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,520
Isabelle?

693
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,340
She tried to kill herself this morning.

694
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,460
She jumped off the roof.

695
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,530
A few minutes later,she was walking
around like nothing happened.

696
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,250
I got to tell you,matthew...
I'm not going to lie.

697
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,260
I'm really glad you're back.

698
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,730
Hello,isabelle.

699
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,630
Hello. Who are you?

700
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,220
My name is matthew ross.

701
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,320
I work closely with shawn.

702
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,910
I'm an advisor to the 4400.
May I come in?

703
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,940
I understand there was an incident
this morning.

704
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,830
You attempted...
to harm yourself.

705
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,360
I see.

706
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,060
You had no right to do that!

707
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,690
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?

708
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,200
- No...
- well,I do.

709
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,460
I know everything about you,isabelle.

710
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,530
I know why you're here,and I know what
you're supposed to do.

711
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,510
Sit...

712
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,790
and I'll tell you a story.

713
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,220
You'll like it.

714
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,030
It's about your past,and it's about your future.

715
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,030
I know you went to a lot of
trouble to get this.

716
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,030
Thank you.
But?

717
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,970
I'm not sure i want to send maia
to a school that only teaches 4400s.

718
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,790
It sounds like a great way to get
her to withdraw even further from the world.

719
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,870
Look,just...

720
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,470
just pretend it's got nothing to
do with the 4400 for a second.

721
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,160
It's a good school.

722
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,150
You know,top-notch faculty,
the facilities are great,and it's all free.

723
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,700
The 4400 center picks up the whole tab.

724
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,730
They even have a class on how
to manage your abilities.

725
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,030
Just give me some time to think about it,okay?
It's a big step.

726
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,000
I was king of hoping dr.
Burkhoff would have...

727
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,850
I don't know,a magic pill or something.

728
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,690
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?

729
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:04,980
You know that promicin serum that
he invented that saved everybody?

730
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,560
Well,I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.

731
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,500
Well,he's a researcher,right?

732
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,140
He's probably injecting it into,
what,mice,guinea pigs?

733
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,360
The only animals i saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.

734
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,870
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself,do you?

735
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:25,610
That's ridiculous.I am not injecting
myself with the promicin serum.

736
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,710
Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

737
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:32,720
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

738
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,530
Dr. Burkhoff,I have to ask you this.

739
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,120
Have you stopped taking your medication?

740
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,950
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.

741
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,710
Once the course of treatment is finished,

742
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,900
I will have taught my body how
to produce promicin,

743
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,330
and then I will be the first
non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities.

744
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,760
The first of many.

745
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,870
You're talking about the next
step in human evolution.

746
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,120
- Do you think the world is ready for that?
- The world is never ready for change.

747
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,340
You have to force it on them.
Isn't that why the 4400 were brought back?

748
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,300
Isn't that why the future woke me up?

749
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,640
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude in--excuse me,but...

750
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,110
in a dump.

751
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,110
These are hardly sterile working conditions.

752
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,730
You could help me with that.
You have scientific background,right?

753
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,790
I have graduate degrees in microbiology
and epidemiology.

754
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,250
Good.

755
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,060
That'll be handy.

756
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,870
I need someone to monitor my progress...

757
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,010
as the changes...

758
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,410
continue.

759
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,950
Changes?

760
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,070
I think it's an exciting first step.
Don't you?

761
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,680
I was thinking,next time,we could make a
world where kyle never shot jordan collier,

762
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,720
never went to prison,the inhibitor
scandal never happened...

763
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,640
sounds nice...

764
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,250
although i have to tell you,at the moment,

765
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,290
I'm not really feeling the need to be
transported to some kind of fantasy world.

766
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:19,440
As long as this water stays hot,things
are a-okay with me right here in reality.

767
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,690
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.

768
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,200
I'll take a rain check.

769
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,730
I'm going to a seminar at
the 4400 center tomorrow.

770
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,670
It's about what we can expect
physically now that we're off the inhibitor.

771
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,780
Is everything okay?
I mean,you're not having any problems,are you?

772
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,800
No,I feel fine.
I feel great,actually.

773
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,750
Well,then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?

774
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,660
I don'T.I want to go.
I'm curious.

775
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,720
But alana,you never...

776
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,780
you never wanted to go to the center before.
Why start now?

777
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,030
I never felt the need to be around
other 4400s before.

778
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,540
Now you do?

779
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,460
It's just a seminar,thomas.

780
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,750
Yeah,okay.

781
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,370
I get it.

782
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,030
OCTOBER 16

783
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,680
Do you recognize those names?

784
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,780
They're 4400s,all of them foreign nationals.

785
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,600
Alessandro ortiz from venezuela.
Ismael namir from libya.

786
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,940
Chitra singh from indonesia.
They've all gone missing in the past year.

787
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,770
That's one year.

788
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,990
Now,that's about as long you've
worked for the nsa,isn't it,gary?

789
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:41,200
We checked your travel records.
You left venezuela two days before ortiz disappeared.

790
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,440
Same thing in libya,indonesia...
everyone on that list.

791
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,060
You were there,they went away.

792
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,240
What exactly did you do for the nsa,gary?

793
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:53,620
There's an arms race going on,isn't there?
Only now it's with 4400s.

794
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,490
These people,I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.

795
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,550
And the nsa couldn't stand by while foreign--
and potentially hostile--

796
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:04,940
governments developed,what,
human weapons of mass destruction?

797
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,680
Is this list complete?

798
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,050
'Cause I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

799
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,480
I did not kill anyone.

800
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,530
Oh,no,no,no,you just got the right
people in the right zip code.

801
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,900
Because you,you were living back home--

802
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,050
what did he say?
Oh,yeah--

803
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:22,090
"very comfortably" when the actual
dirty work was done.

804
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,240
And that's why you went across to
the nova group,isn't it,gary?

805
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,250
Because you just couldn't live with yourself.

806
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,440
The nsa told me that I was helping my country.

807
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,940
They didn't fill in the blanks.

808
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,580
I had to do that myself.

809
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,200
You felt used.

810
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,580
They made you a weapon against your own people.
So when did you figure it out?

811
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,300
- What's up?
- Who are these guys?

812
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,380
This is agent wood and dr. Boll of the nsa.

813
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,220
They've been brought in to help
expedite the interrogation.

814
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,950
Okay,first of all,no more sitting.

815
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,430
What's going on?
Brought in by who?

816
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,680
Gary navarro tried to kill me.
I made a phone call.

817
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,460
You should be in jail right now,dennis.

818
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,640
I still have a few friends,tom.

819
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,430
I had him talking.
I was making progress.

820
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,130
Not fast enough.

821
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,960
The members of gary's cell
know he's been taken.

822
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,440
They're already changing their plans.

823
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,960
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.

824
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,480
October 19th is three days away.

825
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,470
Yeah.

826
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:37,700
I know you find this hard to believe,
tom,but we're on the same side.

827
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,360
We have the same goal.

828
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,200
Those agents are tools.

829
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,180
Use them.

830
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,810
You're sitting in my spot.

831
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,760
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

832
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,500
There's room for two people to sit.

833
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,930
You got stalin,pol pot,and the marquis de sade?

834
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,750
Did you finish all the fun books?

835
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,890
Well,I'm interested in learning
more about evil.

836
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,330
Everybody's scared of me,so I thought,

837
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,000
"what if they're right?What if I'm bad?"

838
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,970
Why would you think that?

839
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,310
Sometimes I think i feel it inside of me,
like....

840
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,050
I could be capable of anything.

841
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,440
Everyone's capable of anything.

842
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,110
- Believe me,I know.
- How?

843
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,560
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah,of course I have.

844
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,890
Will you tell me about them?

845
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,370
Um,okay.

846
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,980
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?

847
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,950
Some people would call that a major betrayal.

848
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,210
A lot of hard feelings.

849
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,660
This man did much worse than that.

850
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,090
Well,I'm not a dictator,but

851
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,320
I've done the big kind of bad,too.

852
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,420
I can't say much about it,
but I gave some money to some people.

853
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,750
They used it for something really,
really wrong,and...

854
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,950
- I don't think that they're finished.
- Well,can you stop them?

855
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:17,740
I could turn them in,but the thing is
so far,they've only gone after bad people,

856
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,510
people that tried to kill me,
tried to kill all of us.

857
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,510
So if they've only gone after bad people,
then doesn't that make them good?

858
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,650
Maybe.

859
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,760
I don't know.

860
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,190
We're relating now,aren't we?

861
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,970
I read about this.

862
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,350
Yeah,we are.

863
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,460
How was it for you?

864
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,700
I liked it.

865
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,700
We talked.

866
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,160
It helped me understand good and evil.

867
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,200
According to you,you get to pick.
It's a choice.

868
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,260
I have it right,don't I?

869
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,580
Yeah,you do.

870
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,960
OCTOBER 17

871
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,420
I can't open my hand.

872
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,150
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.

873
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,870
Arthritis I can handle.

874
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,130
That feels good.

875
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,200
You're like a human heating pad.

876
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,260
I like that.

877
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,930
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.

878
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,500
Seriously,you better?

879
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,050
Yeah.

880
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,570
I've been trading emails with
somebody down at the mayo clinic.

881
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,380
He says we should go to sweden
and try this experimental treatment.

882
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,920
Here.

883
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,200
What's this?

884
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,450
Open it.

885
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,700
Can you believe that the air
force lets you do that now?

886
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,070
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an f-16.

887
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,270
It says here i get to take the controls.

888
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,610
Oh,I talked to the guy who was
in charge of the program,

889
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,330
and I told him about your
background as a pilot,

890
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,330
and he said he would let you
drive for 30 seconds.

891
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,630
Lily,I was a pilot in 1950.

892
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,090
That's why it's only 30 seconds.

893
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,100
Happy birthday,richard.

894
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,440
Thanks,but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.

895
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,060
Richard,I'm not going to be
here in six weeks.

896
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,460
That's not true.

897
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,140
Yes,it is.
You and I have both known for a while.

898
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,510
Richard,I'm dying.

899
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,350
Lily...

900
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,110
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.

901
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,580
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.

902
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,480
He'll keep you healthy.

903
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,840
He can'T.

904
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,380
Not anymore.

905
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,350
Are all these people 4400s?

906
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,970
Well,some are,and some just wish they were.

907
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,110
Why would they want that?

908
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,590
Good morning.
Welcome to the center.

909
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,480
Are you a 4400?

910
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,880
No,sweetie.
Are you?

911
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,780
Well,it is an honor to meet you.
Are you here to take our seminar?

912
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,390
No,we're here to look at the school.

913
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,600
We have an appointment with ms. Tobey.

914
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,520
I'll get her right away.

915
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,940
In the meantime,would you sign
in and register your ability?

916
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,520
We're creating a database.

917
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,290
You sure you want to do this?

918
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,240
I want to meet kids like me.

919
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,870
My name is alana mareva.

920
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,500
I have to admit,

921
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,710
I was pretty hesitant about
coming here today.

922
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,330
I was lucky.My life was pretty
much intact when I was returned.

923
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,580
I never thought much about being a 4400,

924
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,480
but when we all got sick,

925
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,180
and seeing everyone together in quarantine...

926
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,280
it made me feel like I had been
denying a part of myself,

927
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,270
so...

928
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:20,050
here I am,and I'm glad I came.

929
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,960
Anything you want to tell me?

930
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,340
Gary...

931
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,180
Let's end this.

932
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,900
I'll let you sit down.

933
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,350
Who contacted you first?

934
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,780
Just give me a name.

935
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,590
Oh,man.

936
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,370
So how about it?

937
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,960
October 19th is two days away.

938
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,320
Now,you got something to tell me or not?

939
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,920
Suit yourself.

940
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,980
One of our members has been compromised.
I have to assume he's going to give up my name.

941
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,550
So you call me?
For all I know,ntac is monitoring this line.

942
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,790
Well,we're going to have to go underground.
It's going to cost money.

943
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,400
You think I'm just going to
write you a check?

944
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,290
You can arrange it however you want.
I need it tomorrow.

945
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:49,450
I will see you at the usual
spot at the usual time.

946
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,040
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.

947
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,990
Talk to me,gary.
What do you got to say,man?

948
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,100
Talk to me!
Talk to me,gary.

949
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,380
I need names.

950
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,680
Give me a name!

951
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,830
- Talk to me,gary.
- Daniel armand!

952
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,090
Daniel armand.

953
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:41,120
Daniel armand.

954
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,400
Okay.

955
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,040
It's a start.

956
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,440
- Who else?
- That's it. He was my only contact.

957
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,260
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.

958
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,470
I'm sorry.I'm just having a hard
time believing that's true.

959
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,590
His pulse is tachy at 210.
Systolic's up to 240.

960
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,820
We need to lay off.

961
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,750
- We've only got one name.
- You can't put him under again.Not for a few hours.

962
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:08,160
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry.

963
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,060
He's my responsibility.

964
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,570
No,he's not. He's ours.

965
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:16,180
And he's done for the day.

966
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,380
It's okay,gary.

967
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,850
Okay,so he's back.

968
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,270
It's not like we weren't expecting this.

969
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,440
No.
Relax.

970
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,570
He won't get anywhere near isabelle.

971
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:36,350
We'll find him and we'll deal with it.

972
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,570
You made a mistake.
You've got the wrong person.

973
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,810
- I have to go.
- I don't think I do.

974
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,490
Those things you told me?
Those things you said i'm going to do?

975
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,270
That's not me.
I have a choice.

976
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,860
And I don't know who you are,
and I don't know how you think

977
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,710
you know so much about me,but you're wrong.

978
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,000
Isabelle...

979
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,820
I understand why you're having
trouble adjusting.

980
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,440
Growing up is hard.

981
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,570
But don't be angry at the messenger.
It's not my plan.

982
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:06,080
I'm just here to help facilitate.

983
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,990
To help you reach your full potential.

984
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,710
Think of me as a favorite uncle.

985
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,080
No.
No,I don't have any uncles.

986
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,870
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.

987
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,960
Fair enough.
You can always opt out.

988
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:24,710
You can even try saving your mother,
if you like.

989
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,220
How?

990
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,790
What is that?

991
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:46,470
Open it.

992
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,520
There aren't
a lot of things that'll hurt you,isabelle...

993
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,220
but that right there,that'll do the job.

994
01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:00,600
If you can't accept the fact that your life
is vastly more important than your mother's,

995
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,870
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.

996
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,710
And lily?
Who knows.

997
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,380
Maybe she'll wake up and be
a young woman again.

998
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,810
Will it really save her?

999
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,560
I don't know.
It's a gamble.

1000
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:21,720
But if you can't live with who you are,
then don'T.

1001
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,350
Sorry about that.

1002
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,290
Ah. Good.
I knew it.

1003
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,580
I knew I had a clean cup somewhere.

1004
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,230
Now,where are the filters?

1005
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,580
It's okay.
I don't need coffee.

1006
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,860
I swear I just saw them.
Do you mind if I just use paper towels?

1007
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,960
- Kevin,if I do this--
- "if" you do it?

1008
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:57,050
You're already doing it.
You're here,right?

1009
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:02,090
If I monitor you throughout this experiment,
I need you to know one thing--

1010
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:06,290
if it gets to a point where your
life is in danger,I am cutting this off.

1011
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,260
I will not stand by and watch you die.

1012
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,980
Well,I would hope not...

1013
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,340
because I'm too valuable.

1014
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,140
I think it's going to be fun.

1015
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,260
I haven't really...

1016
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:24,730
worked with anyone for quite some time.
I'm looking forward to it.

1017
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,580
Me too.

1018
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,990
So...

1019
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,950
want to draw some blood?

1020
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,090
OCTOBER 18

1021
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,150
Nina.

1022
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,470
We were just downstairs.
The guard on duty said wood signed gary out.

1023
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,910
Gary was transferred to an nsa-run facility.

1024
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,850
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.

1025
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,370
And someone at the pentagon
signed an order overriding us.

1026
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,470
Apparently,they feel we lack experience
in high-pressure interrogation.

1027
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,590
And who do you think put that
little bug in their ear?

1028
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,630
I don't know if it was ryland or not,
but we had our shot at navarro.

1029
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:03,660
Tomorrow is october 19th.We are a day
away from an announced terrorist attack.

1030
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,220
The nsa thinks they can get him to talk.

1031
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,050
So where are they taking him?

1032
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:10,770
- They didn't share that information.
- This is so wrong.

1033
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:15,120
This is the only place in the country that's
at least somewhat equipped to handle 4400s.

1034
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,600
Do you think that I didn't tell them that?

1035
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,110
They weren't interested.

1036
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,050
- Isabelle.
- Hi.

1037
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,190
May I come in?

1038
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,160
Are you going somewhere?
I saw dad putting luggage into his car.

1039
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,950
Oh,we're just going to try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.

1040
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,400
Do you want me to come with you?

1041
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,200
No,it's all right.
Thank you.

1042
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,080
Now,if there's anything that you need,
you talk to shawn.

1043
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,880
He'll be looking out for you.
Okay?

1044
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:08,230
And...

1045
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,790
I want to give you this.

1046
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,130
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.

1047
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,090
Her name was lily,too.

1048
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:26,400
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.

1049
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,080
I remember.

1050
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,690
I used to like to bite on it.

1051
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,090
And my finger,too.

1052
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:39,620
You can wear it if you want.I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.

1053
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,290
It doesn't fit me anymore,and...

1054
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:46,200
I'd hate to lose it.

1055
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,850
I'll keep it safe for you.

1056
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,200
I know you will.

1057
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,840
I'm sorry i have to leave so soon.
I...

1058
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,220
I wish we had more time together.

1059
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,760
- Well,when do you think you'll be back?
- It's hard to say.

1060
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,820
Goodbye,isabelle.

1061
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,630
Bye.

1062
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,400
Thank you very much.
I'll take her from here.

1063
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,630
Thank you.

1064
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,530
Okay...

1065
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,230
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?

1066
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,820
How'd it go over?

1067
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,270
Fine.I had it easy.
I got to lie.

1068
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,980
You're the one who has to tell her the truth.

1069
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,000
What's going on?

1070
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,240
What's happening?

1071
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,270
We'll get him.

1072
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,910
Funny,that's the exact same thing
navarro said about you.

1073
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,070
So far,he's wrong.

1074
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,000
He never should have been moved
in the first place.

1075
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,270
- There was no reason--
- there was every reason.

1076
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,800
You're too soft,tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.

1077
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,410
I had him,dennis!
You lost him!

1078
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,630
Sunset's in four hours.

1079
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,010
At this point,we can't even say with 100% certainty
that it's going to rise again in the morning,

1080
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:29,170
and the one guy who can tell us is gone.

1081
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:32,410
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.

1082
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,330
Yeah. I know.
You keep saying that.

1083
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,790
Hey,shawn.
You got something for me?

1084
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:51,420
Where's daniel?

1085
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,640
Busy. He sent me.

1086
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,020
No,no,no.
That's not how we work.

1087
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,240
Today it is.

1088
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,830
You can trust me.
You saved my life.

1089
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:04,220
I owe you.

1090
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:07,600
Come on.Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.

1091
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,680
Thanks.

1092
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:19,430
Listen,if there's ever anything you need--

1093
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,970
you sold us out.

1094
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,550
- You okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.

1095
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,640
I don't guess we'll be seeing
her in court any time soon.

1096
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,420
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.

1097
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,420
Seriously.You're a hero.

1098
01:40:58,340 --> 01:40:59,680
OCTOBER 19

1099
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:02,770
One minute to go.

1100
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:05,910
Just tell me one thing--

1101
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:08,020
are we as prepared as we can be?

1102
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,030
The entire country is on level-red
terror alert.

1103
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,070
All commercial air traffic has
been suspended for the day.

1104
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:15,890
The national guard has been
deployed to likely targets.

1105
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:18,650
"Likely targets."
Kind of a broad term.

1106
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,680
I wish T.J. Could have narrowed
that down for us.

1107
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:24,400
Well,me,too,but we have to keep
her sedated to inhibit her ability.

1108
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,960
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.

1109
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:31,750
So now we wait.

1110
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,710
Anyone else feel like they're
staring at a doomsday clock?

1111
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:50,470
Well,that's it.

1112
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,750
October 19th.

1113
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:56,910
Looks like the world's still here.

1114
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,800
For the moment,anyway.

1115
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,890
Oh,my god!

1116
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:23,200
What? What happened?

1117
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,170
It's the nova group.

1118
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:28,420
Certainly,"miracle" is an imprecise term,
but I'm not sure how else to describe it.

1119
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:32,520
To repeat,I'm broadcasting livefrom
the nubian desert north of khartoum,

1120
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:36,000
where,overnight,a thousand-acre
patchof barren sand

1121
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,520
has somehow been transformedinto
fertile wheat fields.

1122
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,250
Scientists are at a loss to explain
the conversion,

1123
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:45,530
but tests confirm that the wheat
is real and edible.

1124
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:49,670
There hasn't been food growing in that part
of the world since before the birth of christ.

1125
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:52,020
They make us all terrified,

1126
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:55,320
and then,rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.

1127
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,460
Our station has just received
a statement from the radical

1128
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:01,700
4400 organization known as the nova group,

1129
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:05,400
claiming responsibility for this morning'S
transformation.

1130
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,240
You are witnesses to the beginning
of a new era.

1131
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,260
What happens next is up to you.

1132
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:16,190
The 4400 can be mankind's greatest ally
or its most dangerous adversary.

1133
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:20,580
Don't kid yourself.It's an attack.
An act of aggression,anyway.

1134
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,820
They just showed everyonethat they
can change the world,

1135
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,590
and there's nota damn thing
we can do about it.

1136
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,440
Hello?

1137
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,920
I'm very disappointed in you,shawn.

1138
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,010
Daniel.

1139
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:58,230
I realize you're still a young man,
but I'm afraid i can't forgive you.

1140
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:24,290
To repeat,
I'm broadcasting live

1141
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:27,360
from the nubian desert
north of khartoum where,overnight...

1142
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:11,030
it's okay,kyle.
Daddy'S...

1143
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:13,750
daddy's here.
I'm right here.

1144
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,110
I'm right here.

1145
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,030
Just go to sleep.

1146
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,920
Hey. I'm tyler.

1147
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,890
Maia.

1148
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,240
lily...

1149
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:56,160
we are here.

1150
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:02,120
Hasn't changed much,
has it?

1151
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,020
No.

1152
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,470
We were so happy here.

1153
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:10,350
Just you and me and the baby.

1154
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:13,310
It was so much simpler.

1155
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,430
Would you like to head on inside?

1156
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,840
Not just yet.

1157
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:24,700
No,let'S...let's stay out here for a while.
It's so peaceful.

1158
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,430
Remember
when you went into labor?

1159
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:51,470
I could hardly get the car in gear.

1160
01:47:56,430 --> 01:48:00,940
But you gave me directions to the hospital.
How did you stay so calm?

1161
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,010
Lily?
