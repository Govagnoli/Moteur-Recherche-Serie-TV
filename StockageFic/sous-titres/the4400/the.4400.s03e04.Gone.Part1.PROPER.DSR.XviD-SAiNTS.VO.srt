1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,440
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,340
All at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,270
With no memory of where they've been

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,950
They haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,560
And some have returned with new abilities

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,850
All are trying to reconnect....

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,200
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,600
We're not a threat.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,300
We're salvation.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,700
The worldwill have to deal with us.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,400
Previously on the 4400...

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
this is isabelle.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,377
You are the stewards of the future.

14
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:52,867
Your daughter is the rosetta stone

15
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,900
for understanding what happened to the 4400.

16
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,600
Are you my mother?

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,500
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
The only way for you to live is for me to die.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
Don't you understand who you are,

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,400
what you're here to do?

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
P.I....

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
promicin inhibitor.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
We did it to them,tom.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,000
We made them sick.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
We are in a war.

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
This is a message from the nova group.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,000
The second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.

28
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,900
You think I'm just going towrite you a check?

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
I need it tomorrow.

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,100
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked right in here and attacked the place.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there all with abilities?

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,200
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
in case the government ever came after us again.

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
You lied to me,daniel.

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,900
You never said anything about killing people.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,700
You sold us out.

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.

38
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,900
You're a hero.

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm tyler.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,300
Maia.

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Where are we?

42
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,300
This is where they altered us...

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,700
gave me the ability to create the world we've
been living in for the last eight years.

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
People see her,they see a woman,

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
and they might forget that,inside,

46
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,500
she's just a little girl.

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
You are ticklish.

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Cut it out.

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
It bothers me.

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
It bothers you?

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,700
It didn't seem to bother you a few minutes ago.

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,900
I could hold you like this.

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh,you could hold me like this?

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Really?

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,900
What about that?

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,599
don't answer it.
Don't answer.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,300
I have to.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm still the boss around here.

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
Richard,hey.

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Sorry to bother you.

62
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,400
I was waiting for you down in your office.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh,you know...

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,300
yeah,sorry.

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I'm just running a little late this morning.

66
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,100
What's up?

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Before lily...

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,600
um,before she passed,

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
The healing work you do was really
important to her.

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,500
I remember.

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm glad to have you aboard.

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
What do you need?

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,700
A better head for numbers.

75
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,400
I've been trying to decipher these
financial reports.

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
There's some pretty big cash payments.

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,500
You signed the transfers.

78
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,900
I figured you might remember what they were for.

79
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,600
no idea.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm sorry,no idea.

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,500
Just checking.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
See you soon.

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,700
Maybe we should tell him.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
No,no,I don't think so.

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,500
We just...

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,900
we've just got to be more careful
from now on,okay?

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
Okay.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Thank you for doing this,thomas.

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,100
I know an open house at the center
isn't your favorite sunday activity.

90
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
Hey,I love a good barbecue.

91
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,390
You've been spending a lot of time here.

92
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,200
If this place is important to you,

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,800
it's important to me.

94
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,279
I don't believe you,

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,100
but I love you for saying it,

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,800
and don't be nervous.

97
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Everyone here's going to love you,too.

98
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
So help me out here,tom.

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
You say you love alana,

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
and yet she's a 4400,

101
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,100
and you're an ntac agent.

102
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I mean,if I were you,

103
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,700
and I really loved her,

104
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
well,I'd quit that job.

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,200
First of all,you're not me.

106
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,900
You don't know anything about me.

107
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
You don't know anything about this relationship,

108
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,400
and frankly,I doubt you know much about ntac.

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,900
Well, you did almost kill us all.

110
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Thanks for the input,ryan.

111
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,900
Nice chatting with you.

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I am so sorry,thomas.

113
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
He's usually not that rude.

114
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
We've been here an hour.

115
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
I've had four conversations like that.

116
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,800
You think we can call it a day?

117
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,500
Alana?

118
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,900
I didn't realize your thomas was tom baldwin.

119
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,800
Remember me?

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
Heather tobey.

121
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,123
Nice to see a friendly face.

122
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,200
How are you?

123
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
I couldn't be better.

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Tom was my hero.

125
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,300
you mean heather was one of your assignments?

126
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
about eight months ago.

127
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
That's when I first got my ability .

128
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,700
Heather,you seem great.

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you up to?

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,700
I teach at the school here now.

131
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
It's a good match,huh?

132
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
Finally found a place where they won't run me
out on the rails for being a 4400,

133
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,370
and now alana and i are going to be
working together.

134
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Isn't that cool?

135
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I've been offered a job working with
the children at the school.

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
But I haven't decided if I'm going to take it yet.

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
I blew the surprise,didn't I?

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,900
So help me out here.

139
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Who's amy again?

140
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,400
Is she a 4400?

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Everyone in my class is a 4400.

142
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
She wants me to come over tomorrow.

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,700
It's not a huge deal.

144
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
Oh,it's not?

145
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,600
Well,I guess when you put it like that,

146
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,015
then there's no way i can say no.

147
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:54,779
Where's your sweater?

148
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,097
I left it upstairs.

149
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:56,741
Quickly run and get it.

150
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:57,810
It's freezing by the water.

151
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,500
We're going to miss the ferry.

152
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
You're going to forget me.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,300
Excuse me?

154
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,500
You're going to forget me.

155
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,900
I saw it.

156
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,229
Maia,do you mind explaining that,

157
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,500
because,frankly,it sounds a little creepy.

158
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,000
It's okay.

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
It's not your fault.

160
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,700
Maia, listen to me.

161
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,600
I would never forget you.

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,900
Not ever.

163
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Come on,you know that,don't you?

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll be right back.

165
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Okay.

166
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Maia,come on.

167
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,188
Come on,sweetie,

168
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,900
we're going to miss the boat,literally.

169
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,500
Maia,come here right now.

170
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,100
Mommy,it's okay.

171
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,154
-It's fine--
-who the hell are you?

172
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,200
How did you get in here?

173
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm so sorry.

174
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,374
I didn't mean to upset you.

175
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,900
I was just knocking on your door
when maia came upstairs.

176
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
It's so great.

177
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,300
Tell her.

178
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
Tell me what?

179
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,600
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.

180
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,300
Sara rutledge.

181
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm maia's sister.

182
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,001
It's Lemon.

183
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,400
He was my dog.

184
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,500
I know.

185
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,600
He slept on your bed,every night,

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,300
right until he died.

187
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,100
You really lived in my house?

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
22 white oak lane,crescent city.

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,780
My room was at the top of the steps.

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,300
I know.

191
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,600
It was always your room.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,100
Mom and dad kept it all the same,just for you.

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
They missed you so much.

194
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,500
Maia,I need you to give me some time alone
with sara.

195
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,100
Did daddy teach you to play poker?

196
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,900
We played for tootsie rolls.

197
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,000
Maia...

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,300
I think your mom needs a word with me,sweetie.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,042
I didn't mean to sandbag you.

201
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:08,000
I was going to leave a note.

202
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,400
I haven't tried to find you for years. 

203
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,400
Every phone number out of date,

204
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,100
every letter comes back "return to sender."

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,500
Guyana,the ivory coast?

206
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
I've been hard to find.

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
"Hard to find". I even knew if you were alive or dead.

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,500
Which,I'm guessing,is...

209
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,900
is why you never told maia about me.

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
I'm sorry,

211
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,200
what was I supposed to say?

212
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
"Sweetheart, you have an older sister,

213
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,800
"but it doesn't seem like she's terribly
interested in meeting you?"

214
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,700
I should have called first.

216
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,136
I just felt like i needed to do this in person.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
I just want to know her.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
That's all.

219
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
You think it's that easy?

220
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,100
There are a lot of people who would do anything to get close to a 4400.

221
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Until you can prove to me that you are
who you say you are,

222
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,300
you're not seeing my daughter again.

223
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
I understand.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm willing to take a dna test.

225
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,300
It's a good start.

226
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
You didn't even tell me you were thinking
about teaching,

227
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
that the possibility existed.

228
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
To be honest,I was avoiding it.

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
I know how you feel about the center.

230
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,070
No, I'm fine with the center.

231
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:25,900
They're not fine with me.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
What about your gallery?

233
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
I can still do all the buying,

234
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
and tina can handle sales.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,400
Okay,I'm sorry if this seems just-- sudden.I...

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,100
I told them about my ability at the center,

237
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
and they thought they could use it at the school.

238
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,100
You're going to use your ability?

239
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,108
Don't you think that's why we came back here
with these gifts?

240
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,640
To help other people?

241
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,425
Yeah, Yeah.
No,it sounds great.

242
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,815
I just didn't think that...

243
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,550
I mean,does it even work with other people?

244
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
I did an experiment with heather.

245
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,200
We went to paris for lunch.

246
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't worry,

247
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,200
I don't think my batteries run out.

248
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,200
I'll save my best work for you.

249
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,500
I promise.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,500
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our...

251
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,200
experiment,I guess you'd call it.

252
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,900
We've never tried a healing this large,

253
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,300
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Before we begin,

255
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,700
I'd like to say that this foundation was
started by my late wife,lily tyler.

256
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm proud to be carrying on her work.

257
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,700
She's the reason why we're all here today.

258
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,600
her,and the man i'm about to introduce to you...

259
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,100
shawn farrell.

260
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Thank you.

261
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay

262
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,500
,first off,

263
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,800
kids,

264
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I promise this is not going to hurt.

265
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,700
listen,I'd like to ask everyone here a favor.

266
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
When you leave here today--

267
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,400
and you will be leaving the hospital today--

268
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,000
please tell anyone that asks

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
that a 4400 made you better,

270
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,300
Made you children better.

271
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,800
because we're not bogeymen.

272
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,200
We're here to help.

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,300
So...

274
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
let's get this thing started.

275
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Traitor!

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
You betrayed your own kind.

277
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,100
Next time it won't be paint!

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You okay?

279
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,742
Yeah.

280
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
It's in her file.

281
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Maia's parents had a baby five years after
she disappeared,

282
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,800
and her name was sara.

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,300
so it is possible.

284
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,400
No word at all for two years,

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
and then she just shows up?

286
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,400
You think she's the real deal?

287
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,800
I don't know,maybe.

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,500
What does your gut tell you?

289
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,400
it tells me that she's not going to see
maia again

290
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,600
until the dna tests comes back.

291
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,700
Smart gut.

292
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Her name is lindsey hammond.

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,100
She disappeared on november 23,1979.

294
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,800
You know,just once,

295
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
I wish a 4400 would smile for their picture.

296
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Is that too much to ask?

297
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Since her return,

298
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
she's been living with her stepfather.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Until yesterday,that is.

300
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
What,she's missing?

301
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
her stepfather thinks she ran away.

302
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,000
Take a drive out to her house,

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
see if we need to be worried.

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
That just came in.

305
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,400
The attack at the hospital this mornig
Wasn't random.

306
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
Somehow you've become a target of the nova group.

307
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,600
Any idea why?

308
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,600
Two months ago...

309
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,800
someone called me.

310
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,600
They were trying to raise money to start
a defensive wing of the 4400.

311
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,000
I made a couple of contributions.

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You gave money to the nova group?

313
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Shawn,they murdered half a dozen people.

314
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,800
That was after.

315
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Do you really think i would have given them money

316
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
if I thought that they were going to hurt anybody?

317
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,200
When they came back asking for more,

318
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
I said no.

319
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
You got the money from the foundation,didn't you?

320
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
That's what all those signatures were for.

321
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,900
You diverted money from my wife's foundation
to a terrorist group?

322
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,200
Richard,it was a mistake.

323
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,900
I know that.

324
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
Don't you think I know that?

325
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,500
I'll serve to you.

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,800
We have to try to keep it going for
as long as we can.

327
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Okay?

328
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,600
Maia...

329
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,100
where's maia?

330
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,000
She's at a friend's house--

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,700
a girl from the class. Why?

332
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,200
Preliminary dna came back.

333
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,900
Negative match.

334
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Sara isn't maia's sister.

335
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,800
Where's maia?

336
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
They're in the yard.

337
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
I-is everything okay?

338
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
Maia!

339
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
She left.

340
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Where did she go?

341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,700
She went with that lady, her sister.

342
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
Her picture's already on the wire.

343
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
An amber alert's been issued.

344
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,200
We'll find her,diana.

345
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I know we will.

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.

347
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
We're monitoring every toll booth,

348
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
every intersection we can.

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
If sara shows up on any of them,

350
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
we can be there in minutes.

351
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,600
You're going to keep an eye on things
yourself,right?

352
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,200
you got it.

353
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,300
Okay.

354
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Tom.

355
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
What did the lab say?

356
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,700
Nothing good.

357
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,900
They ran the fingerprints from your apartment,

358
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
and the dna samples against every known database.

359
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,000
No names came up.

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,700
So she has maia.

361
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,600
We have no idea who she is.

362
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,500
No.

363
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,500
She said i was going to forget her.

364
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,800
Mom really kept my room just like I left it?

365
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Sure she did.

366
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,100
She always believed that you were going
to come home.

367
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Maia,can I ask you a question?

368
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Do you see the future more clearly since
you stopped taking the inhibitor?

369
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,300
Well...

370
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
at first,I couldn't control it.

371
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
I thought i was going crazy,

372
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
but now i can see the future,

373
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,800
more when I want to.

374
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,900
It doesn't really sneak up on me anymore.

375
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
Not much,anyway.

376
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,390
That's great.

377
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,975
You're learning to focus your ability.

378
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,900
What if I asked you to predict something
right now?

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Wait.

380
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,100
We can go now.

381
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,000
You are a very special girl.

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,300
What do you think?

383
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,100
This is your house?

384
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,700
I bought it so I can stay in seattle.

385
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
We've spent enough time apart,

386
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
don't you think?

387
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Come on.

388
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Let me show you the inside.

389
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
There's a surprise.

390
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh my gosh.

391
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,000
It's just like my old room.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
I told you mom kept it the same.

393
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,100
Else how would I know?

394
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Sorry to interrupt--

395
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,100
hoping i could have a word?

396
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,500
Matthew...

397
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,300
come on in.

398
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,500
What's on your mind?

399
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,200
I was brought into this organization
by jordan collier.

400
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
I didn't always know what he had
in mind for it,

401
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,600
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.

402
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Six months after i came aboard,he died.

403
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
My new boss was a 19-year-old boy.

404
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
This is about shawn?

405
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,600
He's overwhelmed,richard.

406
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Running this center requires substantive
decisions,

407
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,100
decisions that he's not qualified to make.

408
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
Now,you,on the other hand,

409
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,700
you were an officer.

410
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
You led men into battle--

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
stop.

412
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Shawn runs things here.

413
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,400
I am not interested in a palace coup.

414
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
I am not talking about getting rid of him.

415
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm talking about power sharing.

416
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,500
The two of you make decisions together.

417
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
It's a way of helping him,

418
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,400
giving him the benefit of your experience.

419
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,790
This is all very flattering.

420
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm not trying to flatter you.

421
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm trying to keep this movement alive.

422
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,700
Think about it.

423
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
And before you say no,

424
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,400
I want you to tell me,

425
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,900
could you,under any circumstances,

426
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,700
see yourself inadvertently funding
a terrorist attack?

427
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
Look familiar?

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,500
Maia's been drawing it a lot the last few days.

429
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Are you sure?I mean,it's all through
the margins of her journals.

430
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
I've never seen it before,

431
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
but she likes butterflies.

432
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
It might just be a doodle.

433
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,900
Did you find anything else,

434
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,600
anything we can use?

435
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,200
It's hard to say.

436
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I mean,it's all stream of consciousness.

437
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
You know,predictions about big events
right next to tiny things in her everyday life,

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
and there's no dates.

439
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I did find out how I'm going to die.

440
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,900
that was interesting.

441
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,400
Oh,don't worry.

442
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,100
It's actually kind of cool.

443
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
,she did mention a friend's house.

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Just referred to the mom,though,mrs. Paspalis.

445
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,900
Amy paspalis?

446
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
That's the house she was taken from.

447
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Great,show us that page.

448
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Spooky.

449
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I could spend the rest of my career
working on these things.

450
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,700
Come on,marco,just...

451
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
here.

452
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,861
Mom is coming to pick me up for Mrs Paspalis's House.

453
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,500
But I'm already gone."

454
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm in a circle with tyler downing."

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Tyler downing?

456
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
Isn't he a 4400?

457
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,900
He goes to school with maia.

458
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,620
I told you,
I didn't do anything to maia.I swear!

459
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,740
Look,nobody thinks
that you did anything.

460
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,040
I just need you
to try and remember.

461
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,870
Now,did she ever talk to you
about a circle?

462
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,650
Did she ever mention having visions about the two of you

463
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,970
no,I said already 10 times.
I'm not lying--

464
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,350
ma'am,I know you're worried about your kid.

465
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,930
You're scaring the crap out of my brother.

466
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,210
Diana...

467
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,870
there's nothing here.
There's no sign of maia or the woman.

468
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,120
"I'm in the circle with tyler downing."
Tyler's here,so where is maia?

469
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,030
I don't know.Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.

470
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,730
Is it a street? Barnaby circle?
There's a circle park--

471
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,460
well,we need to check them all,
because she's trying to tell me how to find her.

472
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,030
sara...

473
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,130
is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?

474
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,470
Sara?

475
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,830
Sara,the door won't open.

476
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,230
Sara?

477
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
You can yell
all you want.

478
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,940
She won't come.
She never does.

479
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,780
Who are you?

480
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,610
I'm lindsey.

481
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm a part of her collection.

482
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,790
We all are.

483
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,120
Now you are,too.

484
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,050
All of us are 4400s.

485
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,880
What is she
going to do to us?

486
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,620
Sell us to the highest bidder,
do experiments,I mean,who knows?

487
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,420
It doesn't matter.

488
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,800
We're not going to let it come to that.

489
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,250
Hello?

490
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,960
That was incredible.

491
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,250
Hi.

492
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,710
Oh,hi,thomas.I didn't hear you
come in.

493
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,410
Any word about maia?

494
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,690
Sorry to invade your house,tom.
Alana and i were just practicing.

495
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,930
I think I might take that job at the school.

496
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,550
Heather and I were just trying something.

497
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,720
Don't be shy about it.

498
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,640
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.

499
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,920
We just watched richard nixon fly away
from the white house after he resigned.

500
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,270
That's remarkable,huh?

501
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,880
Well,alana's an amazing woman.

502
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,480
She certainly is.

503
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,170
Are you all right,thomas?

504
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,380
Fine.I'm just...

505
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,990
I'm just worried for diana.

506
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,130
She's strong,
and so are you.

507
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,890
After heather leaves, you want to me to take you somewhere.

508
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,040
it might calm you down some.

509
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,670
No,I think I'm just going to
go to sleep,

510
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,580
hit the investigation fresh
in the morning.

511
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,240
So things are going well
between you and shawn?

512
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,050
Yeah,I think so.
We're having lots of sex.

513
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,090
Has he said
"I love you" yet?

514
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,160
No.

515
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,500
Do you think he should have?

516
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,890
Try this.

517
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,600
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.

518
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,580
Men can do things with their bodies
entirely unrelated to their hearts and minds.

519
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,290
Shawn likes me.
It's real.

520
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,120
Good.

521
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,090
Shawn's going to be having
a difficult time these next few days.

522
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,580
He's going to have
some decisions to make.

523
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,990
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.

524
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,260
You want me to use him?

525
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,180
Use him?

526
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,930
What does that even mean?
You're getting close to shawn,right?

527
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,280
So he'll value your advice.

528
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,170
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.

529
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,050
I guess.

530
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,120
- What do you want me to say to him?
- Just the truth.

531
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,350
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.

532
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,020
It's not a sign of weakness.
It's a display of strength.

533
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,700
Wear that.

534
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,710
Hey,kid...

535
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,420
you have to try
to be quiet,okay?

536
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,570
I just want to go home.

537
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
We all do,but crying is not
going to help.

538
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,450
Listen,we can do stuff.
They can'T.

539
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,610
That's why they want us,
but maybe we can use it against them.

540
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,040
Maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.

541
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,860
Everyone,tell me
what you can do,okay?

542
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,390
My sister and me,

543
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,850
we can make water move.

544
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,480
Back and forth.Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.

545
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,500
- Diffusion.
- Yeah.

546
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,950
We have to be together to do it,though.

547
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,800
What about you,kid?

548
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,760
I do stuff with electricity.
Currents.

549
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,090
I can make machines
in my kitchen stop working.

550
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,970
Okay,good,
that will come in handy.

551
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,140
I can see things,

552
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,450
things that are going to happen.

553
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,210
Really?
That's awesome.

554
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,800
Can you tell if they're going to
keep us here?Are they going to let us go?

555
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,440
Come on,tell us.

556
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,780
We're not going to be here long.

557
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,240
Why,do we get to go home?

558
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,450
I don't think so.

559
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,940
Sorry I asked.

560
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,570
Listen,I don't know
about the rest of you,

561
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,800
but I'm going to try to figure out a way
to get us out of here.

562
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,400
So are you guys up for it?

563
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,550
No,let me go!
Stop! Let me go!

564
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,340
Stop it!
Let me go!

565
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,570
Help me!
Let me go!

566
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,804
Help me !
Let me go!

567
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:56,804
Help!

568
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,896
Help me!
Let me go!

569
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,741
No!

570
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,750
Tyler downing wasn't home when his sister
got back from her waitressing shift last night.

571
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,160
My god,that's the third
4400 kid missing.

572
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
No,try five.

573
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,680
Olivia and duncan germaine's parents thought they
went on a camping trip with their youth group.

574
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,050
Turns out they never showed.

575
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,230
Tom,update me here.
What are we doing to find this woman?

576
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,120
Well,maia's journal said
she was inside the circle with tyler downing.

577
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,340
We've checked out every street
with the name "circle" in it.

578
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,240
Skyline circle park, circle theater
on first hill. And there's nothing yet.

579
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,210
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.

580
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,990
We've already looked.

581
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,980
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in denny park.Maybe there.

582
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,890
It's over here.

583
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,780
Hey,I thought
you could use a jolt.

584
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,390
Thanks.

585
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,050
Didn't get
much sleep last night.

586
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,440
Any,actually.
This helps.

587
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,340
You were up all night?

588
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,570
You should go lie down
in the theory room for an hour.

589
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,550
Tom...

590
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,810
diana,
you're all right?

591
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,870
Look.

592
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,470
"I'm in the circle..."

593
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,020
I don't believe this.

594
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,900
I tell you the truth...

595
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,420
and you use it
to kick me out.

596
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,610
No,shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.

597
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,300
You've got an impossible job.

598
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,220
Jordan collier left me in charge
of this place.

599
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,290
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.

600
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,380
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.

601
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,130
The center has a board of directors,
shawn,

602
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,310
and collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.

603
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,430
They approved it because that's what
jordan wanted,matthew.

604
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,400
Frankly,if jordan was here,
his thoughts on succession might change

605
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,010
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the united states government.

606
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,750
You've made yourself,and this place,
a target for terrorists.

607
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,560
Shawn...

608
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,550
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,

609
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,100
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.You need help.

610
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,920
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.

611
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,520
- I am.
- Really?

612
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,430
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.

613
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,750
Tyler,you have to talk to us.

614
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,569
No.

615
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,840
If we get out of the house,
can you make it so their cars can't start?

616
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,210
No,I'm not helping.

617
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,070
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl? They took her away.

618
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
- I don't want to go away.
- You will.

619
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
We all will if we don't do something.

620
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,790
Lindsey...

621
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,450
lindsey,are you okay?

622
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,430
Who are you?

623
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,500
What did they do to you?

624
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,000
Maia,do you want to come with me,please?

625
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,040
No.

626
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,600
It's okay,sweetie,it's not so bad.I promise.

627
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,650
Help!

628
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,270
Tyler! Duncan!Please!

629
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,040
Somebody help me! Help!

630
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,350
Seattle pd has the south edge.

631
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,580
We'll take center and work east.

632
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,860
It'd be nice if I knew what we were looking for.

633
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,980
A message.

634
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,250
A sign.

635
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,334
Anything.

636
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh...

637
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:25,200
do you like this?

638
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You're seriously asking?

639
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,710
I knew you would.

640
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,360
I picked it out just for you.

641
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,690
Green's your favorite color,isn't it?

642
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,600
I can tell.

643
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,180
I know you now.

644
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,930
Isabelle.Isabelle...

645
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,300
I'm not really ready for another
round right now,okay?

646
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,800
What are you so worried about?

647
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,330
If you don't want to share your job,don't.

648
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,060
What are you talking about?

649
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,000
I can do things,shawn.

650
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,341
Lots of them.

651
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,720
I figure out more every day.

652
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,080
If you want to keep your job,you can.

653
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,070
I can make it happen.

654
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,090
You can do whatever.

655
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,570
Who's going to say different?

656
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,320
Thanks,I guess,

657
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,920
but,uh...

658
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,950
just hold off on the air strikes,okay?

659
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,050
We're talking about your dad
and matthew here.

660
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,160
It's just an argument.

661
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,880
They're not the enemy.

662
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,750
Besides...

663
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,010
they do have a point,don't they?
I did screw up.

664
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,110
Okay.

665
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,010
Just so you know,it's your call.

666
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,280
Drink this.

667
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,360
It'll make you feel better.

668
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,610
You're frightened.

669
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,920
It's all right,I understand,
but you don't have to be.

670
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,300
We're not going to hurt you.

671
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:08,390
Soon,you won't even be worried anymore,
I promise.

672
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,890
These are just to relax you.

673
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,410
They'll help you get ready.

674
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,360
Now,drink up,okay?

675
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,170
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.

676
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,650
No.

677
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,370
Maia...

678
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,720
They're doing it.They're helping.

679
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,800
We'll take dexter south,swing around
for another pass.

680
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,660
Wait,tom. Stop. Stop!

681
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,040
What?

682
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,330
Those butterflies.

683
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,780
There 're in Maia'journals.

684
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,550
She's here.

685
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,540
Maia...

686
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,970
what is going on?

687
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,870
Don't move!

688
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,720
Please.

689
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,810
Please,this house is for sale.

690
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,510
All the valuables are gone.

691
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,360
Is this a dream?

692
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,330
No,honey.

693
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,240
Remember the first time you were
taken away from your parents?

694
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,250
This is where we brought you.

695
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,800
No.

696
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,620
This isn't real.

697
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,510
Yes,it is.

698
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,830
We've brought you back.

699
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,350
You've been here ever since you
walked through the front door of my house.

700
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,250
You're in the future.

701
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,500
We had to bring you here,maia,
you and your friends.

702
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,060
We need your help.

703
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:17,688
That will be over soon.

704
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
Please, let me go.

705
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:22,866
I want to go home.

706
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,373
And i'm afraid you can't

707
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,173
You're too important.

708
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,558
Sweetheart, the experiment we tried is failing

709
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,739
There's been too much interference

710
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,130
The 4400 haven't changed the timeline.

711
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,430
The catastrophe,it's still coming.

712
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,530
We've found a way to fix it.

713
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,810
You and your friends,

714
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,070
you're going to save us all.

715
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,780
We found it all.

716
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,750
The circle,

717
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,870
the butterflies...

718
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,850
she's here.

719
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,020
I mean,she has to be here.

720
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,450
Come on,I'll take you home.

721
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,750
Here.

722
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,090
Sign here.

723
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,370
Thank you,shawn.

724
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,310
I know this wasn't an easy decision.

725
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:47,431
Well..

726
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,760
We all want the same things, right?

727
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,270
you're a good man,shawn.

728
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,100
It's an honor to be working with you.

729
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,640
Why are you giving this to me?

730
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,170
It's a thank you.

731
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,760
You did well.

732
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,310
Everything went smoothly with shawn.

733
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,000
I disobeyed you,matthew.

734
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,960
I told shawn he should keep his job.

735
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,210
I disobeyed you,and you know what?

736
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,960
Nothing happened.

737
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,390
There wasn't an earthquake.

738
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,780
I didn't melt.

739
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,600
I used to be scared of you,

740
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,010
but I don't think you have any
power over me at all,do you?

741
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,790
I didn't think so.

742
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,810
I'll do my own shopping from now on,okay?

743
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,330
Okay,sweetheart,we're ready to begin.

744
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,770
Don't cry.

745
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,400
You and the other children we took,

746
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,840
we tested your abilities,
and you are so special.

747
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,270
That's why you were chosen.

748
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,100
Now...

749
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,760
here's what's going to happen.

750
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,530
We're going to put you all back--

751
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,740
not the same year we took you from,
but earlier,much earlier.

752
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,230
We calculated wrong the first time.

753
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,280
We have to try again.

754
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,060
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.

755
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
I don't care.

756
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,590
I don't want to go anywhere.

757
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,640
I want to stay with my mom.

758
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
I know.It's hard.

759
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,870
I can make the pain go away.

760
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,010
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother,

761
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,980
marco,and your friends.

762
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,610
Please don'T.

763
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,930
They'll forget you,too.

764
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,320
It's better this way.

765
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,690
There'll be no sorrow,no pain,no loss.

766
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,810
As far as the world is concerned,

767
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,530
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1946 and was never found.

768
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,390
That's a lie.

769
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,440
My mom won't ever forget me.

770
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,950
She will.

771
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,890
It's happening already.

772
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,210
Now...

773
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,520
just lie still.

774
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,630
All the hope we have rests with you.

775
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,560
No...

776
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,800
don't do it,please.

777
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,430
Mommy!
