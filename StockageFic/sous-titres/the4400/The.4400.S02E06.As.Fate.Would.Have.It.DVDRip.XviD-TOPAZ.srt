1
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:40,359
We are not a threat.

2
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,723
We are salvation.

3
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:44,243
The world will have to deal with us...

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,265
Previously on the 4400...

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,465
You know those visions that Maia used to have?

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.

7
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:53,965
How long have you known?

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary.

9
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,700
You're one of those 4400 guys, huh?

10
00:00:58,735 --> 00:00:59,665
One day.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,950
All of this will be yours.

12
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:02,200
But you're not going anywhere.

13
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,165
Whatever you do, Shawn...

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,300
... don't reveal your healing ability.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,950
Because if you heal one of them...

16
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,400
... you'll have to heal them all.

17
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm blacking out.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,165
If you're losing chunks of time.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,565
You should talk to your dad about it.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,200
What's he going to do.
Turn me over to NTAC medical?

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,500
Can I help you?

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,700
Heidi, it's mommy.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,900
Who?

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,700
That's okay, sweetie, I got it.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,400
She's my daughter.

26
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:24,465
She doesn't know that.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,150
She thinks Carol is her mother.

28
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:27,892
Brian, look, I need your help.

29
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,565
Richard. He's been arrested.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,165
Hello, Richard.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,500
I want you to come home.

33
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:35,465
If I'm lying.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,300
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,765
If Isabelle accepts me.

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Well, then I can offer you and Lily
and the child a new life.

37
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,000
Let her judge me.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Hush-a-bye

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Hush-a-bye

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Go to sleep little baby

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,100
When you wake I'll give you cake

42
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:09,600
And all the pretty little horses

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And go to sleep-y little baby

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,965
Who's a special girl?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Is Isabelle a special girl? Is she?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,100
Come here.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,165
Look at him with Isabelle.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,600
This keeps up, we're going to have
to start calling him "Uncle Jordan".

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,500
There's something so wrong about that.
Isn't there?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,600
A week ago.
He was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her.

51
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:37,000
- And now it's like...
- They've bonded.

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,800
She's really taken to him.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Is that the couple of the hour?

54
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,665
Hi.

55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,400
Richard, what's up, man?

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,900
It's good to see you.

57
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,300
Look at you.
You look great. You look great.

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
So how long do you guys think you're going to be staying?

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
We're not sure.

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,000
Collier said we could stay at the center
till we get back on our feet.

61
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,600
Did he get you squared away with NTAC?

62
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:04,665
Started to.

63
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,265
His lawyers took our statements.

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in.

65
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:11,365
Well, hey,
I'm sure Jordan will take care of it.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,600
He offered to.
But I think we're going to try and swing it ourselves.

67
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,367
Well, hey, you picked the right week to come.

68
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,065
This reunion thing's going to be big, huh?

69
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,100
We've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries.

70
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,465
Three more maybes.

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,400
There haven't been this many of us in
the same place since quarantine.

72
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:27,865
What's happened since we left town?

73
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,700
I mean, suddenly it seems like
everyone's dying to meet a real, live 4400.

74
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:34,300
Yeah, well, what happened?
Jordan happened.

75
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Welcome to the revolution, little lady, huh?

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,900
He's going to die! I saw it.
He's going to die.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Sweetheart, are you okay?

78
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,165
Did you have a nightmare?

79
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,300
No, I was awake.
And I saw it.

80
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:57,165
Tell us what you saw.

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
That man we watched on tv once.

82
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,600
What man?

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,100
Him.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,600
Jordan Collier?

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,600
Someone's going to kill him.

86
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:33,834
So long ago, another life

87
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:37,822
I can feel your heart beat

88
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:43,160
it's not a dream remember us

89
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,416
I can see it in your eyes

90
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:50,928
we'll find our place in time

91
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,556
our place in time beyond the sun

92
00:04:56,566 --> 00:05:00,461
we'll find our place in time

93
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:05,527
our place in time to call our own

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,050
As far as this department knew.

95
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:26,900
Maia wasn't having visions anymore.

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,865
Right?

97
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,700
Well, she was keeping them secret from me

98
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,717
and writing everything down in a diary.

99
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:33,700
But I'm not here to talk about my daughter.

100
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,200
We're here to talk about Collier.

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,300
We could talk about him all you want.

102
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:38,065
But if I was Collier.

103
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,869
I'd be bringing all my books back to the library.

104
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,805
If you know what I mean.

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,400
The kid's never wrong, right?

106
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,450
Look, as far as I can tell...

107
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:46,165
... Maia has two kinds of visions.

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
If she can see an event clearly enough in her head...

109
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,000
... she can sometimes influence the course of the future.

110
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,600
But mostly her visions are abstract.

111
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:54,700
They're more like...

112
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,365
... certainties.

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Prophecies,
I guess you could call them.

114
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,367
Now, this is one of those.

115
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,900
And as far as I can tell...

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,750
... they're never wrong.

117
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, not yet, anyway.

118
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,400
But nobody's made a concerted effort
to stop one of them from happening.

119
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,900
So we could always offer Collier a suite in the basement.

120
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,265
24-hour surveillance, and a food taster.

121
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,100
Sure. We just tell the guy
he needs to stay isolated for, what...

122
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:16,867
... a week?

123
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:17,565
A year?

124
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,265
When it comes to the prevention of future crime.

125
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
There are no time limits... and everyone's a suspect.

126
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,365
I mean, literally everyone.

127
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,100
So how to stop the inevitable from happening?

128
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,165
Stopping the inevitable...

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,565
isn't that what we deal with every day?

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I mean, that's why the 4400 were sent back, right?

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,200
I like the "can-do" attitude.

132
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:34,665
But I have to ask...

133
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,650
do we even want to save Collier?

134
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,565
Well, he is kind of the bad guy.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,065
Maybe that's the way the future wants it.

136
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Unless they gave us this message as a way
to stop Collier's death from happening.

137
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,565
Fascinating.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,065
What an extraordinary gift.

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
You are clear on what we're telling you?

140
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,865
Your daughter

141
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,800
has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future.

142
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,700
Her latest vision involves my death.
I leave anything out?

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,865
No, that about covers it.

144
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,165
NTAC is offering you all its resources.

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
That means round-the-clock protection,
threat assessment...

146
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:06,000
And I'm meant, of course, to isolate myself?

147
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:08,100
Well, that would be the safest move.

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,665
Let's say I'm willing to assume
good faith on your part... which...

149
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,600
... given your exploitation of the 4400
to get to me, is rather generous...

150
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,467
What, you think we made this up?

151
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,265
I'm not sure you're that creative.

152
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,900
But your plan does call for my total
withdrawal from the public eye

153
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,400
and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest

154
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,200
in the 4400 that's been months in the planning.

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,800
Our history with each other is what it is.

156
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,100
But this is real.

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,600
And denial is not a luxury you can afford.

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
Thank you for the information.
I'll keep it in mind.

159
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
Maia is never wrong.

160
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,100
Whatever protection you can afford me.
I can afford myself.

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,300
Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The foreign returnees' stories are particularly inspirational.

163
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,700
Still come here every thursday, huh?

164
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,900
Thought I might get lucky.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,700
Lily.

166
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,100
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm back in Seattle.

168
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,150
I just wanted to thank you for helping Richard.

169
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,200
Just a couple of phone calls.
It was no big deal.

170
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:28,465
We were in a bad spot.

171
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
You did what you could. It meant a lot.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, you really didn't have to get me anything.

173
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,650
It's actually for Heidi.

174
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:35,900
Her birthday's coming up.

175
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:36,565
Oh, Lily...

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,465
It's just a cool little handbag.

177
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,300
You don't have to tell her it's from me.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
I don't want to mess with your life, Brian.

179
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm just trying to say "thank you".

180
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Okay.

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,465
You're looking well, Lily.

182
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,900
I'm glad things are working out.

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,965
I can't talk to first keys today.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
There's too much going on with this party.

185
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:01,000
But class starts in 10 minutes.

186
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:02,300
I can't do it, Lucy.

187
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,400
You're just going to have to tell them
to think of it as a study hall.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,900
Um... this is outgoing.
Thank you.

189
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
You guys come for the tour?

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Could we talk to you outside?

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Kind of a bad day.
It's pretty crazy around here.

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Told you he'd blow us off.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
What's up?

194
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Oh, Liv.

195
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
They were too embarrassed to come inside.

196
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:33,165
I can't. I can't.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,300
But I saw what you can do.

198
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:35,565
We all did.

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,665
You can heal people.

200
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,500
Listen, it's not that simple.
I can't heal everyone.

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm not asking you to heal everyone.

202
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,665
Just them.

203
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,800
You don't understand.
It's like it drains me.

204
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,700
I can do it for maybe one.
Maybe.

205
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:48,865
One is better than none.

206
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,700
And who chooses that one, Wayne?
You? Me?

207
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,700
I can't heal the world. I'm sorry.

208
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:58,500
What'd I tell you?

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Waste of time...

210
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,500
Don't look at me like that.

211
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,200
Kyle?

212
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Hey, you with us, Buddy?

213
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,700
What?

214
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I thought you were...

215
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,500
... you know... elsewhere.

216
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,100
No, I'm right here with you.
Was just thinking. Relax.

217
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,300
I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days.

218
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,700
I'm hoping that's all done.

219
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:31,865
Yeah, I do too.

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,600
But I still think you should tell your dad
about it and get yourself checked out.

221
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,100
You want to go with me to see the kills?

222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,300
Okay.
So we're ignoring the whole blackout thing, or...

223
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,265
Pretty much.

224
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,700
They go on at 8:00.

225
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,400
You should come.

226
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,900
The TSA is putting a flag on Ian Dravitt and his known associates.

227
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,765
They'll call us if anyone shows up in Seattle.

228
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,700
This whole Dravitt thing is just Collier's latest deal gone south.

229
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,650
Collier had his name on the side of a
skyscraper by the time he was 30.

230
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,492
You pursue power that ruthlessly.
You pick up some enemies along the way.

231
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:08,300
So we find the one who seems most
like John Hinckley or Sirhan Sirhan.

232
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,465
And then do what?

233
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,700
Follow him around for the rest of his natural life?

234
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,300
We could spend the next year looking at
Collier's moves since he founded the center.

235
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,265
The guy had a whole career before he got abducted.

236
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,400
Or maybe it is coming from someone who Collier's never met.

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,465
I mean, if you hate the 4400...

238
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
... killing their figurehead's a good way
to make them suffer.

239
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,665
But what are we supposed to do?

240
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,600
The potential victim has refused our help.

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,100
No one said stopping the future was going to be easy.

242
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,700
Diana, look at this.

243
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,265
His name is Miles Quinlan.

244
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,000
Claims Collier bankrupted him.
Then kicked him out of the center.

245
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,500
Lives with his parents

246
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,765
What.

247
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,700
Nursing a persecution complex?

248
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,600
Pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory.

249
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,750
Come on, Maia,
I've named every guy

250
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,800
I've dated for like the last five years.

251
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,700
Are you telling me I don't have a future with any of them?

252
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,700
I wouldn't worry about it.

253
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,200
Seems like you meet a lot of boys.

254
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah, well, that's the trouble.

255
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,700
I'm tired of meeting boys.

256
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
I want to meet a man.

257
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,700
You will.

258
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,100
When?

259
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,265
Aunt April.

260
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,000
Just because I don't see it doesn't
mean it's not going to happen.

261
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Oh. That's probably Mrs. Bradshaw from upstairs.

262
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:22,700
She's going to watch you tonight while I go to work.

263
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,765
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
It's not my fault.

265
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
You recognize me.

266
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,500
You're Jordan Collier.

267
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,400
I didn't mean to frighten her.

268
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,500
I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.

269
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,300
Yeah, well,
doesn't look like that's going to happen.

270
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
She believes I'm going to die.

271
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,600
Please give her my apologies.

272
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,400
I brought this for her.

273
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
I hope she doesn't already have one.

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Thanks.

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,165
Hi. I'm Lily Tyler.

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,500
- I think someone was asking for me-
- Excuse me.

277
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Heidi...

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you my mother?

279
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,900
I heard them fighting about you.

280
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,000
My mom and dad... Carol.

281
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
It's okay that I still call her "mom", right?

282
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:55,465
I know it's confusing, baby.

283
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Just 'cause they're talking in the other
room doesn't mean I can't hear them.

284
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,600
They said you were one of the 4400.

285
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
That's why I was gone.

286
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
That's why we don't know each other.

287
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,500
Didn't you come to our house once?

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
It's the first thing I did when I got back.

289
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
I wanted to see you.

290
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,800
But your dad and I.
We weren't sure it was a good idea.

291
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,500
Sweetie, does your father know you came down here?

292
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,065
No.

293
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,400
I didn't tell them I heard.

294
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,000
I didn't go to school today.

295
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,050
I came here instead.

296
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:35,900
I'm glad you did.

297
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,065
Was it hard for you not to see me?

298
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,400
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

299
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,800
I think about you every single day.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,100
Look at this.

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,065
Is that me?

302
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,200
That was the day we brought
you back from the hospital.

303
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,100
You look the same as you do now.

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,300
I was gone so long. But...

305
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,565
... to me...

306
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,800
... this feels like yesterday.

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,665
You want to talk about Collier?

308
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.

309
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,167
Is that why you left the center?

310
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,565
I didn't leave. They threw me out.

311
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,100
That's what happens when you run out of money.

312
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,600
They have all these different levels.
They call them keys, right?

313
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,365
You make seventh key, you're unlocked.

314
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,965
"Unlocked"... meaning you've got your own 4400 ability?

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, that's the big prize.
Only they set it up so no one ever gets there.

316
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
There's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass.

317
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,500
If you're not one of the 4400, each one costs.

318
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,165
First I ate up my savings.

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Then I cashed out the equity in my house.

320
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,965
And they didn't deliver.

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,265
Soon as the first check bounced.

322
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,200
They told me I'd reached maximum
potential and sent me on my way.

323
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,200
Is that why you applied for a handgun permit?

324
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,300
We ran a vicap check on you this morning.

325
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:52,465
So I bought a gun.
So what?

326
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,265
I need to protect myself from Collier.

327
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Yeah, well,
I hope self-defense is all you have in mind.

328
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,665
Because if you're planning anything else.

329
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,100
We will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center.

330
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,100
You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that.

331
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,200
You're simplifying the issue.

332
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety.

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,800
It's a start.

334
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,000
Jordan, you just told me there's a little girl out there

335
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:22,300
who can see the future and she saw you dead.

336
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,000
It's time to make yourself scarce.

337
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,400
And where does it stop?

338
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,200
Do I stay away from the center?

339
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,967
I cut myself off from our work?

340
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,201
Yeah, if it means staying alive.

341
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,400
I am not going to become a hermit.

342
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
That is not a win for us.

343
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,465
Look, the center is significantly safer than it seems.

344
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,600
Half the people you see in workmen's
uniforms are bodyguards.

345
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:45,865
Are you looking to die in public?

346
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,665
You're developing a real flair for drama.

347
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,800
You know, this is hanging over my head.
Not yours.

348
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,550
Look, I'm sorry, Jordan.
I'm just-

349
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,100
I am not ready to become a martyr.

350
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,200
And you don't have to be.

351
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
I know you've been looking forward
to this weekend for a long time.

352
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,065
Bringing all the 4400 together.

353
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,400
It's like a validation for everything you've done so far.

354
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,500
But if something happens to you.

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It could undo everything that we've started.

356
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
The movement's not ready for you to be a martyr, either.

357
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,150
Just...

358
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:31,400
Go. Go.

359
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
Where'd you go? I was about to have them page you.

360
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,600
Richard, there's someone I want to introduce to you.

361
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
This is my daughter.

362
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
Heidi.

363
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,400
She came to the center to meet me.
We've been talking.

364
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,765
Well.

365
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,565
It's very nice to meet you.

366
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm Richard Tyler. I'm married to Lily...

367
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,200
... your mother.

368
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,265
She told me.

369
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,400
It's nice to meet you, too.

370
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,050
Is that...

371
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,000
Isabelle.

372
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,100
This is your half-sister.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't be scared.

374
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,665
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,200
She must be hungry.

376
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
It's okay.

377
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
I should probably get home anyway.

378
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Well, I hope I can see you again.

379
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,200
I hope so, too.

380
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,500
Maybe next time I can hold Isabelle.

381
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:36,100
I bet we could make that happen.

382
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll walk you out.

383
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,400
No more cutting school, okay?

384
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
What's the matter?

385
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,065
All I'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him.

386
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Well, tall or short,
Collier had no business showing up here.

387
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,700
I totally agree, Di.
I didn't let him in.

388
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,100
Aunt April likes tall boys.

389
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh, so you're talking about men to my daughter?

390
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:04,700
She's a child.

391
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,900
It might have come up in passing.

392
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Hey, mom?
How come you never go out on dates?

393
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,065
Well, I wouldn't say never.

394
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,965
But aunt April goes out all the time.

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,900
Well, I think your aunt's an extreme example.

396
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,800
How do I know which one is right?

397
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,965
Not many or lots?

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,700
I think that you should probably shoot
for somewhere in the middle.

399
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:28,865
I'll try.

400
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
But do dates always have to be with boys?

401
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:32,500
They're so gross.

402
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,265
You get used to them.

403
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Can we have this conversation,
like, in two or three...

404
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,200
... maybe 10 years?

405
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
What's that?

406
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Oh, a lady dropped it off today.

407
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
Oh, it's a subpoena.

408
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,065
What's that?

409
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, it's when someone wants you
to give them something.

410
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,400
Who's it from?

411
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
It's from my bosses.

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,300
What do they want?

413
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,800
Your diary.

414
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,300
Kyle! You okay, man?

415
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,100
You didn't have a drink, did you?

416
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,000
Just diet coke.

417
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,100
It's really loud in there, huh?

418
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah, but they're great, huh?

419
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:32,800
You want to go back in?

420
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,700
Come on, my buddy's saving us a spot by the stage.

421
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you know what time it is?

422
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,700
What are you doing here?

423
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,300
Kyle! Do you know what time it is?

424
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,300
What are you doing outside my apartment?

425
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
I don't know, I was at the pub.

426
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,400
You're scaring me.
How long have you been out here?

427
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,500
I don't know...
I think I was digging or something.

428
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,365
Look, Kyle, I think you should go.

429
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,465
- We can talk about this-
- I'm sorry.

430
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
I didn't mean to scare you.
It just happened again.

431
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,700
Let me in.

432
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,100
Get your hands off of me! You don't understand.

433
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:52,600
He's a fraud. All of you.
Do you hear me?

434
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,767
Your golden boy is a big fraud.

435
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:56,900
Liv, you need to calm down.

436
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,100
It's okay, guys, I got it.

437
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,500
My whole life.

438
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,700
I have been looking for just one thing.

439
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,200
Just one thing to believe in.

440
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,100
I thought it was you.

441
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,900
How long ago did you get high?

442
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,465
You gonna help me up or what?

443
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Are you going to stop yelling at me?

444
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:34,800
I am done with you altogether.

445
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,800
Go back to your penthouse.

446
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,700
Pretend we don't exist.

447
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Everyone else does.

448
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Why not you?

449
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Listen...

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,300
easy.

451
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm not going to send you off into the night like this.

452
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,100
You can sleep on my couch.

453
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I got you.

454
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,800
It's okay.

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,100
You started all this, you know.

456
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Everything around you took shape
after you showed me where to go.

457
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't know what to do, though.

458
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,900
I could count the number of times I've
said that on one hand.

459
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
But right now it's true.

460
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,365
That's right. If you know anything...

461
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,900
... now would be a good time
to tell uncle Jordan, huh?

462
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,400
Oh...

463
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,100
... thank you.

464
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Thank you.

465
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
The reunion goes forward.

466
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,000
Diana. One of Dravitt's hired guns
flew into town last night.

467
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,467
His name is Laurent Ganning.

468
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:33,865
TSA had his alias flagged.

469
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,465
Well, do we have a present whereabouts?

470
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,200
He just checked into a motel in first hill
under the name "Lawrence Gawain".

471
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
It's clear.

472
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,000
Tom...

473
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
he's on the move.

474
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,365
Wendy, wait.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

475
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,900
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.

476
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,265
Do you know how weird that is?

477
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know how I got there, please.
Believe me, I...  I...

478
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:49,067
I had another blackout last night.

479
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:51,065
Look, Kyle, this is getting bad.

480
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,000
And I can't give you the kind of help that you need.

481
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,800
So you want me to just go away?

482
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,100
No, I...

483
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,300
I want you to talk to someone.

484
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,700
Someone qualified.

485
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm scared for you.

486
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,900
Scared for me or scared of me?

487
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,665
And we are humbled by the bravery
of our foreign guests.

488
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Many of whom risked so much to be here today...
You know, Glen....

489
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:25,265
... I'm getting some nasty echos.

490
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back?

491
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,700
Testing. Testing.
One, two, three, testing.

492
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,700
You know, that's a lot better.

493
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,665
Nobody moves!

494
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,000
Everyone stay right where you are.

495
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,300
Don't move. Don't move!

496
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,265
Get your hands on your head.

497
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,500
Get them up. Turn around. 
Turn around!

498
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
Get down. Down.
Down!

499
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,400
Ganning's pistol was made from synthetic polymers.

500
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,465
The bullets, too.

501
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,700
He walked it right through your metal
detectors without so much as a peep.

502
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:33,717
You were round to get him.

503
00:28:33,752 --> 00:28:34,665
He never would have killed me.

504
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,300
He was standing two feet away
from you with a loaded firearm.

505
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,567
The whole thing was put in motion by Maia.

506
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,765
Your daughter's vision was a gift to me.

507
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,700
A prescription, if you will.
For changing the future.

508
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,565
In one chain of events.
Ganning's bullet killed me.

509
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,300
I can only assume that somebody
has a different plan for me.

510
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,450
Well, I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet.

511
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:57,165
I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures.

512
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,300
The same extra measures that just allowed
an assassin to walk right up to you.

513
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,600
Would NTAC like a presence at the gala tomorrow?

514
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:04,465
Yes.

515
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,600
Mr. Collier, we don't stand off to the side and watch.

516
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:08,900
We take command.

517
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,700
I'll issue credentials.

518
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,400
That was a rather dramatic demonstration
of competence just now.

519
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,300
What time is it?

520
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,300
It's about 2:00.

521
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,100
How'd I end up here, anyway?

522
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,765
Liv, you were pretty far gone last night.

523
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,600
But are you really telling me you don't remember?

524
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,400
I remember.

525
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,300
You don't have to hover over me.

526
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
I'm not going to steal anything.

527
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,000
The maid can come in and clean the
couch as soon as I'm gone.

528
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,100
How many of these nights do you
think you have left in you?

529
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,900
Hopefully not too many.

530
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:57,500
You've seen my life.

531
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:58,665
When I OD....

532
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,400
It's not gonna be any big loss.

533
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:01,365
That is not true.

534
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800
How's it going to change?

535
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,500
I used to feel the same way.

536
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,700
I meant what I told you.

537
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,165
I can't save the whole world.

538
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,400
And I can't even save your friends.

539
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,665
And I'm sorry.

540
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,900
But if you're serious about wanting a change.

541
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
Maybe I can save you.

542
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,500
How?

543
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,700
By giving you the same thing that saved me.

544
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,500
He's here.

545
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,300
Hi, good to see you.

546
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,700
Excuse me.

547
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,150
Hello, my love.

548
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,400
Here we go.

549
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,800
I think I have to...

550
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,300
nice to meet you

551
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Pleasure to see you.

552
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,000
Excuse me, sir.

553
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,100
All the guests check out so far.

554
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,900
Yeah, we secured the surrounding rooftops.
Did a bomb sweep.

555
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:42,500
So now it's cross-our-fingers time.

556
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
Yeah.

557
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,465
Good afternoon.

558
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,150
Thank you for coming to the center.

559
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,800
We have a great day planned for you.

560
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,265
But before we get started.

561
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,250
I'd like to thank the man that made this all possible.

562
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:00,200
I mean that literally... he didn't just pay for the food.

563
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,900
He built this place.

564
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,565
And this movement.

565
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
So I'd like you to please welcome my mentor.

566
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,300
My friend... Mr. Jordan Collier.

567
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Thank you.

568
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,300
And thank you, Shawn,
for that introduction.

569
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,600
We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.

570
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:33,500
Many of whom risked so much to be here today.

571
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,665
Let's go.

572
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,200
I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself.

573
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,100
Jordan?

574
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
He's up there! Go!

575
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
Everybody stay down!

576
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,900
We've got a shooter.

577
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,400
Everyone calm down!
Just stay down. Stay down!

578
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,800
We've got a shooter.

579
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:29,000
Let me go.

580
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,300
Jordan! Oh, my god!

581
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Oh, god...

582
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,400
Please let me go, please!

583
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
Get that stretcher ready.

584
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
Pulse is weak and thready come on let's go hurry up!

585
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,950
Breathing's stopped.

586
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:03,100
We're losing him again.

587
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,500
No! You're not going anywhere yet.

588
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,900
Shawn! She told me to go through with it.

589
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:17,900
Who did?

590
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,800
She lies.

591
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,165
No...

592
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,900
Don't go anywhere, no...

593
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
- Lily, I need to-
- Brian, I don't have much time.

594
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,800
I did not violate our agreement.

595
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:44,900
Heidi found me.

596
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:45,665
Lily.

597
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,800
Heidi's sick.

598
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
She's in the hospital.

599
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
It happened yesterday.

600
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,865
Something with her spleen.

601
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,600
They had to operate right away.

602
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,000
Is she okay?

603
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,200
Can I see her?

604
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,065
She's okay.

605
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,000
She's still recovering from the anesthesia.

606
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,200
She's been asking for you.

607
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,865
She's still in recovery now.

608
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,900
But Carol thinks it's all right if you
want to get in there tomorrow.

609
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,800
Brian, what happened?

610
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,900
Her spleen? She's 12 years old.

611
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,100
It just ruptured.

612
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,700
Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
Even they can't tell us why.

613
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,800
Where you been?
The funeral's about to start.

614
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,500
Lily, what's wrong?
What is it?

615
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
Heidi's sick.

616
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,900
And I think Isabelle's responsible.

617
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,200
I think they're ready for you.

618
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,100
You are going to read a lot about
Jordan Collier in the next few weeks.

619
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,950
Some of it good.

620
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:43,400
A lot of it bad...

621
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,700
I will be ignoring all of it.

622
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,200
Just like Jordan would have.

623
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,565
Because Jordan may have used the media.

624
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,900
But he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.

625
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,200
I could tell you how much I owe the man.

626
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:09,200
He took me in when I was feeling
lost and alone... confused.

627
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:12,300
I'm sure many of you have similar stories.

628
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,700
The fact is that everyone alive today.

629
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,300
Whether they know it or not.
Owes Jordan Collier.

630
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:23,200
He had a vision to save the future.

631
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,100
And he gave us that vision.

632
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,100
And now he won't be here to see us achieve it...

633
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,900
but we will achieve it.

634
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,100
I promise you.
We will achieve it.

635
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,400
We have all suffered a tremendous loss.

636
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,500
We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside.

637
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,700
But we will not let that stop us.

638
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,800
And I will not let that stop me.

639
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,565
We will honor Jordan Collier.

640
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:13,000
And we will create the better future that he died building.

641
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,100
Thank you for coming.

642
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,600
Goodbye.

643
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,900
Nice words, Shawn.

644
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,300
I think Collier would have approved.

645
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah, I hope so.

646
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,900
He would have liked that you came.

647
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,700
Oh, I don't think I was that high on his radar.

648
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,050
Don't be too sure.

649
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,165
You guys bumped heads.

650
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,565
But you believed the same thing.

651
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,700
That the 4400 are the key to the future.

652
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,365
Your goals were identical.

653
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,150
But our methods were different.

654
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,900
Not as different as you think.

655
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,800
See, that's where your view of
Jordan Collier splits from mine.

656
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,700
Well, at least we have some common ground.

657
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,500
Maybe your side and my side can work together
now that I'm assuming new duties around here.

658
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,400
You're becoming quite the little politician, Shawn.

659
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,100
Now I know Collier would have been proud of you.

660
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,965
He's gone!

661
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,900
His body,
it's not there!

662
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Someone stole the body.

663
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,300
There's only one way out.

664
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,400
And we were standing right in front of it,
stole it how?

665
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,200
Then what happened?
