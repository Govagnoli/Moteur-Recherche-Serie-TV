1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,200
Over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,140
All at once they were returned.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,140
With no memory of
where they've been.

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,730
They haven't aged a day.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,310
And some have returned
with new abilities.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,690
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,170
...with a life interrupted.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
We're not a threat,
we're salvation.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,900
The world
will have to deal with us.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,900
Previously on the 4400...

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
you're so sweet.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
I wish i could take you with me when i go, but i can't.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,470
Yesterday, a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,500
and today,
it's the entire hospital.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,170
If we get tess
out of here,

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,850
do you think
this compulsion will fade?

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,100
I will have taught my body how to produce promicin,

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,550
and then i will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Enough running, dr. Burkhoff.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,800
You need to come with us now.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,700
No.

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Stay back.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
I don't want to
hurt anyone.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
That's very reassuring.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll keep that in mind.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
No! No!

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,200
 No!

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,145
Mr. Tyler. Come in.

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,730
What can i do
for you?

31
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,500
I wanted to ask you about your work
with the students here.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,300
Sure.

33
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
I teach three classes,
history, art, and...

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
i'm not talking
about your teaching.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,100
I was talking about the "counseling" that you do.

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,600
I understand you use your ability
with the kids?

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
That's right.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,000
My ability is to help them
focus their abilities.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
It's pretty much
what i've been doing

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
ever since i came back.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
If a student
has a talent...

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,100
like all of our kids here do...

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,500
i help them learn
how to use it,

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
gain control of it,
build their confidence.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Does it work with adults?

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
It didn't used to,

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,580
but i haven't tried it since i've been
off the inhibitor.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,700
 Why?

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,500
I developed this ability
a few months ago...

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,400
telekinesis.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
What a word, huh?

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,700
I can't even say it
with a straight face.

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,200
That's fantastic.

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
I've just been pretending
it isn't there.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,900
I mean, i know
a little bit about it.

56
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,800
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects,

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
little stuff.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
But when i'm mad or excited,

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,900
i can do a lot more
with it.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,800
And you're looking to control it
when you're calm?

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Yeah, that's why i'm here,
i guess.

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,000
How many times do i have to go over this
with you people?

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have not been injecting promicininto anyone but myself.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
You're certain of that?

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,900
You're a world-class
scientist.

66
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,200
I find it
difficult to believe

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,800
you wouldn't build a redundancy plan 
into your experiment.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
This isn't
your basic sleep study.

69
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,500
I mean, look at me.

70
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,900
Do you think
i'd have an easy time finding volunteers?

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,300
No. I do not.

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,700
Oh.

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,300
You look like you're in
quite a bit of discomfort to me.

74
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,500
Yes.

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Well...

76
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,600
you can relax now.

77
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
The experiment's over.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
This will only hurt
for a minute.

79
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,600
Bag him.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
We'll take him back
for the autopsy.

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Get dr. Burkhoff
up there quickly.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They promised results
by the morning.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,100
Mommy?

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Mommy?

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,100
Are you okay?

86
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh, of course, sweetie.
I'm fine.

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
Why wouldn't i be?

88
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,800
I had a bad dream,
and you were in it.

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,500
Well, you get in
and tell me about it.

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
You turned into
a monster.

91
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,300
It was horrible.

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
It seemed so real.

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
It was you.

94
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,400
But you
were different.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
What kind
of a monster?

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
Nice.

97
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Something
for the refrigerator door.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,300
You don't think there's anything
to this?

99
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
It's not a prediction,
right?

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,600
Just a bad dream.

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,100
Well, i hope so, but when your daughter's
a precog,

102
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,300
you don't want her
giving you a picture like this.

103
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,600
Hello.
This is skouris.

104
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,392
Well, thank you
for calling me back.

105
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,000
Let me know if you see him, all right?

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
Everything okay?

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,358
Maybe.

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,720
I'm not sure.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
I mean, that was
the 4400 center.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
I was hoping maybe
they'd seen dr. Burkhoff.

111
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,100
I stopped by
his apartment yesterday,

112
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,000
and he wasn't home.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,900
Uh, diana.

114
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,600
Why would you be stopping by
dr. Burkhoff's apartment?

115
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,000
You actually saw the wound in kevin's hand
heal over?

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes.

117
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
He pulled the scalpel out, and it was gone
within seconds.

118
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
He's developing
an ability.

119
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
I mean, he's close
to it, anyway.

120
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
He said
it comes and goes.

121
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,300
What?

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,600
Anyone else developing
a 4400 ability i should know about?

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
I should have
told you earlier.

124
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
You're damn right
you should have.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Got to hand it
to you, diana...

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,711
some people play racketball,
in their spare time,

127
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,142
maybe collect old records.
But you?

128
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,600
You play igor
to the one man who...

129
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,500
Well, if he has developed
an ability, like you say,

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,600
maybe he really is
the father of 4400 technology,

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
just like the future predicted.

132
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,200
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?

133
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:42,400
I thought we were...

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,103
and now i'm not so sure,

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,400
and that's what
i'm worried about.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Tom, what if someone else finds out 
what he's up to?

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Well, if he succeeds,
we could be talking

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
about the mass-marketing
of 4400 abilities.

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,500
I'm sure a lot of people would
like to keep that genie in the bottle.

140
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:58,800
Wouldn't make our jobs
any easier.

141
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,100
Are you...
are you okay?

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,800
That's just my allergies
are acting up.

143
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,749
I've already spoken
to his family.

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,067
They haven't heard from him
in months.

145
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,100
Okay, so who else
is he close to?

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,100
I didn't know that cheshire cats
always grinned...

147
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,400
In fact, i didn't know that cats could grin, said alice
very politely.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,169
"You don't know much,"
said the duchess.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,992
"And that's a fact."

150
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
We'll finish this chapter
tomorrow.

151
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
I hope you all can make it.

152
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,900
I've been living in a halfway house
for about three months.

153
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,500
I got this job here
two weeks ago.

154
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,920
That's great, tess.

155
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,900
So they found a medication
that works for you?

156
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,000
So far, so good.

157
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,317
I still
have my disease.

158
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
Schizophrenia
never goes away,

159
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
but i haven't had
any symptoms for a while.

160
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Hopefully i won't.

161
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,800
So these kids you're reading to,
they're not going to try and build a tower

162
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
To contact the future,
are they?

163
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't think so.

164
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,060
I can barely remember
all that now.

165
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm still not sure how i could compel people
to work,

166
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,000
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.

167
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm glad
it made kevin better,

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,100
but it was still so weird.

169
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,600
That's actually
why we're here.

170
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Have you been in touch
with kevin lately?

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,800
No.

172
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,900
I called him when i first got out
of the institution

173
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
We met for coffee,

174
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
but i haven't seen him
in months.

175
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
Is he okay?

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Well,
we're not sure,

177
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,700
but we'd like to
talk to him.

178
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
So, if he contacts you,
would you let us know?

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Well, of course.

180
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
When you find him,
will you have him call me?

181
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Sure.

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,051
It's nice to see you
again, tess.

183
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,264
Bye.

184
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,800
I just spoke
with the program coordinator.

185
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,239
She says the first segment will be interviews
with some of the people you've healed

186
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,900
and then they'll bring you out after the break.

187
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,300
She says the emotional stuff also plays well
with her audience,

188
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,000
also plays well
with her audience,

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
- So feel free to cry or...
- We'll see about that.

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,689
They're also curious
about the wedding.

191
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,500
She'd love it if you answered
some questions...

192
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,800
let's keep the private life
private, okay?

193
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
Nick!

194
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Nick, please,
wake up!

195
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Nick!

196
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,600
Nick, please,
wake up!

197
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,066
Oh, jesus,
that's nick crowley.

198
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, my god.

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,645
You're that 4400,
the one with the hands.

200
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Help him, please!
Nick!

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Nick, wake up. Please!

202
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
If you're okay,
say something.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,235
Well, jim morrison says hello.

204
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,300
Easy. Easy, boys, easy.

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
You just saved nick crowley.

206
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
On behalf of millions of rock and roll
burnouts all over the world,

207
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,400
Allow me to thank you.

208
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,593
Any time you want to lay these on me,
you just let me know.

209
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
It was a little bit big,

210
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
so i just had it resized.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,400
It's perfect now.

212
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,600
I think, mom would be really happy,
don't you?

213
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Lily gave you
that ring.

214
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,700
I guess you can do
what you want with it.

215
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,100
I think it's perfect.

216
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,660
Have you thought about what you're going to say
at the wedding?

217
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,260
Usually, the father of the bride gives a toast.

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
Um...

219
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,700
Well.

220
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
It's all been so sudden.

221
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,100
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.

222
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:56,770
That's okay.

223
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,440
I have a few thoughts.

224
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,862
There's an article
in this magazine on toasts.

225
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,740
Read it.

226
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,480
I think i can handle that
on my own.

227
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,867
Dad, i want you to read it.

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Tonight.

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,905
Hi.

230
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
I bought some food.

231
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,222
Let me help you with that.

232
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,763
Thank you.

233
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
My joints
are a little stiff.

234
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,308
Kevin, why did you put your hood up
when i came in?

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,930
You shouldn't have to
look at me like this.

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,856
Like what?

237
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,129
Diana skouris and tom baldwin
came by the bookstore today.

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,116
They were asking
about you.

239
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,444
I figured
diana would be worried.

240
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,551
How did she look?

241
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,808
Okay, i guess.

242
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,959
A little sick.

243
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,513
Kevin, i felt bad
seeing her.

244
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:34,350
I don't like what we're doing to her...
what i'm doing to her...

245
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:41,587
I don't like it much either, but we are on the cusp
of changing the world...

246
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,600
For the better.

247
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,800
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.

248
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Kevin, it's already ugly.

249
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Someone shot you yesterday.

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,103
I know, but the experiment is worth the risk.

251
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,356
They woke me up
to do this.

252
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,622
You woke me up
to do this.

253
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:04,092
I have to move forward.

254
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,800
And to do that,
i need diana.

255
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,888
And i need you.

256
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,000
Is shawn farrell around?

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,400
I have something for him.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Oh!

259
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,638
I played that when we were recording
my first album.

260
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
I've been holding onto it
for years.

261
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,200
You're really
giving this to me?

262
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
You saved my life.

263
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,600
Seems like a fair trade
to me.

264
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,700
So this, uh,
ability of yours...

265
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,500
it works every time
out of the gate?

266
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Yeah, pretty much.

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, my god.

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,100
I wish they brought you back 15 years ago.

269
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
A career in rock 'n' roll...

270
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,700
sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.

271
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,000
You lose a lot of people
along the way.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
One day you look up,

273
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,781
and you're the last man
standing.

274
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
You should take better care
of yourself.

275
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm not always around.

276
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
I feel like i owe you
more than a guitar.

277
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
We're playing tomorrow night

278
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
and i wanted to invite you
backstage.

279
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,900
You can hang out, watch the show
from the wings.

280
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
- Really?
- Sure.

281
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.

282
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
If i keel over,

283
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,500
you can always come out and do your "hands of god" thing
for an encore.

284
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
It's cold.

285
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,400
You should
bring your jacket.

286
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,700
She didn't say anything
on the way over?

287
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
Of course not,
kevin.

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,700
She hardly ever does.

289
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,200
You're so brave.

290
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,700
I always wanted to
give it to you first.

291
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I thought
you deserved an ability.

292
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,900
I'm sorry it has to happen
without your permission.

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
Can i get this
started?

294
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,834
Give dr. Burkhoff your hand.

295
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,000
Mommy, I'm gonna be late for school,
if we don't leave soon.

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry, baby.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,100
I slept through
my alarm.

298
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll be ready
in a few...

299
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Mommy,
are you okay?

300
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm fine.

301
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
I just broke a nail is all.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Ew.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Ew.

304
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hi.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Hey, marco.

306
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,900
What are you doing down here?

307
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,400
Tom asked me to check out
dr. Burkhoff's computers.

308
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,700
Uh, you okay?

309
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
I heard
you had the flu.

310
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,600
Hey.

311
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,700
I thought
you were taking a sick day.

312
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,593
Would everyone please stop treating me
like a plague patient ?

313
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm fine.

314
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,100
Have we learned anything
here?

315
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean.

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,700
Like, completely clean.

317
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,600
I mean, there're no saved files,
no records of anything.

318
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,632
It's like someone took out his hard drives and swapped them
for new ones.

319
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,900
So either he took them
somewhere...

320
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
or someone else has them.

321
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Diana.

322
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
Look at this.

323
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Is that...

324
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,500
kevin?

325
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Yeah.

326
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,400
My god.

327
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
These are the side effects
of the injections?

328
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,800
I haven't seen him
in a couple of weeks.

329
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,500
I had no idea
he'd gotten so bad.

330
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
- Think it's a self-portrait?
- No way.

331
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,686
Kevin's hands weren't steady enough to make coffee.

332
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,100
Didn't tess like to draw?

333
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
I feel like i'm in
a staring contest.

334
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:41,700
It's okay.

335
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,416
I know it can be a little awkward at first.

336
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,849
So, sometimes when i'm having trouble
getting started with a student,

337
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
I'll take their hand.

338
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,020
It helps everything
get rolling.

339
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,200
You up for it?

340
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
Yeah.

341
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
I guess.

342
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,700
Just relax, okay?

343
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,600
Hmm.

344
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh.

345
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

346
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
To be honest,
i felt a little awkward.

347
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,100
I, uh, i haven't had someone touch me like that
since, uh...

348
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,000
My wife passed, and...

349
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,100
it's okay.

350
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,700
Sometimes it takes more than one session
to make headway.

351
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,300
Diana?

352
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
Diana?

353
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,267
Should i just call you a cab?

354
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,799
I can handle this if you want.

355
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
No, i'm okay.

356
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,900
Any sign of tess?

357
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,400
No, she hasn't come out yet.

358
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:05,400
Look, tom.

359
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,692
I made an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow morning,

360
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:10,454
but, for now, i'd just like to
stick with it, okay?

361
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:16,200
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.

362
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
It's like
i'm dragging myself around.

363
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
Here she is.

364
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,600
Come in.

365
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,900
Hey.

366
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,600
What?

367
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,500
Different look
for you.

368
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
"Look?"

369
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,100
I dressed like this
for 10 years.

370
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Hey, you're not going to ask
about the wedding, are you?

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,264
I am officially taking the night off from all planning.

372
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,789
This has nothing to do with the wedding
unless nick crowley's invited.

373
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,000
Hum, He's downstairs.

374
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Really?

375
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
No, i'm getting ready
for his show.

376
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,900
Maybe he wants to give me
a ride or something.

377
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,000
Uh, i don't think
that's it.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Well, what?

379
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,100
I never get enough refills.

380
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,500
I mean, look at me...

381
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
What's he saying?

382
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,300
Nick has a prescription
for antabuse.

383
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,900
They're these pills

384
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,300
that are supposed to help him
cut back on his drinking.

385
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
He finally
tried some.

386
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
I guess
he overdid it, huh?

387
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
It's the same thing
he does with everything.

388
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.

389
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
Do your worst.

390
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,900
Please?

391
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,200
Come to my arms,

392
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,600
my beamish boy.

393
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Lie down. Lie down.

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,700
You're my little lifeline.

395
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,700
Kevin.

396
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,924
Dr. Burkhoff, i've been worried about you.

397
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,000
What are you doing,
hiding up here?

398
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
My god. Look at you.

399
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,210
Dr. Burkhoff, you need to
come with us.

400
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
We're going to get you
some help.

401
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,502
I can't do that. People are trying
to kill me.

402
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
What people? Who's trying
to kill you?

403
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,500
I think they work
for the government.

404
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,200
They don't work
for ntac.

405
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Are you sure about that? Because i'm not.

406
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,050
Listen, kevin. You know us.

407
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,700
If you come in,
we'll protect you.

408
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,341
And, besides, i'm not taking no for an answer.
Come on.

409
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,778
Actually, i think
you're going to have to.

410
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,726
Diana? What the hell
are you doing?

411
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:19,920
I don't know, tom. I'm sorry.

412
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,595
Diana's not quite
herself right now.

413
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,554
She'll do
whatever tess wants her to.

414
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,290
Tess, will you get his gun, please?

415
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,723
Please.

416
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,205
I am so close to finishing.
Stop trying to find me.

417
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,787
I have no desire to hurt you.

418
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,754
Diana...
are you okay?

419
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,200
Are you all right?

420
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,900
I don't know.

421
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
What happened?

422
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,987
You pulled your gun
on me.

423
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,985
Tess?

424
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,443
Yeah.

425
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,900
 Oh, god.

426
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,400
What?

427
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,900
Something's wrong.

428
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,300
I just feel weird.

429
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh, my god.

430
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,900
What are those?

431
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,600
They're lesions.

432
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,472
They're just like the ones kevin had 
when he started taking promicin.

433
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,500
We need to get you
to ntac medical.

434
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,506
We wanted to bring in

435
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,929
If there's anything at all to these experiments
dr. Burkhoff has been conducting,

436
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,298
A lot of people in d.c. are going to want to
look over his notes.

437
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:44,400
These pictures have already been circulated to local law enforcement.

438
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,947
We're going to distribute them around the neighborhood
near dr. Burkhoff's apartment.

439
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,934
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.

440
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Maybe we'll get lucky.

441
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,646
So, what, we're supposed to tell people
that there's some kind of monster on the loose?

442
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,600
No, if anyone asks,

443
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,757
we tell them dr. Burkhoff
has werner syndrome.

444
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,222
It's a rare wasting disease.

445
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:58,810
Okay.

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,453
But do you really think we'll be able to bring 
this guy in safe and sound?

447
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,166
I mean, some cowboy cop sees this stumbling
towards him,

448
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,565
You don't think he might shoot first and ask questions later?

449
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,206
That's why we have to
get to him first.

450
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,028
Whatever dr. Burkhoff is guilty of, he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.

451
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,800
The good thing about his condition is,
 it shouldn't make him too hard to spot.

452
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,100
I don't know.

453
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,900
You're nice hands,

454
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
But they don't look magical
or anything.

455
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Making friends
already?

456
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Hey.

457
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
You've chosen
wisely.

458
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,400
I speak from experience.

459
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,800
The show was amazing.

460
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Thank you so much
for having me.

461
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
What are you
thanking me for?

462
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,300
The show would've been canceled
if not for you.

463
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Listen.

464
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,464
I just had the best idea during the encore.

465
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?

466
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And do what?

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,300
Well, you could start
with mischa

468
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,700
and work your way
onward from there.

469
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,

470
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
but i kind of have a lot on my plate here in seattle, you know?

471
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm supposed
to get married soon.

472
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,704
Well, in that case, you have to come with us.

473
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,189
It'll be like
an extended bachelor party.

474
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,100
We'll take good care of you.

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Promise.

476
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,806
And a promise from mischa is money
in the bank.

477
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,900
Besides, i like
having you along with us.

478
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,100
You keep me...

479
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:13,700
limber.

480
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,600
You mean upright?

481
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
Well, yeah, that too.

482
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,100
Um, it's just

483
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,948
i'm not your personal physician,
you know?

484
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:21,800
Of course you're not.

485
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,714
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor i've ever met.

486
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh.

487
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,700
Think about it.

488
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,200
But not too long.

489
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
What's to think about?

490
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,800
Who could say "no"
to all of this?

491
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,399
so what can i get you
this morning?

492
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,100
could i have
the steak and eggs?

493
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,002
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?

494
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,500
Thanks


495
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,100
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner in beacon hill.
He's there right now.

496
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,500
Bring him in quietly,
if you can,

497
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,100
but bring him in.

498
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,300
Diana, wake up.

499
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,782
Dr. Anapurn.

500
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,345
I thought i was
supposed to sleep.

501
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,900
You gave me drugs...

502
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,000
you're being
discharged.

503
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,800
You need to come
with me.

504
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,595
I don't know.

505
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
I guess he left
about 15 minutes ago.

506
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Did he say where
he was headed?

507
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,400
No.

508
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
I mean, he didn't even touch the food he ordered,
right?

509
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,900
He just left
in a hurry.

510
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,200
Left a good tip,
then.

511
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,365
Where are we going?

512
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,300
Thank you.

513
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
You can go back
to your office now.

514
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,200
Tess,
don't do this.

515
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm sorry.

516
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,038
I wish, it didn't have to be you,
but there's no one else.

517
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,700
We'd better go.

518
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,100
He'll be
waiting for us.

519
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,900
How could i have done that?

520
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't remember any of it.

521
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,817
Diana doesn't remember going to kevin's apartment
at night, either.

522
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:01,779
If dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,

523
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,779
he must be getting desperate.

524
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,746
Feels like
he's running out of time.

525
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Which means he has to
complete the experiment.

526
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,800
He's going to up her dosage.

527
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,157
If we don't find diana soon, she's going to wind up
in the same shape as kevin.

528
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,328
I think, it's the silence that's messing us up.

529
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,007
It's too awkward.

530
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,868
So instead of us just staring
at each other,

531
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,784
i thought we'll talk.

532
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,100
Okay. Um...

533
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
is there something specific
you wanted to talk about?

534
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,700
No.

535
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,100
You pick.

536
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,300
Well, i've been thinking about
my parents a lot lately,

537
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,200
What they'd think
of all this,

538
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
This place...

539
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,700
Me,

540
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
Sitting here trying to
figure out how to use my...

541
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,500
Telekinetic ability?

542
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
You know, you can
say it out loud.

543
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

544
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah, you can say that,

545
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,600
But when i first got back,
i was a 4400,

546
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,200
But i didn't have
an ability.

547
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
I felt normal.

548
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,300
It was something
i could hold on to.

549
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,850
Now you have to get used to the idea
that you're special.

550
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,960
Is that what my parents
would thinkif they were here?

551
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,254
Or would they just think that their son
had become a freak?

552
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,600
Richard.

553
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
When you got taken,

554
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100
you were one of
the first black pilots

555
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,900
in all of the military.

556
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,700
You were at the vanguard.

557
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Now you're part of
a different vanguard.

558
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,800
There's a reason
they picked you.

559
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,900
I think your parents
would be proud.

560
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah.

561
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Uh...

562
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
Maybe that's true.

563
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Richard?

564
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
Whoa.

565
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Well, i guess
that worked, huh?

566
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
This will be fine.

567
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
We can work here
for a while.

568
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,865
Tell him he can go home.

569
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,451
Please.

570
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
You have to help me.

571
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Say something.

572
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,500
Don't bother.

573
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,300
He's not going to remember
any of this.

574
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,500
Thank you.

575
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,300
You can
go home now.

576
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,500
Kevin?

577
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,700
Can i get you
some water?

578
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm fine.

579
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
Kevin.

580
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,700
You're dying.

581
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,200
You're killing yourself.

582
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,754
And now you're going to kill me, too.

583
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,700
No.

584
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,500
You will not die.

585
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,064
My work... is valid.

586
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,900
Are you sure?

587
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,100
Look at yourself.

588
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,285
If it isn't working in me,

589
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,550
the fault isn't
with the experiment.

590
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:11,400
It's with me.

591
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,973
All those years, the shock treatments,
the fistfuls of medications,

592
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
they must have changed me.

593
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm not a good subject.

594
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,800
There is no good subject.

595
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,700
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.

596
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,710
You failed, and you're notthinking clearly enough
to see that.

597
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,341
My mind is not compromised.

598
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,600
We are at a point, Diana,

599
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,700
Where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.

600
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,600
We have to be braver
than that.

601
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
And, if necessary...

602
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,300
Oh. No...

603
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Oh...

604
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,381
i'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.

605
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Working on a song?

606
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,100
The end of one.

607
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,460
Can't nail it, though.

608
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Inspiration.

609
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
Are you shocked
i'm drinking my lunch?

610
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,200
I didn't say anything.

611
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Good, because this is...

612
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,400
listen...

613
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,800
this here is called
"maintaining a base level."

614
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,500
That's kind of scary, actually.

615
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,400
Shawn.

616
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Don't worry.

617
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,900
I've made a solemn vow
not to over-indulge...

618
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
unless, of course,
you're around.

619
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.

620
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,400
You're not going to be around,
is that it?

621
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,700
You're not coming on the road?

622
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,600
I wanted to.

623
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,700
It's just...

624
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,300
you know, even if it was
for a little while.

625
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,500
This gift i have, though,

626
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,700
it's kind of
a responsibility, you know?

627
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
And i don't mean
to be harsh, man,

628
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
but i don't think
it was meant to be used

629
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,599
As a rock star's personal safety net.

630
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
You don't know that.

631
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,800
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive

632
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,400
So i could finish my album.

633
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,900
Nick, if you go down again...

634
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,293
i can't be there for you.

635
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,500
There's still time,
you know.

636
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,900
We can save him.

637
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in kevin.

638
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
He can do this.

639
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700
He's special.

640
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,600
That's why
they had me wake him up.

641
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Tess?

642
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,000
I packed an adrenaline shot
when we left the cabin.

643
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,400
Have you seen it?

644
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,500
No.

645
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,400
I need it.

646
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
It has to be here
in case i slip under.

647
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Ah.
Kevin?

648
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,700
I think i got stung
by a bee.

649
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
What is this?

650
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,000
Don't move, dr. Burkhoff!

651
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
- Tess?
- There'snowhere to go.

652
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,900
We've got this place
surrounded.

653
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Nobody fire.

654
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,000
He's not going anywhere.

655
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,500
Diana,
are you all right?

656
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,600
Tom.

657
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,900
Whoa.
Hold still, burkhoff.

658
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,100
Put your hands up.

659
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Burkhoff!

660
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
They won't be able
to hide for long.

661
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,000
Tess will run out of meds.

662
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Dr. Burkhoff
is not exactly inconspicuous.

663
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,715
They'll show themselves,
we'll find them.

664
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
You mean we'll find tess.

665
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,100
It doesn't sound like
burkhoff will live out the week.

666
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I don't get it.

667
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,045
He was supposed to be
the father of 4400 technology.

668
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:46,020
That's why they woke him up.

669
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Well, that's
just our theory.

670
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,200
Maybe you're putting
too much faith in the future.

671
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,200
Diana's okay?

672
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Yeah,
she'll get there.

673
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
She's down
in ntac medical.

674
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
You got us a ride.

675
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Someone
let me borrow them.

676
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,671
Mr. Ryland wants a status report
on the promicin.

677
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,800
We're good.

678
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Great, actually.

679
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,743
We have enough of a stockpile to last us
for almost two years.
