1
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,067
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

2
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,367
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,667
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

4
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:43,900
[tom]:
They just arrested a suspect

5
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,067
in the collier killing.

6
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,734
Roy marsden didn't kill
jordan collier.

7
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,768
And neither did you, kyle.

8
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,067
Son of a bitch!

9
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:50,067
You go and you
tell your daddy

10
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,134
that he didn't kill anybody.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,434
If maia's having visions,

12
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,768
you should know about it,

13
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,234
and you should know
what they are.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,100
<i>[Maia]: mommy's bosses
will be punished</i>

15
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,100
<i>for betraying us.</i>

16
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,134
I want to go home.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,634
I know you do, honey,

18
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,234
but dr. Hudson is going to take
very good care of you.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,933
Don't tell anyone
i can't heal.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,267
Sure.

21
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,234
What are you going to do?

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,801
What i have to.

23
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,067
<i>[Richard]:
If you're sick,</i>

24
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,401
<i>the responsible thing
is to report to ntac,</i>

25
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,300
but if you are well...

26
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,434
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,

27
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,300
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.

28
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:22,267
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood

29
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,401
of every 4400.

30
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,134
They even gave it a name.
They call it...

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,501
"promicin inhibitor."

32
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,601
Every time
they came to ntac medical,

33
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,801
every checkup.

34
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,367
Your daughter
is the rosetta stone

35
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:34,234
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,967
We're her parents.
We decide.

37
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,501
Are you sure
you want to do this?

38
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,834
Just get me and isabelle
someplace safe.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,234
But if it comes down
to a choice

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,801
between the safety
of the american people

41
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,467
and the welfare
of the 4400,

42
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:46,401
tom...

43
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:48,933
that's no choice at all.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,467
We tried being reasonable.

45
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:52,967
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.

46
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,734
[Siren wailing]

47
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,567
[Grunts]

48
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:17,768
Easy, mccullough.

49
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,033
Let me go! I'm not sick!

50
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,134
There's nothing wrong with me!

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,434
We know that,
but you're a 4400,

52
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,734
and everybody's
got to go in.

53
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,134
Come on...

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,134
now, i don't want
to cuff you,

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,467
but if you run again,

56
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:29,000
you're going to
give me no choice.

57
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,434
"Quarantine"
is just a word to you guys.

58
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,367
Try living it.

59
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,234
Come on.

60
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,000
What are we
doing here, diana?

61
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,134
This is so wrong.

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,401
All right,
what do you suggest?

63
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,667
We walk into
the middle of ntac,

64
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:43,834
and shout out,
"we did this.

65
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
We made them sick."

66
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,501
Yeah, yeah, that's good start.

67
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,334
We've got the medical records.
We can take them to dennis.

68
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,900
You really think that max hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors

69
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,167
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400?

70
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:54,667
I mean, you really think
that they could do that

71
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:55,868
without approval?

72
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,200
Whose approval?

73
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,467
Dennis ryland's, for one.

74
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,567
He was the head
of this division

75
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,834
when this whole thing
started.

76
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,367
I mean, you think
he didn't know?

77
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,067
Until we know
how far up this goes,

78
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,834
we've got to stay calm,
work quietly...

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,100
and watch our backs.

80
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,868
Don't tell me to calm down,
lily.

81
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,534
How am i supposed to be calm

82
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,734
when my wife and daughter
left in the middle of the night?

83
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,234
We didn't leave you, richard.

84
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,834
I just didn't feel
like isabelle was safe there.

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,401
<i>You've turned this
resisting quarantine</i>

86
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,900
<i>into your
personal mission.</i>

87
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,401
Ntac turned it
into my personal mission

88
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,868
when they started
rounding us up.

89
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,967
<i>And i admire
what you're doing,</i>

90
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,601
but it's not my fight,

91
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,200
and i sure as hell won't let it
become isabelle's fight.

92
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:41,900
Just tell me where you are.

93
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,167
<i>Put my mind at ease.</i>

94
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>I'll come see you.</i>

95
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,768
Lily?

96
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,300
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

97
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,067
I just feel like
it's better this way for now.

98
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,367
<i>I'll call soon.</i>

99
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,467
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.

100
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,434
<i>911. please state
the nature of...</i>

101
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,834
i need an ambulance.

102
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,100
I'm... i'm sick.

103
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,534
I've got this...

104
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,734
<i>hello?</i>

105
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,768
<i>Hello?</i>

106
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,167
<i>Miss, are you there?</i>

107
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,467
Never mind.

108
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,734
Think they're sharing
trade secrets?

109
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:50,933
Either that,

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,601
or she's asking
for her office back.

111
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,634
After you.

112
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,634
Thanks.

113
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,900
Nina.

114
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,000
Good to see you.

115
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,267
Thanks.

116
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:06,701
I wish the circumstances
were a little better.

117
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,033
We lost the first 4400s

118
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,601
to this thing
overnight.

119
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,267
Seven dead.

120
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,868
There'll be more
by day's end.

121
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,134
No word about a vaccine,
a cure?

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,033
[Jarvis]: I just got
off the phone with hudson.

123
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,367
He said that they've worked
on a few things overnight.

124
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,167
I'm going to quarantine.

125
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,768
Diana...

126
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,000
i know this is frustrating,

127
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,834
but we've got
the best minds in the country,

128
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,868
in the world,

129
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,267
working on this.

130
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,834
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.

131
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,701
Alana could be next,

132
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:31,701
or maia,

133
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,167
and still,

134
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,401
nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they?

135
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,768
We'll get it figured out.

136
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,801
Hey, sweetie.

137
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,667
It's me, tom.

138
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,900
Who are you?

139
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,900
[Weakly]:
Who are you?

140
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,000
She was awake earlier.

141
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,933
Only for a few
minutes, though.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,501
Did she say anything?

143
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,501
She talked about you.

144
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:18,200
Said you were going to
make everything okay.

145
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,033
I hope she's right.

146
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:27,834
Me too.

147
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,367
Let's go.

148
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,933
Where are we headed?

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,967
We've got
an appointment

150
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,467
with the good doctor
hudson.

151
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,967
Diana, what...

152
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,267
what the hell
are you doing?

153
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,367
We've got some things
we need to talk about.

154
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:11,134
* so long ago, another life *

155
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,067
* i can feel your heart beat *

156
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:20,501
* it's not a dream
remember us *

157
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:24,768
* i can see it in your eyes *

158
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,067
* we'll find our place in time *

159
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:33,701
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

160
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:37,334
* we'll find our place in time *

161
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:42,734
* our place in time
to call our own *

162
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,334
?????

163
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,334
This guy your agents brought in,
orson bailey,

164
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,301
i think i can explain
how he developed this...

165
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,501
jesus,
i can't even say the word.

166
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,301
Telekinesis.

167
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,568
Thank you.

168
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,867
The body produces four
main neurotransmitters.

169
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,267
They're like traffic cops
to the brain.

170
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,867
They control everything,
regulate everything.

171
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,833
Tell me something i don't know.

172
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,100
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.

173
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,634
We've never seen it before.

174
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,934
Nobody has.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,534
I'm guessing
it factors into bailey's ability

176
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,367
to bend spoons with his mind.

177
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,668
Let's just say
promicin

178
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,067
is basically a backstage pass

179
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:28,367
to the v.i.p. Section
of the brain.

180
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,000
He is using
parts of the cerebellum

181
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,800
no human has ever had access to.

182
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,234
I ran some tests
on the 4400s

183
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,668
who are still
in quarantine.

184
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,301
Every single one of them

185
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,301
is producing trace amounts
of promicin.

186
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,601
So it's just a matter of time

187
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,733
before every 4400
develops telekinesis?

188
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,967
Promicin's behavior
is unpredictable.

189
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,134
They might not get telekinesis,

190
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,401
but they'll get something.

191
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,401
Put everything on paper.

192
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,401
I want to get
my talking points straight

193
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,867
before i try to explain this
to d.c.

194
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,867
D.c. Panicked.

195
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,267
I was ordered to work on a drug

196
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,167
to suppress
the production of promicin

197
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:03,967
in the 4400.

198
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,134
Once i synthesized
the inhibitor,

199
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,668
we gave it to every 4400,

200
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,634
every time they came in
for a checkup.

201
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,934
But it doesn't even work.

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,967
4400s are developing abilities
all the time.

203
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,467
A small percentage of them are,

204
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,067
but if it wasn't
for the inhibitor,

205
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,267
they'd all have them.

206
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,167
I know it didn't
work perfectly.

207
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:20,267
"Perfectly?"

208
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,434
Seven 4400s died last night.

209
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,234
It was your inhibitor
that did it.

210
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,434
You made them sick!

211
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,700
You think
i don't know that?

212
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,234
We weren't trying
to kill anyone.

213
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,201
We were preserving
the status quo,

214
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,167
doing a good thing.

215
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,601
I guess it backfired.

216
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:34,568
I am trying to undo it,

217
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,668
but if you want to
pull that trigger,

218
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,334
please, be my guest.

219
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,833
Maybe then
finally i'll get some sleep.

220
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,067
All right.

221
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:51,934
If you're not going to shoot me,
let me get back to work.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,434
I don't want anyone else to die.

223
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,401
Alison?
What are you doing here?

224
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,767
They're going to
give roy life.

225
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,100
They're going to
give him life,

226
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,100
and he's
going to take it.

227
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,067
What are you
talking about?

228
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,668
The state was going to go
for the death penalty,

229
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,334
and the public defender
convinced roy

230
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,867
to take a plea bargain.

231
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,034
But they've got no case
against him.

232
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,134
My dad told me.

233
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,201
I don't know.

234
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:20,367
This lawyer,

235
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:21,534
he's handling, like,
10 different cases,

236
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,833
and he just
doesn't want to see

237
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,067
the inside
of a courtroom.

238
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,067
I don't know.

239
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:26,267
But he didn't do it, okay?

240
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,601
He didn't kill jordan collier.

241
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,634
You keep saying that.

242
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,800
Does your dad know something?

243
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:30,967
What?

244
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:33,800
Is there evidence
that they're hiding?

245
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,267
What?
You have to tell me.

246
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,601
If roy takes this deal,

247
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,301
he can't even get parole
for 20 years.

248
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,634
He's not going to prison.

249
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,568
Why?

250
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,833
The 4400 came back august 14th.

251
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,601
Hudson discovered promicin
october 11th.

252
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,100
So they probably gave

253
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,367
the first doses
of the inhibitor

254
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:58,900
sometime around
the end of the month.

255
00:10:58,967 --> 00:10:59,967
But we have every
internal document

256
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,301
for october.

257
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,700
There's nothing
about any of this.

258
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,568
There's hardly even
a mention of orson bailey.

259
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,100
We both wrote reports
about him, diana.

260
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,167
They're gone.

261
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,700
They were hoping

262
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,334
that was going to be
the only extrahuman ability

263
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,234
ever developed in a 4400.

264
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,067
If they destroy
all records of it...

265
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:15,534
nobody would ever know.

266
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:16,833
But this went to the top
of the food chain.

267
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,967
Here.

268
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,267
Britain, france,
korea...

269
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,401
everywhere there's a sick 4400.

270
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,501
There has to be a paper trail.

271
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:22,867
Does it even matter?

272
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,301
I mean,
we could find a memo

273
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,900
signed by the entire
united nations security council.

274
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,134
It's not going to cure anyone.

275
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,733
Diana, we delivered
confidential medical records

276
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,267
to dr. Burkhoff.

277
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,867
We've got the so-called
"father of 4400 technology"

278
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:35,900
working on the case,

279
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,067
and you just
stuck a gun

280
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,733
to the head of ntac's
medical director.

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,334
We've done everything we can

282
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,067
to get the right people
working on a cure.

283
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,733
That's if ntac
even wants a cure.

284
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,534
Ryland's been talking
about people in d.c.

285
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,234
Who've been on a wartime footing
for months.

286
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:49,733
This is nothing
but a stroke of luck for them.

287
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,967
You think
they want them all dead?

288
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,301
I told you!

289
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,934
I told you
i wasn't safe here.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,334
It's just a precaution, kevin.

291
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,867
We think
you'll just be safer

292
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,634
if you move to
a less exposed location.

293
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,767
It's because
i told you

294
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,000
about that inhibitor
thing, right?

295
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,733
I spent six years
in a psychiatric hospital

296
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,167
suffering from paranoid
personality disorder.

297
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:11,467
As soon as i get out,

298
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:12,767
you two put me
smack in the middle

299
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,434
of a massive
conspiracy.

300
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,733
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning
all kinds of stories about ntac.

301
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,100
Very interesting stuff.

302
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,034
Well, he can spin

303
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,934
all the theories
he wants,

304
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,201
just not here.

305
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,900
I'll make sure
he has a safe place to work.

306
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,867
I figured out what promicin is.

307
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:28,668
That's the name they gave
the neurotransmitter,

308
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,234
right?

309
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,568
The one that gives the 4400
their abilities?

310
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:36,100
And if i can find
one 4400

311
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,367
that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor,

312
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,034
i think i can neutralize it.

313
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,668
Hey.

314
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:54,967
You scared me.

315
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:58,034
Why didn't you use
your key?

316
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,568
Oh, sorry.
My hands were full.

317
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,934
I brought you guys
some supplies.

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,301
You still like chocolate cherry?

319
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,334
That sounds great. Thank you.

320
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,668
Oh...

321
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,334
you okay?

322
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:16,501
Yeah, just jumpy.

323
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:19,167
It's so quiet out here.

324
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,934
Yeah, a lot of places
have closed up for the season.

325
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, i thought that, uh...

326
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,900
maybe i could stay for
a little dinner or something.

327
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,867
You don't have to
get back home?

328
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,401
No, not really.

329
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,700
Carol's gone.

330
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,800
She found out

331
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,134
that you and i
were talking.

332
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,134
Don't worry,
she doesn't know you're here,

333
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,668
but she got mad.

334
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,134
Brian, i'm sorry.

335
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,434
She'll stay away
for a few nights.

336
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,100
I'll stay on the couch
for a while...

337
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,267
but in the meantime,

338
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,900
heidi's staying with a friend,

339
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,134
and i figured,
why eat alone?

340
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,501
Sure,

341
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:52,967
but i hope
you're not expecting much.

342
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,334
I haven't made pot roast
in a while.

343
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,534
You know, lily,
the truth is...

344
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,668
i never
should have married carol

345
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,700
in the first place.

346
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:04,900
What are you doing, brian?

347
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:05,934
Come on.

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm alone.

349
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,367
You're alone.

350
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:09,767
You and richard aren't happy.

351
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,301
That's not true.

352
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,668
We could have it back, lily.

353
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,967
Don't, brian.

354
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,234
Why are you
fighting it?

355
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,833
Brian, stop it!
Let me go!

356
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,401
I don't want to hurt you, lily!

357
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,034
Stop it!

358
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:25,167
You little bitch.

359
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:45,833
Hello?

360
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,668
<i>[Brian]: lily?
Are you okay?</i>

361
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,967
Brian?

362
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,867
<i>Yeah, i was going to
bring by some food.</i>

363
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,401
Don't.

364
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,733
Something's not right here.

365
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,067
I haven't heard

366
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:07,034
from the safe house
in wheeling

367
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,467
for a day.

368
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,534
We have to assume
it's been compromised.

369
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,167
That's the third one
that's gone silent.

370
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:13,900
They're picking us off
one by one.

371
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,634
We might want to think
about fighting back.

372
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,034
We can do that, richard.

373
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,867
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,

374
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,234
but once
we take that step,

375
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:22,700
there's no turning back.

376
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:23,934
Excuse me,

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,967
but shouldn't there be
bars on these windows?

378
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,267
The point is

379
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,301
to be unobtrusive,
dr. Burkhoff.

380
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,867
Well, this seems

381
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,434
a little lax to me.

382
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,767
Most of you are 4400s.

383
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,201
I'm a collaborator.

384
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,767
You know what they do
to collaborators?

385
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,434
[Quietly]:
We need to get him working.

386
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,467
It calms him down considerably.

387
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,934
We cleared out a room for you.

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Anything you need,
just let us know.

389
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,234
What i need is a clean 4400,

390
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,534
one that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor.

391
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,434
I don't guess
you've got one of those, do you?

392
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,934
Actually, i might.

393
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,833
20 years,

394
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,067
i've never seen you pour a drink
on government property.

395
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:22,134
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.

396
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,100
Conscience bothering you,
dennis?

397
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,601
Hell, yes...

398
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:29,934
it is...

399
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,501
and given the circumstances,
i'd say that's a good sign,

400
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:35,668
but i'm trying to focus
on my job, tom...

401
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,833
and i need the same from you.

402
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,800
But sometimes when you...

403
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,534
you look for one thing,
you...

404
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:44,867
you learn something else.

405
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,301
You know how it is, dennis.

406
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>[Ryland]:
I know exactly what you mean.</i>

407
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,401
<i>I've learned some things
myself.</i>

408
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,401
Open it.

409
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,401
Knowledge is a burden, huh, tom?

410
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,067
<i>Did you think</i>

411
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,401
<i>that i would release kyle
from quarantine</i>

412
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:19,034
<i>and not keep an eye on him?</i>

413
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,167
Why didn't you stop this?

414
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:22,634
Because i didn't know

415
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,167
exactly what kyle
was going to do.

416
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,601
I just sort of let the future
play out.

417
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,534
Isn't that what
you're always talking about?

418
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:29,867
You set up roy marsden.

419
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,634
That was my gift to you, tom.

420
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,833
Would you rather

421
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,000
i just turn these over
to my bosses?

422
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,467
I would rather
you be the friend...

423
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,067
you be the ryland
i worked with for 20 years.

424
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,034
I haven't changed.

425
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,367
I have a tough job,
and i'm doing my best,

426
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,534
and as your boss,

427
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,000
and as your friend,

428
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,767
i expect support.

429
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,833
Kyle hated quarantine.

430
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,777
???????

431
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,934
They know.

432
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,733
Ntac knows
you shot collier.

433
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
What? How?

434
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,334
They've known all along.
They let it happen.

435
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,100
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.

436
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,067
I'm going to call
alana's friends.

437
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:33,934
You're sending me to spain?

438
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,201
If they come
after you,

439
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:37,467
i need you to be ready
to leave right away.

440
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,301
Did you hear roy marsden's
being sent to jail for life?

441
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,334
They set him up.

442
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,334
But if i run...

443
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,067
just one thing at a time, kyle.

444
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,733
Let me worry about you,
then i will deal with marsden.

445
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,867
So you want me
to start packing?

446
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,034
Yeah, kyle!

447
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,833
Aren't you
hearing me?

448
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,934
[Diana]: He committed suicide?

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,501
I know that max was under
a lot of strain, but...

450
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:06,700
he had

451
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,833
all those people's lives
in his hands.

452
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,167
Maia's...

453
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,767
i know,

454
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,201
but dr. Pinero's been
hudson's number two

455
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,700
from the very beginning.

456
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,134
He knows everything
that hudson knew.

457
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,634
We're still going to
beat this thing.

458
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,634
Good morning, tom.

459
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,034
Nina.

460
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,301
Here.

461
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,568
I grabbed this
out of your mail cubby.

462
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:24,900
Did you hear
about hudson?

463
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,167
Yeah.

464
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,267
You okay?

465
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,401
They're calling it
a suicide.

466
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,800
What are you calling it?

467
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,733
Tom, look at this.

468
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,767
It's from max.

469
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,867
"Firewall memo."

470
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:37,900
What is that?

471
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,967
I don't know.

472
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,201
Why are you doing this,
isabelle?

473
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,568
Mommy needs to know.

474
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:45,700
I brought you here
so we could be safe.

475
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,800
Don't you want that?

476
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:47,833
[Pounding on door]

477
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,967
Lily, what's going on
out here?

478
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,067
You okay?

479
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,234
No. Go away!

480
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,668
I told you not to come here!

481
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,100
That's why i'm here.

482
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,534
Lily, please, let me in.

483
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,534
How do i know you're real?

484
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:57,534
What are you
talking about?

485
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,534
Of course i'm real.

486
00:19:58,601 --> 00:19:59,700
Did carol leave you?

487
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,000
Why would she leave me?

488
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,534
Lily, i'm coming in,
okay?

489
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,867
No. No!

490
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:06,000
No!

491
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,534
Lily... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

492
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,601
Lily...

493
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,501
put down the knife. Please.

494
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:11,934
I just came
to check on you guys,

495
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,401
make sure
you were okay.

496
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:15,767
Look, it's me.

497
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,767
Brian.

498
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,767
Put the knife down.

499
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:30,034
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want?

500
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,201
No!

501
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,401
Stop it, isabelle!

502
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,134
Lily, i heard screaming.
What is going on?

503
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,534
Brian...

504
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,467
if you're real,
you've got to get me out.

505
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:48,467
Isabelle
doesn't want to be here.

506
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,967
Firewall...

507
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:52,234
it's a program,
a safety net.

508
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,434
That's how
you keep viruses

509
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,467
off your hard drive.

510
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,100
Okay, did you ever see a memo

511
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,100
with the word "firewall"
written in the subject line?

512
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,601
No, but i don't read
most of the memos

513
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,568
that circulate
around here anyway.

514
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:04,800
Look, how long
are you guys

515
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,967
going to be
working in here?

516
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,568
What, are they painting
your offices?

517
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,733
We need a little privacy, okay?

518
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,401
Tom, this memo,
whatever it is,

519
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,833
i doubt it ever went out
on a general distribution,

520
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,234
and every copy probably went
through the shredder

521
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:15,301
months ago.

522
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,634
So if there's no hard copy,

523
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,601
and if marco is the only one
we even trust

524
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,134
to even
talk about it with,

525
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:20,467
then we're at a dead end.

526
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:21,634
We could always
march into ryland's office

527
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,800
and ask him about it.

528
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,067
[Marco]: The guy
does know memos.

529
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,634
When he was working here,

530
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,501
i must have thrown away,
like, 15 every day.

531
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,167
More like 20.

532
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:29,501
He liked to
keep his keyboard burning.

533
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,900
Who, ryland?

534
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:31,767
Yeah.

535
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,767
He didn't type.

536
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,067
He used to
call me in sometimes

537
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,401
when he froze up
his computer.

538
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,134
Hunt-and-peck city.

539
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:38,867
Took him 10 minutes
to type in an email address.

540
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,000
Ryland dictated everything
to his secretary.

541
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,767
She had "l" level
security clearance.

542
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:46,833
Look.

543
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,601
"D.r. /j.o."

544
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:49,767
Everything says
"d.r. /j.o."

545
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,267
"D.r.,"
dennis ryland.

546
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:52,534
And "j.o." is jane orman.

547
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:53,800
She worked for him
for 22 years.

548
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,167
Did she stay in seattle?

549
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,267
Say hi for me.

550
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,000
Lily.

551
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,034
You came back.

552
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,700
Are you all right?

553
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,733
[Lily]: I thought
i was doing

554
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,767
the smart thing,

555
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,334
but isabelle...

556
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,234
what happened?

557
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,733
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place...

558
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
i don't know.

559
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,034
Hey.

560
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,067
Did you miss daddy?

561
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:38,367
Yeah?

562
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,134
Well,
he missed you.

563
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,767
Both of you.

564
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,501
Listen, i'm, uh...

565
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:45,534
i'm going to take off.

566
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:46,668
Brian...

567
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,267
thank you...

568
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,100
for everything.

569
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,800
Hey, uh...

570
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:55,401
do me a favor...

571
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,900
forget this address,

572
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,501
forget about
all of us,

573
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:00,568
and i'll forget

574
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,100
you drove off with my wife

575
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,767
in the middle
of the night.

576
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,967
Good luck, lil.

577
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,000
Hey, i've been
calling you all day.

578
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,934
There's a guy here
who thinks that isabelle...

579
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,234
excuse me.

580
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:17,301
Didn't anyone hear
that car pull up...

581
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,833
is that her?

582
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,134
I think
there's somebody here

583
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,634
who wants to meet you.

584
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,800
This is isabelle.

585
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,201
What are we
supposed to say?

586
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,568
"You know that
massive conspiracy

587
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:41,534
"to suppress
the abilities

588
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:42,833
"of the 4400?

589
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,067
"We were just
kind of hoping

590
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,234
you would fill us in
on the particulars."

591
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,634
Yeah,
"and don't be nervous,

592
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,967
"but we had to shake
a government tail

593
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,334
on the way here
to do it."

594
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,100
Yeah, sounds
like a start.

595
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,568
Tom baldwin.

596
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,034
Long time, jane.

597
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,601
Do you remember my partner,
diana skouris?

598
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:58,501
Of course.

599
00:23:58,568 --> 00:23:59,967
Yeah. Hi.

600
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:01,568
I always wondered
who would show up.

601
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,800
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.

602
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:07,733
You're here about firewall,
right?

603
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,733
????

604
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,301
The inhibitor
hasn't been tested.

605
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,367
It is not ready.

606
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:19,401
[Ryland]:
One of the 4400

607
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,833
is a serial killer

608
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,100
who was using,
i don't know,

609
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,700
some kind
of mind control

610
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,668
to get people
to commit murder.

611
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,568
The inhibitor's ready.

612
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,833
This is wrong, dennis.

613
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,467
We are beyond
right and wrong here!

614
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,900
There's no precedent for this.

615
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,967
Now, d.c.'s been advised
of the operation.

616
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,434
It's been approved
at the highest level.

617
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:40,134
There is nothing further
to discuss, is there?

618
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,934
I am not doing this.

619
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,234
I took it home with me
that night.

620
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:57,467
The next day,
i put in my notice.

621
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:58,568
I mean, you have to understand,

622
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,134
for two decades,

623
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,401
i thought that dennis ryland
was the finest man i ever met,

624
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,967
and after i read this,
i couldn't work for him anymore.

625
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:07,668
I kept telling myself
i should send it somewhere...

626
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,334
the newspapers, or...

627
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,334
i don't know...

628
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,668
but the names

629
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,067
that signed off
on this...

630
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:14,434
i was just a secretary.

631
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:17,334
What could i do
against those names?

632
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:18,733
It's all here.

633
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,601
Did you see the names?

634
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:21,833
When maia said,

635
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,134
"mommy's bosses are
going to be punished,"

636
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:24,234
i had no idea
she meant

637
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,434
all the way up
the chain of command.

638
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:26,501
We can't go public yet.

639
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,568
What?

640
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:28,700
We can't go public yet.

641
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,900
Listen, the faster
this gets exposed,

642
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:30,767
the better it is
for maia, alana, shawn...

643
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,900
all of them.

644
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,100
No more secrets.

645
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,201
No more relying
on the people who did this

646
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,367
to find a cure.

647
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,434
At the very least,

648
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,234
they're going to
have to rescind

649
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:38,401
the quarantine order.

650
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:39,867
Diana,
ryland's got something on me.

651
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,201
Ryland?

652
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,668
This entire memo
is over his signature.

653
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:45,668
What could he possibly
have over you?

654
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,668
He knows
kyle killed jordan collier.

655
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:49,934
What?

656
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,467
That night
on highland beach,

657
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:52,900
they put someone inside of him,
or some program...

658
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,067
i don't know...

659
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:55,201
directing his actions,

660
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:56,601
and ryland has evidence.

661
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm sorry, tom,

662
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,067
but i can't just sit on this!

663
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:04,501
Maia's getting sicker!

664
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,100
Just give me one hour, diana.

665
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,201
Just one hour.

666
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,034
Please.

667
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:16,800
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, kyle.

668
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,000
If i go through
with this,

669
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,134
they're going to
come after you,

670
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,401
and it doesn't matter

671
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:21,833
if you're in spain
or siberia.

672
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,067
I know, but with all those lives
at stake,

673
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:24,434
you have to do it.

674
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,434
Okay, i'm taking you
to the airport.

675
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,800
Dad...

676
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:30,267
i'm not going anywhere.

677
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,501
This actually makes it easier.

678
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:36,034
I didn't know
how i was going to tell you.

679
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,967
Tell me what?

680
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:40,534
I can't live like this anymore.

681
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,634
I can't live
knowing that guy is in jail.

682
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,800
I go through every day

683
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,733
trying to pretend
it's all normal,

684
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,100
but it's just a cover-up.

685
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,767
I can't let you do it, kyle.

686
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,934
Marsden shot at me.

687
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,167
He, uh...
he shot at other cops too.

688
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:01,000
Even if you confess, kyle,
he is still going to jail.

689
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:04,401
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.

690
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,767
Look what it did
to your boss.

691
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,267
Ryland used to be your friend.

692
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,700
It's over, dad.

693
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:11,100
No more lies.

694
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,301
I can't do it anymore.
I just can't do it.

695
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,700
Okay? You can't stop me.

696
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,201
Okay?

697
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,334
Don't you do anything
until i get back.

698
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:23,800
You hear me?

699
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,467
[Ryland]: This is
the right thing,

700
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,301
the heroic thing,

701
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:38,867
and being a hero
comes with some perks.

702
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,867
You tell me
what i need to know,

703
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,601
i'll see that
you're transferred

704
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:44,167
to a private
quarantine facility

705
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:45,501
this afternoon.

706
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:46,934
You can
walk the grounds,

707
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
you can choose
your own meals...

708
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,733
what's wrong with that?

709
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:57,167
139 lebanon street.

710
00:27:58,234 --> 00:28:00,800
That's where
they told me to go.

711
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,000
The inhibitor

712
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:03,900
is piggybacking
on glucose.

713
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,467
It enters the brain

714
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:07,700
through facilitated
diffusion.

715
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,267
It's a binding protein.

716
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,501
That's how
they did it...

717
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,534
i'll take your word for it.

718
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:12,833
But this serum

719
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,034
has pure promicin
in it.

720
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,733
It can neutralize the charge.

721
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,134
The inhibitor won't be able
to cross membranes anymore.

722
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,167
We can flush it
out of their systems.

723
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,501
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away?

724
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,700
Please.

725
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,967
Stop saying "disease."

726
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:27,934
For the last time,
it's a side effect.

727
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,134
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.

728
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,733
It'll happen
virtually instantly.

729
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,934
So this substance...

730
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,167
promicin.

731
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:38,900
It's what makes you people
unique.

732
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,501
How did you get it
out of my daughter?

733
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,833
She has trace amounts of it

734
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,301
in her bloodstream.

735
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,334
Before the inhibitor,
you all did.

736
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,367
That's how they found it

737
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,634
in the first place...

738
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,334
but...

739
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,267
she's an infant.

740
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:54,401
I could only draw
enough blood...

741
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:57,167
to make one shot.

742
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:58,634
If you can get that
into quarantine,

743
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,234
one shot might be all you need.

744
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:08,301
Nina, where's ryland?

745
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:11,434
A 4400 gave up
the seattle safe house.

746
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,501
They're on their way
to take it down.

747
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Excuse me.

748
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,367
Please don't shoot.

749
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:24,634
Dr. Burkhoff,
why would we shoot you?

750
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,367
I have no idea,

751
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,501
but i'm feeling
a little insecure right now.

752
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,434
I brought something
for you.

753
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:36,100
Whatever you do, don't drop it.

754
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:44,934
<i>Everybody in this house</i>

755
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
<i>is subject
to quarantine and arrest</i>

756
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,601
<i>under emergency order 74.</i>

757
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:52,867
<i>You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.</i>

758
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,067
<i>If not,</i>

759
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:56,800
<i>we'll come in and get you.</i>

760
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,234
There's an army out there.

761
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,267
Ryland!

762
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,701
Call it off.

763
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:05,800
It's over.

764
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,000
Quarantine. Everything.

765
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,467
Agent baldwin
is obstructing justice.

766
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:09,734
Arrest him.

767
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:13,534
I don't think so,
dennis.

768
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,267
????

769
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:24,301
Keep your weapon on him.

770
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,867
You're really willing
to give up your son?

771
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,833
Kyle's turning himself in.

772
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,234
He can't live with the cover-up.

773
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,601
When i wrote that memo,

774
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,967
we had no idea where
the 4400 were from

775
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,167
or why they were
brought back.

776
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:40,334
Dr. Hudson
gave me information.

777
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:42,367
I acted on it, tom.

778
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:45,334
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.

779
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,434
Hi.

780
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,567
I've got some
medicine for you.

781
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,067
To be honest with you,

782
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:00,800
i'd rather be giving this
to maia,

783
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,167
but a crazy neuroscientist
told me

784
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:03,567
that that was not
the right thing to do,

785
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,067
so if you don't mind
holding still

786
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:07,734
for a minute...

787
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,167
you saw orson bailey
up close and personal.

788
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,701
Oliver knox.

789
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:16,467
You know what these people
were capable of.

790
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:18,401
Hell, i attached your reports
to the memo

791
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,900
when i sent it to d.c.

792
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,900
But we learned better, dennis.

793
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,301
Highland beach?

794
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,434
"Save the future?"

795
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:27,267
Heartfelt message, tom,

796
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,668
and while they were
giving it to you,

797
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,134
they were
programming your son

798
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,833
to commit murder.

799
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,100
Does that sound to you

800
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,401
like they were
guiding us toward eden?

801
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,567
I don't know,

802
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:36,933
but i sure as hell

803
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
don't want to go
where you're taking me.

804
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,900
Goddammit, tom!

805
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,301
What does it even mean,
"save the future?"

806
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,833
Save the future how?

807
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,301
Kill us all?

808
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,534
Start over
with a smaller,

809
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:48,234
more evolved
population?

810
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,134
Is that an outcome
you can live with?

811
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,668
What can you
live with, dennis?

812
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:53,267
Was max hudson really a suicide,

813
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,967
or did you pull
that little string too?

814
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:56,967
And what about me,
dennis?

815
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,200
Because if you're
holding on to any hope

816
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,034
of keeping this covered up,

817
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,768
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground

818
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,134
right here and right now.

819
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,833
<i>[Ryland]: tom, you're reducing
the fate of the planet</i>

820
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,734
<i>to a question
of your personal faith.</i>

821
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,267
<i>Without the inhibitor program,</i>

822
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,000
<i>who the hell knows
what'll happen?</i>

823
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,367
Who the hell ever knows?

824
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,534
Very wise.

825
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:42,567
Pithy.

826
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:44,601
But if the world
turns out to be a place

827
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:46,734
of unchecked
4400 abilities,

828
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,334
i hope we don't live
to regret it.

829
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:55,701
Stand down!

830
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,434
We're done here.

831
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,134
You can all go home now.

832
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,034
Thomas.
Alana.

833
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,867
Alana.

834
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,067
What happened here?

835
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:00,134
A miracle.

836
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,568
Welcome home, baby.

837
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:29,833
Home...

838
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,401
i never even unpacked.

839
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,301
We'll take care of that
right now.

840
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,601
Where's kyle?

841
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:36,867
I can't wait
to see him.

842
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,501
Yeah, i told him
you were coming home.

843
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,301
Hey, kyle!
We're back!

844
00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:58,034
Hey, kyle.

845
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,501
Man, i never thought

846
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,867
i was going
to see you again.

847
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,501
You're okay, right?

848
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,733
I feel like i did
15 keg stands last night,

849
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,833
but yeah,
pretty much.

850
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,501
We all are.

851
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,900
Dr. Burkhoff
took blood samples

852
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,934
from the people that i healed.

853
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,467
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...

854
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,900
hey, you guys
kind of lucked out, huh?

855
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,167
"Lucked out?"

856
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,700
There's 23 of us dead,

857
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,700
and they don't even have
a final count yet.

858
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:26,867
I don't think that was
part of the plan,

859
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,034
you know?

860
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,467
That's not why
they brought us back.

861
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:31,700
This whole idea

862
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,134
that there's some kind
of plan...

863
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:34,568
i don't know.

864
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,501
I wish
i could believe that.

865
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,634
Just trust me when i say

866
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,367
that there's a plan,
it's important,

867
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,534
and every 4400 is a part of it.

868
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,733
Shawn...

869
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,967
i killed jordan collier.

870
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,234
[Softly]: What?

871
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,668
I bought a rifle,

872
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,134
i went up on that roof,
took out two government agents,

873
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:52,467
and then i shot him.

874
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,100
Remember
when i was in trouble?

875
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,367
Losing chunks of time?

876
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,501
That's what i was doing.

877
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,467
Planning out an assassination.

878
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,601
Why?

879
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:01,201
You think i know?

880
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:03,201
There's something inside me,
shawn...

881
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:04,867
or someone.

882
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:06,467
It takes over.

883
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:07,900
Those people
who took you?

884
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,301
If they have a plan,

885
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,000
it includes
me killing jordan collier.

886
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:12,467
That's not true, kyle!

887
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:13,867
Then why did they
make me do it?

888
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,034
Why did they
ruin my life?

889
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,234
I'm about
to go to prison

890
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,668
for the people
you worship.

891
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,833
You murdered jordan?

892
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,367
I didn't mean...

893
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,167
i didn't even know
what i was doing, shawn.

894
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:24,267
I'm sorry.

895
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:27,067
I'm so sorry.

896
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,934
Kyle...

897
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,800
Stop... shawn...

898
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:07,867
what are you doing?

899
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,733
Stop it.

900
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,700
You're killing me.
