1
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:39,659
we are not a threat

2
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,023
we are salvation

3
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:43,543
the world will have to deal with us

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
Previously on the 4400...

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,800
you know those visions that maia used to have?

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,300
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
How long have you known?

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary.

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,000
You're one of those 4400 guys. huh?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One day.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
all of this will be yours.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,500
But you're not going anywhere.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Whatever you do. shawn.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
don't reveal your healing ability.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,400
because if you heal one of them.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,700
you'll have to heal them all.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
I'm blacking out.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,500
If you're losing chunks of time.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
you should talk to your dad about it.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,500
What's he going to do.
turn me over to ntac medical?

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,800
Can I help you?

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,000
Heidi.it's mommy.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,200
Who?

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
That's okay. sweetie. I got it.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,000
She's my daughter.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
She doesn't know that.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,300
She thinks carol is her mother.

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
Brian. look. I need your help.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
Richard. he's been arrested.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,400
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,500
Hello. richard.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,800
I want you to come home.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
If I'm lying.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
isabelle will punish me accordingly.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,100
If isabelle accepts me.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,500
well. then I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,300
Let her judge me.

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Hush-a-bye.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
hush-a-bye

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,900
go to sleep little baby

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,500
when you wake I'll give you cake

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,900
and all the pretty little horses

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,300
and go to sleep-y little baby

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
who's a special girl?

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
Is isabelle a special girl? Is she?

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,400
Come here.

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,500
Look at him with isabelle.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,900
This keeps up.
we're going to have to start calling him "uncle jordan.

49
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,800
" There's something so wrong about that.
Isn't there?

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,900
A week ago.
he was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,300
-and now it's like...
- they've bonded.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,100
She's really taken to him.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is that the couple of the hour?

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hi.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,700
Richard. what's up. man?

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,200
It's good to see you.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Look at you. Oh.
you look great. You look great.

58
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,100
So how long do you guys think you're going to be staying?

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,100
We're not sure.

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,300
Collier said we could stay at the center till we get back on our feet.

61
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,900
Did he get you squared away with ntac?

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
Started to.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
His lawyers took our statements.

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,300
I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in.

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Well. hey.
I'm sure jordan will take care of it.

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,900
He offered to.
but I think we're going to try and swing it ourselves.

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Well. hey. you picked the right week to come.

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
This reunion thing's going to be big. huh?

69
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
Three more maybes.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,700
There haven't been this many of us in the same place since quarantine.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
What's happened since we left town?

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean. suddenly it seems like
everyone's dying to meet a real. live 4400.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Yeah. well. what happened? Jordan happened.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Welcome to the revolution. little lady.Huh?

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,200
He's going to die! I saw it.
He's going to die.

77
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Sweetheart. are you okay?

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Did you have a nightmare?

79
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,600
No. I was awake. and I saw it.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,500
Tell us what you saw.

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
That man we watched on tv once.

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,900
What man?

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Him.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,900
Jordan collier?

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,900
Someone's going to kill him.

86
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:21,614

89
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
As far as this department knew.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,200
maia wasn't having visions anymore.

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Right?

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Well. she was keeping them secret from me

93
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
and writing everything down in a diary.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
but I'm not here to talk about my daughter.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
We're here to talk about collier.

96
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,600
We could talk about him all you want.

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
but if I was collier.

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,169
I'd be bringing all my books back to the library.

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,105
If you know what i'm mean.

100
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,700
The kid's never wrong. right?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Look. as far as I can tell.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
maia has two kinds of visions.

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
If she can see an event clearly enough in her head.

104
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,300
she can sometimes influence the course of the future.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,900
But mostly her visions are abstract.

106
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,000
They're more like...

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,700
certainties.

108
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Prophecies.
I guess you could call them.

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,600
Now. this is one of those.

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
and as far as I can tell.

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
they're never wrong.

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,300
Well. not yet. anyway.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,700
but nobody's made a concerted effort
to stop one of them from happening.

114
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,200
So we could always offer collier a suite in the basement.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,600
24-hour surveillance. and a food taster.

116
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Sure. we just tell the guy
he needs to stay isolated for what.

117
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,200
a week?

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,900
A year?

119
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,600
When it comes to the prevention of future crime.

120
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,700
there are no time limits-- and everyone's a suspect.

121
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
I mean. literally everyone.

122
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
So how to stop the inevitable from happening?

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Stopping the inevitable--

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
isn't that what we deal with every day?

125
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,500
I mean. that's why the 4400 were sent back. right?

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,500
I like the "can-do" attitude.

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
but I have to ask--

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
do we even want to save collier?

129
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,900
Well. he is kind of the bad guy.

130
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,400
Maybe that's the way the future wants it.

131
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,800
Unless they gave us this message as a way to stop collier's death from happening.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Fascinating.

133
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,400
What an extraordinary gift.

134
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
You are clear on what we're telling you?

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
Your daughter

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Her latest vision involves my death.
I leave anything out?

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,200
No. that about covers it.

139
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,500
Ntac is offering you all its resources.

140
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,800
That means round-the-clock protection.threat assessment

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
and I'm meant. of course. to isolate myself?

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Well. that would be the safest move.

143
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's say I'm willing to assume good faith on your part-- which.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,900
given your exploitation of the 4400 to get to me.
is rather generous...

145
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
what. you think we made this up?

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm not sure you're that creative.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,200
but your plan does call for my total withdrawal from the public eye

148
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest

149
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,500
in the 4400 that's been months in the planning.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,100
Our history with each other is what it is.

151
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,400
but this is real.

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,900
and denial is not a luxury you can afford.

153
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Thank you for the information.
I'll keep it in mind.

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Maia is never wrong.

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Whatever protection you can afford me.
I can afford myself.

156
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,600
Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out.

157
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,300
The foreign returnees' stories are particularly inspirational.

158
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Still come here every thursday. huh?

159
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,200
Thought I might get lucky.

160
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,000
Lily.

161
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm back in seattle.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
I just wanted to thank you for helping richard.

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Just a couple of phone calls.
It was no big deal.

165
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,800
We were in a bad spot.

166
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,700
You did what you could. It meant a lot.

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Well. you really didn't have to get me anything.

168
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,000
It's actually for heidi.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Her birthday's coming up.

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,900
Oh.lily...

171
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
it's just a cool little handbag.

172
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
You don't have to tell her it's from me.

173
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
I don't want to mess with your life. brian.

174
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm just trying to say "thank you."

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

176
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,800
You're looking well.lily.

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm glad things are working out.

178
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
I can't talk to first keys today.

179
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
There's too much going on with this party.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,300
But class starts in 10 minutes.

181
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,600
I can't do it. lucy.

182
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,700
You're just going to have to tell them to think of it as a study hall.

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,200
Um...this is outgoing. Thank you.

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
You guys come for the tour?

185
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,900
Could we talk to you outside?

186
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,500
Kind of a bad day.
It's pretty crazy around here.

187
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
Told you he'd blow us off.

188
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
What's up?

189
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
Oh. liv.

190
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
They were too embarrassed to come inside.

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,500
I can'T. I can'T.

192
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,600
But I saw what you can do.

193
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,900
We all did.

194
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,000
You can heal people.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Listen. it's not that simple.
I can't heal everyone.

196
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm not asking you to heal everyone.

197
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,000
Just them.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,100
You don't understand. It's like it drains me.

199
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
I can do it for maybe one. maybe.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
One is better than none.

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
And who chooses that one. way? You? Me?

202
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
I can't heal the world. I'm sorry.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
What'd I tell you?

204
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,900
Waste of time...

205
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,800
don't look at me like that.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,500
Kyle?

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,200
Hey.you with us. buddy?

208
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
I thought you were...

210
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
you know. elsewhere.

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
No. I'm right here with you.
was just thinking. Relax.

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days.

213
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm hoping that's all done.

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah. I do too.

215
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,900
But I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself checked out.

216
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,400
You want to go with me to see the kills?

217
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
Okay.
so we're ignoring the whole blackout thing. or...

218
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
pretty much.

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
They go on at 8:00.

220
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,700
You should come.

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
The tsa is putting a flag on ian dravitt and his known associates.

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,100
They'll call us if anyone shows up in seattle.

223
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,000
This whole dravitt thing is just collier's latest deal gone south.

224
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,500
Collier had his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he was 30.

225
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,800
You pursue power that ruthlessly.
you pick up some enemies along the way.

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,600
So we find the one who seems most like john hinckley or sirhan sirhan.

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
And then do what?

228
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Follow him around for the rest of his natural life?

229
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,600
We could spend the next year looking at collier's moves since he founded the center.

230
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
The guy had a whole career before he got abducted.

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,700
Or maybe it is coming from someone who collier's never met.

232
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
I mean. if you hate the 4400.

233
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,200
killing their figurehead's a good way to make them suffer.

234
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,000
But what are we supposed to do?

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,900
The potential victim has refused our help.

236
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,400
No one said stopping the future was going to be easy.

237
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Diana. look at this.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
His name is miles quinlan.

239
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,300
Claims collier bankrupted him.
then kicked him out of the center.

240
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,800
Lives with his parents

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,100
What.

242
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
nursing a persecution complex?

243
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,900
Pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,900
Come on. maia.
I've named every guy

245
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,100
I've dated for like the last five years.

246
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you telling me I don't have a future with any of them?

247
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,000
I wouldn't worry about it.

248
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,500
Seems like you meet a lot of boys.

249
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Yeah. well.that's the trouble.

250
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm tired of meeting boys.

251
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
I want to meet a man.

252
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
You will.

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
When?

254
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Aunt april.

255
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,300
just because I don't see it doesn't mean it's not going to happen.

256
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,100
Oh. that's probably mrs. Bradshaw from upstairs.

257
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,000
She's going to watch you tonight while I go to work.

258
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
It's not my fault.

260
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,900
You recognize me.

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,800
You're jordan collier.

262
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,700
I didn't mean to frighten her.

263
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.

264
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,600
Yeah. well.
doesn't look like that's going to happen.

265
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
She believes I'm going to die.

266
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,900
Please give her my apologies.

267
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,700
I brought this for her.

268
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,900
I hope she doesn't already have one.

269
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Thanks.

270
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,500
Hi. I'm lily tyler.

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,800
- I think someone was asking for me-
- excuse me.

272
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Heidi...

273
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,700
are you my mother?

274
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
I heard them fighting about you.

275
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,500
My mom and dad... carol.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,900
It's okay that I still call her "mom." right?

277
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,000
I know it's confusing. baby.

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Just 'cause they're talking in the other room doesn't mean I can't hear them.

279
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,100
They said you were one of the 4400.

280
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,700
That's why I was gone.

281
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,500
That's why we don't know each other.

282
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,000
Didn't you come to our house once?

283
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,400
It's the first thing I did when I got back.

284
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,500
I wanted to see you.

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,300
But your dad and I.
we weren't sure it was a good idea.

286
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Sweetie. does your father know you came down here?

287
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,600
No.

288
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,900
I didn't tell them I heard.

289
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
I didn't go to school today.

290
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:29,900
I came here instead.

291
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm glad you did.

292
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Was it hard for you not to see me?

293
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,900
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

294
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,300
I think about you every single day.

295
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,600
Look at this.

296
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,600
Is that me?

297
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
That was the day we brought you back from the hospital.

298
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,600
You look the same as you do now.

299
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,800
I was gone so long.but...

300
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
to me...

301
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,300
this feels like yesterday.

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,200
You want to talk about collier?

303
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.

304
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
Is that why you left the center?

305
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,100
I didn't leave. They threw me out.

306
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
That's what happens when you run out of money.

307
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
They have all these different levels.
They call them keys. right?

308
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,900
You make seventh key. you're unlocked.

309
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,500
"Unlocked"-- meaning you've got your own 4400 ability?

310
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Well. that's the big prize.
only they set it up so no one ever gets there.

311
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,100
There's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass.

312
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,000
If you're not one of the 4400. each one costs.

313
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
First I ate up my savings.

314
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
then I cashed out the equity in my house.

315
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,500
And they didn't deliver.

316
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,800
Soon as the first check bounced.

317
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,700
they told me I'd reached maximum potential and sent me on my way.

318
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Is that why you applied for a handgun permit?

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
We ran a vicap check on you this morning.

320
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
So I bought a gun. So what?

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
I need to protect myself from collier.

322
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Yeah. well.
I hope self-defense is all you have in mind.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
because if you're planning anything else.

324
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,600
we will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center.

325
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,600
You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that.

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,700
You're simplifying the issue.

327
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,500
Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety.

328
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
It's a start.

329
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,500
Jordan. you just told me there's a little girl out there

330
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,800
who can see the future and she saw you dead.

331
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,500
It's time to make yourself scarce.

332
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
And where does it stop?

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Do I stay away from the center?

334
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I cut myself off from our work?

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Yeah. if it means staying alive.

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,900
I am not going to become a hermit.

337
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,100
That is not a win for us.

338
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Look. the center is significantly safer than it seems.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Half the people you see in workmen's uniforms are bodyguards.

340
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,400
Are you looking to die in public?

341
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
You're developing a real flair for drama.

342
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,300
you know. This is hanging over my head.
not yours.

343
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,300
Look. I'm sorry. jordan.I'm just-

344
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,600
I am not ready to become a martyr.

345
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,700
And you don't have to be.

346
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,700
I know you've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time.

347
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Bringing all the 4400 together.

348
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,900
it's like a validation for everything you've done so far.

349
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,000
But if something happens to you.

350
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
it could undo everything that we've started.

351
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,500
The movement's not ready for you to be a martyr.either.

352
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,100
Just

353
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,900
go. Go.

354
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,300
Where'd you go? I was about to have them page you.

355
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Richard. there's someone I want to introduce to you.

356
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,300
This is my daughter.

357
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,900
heidi.

358
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,900
She came to the center to meet me. We've been talking.

359
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,300
Well.

360
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,100
it's very nice to meet you.

361
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm richard tyler.I'm married to lily-

362
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
- your mother.

363
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
She told me.

364
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,900
It's nice to meet you. too.

365
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,500
Is that...

366
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
isabelle.

367
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,600
This is your half-sister.

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
Don't be scared.

369
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
She must be hungry.

371
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,300
It's okay.

372
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
I should probably get home anyway.

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
Well. I hope I can see you again.

374
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,700
I hope so. too.

375
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Maybe next time I can hold isabelle.

376
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
I bet we could make that happen.

377
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,900
I'll walk you out.

378
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
No more cutting school. okay?

379
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,100
What's the matter?

380
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,600
All I'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him.

381
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,200
Well. tall or short.
collier had no business showing up here.

382
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I totally agree. Di.
I didn't let him in.

383
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
Aunt april likes tall boys.

384
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh. So you're talking about men to my daughter?

385
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
She's a child.

386
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,400
It might have come up in passing.

387
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,900
Hey. mom?
How come you never go out on dates?

388
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,600
Well. I wouldn't say never.

389
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,500
But aunt april Goes out all the time.

390
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,400
Well. I think your aunt's an extreme example.

391
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
How do I know which one is right?

392
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Not many or lots?

393
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,200
I think that you should probably shoot for somewhere in the middle.

394
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll try.

395
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
But do dates always have to be with boys?

396
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
They're so gross.

397
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
You get used to them.

398
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
Can we have this conversation. like in two or three.

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,700
maybe 10 years?

400
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,500
What's that?

401
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh. A lady dropped it off today.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Oh It's a subpoena.

403
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
What's that?

404
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,100
Well. it's when someone wants you to give them something.

405
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
Who's it from?

406
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
It's from my bosses.

407
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
What do they want?

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,300
Your diary.

409
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Kyle! You okay. man?

410
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
You didn't have a drink. did you?

411
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Just diet coke.

412
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,300
It's really loud in there. huh?

413
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah. but they're great. huh?

414
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
You want to go back in?

415
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,200
Come on. My buddy's saving us a spot by the stage.

416
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,500
Do you know what time it is?

417
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
What are you doing here?

418
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,800
Kyle! Do you know what time it is?

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,800
What are you doing outside my apartment?

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't know. I was at the pub.

421
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,900
You're scaring me.
How long have you been out here?

422
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't know...
I think I was digging or something.

423
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,900
Look. kyle. I think you should go.

424
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,000
- We can talk about this-
- I'm sorry.

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,100
I didn't mean to scare you.
It just happened again.

426
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,200
Let me in.

427
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,600
Get your hands off of me! You don't understand.

428
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,100
He's a fraud. All of you.
do you hear me?

429
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,400
Your golden boy is a big fraud.

430
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Liv. you need to calm down.

431
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,600
It's okay. guys. I got it.

432
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,000
My whole life.

433
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,200
I have been looking for just one thing.

434
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,700
just one thing to believe in.

435
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
I thought it was you.

436
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,400
How long ago did you get high?

437
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
You gonna help me up. or what?

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you going to stop yelling at me?

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,300
I am done with you altogether.

440
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,300
Go back to your penthouse.

441
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,200
Pretend we don't exist.

442
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Everyone else does.

443
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,900
Why not you?

444
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Listen...

445
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,800
easy.

446
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm not going to sen d youoff into the night like this.

447
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
You can sleep on my couch.

448
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,400
I got you.

449
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,300
It's okay.

450
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,600
You started all this. you know.

451
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Everything around you took shape after you showed me where to go.

452
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,900
I don't know what to do. though.

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,400
I could count the number of times I've said that on one hand.

454
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but right now it's true.

455
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,900
That's right. If you know anything...

456
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,400
now would be a good time to tell uncle jordan. huh?

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,900
Oh...

458
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
thank you.

459
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,700
Thank you.

460
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
The reunion goes forward.

461
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,500
Diana. One of dravitt's hired guns flew into town last night.

462
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,800
His name is laurent ganning.

463
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Tsa had his alias flagged.

464
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
Well. do we have a present whereabouts?

465
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,700
He just checked into a motel in first hill under the name "lawrence gawain"

466
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
It's clear.

467
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,500
Tom...

468
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,500
he's on the move.

469
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,900
Wendy. wait. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

470
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,400
You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night.

471
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Do you know how weird that is?

472
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't know how I got there. Please. believe me.I-I-

473
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,400
I had another blackout last night.

474
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Look. kyle. this is getting bad.

475
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,500
and I can't give you tHe kind of help that you need.

476
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,300
So you want me to just go away?

477
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,600
No. I...

478
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,800
I want you to talk to someone.

479
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,200
someone qualified.

480
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm scared for you.

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,400
Scared for me or scared of me?

482
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,200
And we are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.

483
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
many of whom risked so much to be here today...
you know. glen.

484
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm getting some nasty echos.

485
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back?

486
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,200
Testing. testing. one. two.three.Testing.

487
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
You know. that's a lot better.

488
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,200
Nobody moves!

489
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,500
Everyone stay right where you are.

490
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
Don't move. Don't move!

491
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,800
Get your hands on your head.

492
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
Get them up. Turn around. Turn around!

493
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Get down. down. Down!

494
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,900
Ganning's pistol was made from synthetic polymers.

495
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
The bullets. too.

496
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,200
He walked it right through your metal
detectors without so much as a peep.

497
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
You were Round to get him.

498
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
He never would have killed me.

499
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,800
He was standing two feet away from you with a loaded firearm.

500
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,200
The whole thing was put in motion by maia.

501
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,300
Your daughter's vision was a gift to me.

502
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,900
a prescription. if you will.
for changing the future.

503
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,100
In one chain of events.
ganning's bullet killed me.

504
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,800
I can only assume that somebody has a different plan for me.

505
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,100
Well. I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet.

506
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,700
I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures.

507
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,800
The same extra measures that just allowed an assassin to walk right up to you.

508
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,100
Would ntac like a presence at the gala tomorrow?

509
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes.

510
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,100
Mr. Collier. we don't stand off to the side and watch.

511
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,400
We take command.

512
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
I'll issue credentials.

513
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,900
That was a rather dramatic demonstration of competence just now.

514
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,800
What time is it?

515
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
It's about 2:00.

516
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,600
How'd I end up here. anyway?

517
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
Liv. you were pretty far gone last night.

518
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,100
but are you really telling me you don't remember?

519
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,900
I remember.

520
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,800
You don't have to hover over me.

521
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,800
I'm not going to steal anything.

522
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,500
The maid can come in and clean the couch as soon as I'm gone.

523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,600
How many of these nights do you think you have left in you?

524
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,500
Hopefully not too many.

525
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
You've seen my life.

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
When I O.D..

527
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,900
It's not gonna be any big loss.

528
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
That is not true.

529
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,300
How's it going to change?

530
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
I used to feel the same way.

531
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,200
I meant what I told you.

532
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,700
I can't save the whole world.

533
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,900
and I can't even save your friends.

534
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,200
and I'm sorry.

535
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,400
but if you're serious about wanting a change.

536
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
maybe I can save you.

537
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,000
How?

538
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,200
By giving you the same thing that saved me.

539
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,000
He's here.

540
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,800
hi.Good to see you.

541
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
Excuse me.

542
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,800
Hello. my love.

543
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,900
Here we go.

544
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,300
I think I have to...

545
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
nice to meet you

546
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,300
Pleasure to see you.

547
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
Excuse me. sir.

548
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
All the guestscheck out so far.

549
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah. we secured the surrounding rooftops.
did a bomb sweep.

550
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,000
So now it's cross-our-fingers time.

551
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100
Yeah.

552
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Good afternoon.

553
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,700
Thank you for coming to the center.

554
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,300
We have a great day planned for you.

555
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
but before we get started.

556
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,600
I'd like to thank the man that made this all possible.

557
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,700
I mean that literally-- he didn't just pay for the food.

558
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,400
He built this place.

559
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,100
and this movement.

560
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,500
so I'd like you to please welcome my mentor.

561
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,800
my friend-- mr. Jordan collier.

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Thank you.

563
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,800
and thank you. shawn.
for that introduction.

564
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,100
We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.

565
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,000
many of whom risked so much to be here today.

566
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Let's go.

567
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,700
I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself.

568
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
Jordan?

569
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,500
He's up there! Go!

570
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,300
Everybody stay down!

571
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
we've got a shooter.

572
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,900
Everyone calm down! Just stay down. Stay down!

573
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,300
We've got a shooter.

574
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
Let me go.

575
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Jordan! Oh. my god!

576
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,300
Oh.god...

577
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,900
please let me go. please!

578
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
get that stretcher ready.

579
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,900
Pulse is weak and thready come on let's go harry up!

580
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,900
Breathing's stopped.

581
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,600
We're losing him again.

582
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,000
No! You're not going anywhere yet.

583
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,400
shawn! She told me to go through with it.

584
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Who did?

585
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
She lies.

586
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,700
No....

587
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,400
don't go anywhereno.....

588
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
-Lily.I need to-
- brian. I don't have much time.

589
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,000
I did not violate our agreement.

590
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,100
Heidi found me.

591
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,900
Lily.

592
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,000
heidi's sick.

593
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
She's in the hospital.

594
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
It happened yesterday.

595
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,100
Something with her spleen.

596
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,800
They had to operate right away.

597
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,200
Is she okay?

598
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,600
Can I see her?

599
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,300
She's okay.

600
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,200
She's still recovering from the anesthesia.

601
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,400
She's been asking for you.

602
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,100
She's still in recovery now.

603
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,100
but carol thinks it's all right if you want to get in there tomorrow.

604
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Brian. what happened?

605
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,100
Her spleen? She's 12 years old.

606
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,300
It just ruptured.

607
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,900
Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
Even they can't tell us why.

608
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,000
Where you been?
The funeral's about to start.

609
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,700
Lily. what's wrong?
What is it?

610
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,500
Heidi's sick.

611
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,100
and I think isabelle's responsible.

612
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,400
I think they're ready for you.

613
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,300
You are going to read a lot about jordan collier in the next few weeks.

614
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,800
some of it good.

615
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
a lot of it bad...

616
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,900
I will be ignoring all of it.

617
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,400
just like jordan would have.

618
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,800
because jordan may have used the media.

619
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,100
but he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.

620
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,400
I could tell you how much I owe the man.

621
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,400
He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone. confused.

622
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,500
I'm sure many of you have similar stories.

623
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,900
The fact is that everyone alive today.

624
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,500
whether they know it or not.
owes jordan collier.

625
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,400
He had a vision to save the future.

626
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,300
and he gave us that vision.

627
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,300
and now he won't be here to see us achieve it...

628
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,100
but we will achieve it.

629
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,300
I promise you.
we will achieve it.

630
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,600
We have all suffered a tremendous loss.

631
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,700
We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside.

632
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,900
but we will not let that stop us.

633
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,000
and I will not let that stop me.

634
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,800
We will honor jordan collier.

635
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,200
and we will create the better future that he died building.

636
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,300
Thank you for coming.

637
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,800
Goodbye.

638
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,100
Nice words. shawn.

639
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,500
I think collier would have approved.

640
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah. I hope so.

641
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,100
He would have liked that you came.

642
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,900
Oh. I don't think I was that high on his radar.

643
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,300
Don't be too sure.

644
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,400
You guys bumped heads.

645
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
but you believed the same thing.

646
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,900
that the 4400 are the key to the future.

647
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
Your goals were identical.

648
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
But our methods were different.

649
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,100
Not as different as you think.

650
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,000
See. that's where your view of jordan collier splits from mine.

651
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,900
Well. at least we have some common ground.

652
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,700
Maybe your side and my side can work together now that I'm assuming new duties around here.

653
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,600
You're becoming quite the little politician. shawn.

654
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,300
Now I know collier would have been proud of you.

655
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
He's gone.

656
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
is body.
it's not there.

657
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Someone stole the body.

658
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,500
There's only one way out.

659
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
and we were standing right in front of it.
Stole it how?

660
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,400
Then what happened?

661
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,800
All lying across the ground

662
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
try not to make no sound

663
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,400
to make or break you down I said

664
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,900
to make or break you down I break

665
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,300
all lying across the ground try not to make no sound

666
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,100
to make or break you down I said

667
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,000
to make or break you down I break

668
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,200
I take down what I need

669
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
'cause you know I need to breathe

670
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,500
I'm tired of walking on another plane

671
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,600
another plane 'cause I feel insane

672
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,100
I step back to get to you

673
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,700
cut back I'm falling through

674
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,100
another day I feel the same

675
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,500
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you
