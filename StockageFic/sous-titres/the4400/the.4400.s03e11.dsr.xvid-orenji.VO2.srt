1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,900
Over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,800
All at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,700
With no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,400
They haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,000
And some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,400
All are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,936
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,984
<i>We're not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>

9
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:43,251
The world will have to deal with us.

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,084
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

11
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,762
the canadian border's
about 30 miles away.

12
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,900
I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.

13
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,951
I didn't want us to end, thomas.

14
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,606
Ever.

15
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:55,418
I'll find a way
to bring you back, i promise.

16
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:56,665
April!

17
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:57,850
Surprised?

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,684
How's it going,
sibling?

19
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,084
Jordan, you just told me
there's a little girl out there

20
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,841
who can see the future, and she saw you dead.

21
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:04,450
Do i stay away from the center?

22
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,517
I cut myself off?

23
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:11,650
Even if you confess, kyle,
he is still going to jail.

24
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:14,600
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.

25
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:15,884
We have to get married.

26
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,151
It's the only way we can be sure we'll
never lose each other.

27
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,384
Shawn!

28
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,850
Shawn farrell!

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,184
Do you know who i am?

30
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:33,650
Get out of the way!

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,817
Jordan!

32
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:35,817
Jordan!

33
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,550
Let us through!
- Jordan!

34
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,650
Jordan!

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,682
Did you see jordan collier
come through here?

36
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:44,262
No, sir.
- Long hair, beard.

37
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,084
Anyone?

38
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,650
You saw him, right?

39
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,750
Yeah.

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,717
Look, i want
this place secure.

41
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,447
No one gets in or out
until i say different.

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,244
Come on.

43
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,500
All right, guys,
let's look around.

44
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,567
Guys, we've been
all over the grounds,

45
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,201
and we can't find anybody.

46
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you sure it was collier?

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,934
It was him.
He looked right at me.

48
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,067
He talked to me.

49
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,700
It did look like him,

50
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,268
but i only saw him
for a second.

51
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:15,234
Well, if he's on foot,
he can't have got far.

52
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,867
I think we should call ntac, get them
to sweep the neighborhood.

53
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,334
Shawn ?

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,634
What's going on?

55
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,867
The ceremony was supposed to start
20 minutes ago.

56
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,567
Richard,
i just saw jordan.

57
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,967
He's alive. He's here.

58
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:26,967
What?

59
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,867
Where?

60
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,699
Look, shawn, me and diana
have to get moving, okay?

61
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,901
Hey, no, no, no, no.

62
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,234
I'm coming with you.
- What?

63
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm going to help you
find him.

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,634
Jordan looks different now.

65
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,067
I'm the one who got
the best view of him.

66
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,400
Shawn, you're in the middle
of your wedding.

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,700
We've got
a thousand guests here...

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,134
The media...

69
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:42,301
Isabelle ?

70
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,867
You're going to have to do
some damage control.

71
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,420
Tell isabelle that the wedding's
not off...

72
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,178
It's just postponed...

73
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,767
And I... And I'll come see her
as soon as i can.

74
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,634
Are we ready to go?

76
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,901
Daddy, what is it?

77
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:51,584
I thought we agreed.

78
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,433
I don't want to see you.

79
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,101
This couldn't wait, kyle.

80
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,500
He's alive.

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>Jordan collier is alive.</i>

82
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,634
I'm going to
find him, kyle,

83
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,034
<i>and i'm going to get you
out of here.</i>

84
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,934
It's okay, sweetie.

85
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,200
It's going to be okay.

86
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I just feel so bad for you.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll be fine.

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,500
You don't need
to worry about me.

89
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:24,810
Shawn. Thank god.

90
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,821
What happened?
All the guests are gone.

91
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,495
Everybody thinks
you walked out.

92
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:29,800
That's...
it's okay. I just...

93
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,500
i need to talk to isabelle
for a second...

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,867
If you don't mind.

95
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,267
So, your "daddy" came home, huh?

96
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,600
Your dad told you
about jordan?

97
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,767
He did.

98
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,062
I was really curious as to

99
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,068
why i wasn't getting married.

100
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,001
I'm sorry, isabelle.

101
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,300
I am.

102
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,168
Jordan's out there somewhere.

103
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,267
I need to find him.

104
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,834
And then what?

105
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,634
If he's alive, what does
that mean for you and me?

106
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:57,767
I'm not sure.

107
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,333
Jordan was dead,
and now he's not...

108
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,667
shawn, is the wedding off...

109
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,101
or isn't it?

110
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:06,834
It's still going to happen.

111
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,600
Just not today, and not until
i figure out

112
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,834
what's going on with jordan.

113
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I know
collier means a lot to you.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,634
To everyone here.

115
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,400
Find him.

116
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,701
Di...

117
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
April, my god,
what are you doing here?

118
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,950
I came to see my sister.

119
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,667
Tell me, do you have some kind of allergy

120
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,234
that keeps you
from calling ahead?

121
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,567
I wasn't sure
that was a good idea.

122
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,033
If i called,

123
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,701
you might have refused
to see me.

124
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:52,734
So, are you going to hug
your only sister,

125
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,100
or are you going to
shut the door in my face?

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,501
I'm sorry. I just...

127
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,934
you surprised me, that's all.

128
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,634
I mean, i didn't even know
you were in seattle.

129
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,067
I'm moving here.

130
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,200
Why?

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,300
Are you in trouble?

132
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,634
No! I'm in love.

133
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,467
I know what
you're thinking...

134
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,467
"same difference"...

135
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,467
but not this time.

136
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,501
This guy's the keeper.

137
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,730
Oh, that's... that's great.

138
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,801
I'm really happy for you.

139
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, wait till you meet him.

140
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,501
Which should be any minute now.
He's parking the car.

141
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,367
April, i'm in the middle
of something for work.

142
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,367
It won't take long.

143
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:20,701
Just a couple of minutes.

144
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,734
Please?

145
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,067
It'd mean a lot.

146
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,073
I bet you
maia would be happy, too.

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,601
Aunt april!

148
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,834
Someone's getting tall.

149
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,634
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.

150
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,133
I bet the boys
think so, too.

151
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:35,001
Maia, this is
my friend ben.

152
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,067
I heard a lot about you, young lady.

153
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,301
Your aunt says you're a very special girl.

154
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,468
Maybe a little.

155
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,201
Sorry, i'm in a bit
of a rush.

156
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,734
I actually told april

157
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:45,834
we should have
called ahead.

158
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,201
See? Polite.

159
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,241
And if you did
a body search,

160
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,667
you wouldn't find a piercing
anywhere.

161
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,667
April mentioned

162
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:52,500
that you're
a photographer.

163
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,533
Uh, yeah.

164
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,934
April and i just
got back from india.

165
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,401
I was doing a piece
on the caste system there.

166
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:58,334
It's all for a show
he's putting on

167
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,234
at the museum
of contemporary art.

168
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:01,500
Really?

169
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,738
Wow.

170
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,660
Well...
- Yeah..

171
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,234
I spent some time
in india

172
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,834
when i was
a graduate student.

173
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,400
We were doing
an epidemiology study

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,534
in the nilgiri range.

175
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,034
We were there.

176
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,534
Well, you are
so lucky.

177
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:15,801
It was so beautiful.

178
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,867
I used to wake up early
so i could watch

179
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,067
the sun come up
over the foothills.

180
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,300
Yeah, i've got some shots
of the sunrises,

181
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,867
just for my own
personal collection.

182
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,268
If i'd known
you were interested,

183
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,168
i'd have brought them by.
- I'd like to see them.

184
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:26,967
I'll bring them by.

185
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,134
I look forward to it,

186
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:30,333
but right now,
i really got to rush.

187
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,367
Bye.

188
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,700
Bye.

189
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,667
Nice to meet you.

190
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,634
You too.

191
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:37,667
Bye.
- Bye.

192
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:40,001
You're right.
He is a keeper.

193
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,600
This is a nice place.

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,555
Collier sure had an eye
for real estate.

195
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,433
I mean, what,

196
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,500
this is the sixth place
we've looked at today?

197
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,134
Must be nice to have
that kind of money.

198
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,534
Diana...

199
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,534
look at this.

200
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,634
Someone's been staying here.

201
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,234
Guys.

202
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,433
It's from a soup kitchen
downtown.

203
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,967
What does
the notebook say?

204
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,433
The whole thing's full.

205
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,767
"The city is
a thousand miles wide.

206
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,001
"The last city.

207
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,801
"The walls
are a hundred feet high.

208
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,400
"Nothing grows
on the outside anymore,

209
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,634
"so the people
beg to be let in,

210
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,034
but nobody listens."
It's all like this.

211
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,734
Is that collier's handwriting?

212
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,500
This is just preliminary,

213
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,134
but i ran the handwriting
from the notebook

214
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,467
against the sample
from collier's

215
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,634
that you gave me.

216
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,434
Now, they don't
look alike at all.

217
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,001
I mean, the handwriting
from the notebook

218
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,168
is shaky,

219
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,701
almost like
whoever did it is sick,

220
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,400
but the software says
that they're a probable match.

221
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,867
So jordan wrote this stuff?

222
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:56,901
I can't say for sure,

223
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,467
but there's a lab
in d.c.

224
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,801
That'll be able to give us
a positive identification.

225
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,367
But it's probable, right?
Jordan's alive.

226
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,667
Well, we don't know that yet.

227
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,001
I'll tell you
one thing...

228
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,667
if he did write this,

229
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,701
he has seen
some interesting stuff

230
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,001
while he's been gone.

231
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,567
The whole thing
goes on and on

232
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,500
about a walled city.

233
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,767
You know,

234
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,233
a privileged elite
lives on the inside.

235
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,867
Everything else
is just a wasteland.

236
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:17,901
Oh, and then the last few pages

237
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:18,901
are just one phrase

238
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,734
repeated
over and over again.

239
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,767
"The war for the future
will be fought in the past."

240
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,233
Mommy?

241
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,467
Oh.

242
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,667
You scared me.

243
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,101
Sorry.

244
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,567
I couldn't sleep.

245
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,967
Oh, well...

246
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,467
why don't you come on in.

247
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,734
I'll make you
a bowl of ice cream.

248
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:47,434
Our family's
going to get bigger now.

249
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:50,068
Oh, sweetie...

250
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,567
don't get too attached
to the idea

251
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,734
of your aunt april
living in seattle.

252
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:54,867
You know how she can be.

253
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,767
That's not it.

254
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,500
You're going to get married.

255
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,233
I saw it.

256
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,400
Not too long
from now.

257
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,734
You look the same
when it happens.

258
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,701
I'm getting married?

259
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,434
Isn't it great?

260
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,934
You're going to be
so happy.

261
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,867
Okay, well, um...

262
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,600
did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?

263
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,901
Yeah.

264
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,300
It was the man we just met.

265
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,534
Ben.

266
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,134
Maia...

267
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,967
you saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

268
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,168
Mm-hmm.

269
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,734
But ben is with aunt april.

270
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,467
I guess
they don't stay together,

271
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,634
'cause you two are going to
get married.

272
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,333
You're going to
have a husband.

273
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,667
I'm going to have a dad.

274
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,134
Isn't that the best?

275
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,101
Hello?

276
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:57,834
Oh, hey, tom.

277
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,168
No...

278
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,068
we're up.

279
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,333
Have you seen this man?

280
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,667
Sure.

281
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,867
I volunteer at
st. Alban's kitchen.

282
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,434
These guys brought
the sketch by

283
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:11,767
when we were
closing up tonight.

284
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,233
We bring food down here
twice a week.

285
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,434
I've seen him.

286
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,434
You sure about that?

287
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,534
Positive.

288
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,001
I remember him
because everyone else

289
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,434
always lets him go
to the front of the line.

290
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,034
They get
out of his way.

291
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,101
I've never seen that before.

292
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,101
But you haven't seen him today.

293
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,333
Not for
a couple of weeks,

294
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,001
but i always see him
eating with will.

295
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:30,434
Will's kind of
the elder statesman around here.

296
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,767
He knows just about everyone.

297
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah, i know him. We all do.

298
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,068
The preacher.

299
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,467
"The preacher"?

300
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,367
He never said his real name
was jordan collier.

301
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,634
I thought collier was dead.

302
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,867
Who are you guys, anyway?

303
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,867
We're from ntac.

304
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:45,834
We need to
find this man.

305
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:46,834
When's the last time
you saw him?

306
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,200
Just now.

307
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,500
He's here?

308
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,233
He's always here.

309
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,901
It's pretty empty.

310
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,233
You're sure
he's back here?

311
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,701
He never goes anywhere.

312
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,600
Okay...

313
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,034
say hello...

314
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,600
to the preacher.

315
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,667
You made
a painting of him?

316
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,634
Not me personally,

317
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,901
but the preacher's
a popular guy.

318
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,967
He's got some amazing stories.

319
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:33,767
The guy claims
to have seen the future.

320
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:38,060
People around here...
we believe him.

321
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,134
You lied to me, isabelle.

322
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,734
I don't remember much
about being a baby.

323
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,634
You and mom, mostly.

324
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,767
Vague stuff.

325
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,034
I remember collier.

326
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,867
I remember
how he made you guys feel,

327
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,600
and i remember how i felt
when he touched mom that time.

328
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,667
You gave him something 
to remember that day.

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Collier was recovering
for months.

330
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,204
That's not the only thing
i did to him.

331
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:34,834
Right before he died,

332
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,603
he came to talk to me.

333
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,334
I know it sounds weird...

334
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,734
i was just a baby...

335
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,167
but he wanted me to tell him
whether it was safe

336
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,268
to go ahead with the party
he was planning.

337
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,368
I remember.

338
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,638
That's when he asked to take you for a walk
through the gardens.

339
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,368
He wanted... power.
He wanted acclaim.

340
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:54,234
A name that would live on
after he died,

341
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,105
so that's what i showed him.

342
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,567
So, what,
you gave him a vision?

343
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,600
He had the party.
He got shot.

344
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I didn't pull the trigger,

345
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,667
but daddy,
i made that happen.

346
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,084
If collier's back,
he knows what i did.

347
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,317
What does he want? Revenge?

348
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,351
We don't even know
whether or not he is alive.

349
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,384
What if he tells shawn
what i did?

350
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,251
You sound like you're 
scared of collier.

351
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:25,650
Isabelle...

352
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,384
Collier's a very powerful man...

353
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:29,950
but he is just a man.

354
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:34,284
He was just a man.

355
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:37,618
We don't know what he is now.

356
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,151
Guys, i've got something
you need to check out.

357
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,484
You know that graffiti mural,

358
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,017
the one that might be collier?

359
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,717
Well, there's a national
graffiti database.

360
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:46,850
I ran the portrait
against it.

361
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,850
And?

362
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,151
This preacher guy?

363
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,618
He gets around.

364
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,950
That one's
from st. Louis.

365
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,683
That's el paso.

366
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:56,284
Tempe, arizona,
reno...

367
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:58,017
these are from
all over the country.

368
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,683
If this is collier, he's been a very busy man.

369
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,560
He might need a shave and a haircut,
but he's still got charisma.

370
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,384
He's got followers everywhere.

371
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:09,000
So, what, he's traveling around,
preaching the gospel of the future?

372
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,017
Are you almost done?

373
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,117
I was going to
make you a snack.

374
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:21,217
Five more minutes.
- Okay.

375
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,884
Did you see ben today?

376
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,284
You mean
your aunt april's boyfriend?

377
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,783
No, i didn't see him,

378
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,683
and i'm not going to see him.

379
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,650
Your antenna is not working right
on this one, sweetie.

380
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,184
Okay.

381
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,518
Hi.

382
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,351
Hum...

383
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,017
look, i'm not the type of guy who drops 

384
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,628
by unannouncedall the time, i promise...

385
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,629
Okay...

386
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,884
But i was just in
the neighborhood.

387
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,484
I didn't have your phone number.

388
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,884
The pictures we talked about?

389
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,351
Oh.

390
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,384
Thanks.

391
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,683
Um, come in.

392
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:11,151
Hi, maia.

393
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:12,451
Hi, ben.

394
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,683
I'm going to go to my room
to study.

395
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,917
You two talk.

396
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,850
Um, so,
you going to open it?

397
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,650
Does it look
familiar?

398
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,417
That's
the nilgiri hills.

399
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,584
Yeah.

400
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,251
Listen...

401
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,650
this is not going to happen.

402
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,618
Excuse me?

403
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:47,151
Married?

404
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,084
Are you sure
she meant me?

405
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,850
Uh-huh.

406
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,884
Well, that can't happen.

407
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:56,284
I'm glad you agree.

408
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,917
April told me about maia
and what she can do,

409
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,251
but she's wrong here, right?

410
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,650
Oh, she's going to be.

411
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,284
Okay, um...

412
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,950
i'm going to go...

413
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,084
And no more visits
to bring you pictures.

414
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:13,417
No more visits, period.

415
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,618
Okay, well...

416
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:16,950
it was nice
meeting you...

417
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,950
and then resolving
never to see you again.

418
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,284
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

419
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,451
<i>Did you kill me?</i>

420
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,151
<i>That's him.</i>

421
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,683
<i>That's him!</i>

422
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:07,683
<i>That's jordan collier!</i>

423
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,917
That's jordan collier!

424
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>Tell them i didn't kill you!</i>

425
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,184
<i>Tell them
you're jordan collier!</i>

426
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,184
Tell them!

427
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,351
Tell them you're
jordan collier!

428
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,084
Tell them!

429
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,361
is that who i am?

430
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,234
When you went
to see kyle,

431
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,867
you signed in
as jeffrey paulson.

432
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:43,867
Why?

433
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,700
I found a library card
in the pocket of my coat,

434
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,034
and that's what it said.

435
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,134
I thought...

436
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,001
i thought
maybe that was my name.

437
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,800
Your name
is jordan collier.

438
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,730
You don't
remember that?

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,817
You're one of the 4400.

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,701
Am i?

441
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,667
You were shot.

442
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,200
You died.

443
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,434
Ah...

444
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:09,300
Yes, i saw that in the papers.

445
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,567
I thought i looked
like that man.

446
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:13,701
You disappeared.

447
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,034
Do you have any idea
where you've been?

448
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,233
Everywhere.

449
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,300
I have been everywhere.

450
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:32,267
I've been alive for hundreds of years,
maybe thousands.

451
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,500
I couldn't speak to anyone.
I just...

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,734
i wandered.

453
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,367
No food, no sleep...

454
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,900
And i watched it all.

455
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,234
I watched the world...
change...

456
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:58,234
and it just kept
getting worse...

457
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:04,567
and the skies
filled with smoke...

458
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,167
and all the machines
stopped working,

459
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,217
and the streets,
and the rivers...

460
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:13,741
were filled
with bodies.

461
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,601
The dead...

462
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:20,100
were everywhere.

463
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,833
The earth...

464
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,567
cried out...

465
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,000
and it...

466
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:30,567
it never stopped.

467
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,267
The things you're talking about,
they haven't happened.

468
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,668
Not yet, anyway.

469
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,668
It's 2006.

470
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,134
It's been less than a year
since you were shot.

471
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,034
How could it be?

472
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:51,867
I've been wandering
for so long.

473
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,000
That's the preliminary
dna report.

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,134
That man we're holding
is jordan collier.

475
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:00,867
Well, at least
somebody's sure of it.

476
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,930
I need collier to remember who he is

477
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,102
so he can stand
in front of a judge

478
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,600
and ask for my son to be freed.

479
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,768
But tom, this is
already a win for kyle.

480
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:10,000
Collier's alive.

481
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,601
So he serves a term
for attempted murder

482
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,134
instead of murder?

483
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,501
No, no, no, diana.

484
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,301
That's not good enough.

485
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,134
Look, collier knows who he is.

486
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,401
It's buried in there somewhere.

487
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,967
He showed up at the wedding.

488
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,734
He found his way
to one of his safe houses.

489
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,601
We just need to find a way

490
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,434
to help bring it all
to the surface.

491
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,867
Tom, i just got off the phone

492
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,768
with the national security
advisor.

493
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,401
He wants to schedule
a conference call

494
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,100
with him, me,
and the joint chiefs of staff

495
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,701
to discuss the fact
that jordan collier

496
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,034
is somehow
back from the dead,

497
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,301
and you want me
to look the other way

498
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:45,768
while alana mareva, a fugitive, walks into ntac
and uses her ability on collier?

499
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,034
She can access his memories.

500
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,367
Show him his life.

501
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,933
These people in d.c.,

502
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,701
they need collier to remember 
who he is, too, right?

503
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:53,867
They need answers.

504
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,234
This might be the only way
to get them.

505
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,734
Nina, please...

506
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,367
Come on.
We're talking about my son.

507
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,768
You have a way
to get in touch with alana?

508
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:19,900
Make the call.

509
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,567
I got it, maia.

510
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,768
You just couldn't stand
to see me happy, could you?

511
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:33,434
April,
what are you talking about?

512
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:35,234
What did you say to ben? Huh?

513
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,100
What did you say, diana?

514
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,434
Nothing. Why?

515
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,634
He broke up with me!

516
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,603
You weren't supposed
to break up with her.

517
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:45,601
That's not why
i told you what maia said.

518
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:46,450
I realize that, 

519
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,768
but you have to understand,
a precog just told me

520
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,534
that i was
with the wrong person,

521
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:55,434
and if you know
you're with the wrong person...

522
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,701
why stay with her?

523
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,967
I don't know.

524
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,701
Maybe because you love her.

525
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:00,933
I do love april.

526
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,467
At least,
i thought i did.

527
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:07,301
You know, i can't believe how casual 
you can be with all this.

528
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:08,768
Maybe it's because
you live with a 4400.

529
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,234
But someone just told me

530
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:12,000
that i met the person,
the woman,

531
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,467
that i'm supposed to be with.

532
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,567
I can't ignore it.

533
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:23,401
You know, i want you
to tell me the truth.

534
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:28,000
When you look at me,

535
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,034
do you feel anything at all?

536
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:31,900
An attraction?

537
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,601
An inkling of an attraction?

538
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:41,467
Yes.

539
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,467
I do.

540
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,100
You asked
for the truth,

541
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,000
so, yes, i do.

542
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,100
and if i met you
under different circumstances,

543
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:48,734
yes, i'd...

544
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,768
i'd want to see you again.

545
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:54,668
Yeah.

546
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:57,400
Me too.

547
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,134
But it doesn't matter.

548
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,106
We can't do it.

549
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,601
Yeah, i know.

550
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:07,234
I'm going to take my sister's 
stuff and go.

551
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,467
But wouldn't it be something

552
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,301
if we were giving up
our shot at happiness?

553
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,434
Hello, thomas.

554
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:53,352
You cut your hair.

555
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,467
I can't believe
you're here.

556
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,434
Thank you
for doing this.

557
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,007
For kyle, i'd do anything.
You know that.

558
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:06,000
Besides, i missed you.

559
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,167
You ready?

560
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,234
You don't have to
do anything.

561
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:20,900
Just shut your eyes
and relax.

562
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,301
You won't feel anything.
I promise.

563
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,034
<i>My name's jordan collier.</i>

564
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,289
If i could stay here
for a while...

565
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,250
you're one of the 4400.

566
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:48,034
That baby could be the key
to the future.

567
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,668
Peter has all the time
in the world.

568
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:52,000
Hi, peter.

569
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,933
My name is jordan collier.

570
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:55,634
Hello, richard.

571
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:56,967
Welcome
to the revolution.

572
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,933
Collier, are you all right?

573
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:31,167
My name is jordan collier.

574
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:35,434
I know why they sent us back.

575
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,634
I saw the catastrophe,
and i know what we have to do to stop it.

576
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:52,484
You say you have
all these answers.

577
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:53,484
Tell us what they are,

578
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:55,190
and then we can talk,
about letting you out of here.

579
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,784
You'll learn what i know
when everyone else does.

580
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:58,784
When will that be?

581
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:00,217
As soon as i am free,

582
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,550
you and the world
will know what i know.

583
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,585
And what if we hold you
indefinitely?

584
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,683
I've grown accustomed
to waiting.

585
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,817
Yeah, well, i can't.

586
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:11,017
My son is in prison.

587
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:12,284
You're the only one
who can get him out.

588
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,317
Then you want me released

589
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,351
as badly as i do.

590
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:19,017
Your son kyle
is innocent.

591
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:20,717
He is a pawn,

592
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:23,617
and i will say that
to whomever you want...

593
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:25,120
the moment i am a free man.

594
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:26,717
I can't believe this, nina.

595
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:29,951
My son could be one court 
appearance away from freedom,

596
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:31,974
and you're refusing to let 
collier testify on his behalf?

597
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,017
I'm not refusing.
The pentagon is.

598
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,317
Their official position is,
collier's not even back.

599
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:36,817
Come on, nina.

600
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,218
They can't honestly believe
that they can squash this.

601
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,751
Well, they're
going to try.

602
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,417
Look, collier's return
changes everything.

603
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,250
We're not just talking about 
galvanizing the 4400.

604
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,417
There are
religious groups

605
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,684
all over the world

606
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,051
who would consider him
the messiah.

607
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,151
No matter what he says,

608
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,151
no matter
how crazy it is,

609
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:52,417
people are going to listen.

610
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,151
So maybe we should find out
what's on his mind

611
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,006
before we stick him in front 
of a bank of microphones.

612
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:59,450
And what if we don't like
what he has to say?

613
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,151
We stick him in the basement,
pretend this never happened?

614
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,017
I don't think
that's going to be our decision.

615
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:04,584
I'd be surprised

616
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:05,984
if collier's
not transferred out of here

617
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:07,218
by this time tomorrow.

618
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,383
They should be here by now.

619
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:16,884
You sure you're okay?

620
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,650
L-i will be.

621
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,584
When i touched collier,
those things i saw...

622
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,184
they weren't only
from his past.

623
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:27,517
There were other images, too.

624
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,751
Terrible ones.

625
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,751
It was like a nightmare.

626
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:32,917
I don't know

627
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,517
how collier
lived through it

628
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,051
and stayed sane.

629
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,317
I don't want to leave you,
thomas.

630
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:49,951
I don't want
to go on the run again.

631
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:52,084
You know, maybe
you don't have to.

632
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:55,650
What you did today,
it helped ntac.

633
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,917
If i tell them

634
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,550
they can have access
to your ability,

635
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,184
maybe they'll drop the charges
against you.

636
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,317
I'd never hurt the 4400...

637
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:01,916
I know.

638
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,684
I know.

639
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:05,617
Maybe we can work it
so you don't have to.

640
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:06,717
Okay?

641
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,317
Uncle tommy.

642
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:10,517
Wait right here.

643
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,717
What the hell's
going on?

644
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,815
I didn't help you find jordan
so you could lock him away.

645
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:21,383
Shawn, they're scared.

646
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:24,784
This is how the government reacts
when it's scared.

647
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,250
You know, if we wanted,
we could take him.

648
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:31,218
If we set our minds
to it,

649
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:32,650
we can get into ntac,

650
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,984
and there won't be
anything you can do to stop us.

651
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,151
You may be right...

652
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:39,151
but there might be another way.

653
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,017
Here.

654
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:40,851
That's a still

655
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:43,218
from a security camera at ntac.

656
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,717
It was taken
this afternoon.

657
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,084
You show it
to everyone.

658
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:48,184
You let the world know
that collier's back.

659
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:56,851
Thank you.

660
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:59,317
Yeah.

661
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:31,961
wagon wheel.

662
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,861
You know, i used to
live on those things in college.

663
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:36,917
Ben...

664
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,650
what are you
doing here?

665
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,184
Well, i eat, too.

666
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:47,617
So...

667
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:49,851
what do you think?

668
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:52,151
Coincidence? Or is this thing going to happen

669
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,417
whether we try to stop it
or not?

670
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,817
Well, normally,

671
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,984
i'd give you a lecture
about free will right now,

672
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:08,450
but i have to admit,
it might sound a little hollow.

673
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,017
Well, we're both here.

674
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,617
We're both shopping.

675
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:21,517
Want to join forces?

676
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,627
I loved doing
the final project.

677
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,077
Let me guess...

678
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,637
faces of the elderly.

679
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:53,283
Red lights.

680
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:55,250
Every time i stopped
at a red light,

681
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,517
i'd take a picture.

682
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,684
Mm-hmm.

683
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,684
You had to study
these intersections

684
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:02,617
that you never
really noticed.

685
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:06,151
Like, the stores,
the people,

686
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,317
the garbage cans...

687
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,417
huh.

688
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,550
Everything.

689
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,317
That's very creative.

690
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:13,084
I was just
screwing around.

691
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:14,584
No, i would like
to see them.

692
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:17,317
Okay, yeah, i think
i've got them somewhere.

693
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,584
No...

694
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,717
wait.

695
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:20,951
What?

696
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,350
We can't do this.

697
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,017
We just did.

698
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:25,784
That was a date,

699
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:26,851
and that was
a pretty good one.

700
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:28,751
No, it wasn't.

701
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:31,617
It was nice,
but it wasn't a date.

702
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:34,250
Then why do i feel
like doing this?

703
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:45,851
You got to admit,
that was nice, too.

704
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,684
Can i see you again?

705
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:00,917
<i>Free collier now!</i>

706
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,550
<i>Free collier now!</i>

707
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,917
Anyone else feel
like it's bastille day?

708
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,051
Well, it does feel

709
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,350
like the start of something.

710
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,684
We have got to let him go.

711
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:10,151
It's either that
or bring in troops.

712
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,550
And we won't just be
reading the riot act to 4400s.

713
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,250
There's clergy out there.
Citizens.

714
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,517
Look, we can't just sit on this.

715
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:17,951
If collier
is some kind of messiah,

716
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,450
he needs to be free.

717
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,517
If he's not,

718
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,951
letting him out
is still the right move.

719
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:24,250
It would give him enough rope
to hang himself.

720
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,017
I'll call d.c.,

721
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:27,450
but they're going to
want to know

722
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,817
how those people
got their hands

723
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,884
on a picture of collier.

724
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:34,218
Any idea what
i should tell them?

725
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:37,184
Yeah, tell them it's hard 
to cover up a resurrection.

726
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,851
<i>Free collier now!
Free collier now!</i>

727
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:43,051
<i>Free collier now!
Free collier now!</i>

728
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,283
<i>Free collier now!</i>

729
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:51,050
Free collier now!
Free collier...

730
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,618
It's you.

731
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:03,618
Welcome back, jordan.

732
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,317
Thank you
for keeping the center alive

733
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,317
while i was gone.

734
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:15,284
Richard...

735
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,351
i'm glad to see you
still with us.

736
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:19,584
You'll have
an important role to play.

737
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,517
I stand here...

738
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:30,618
and i see the future.

739
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:35,217
4400s and non-4400s
working hand in hand

740
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,484
toward a common goal.

741
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:38,817
Saving humanity

742
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,150
is no longer
the exclusive province

743
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,850
of the 4400.

744
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,517
Each and every one of you
will have work to do...

745
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:48,451
and the work starts now.

746
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,417
We're going to the courthouse.

747
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,684
There is an innocent man
who needs to be freed.

748
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:17,417
Look, just get those people
away from this building.

749
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:19,541
You're impeding
the business of my court.

750
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:20,117
They won't leave

751
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:21,684
until you listen
to what i have to say.

752
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:24,718
I hereby withdraw

753
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:26,384
any and all charges
against kyle baldwin

754
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,817
for my alleged murder.

755
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:30,117
Well, Mr. Baldwin

756
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:32,317
still assaulted
two federal agents.

757
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,384
Now, he fired a high-powered weapon
into a crowd of people,

758
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:37,817
and he admitted it all
in a detailed confession.

759
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,184
My son has been in jail
for months.

760
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:40,517
He's a first-time offender.

761
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:42,251
You could release him
with time served.

762
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,351
Those people out there,
they listen to me.

763
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:48,050
They will be back every day
until this man's son goes free.

764
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,317
Well, these are
highly unusual circumstances.

765
00:36:52,317 --> 00:36:55,783
I'll grant you both that.

766
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:59,384
Perhaps we can revisit
the murder plea.

767
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,883
Do. Quickly.

768
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:11,317
Thank you.

769
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:37,730
I thought
you didn't want to see me.

770
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:38,651
Oh, i don't.

771
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:39,618
I want to see your pictures.

772
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:41,351
Oh.

773
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,351
Well, okay,
so i knew you'd be here.

774
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:45,950
Well, then why'd you come?

775
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,917
I guess i've been thinking
about the grocery store,

776
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,783
and...

777
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:56,584
i thought
it was a good date, too.

778
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:01,217
It just didn't end right.

779
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:04,917
Okay...

780
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:10,217
and how should it
have ended?

781
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:29,950
Hey, mommy.

782
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,150
Hi.

783
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,351
Where you been, di?

784
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,451
Nowhere.

785
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:34,684
I just...

786
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:38,017
had to work late.

787
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:58,651
I'm sorry.

788
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:01,718
I'm so sorry.

789
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:05,217
Don't apologize.

790
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:07,317
Those things you saw in me...

791
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,150
pride, ambition, vanity...

792
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,484
they were there.

793
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:13,217
I had to die
to lose them.

794
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,850
I've done bad things...

795
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,451
and i'm supposed to do more.

796
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:22,783
I know.

797
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,551
And i'm trying not to.

798
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,750
Tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.

799
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,551
Leave.

800
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,584
Leave the 4400 center,

801
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:47,351
and never come back.

802
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:51,017
Nothing you can do will change 
what you are, Isabelle.

803
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:52,850
You are the enemy
of the 4400,

804
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,417
the enemy of everything
that is good,

805
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:57,584
and that part of you that is human...

806
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:03,618
It is much smaller
than the part of you that's not,

807
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:08,384
and your struggle to keep it 
alive will fail.

808
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,584
No.

809
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,651
No.

810
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,718
I have a choice.

811
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,517
Others might. Not you.

812
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,883
If that's true,
if we're enemies,

813
00:41:27,883 --> 00:41:30,017
then why shouldn't i
just kill you right now?

814
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:33,017
You're welcome to try,
but it won't work.

815
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,517
I'm ready for you this time.

816
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:44,150
This place is mine again...

817
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:52,883
And you're not
welcome here.

818
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:55,783
Goodbye, Isabelle.
