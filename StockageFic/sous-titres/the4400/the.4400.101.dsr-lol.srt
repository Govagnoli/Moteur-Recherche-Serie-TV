1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,978
* I'm in heaven... *

2
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:09,279
Ethan, I don't think

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:10,808
it's going to clear up anytime soon.

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,637
I don't think it's
going to last that long.

5
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,307
It's not raining that hard.

6
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:15,807
It was so nice this morning.

7
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:18,336
Yeah. It'll clear up.

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,005
And if it doesn't, we'll just
have a picnic in the car.

9
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,505
No, Daddy. I want
to go outside and play.

10
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,674
Oh, no, you're going
to get all wet, sweetie.

11
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,133
Maybe later.

12
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:28,834
Please?

13
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,003
It's a very light shower.

14
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,173
Please? I won't get wet.

15
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:36,331
Please?

16
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:37,670
Okay.

17
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,331
Yay!
But just for a minute.

18
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,669
Okay.
And I want you to come right back.

19
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,129
I promise.

20
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:50,227
Have fun.
I will.

21
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:46,613
We treated you as an equal.

22
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:48,012
That wasn't good enough for you.

23
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,552
You had to cross the line.

24
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,280
I'd put in for a transfer
if I were you.

25
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,202
So, where you two going

26
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,402
for dinner?

27
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,402
Chez Michael's.

28
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:29,901
That's going to set you back.

29
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:34,770
Elizabeth has been married
to me for 35 years.

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,769
She deserves a nice meal.

31
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,269
Have a good evening,
Orson.

32
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,738
God bless.

33
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:07,662
Oh, you need to slow down, cousin.

34
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm not driving back into town
for another six pack.

35
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,230
You're just afraid my dad
will kick your ass

36
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,829
if I come home smelling like beer.

37
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,758
Evil cousin Shawn-- that's me.

38
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:21,228
Corrupter of the innocent.

39
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,557
That next door neighbor
of yours, what's-her-name?

40
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,456
She seems ready
for some corruption.

41
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:25,857
You mean Nikki?

42
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,225
She's 14, Kyle.

43
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:30,886
14?
Yeah.

44
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:31,885
Hmm.

45
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,554
Hmm.

46
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,550
Now, would it be fair to say
that this comet is close in size

47
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,919
to Haley's comet,
or is it a little bigger?

48
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,149
Well, actually, as far as comets go,

49
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:55,619
this one's a little smaller
than Haley's,

50
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:00,018
but what makes this
particularly interesting to us

51
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,677
is how close it will pass by Earth.

52
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:05,846
And what are the predictions
on how close it will pass?

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,375
Hey, kiddo.
WOMAN:
Somewhere between two

54
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,716
and five million miles.

55
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,674
You're missing the show.

56
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:14,044
There's a big comet.

57
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,514
WOMAN:
...the distance from the sun
to the Earth

58
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:16,943
is about 93 million miles...

59
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:20,442
NASA says we'll never see one 
closer in our lifetime.

60
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:25,771
Yeah, I didn't think
that would work.

61
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,310
MAN:
...appears to have
little or no tail.

62
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,770
WOMAN:
Well, it's a little unusual...

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,709
Hi.

64
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,539
How is he?

65
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,068
The same.

66
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:36,538
Same as always.

67
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:40,867
Some of your mail's
still coming to the house.

68
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:44,706
I'll call the post office.

69
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:47,366
Hi, baby.

70
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,834
Haven't seen you around here
for the last couple of days.

71
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:55,763
Can't make it every
day, not anymore.

72
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,763
Not after

73
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,232
three years.

74
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,831
So what are we supposed to do,
just give up on him?

75
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,060
I better go.

76
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:09,359
Linda, just wait.
Linda!

77
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,928
Linda.

78
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,358
It's not a competition, Tom.

79
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:17,028
It's not about who can sit by
his side the longest.

80
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,327
I still love him.

81
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:20,557
I just can't live here
like you do.

82
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:21,556
I know.

83
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,196
I wasn't accusing you.

84
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,824
I saw you got a bill
from Olympia Investigations.

85
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:32,793
More pvate detectives?

86
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:33,923
I thought we were
on to something.

87
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,493
Someone matching
Shawn's description

88
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:35,753
living down in Monterey.

89
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:36,852
But it wasn't him, was it?

90
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,351
Shawn can be anywhere.

91
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,651
Even if you found him
it wouldn't wake Kyle up.

92
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,349
At least I'd have some answers.

93
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,019
I'm worried about you, Tom.

94
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:52,448
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son,

95
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:52,748
that is my job.

96
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,447
How can you not know that?

97
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,686
You look tired.

98
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,645
Try and get some rest.

99
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,080
I thought we were supposed
to be watching the comet.

100
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,939
Oh, yeah, the comet.

101
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:29,808
Is it supposed to
be that bright?

102
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:49,733
Skouris here.

103
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:51,803
Get over here. Now.

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,829
This cannot be good.

105
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,028
All right, listen up, everyone.
We're at DEFCON One.

106
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,467
These envelopes
are orders from Home Sec.

107
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:13,567
Our first priority is
secure SeaTac Airport,

108
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:13,867
ground all the planes,

109
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:18,565
gaer up all the foreign dignitaries
in the greater metropolitan area.

110
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,425
Get them, the local
elected officials,

111
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,424
take them all to the
shelters in those orders.

112
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:24,763
Someone bring me up
to speed. Sid?

113
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,524
The comet.
It's not a fly-by anymore.

114
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,463
It's heading right at us.

115
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:32,222
Sir, it just changed course
and accelerated again.

116
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,291
A comet cannot change course.

117
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,161
This one has.

118
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,361
Then it's not a cot.

119
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,661
Revised estimate
of velocity is...

120
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,790
3,000 kilometers a second.

121
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,990
How much time do we have?

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Impact in 28 minutes.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
Sir.

124
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,059
Ryland.

125
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:48,657
Understood.

126
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:52,017
China just launched
its missiles at it.

127
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:55,386
Get ready, guys.
We're going next.

128
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:55,586
There has been a launch.
The U.S.ilitary

129
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,514
has launched a volley
of 24 Titan II missiles.

130
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,052
Danny...

131
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:11,581
what's going on?

132
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,709
All right.
Our missiles are in the air.

133
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:22,608
England has launched, too.

134
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,079
France and Russia.

135
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:25,278
NORAD's saying

136
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:25,548
the first flight of missiles

137
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,647
will intercept in 15 seconds.

138
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,005
Nine...

139
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,245
eight...

140
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:37,445
seven...

141
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:39,874
six...

142
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:42,874
five... four...

143
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,342
Three... two...

144
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:46,943
one.

145
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,600
We should get inside.

146
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,800
Multiple hits.

147
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,399
I think they got it.

148
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:00,668
NORAD is reporting that at least
nine of the Titan II missiles

149
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:01,569
have hit their target.

150
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,038
It appears the comet has...

151
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,067
No effect. The comet
is still headed right for us.

152
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,168
How hard will it hit?

153
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,966
Something that big, that fast?

154
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:11,796
You don't want to know.

155
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,034
You don't want to know.

156
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,392
I'm scared.

157
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,063
I'm going to go find
my parents, okay?

158
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:25,193
Okay

159
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:30,161
Hey, Dad?

160
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:33,230
If you're there can you pick up
the phone?

161
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,830
It's Diana.

162
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,589
You know, your daughter.

163
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,828
Ju tell my brother that I love him.

164
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:41,058
You tell Mommy that I love her,
okay?

165
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:43,727
Nancy, it's dad.

166
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,756
I just wanted to tell you
I love you.

167
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:49,786
Catastrophic impact with Earth
now appears unavoidable...

168
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,585
Tom,t's Susan. What is going on?

169
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:54,455
...Where and exactly when
this now certain...

170
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,154
Tom, isn't there a shelter
we can go to?

171
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,654
I mean, technically you still
work for Homeland Security,
don't you?

172
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,353
Susan, it doesn't matter.

173
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,152
The shelters aren't going to
make a damn bit of difference.

174
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,881
Just...

175
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,451
I'm sorry. I love you, sis.

176
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,650
Just hug Danny close
and pray for the best.

177
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,179
Sir, British missiles
just hit the object

178
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,649
but it's still coming.

179
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,748
It's entered the atmosphere.

180
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:17,849
I got it on SeaTac radar.

181
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,418
It's slowing down.

182
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,617
What?

183
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:24,217
It's at Mach Seven, Mach Two.

184
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,216
It's going subsonic.
It's leveling off

185
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,516
and continuing to lose speed.

186
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:30,815
It's as if it's coming in
for a landing.

187
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,574
Landing? Wha... like...
Like a pla?

188
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:34,944
No, more like the mothership.

189
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,973
Give me some coordinates.
Where's it going?

190
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:43,642
47 North Longitude;
122, maybe 123 West Latitude.

191
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:45,741
That's by Mount Rainier.

192
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,070
That's our backyard.

193
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,703
Come on, get the shot.
Get the sh.

194
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:44,026
We're, we're close to the base
of Mount Rainier.

195
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:45,525
The ball of light is massive;

196
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:46,755
100, 200 feet in diameter.

197
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:47,954
It's hard to tell.

198
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,254
We're going to try to get closer.

199
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,623
I can tell you that this is,

200
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:53,694
without a doubt, one of the most

201
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:56,892
incredible sights I've ever seen.

202
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,049
We're still looking
for some sort of official

203
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,788
that might be here
from the government.

204
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,143
Jim?

205
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,913
Jim, what's going on?

206
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:37,042
We're not sure what's just happened.

207
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:41,080
The ball of light is gone.

208
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,225
Thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.

209
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,064
This is amazing.

210
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,264
There are thousands of people
as far as the eye can see.

211
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,923
I think I just...
I saw your brother.

212
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,923
Shawn?

213
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,922
Yeah!

214
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,311
Pull me all the files
from the Northern Counties.

215
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,449
I want back in.

216
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:43,578
Tom, do you have any idea

217
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:46,078
what I'm wading through here?

218
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:46,748
I have over 4,000 people

219
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:49,677
that stepped out
of a ball of light

220
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,147
and landed in my lap.

221
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,046
Somef them have been gone 60 years.

222
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,175
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.

223
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:56,375
You want me to drop everything

224
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:56,805
because u want back in?

225
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,544
I can help.

226
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:00,774
I needed help from you before.

227
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,703
When Home Sec asked me
who I wanted

228
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,642
to bring over from the Bureau,

229
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,102
your name
was at the top of the list.

230
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,141
What did I get from you?

231
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,672
Five months.

232
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,701
Five months.

233
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:16,700
And then an indefinite leave
absence.

234
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,169
You made fools out of both of us.

235
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,369
I needed to find the truth
about what happened toy son.

236
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,738
And you still do.

237
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,538
And that's the reason
you want back in...

238
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:25,498
because your nephew
is one of the returnees.

239
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:29,697
Look, I admit
I have a personal stake in this.

240
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,766
That's why I'll come through
for you.

241
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,735
I need answers, too.

242
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,733
Diana Skouris.

243
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,292
Tom Baldwin.

244
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,532
You two will be one
of the teams

245
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,691
that's responsible
for investiging

246
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,360
what happened to the returnees.

247
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
Skouris, ex-CDC, right?

248
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,130
Yeah, I heard of you, too.

249
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,959
You got to be
kidding me, right?

250
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,429
Is there a problem?

251
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:59,659
He went MIA once.
Who's to say

252
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:00,858
he won't do it again?

253
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,557
Me.

254
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:06,786
Is this where you give me

255
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,426
the "Be a good soldier" speech?

256
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,385
No, this is ere
I give you the speech

257
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,085
about how you're
my best field scientist

258
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:12,525
and Tom is my best
lead investigator,

259
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:14,924
and how together,

260
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,584
you're going to make a good team.

261
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,323
Hmm.

262
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,622
Well, should be interesting.

263
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,381
Nice to meet you, too.

264
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:28,851
Beautiful.

265
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,720
The sooner we find out
what's going on,

266
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,650
the better for us.

267
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,319
The better for them.

268
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:50,515
What's your name again, sir?

269
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:51,175
Julius.

270
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:51,915
Anita.

271
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:52,245
Amanda.

272
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:54,973
I want to see my family.

273
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:56,244
( speaks Spanish )

274
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,772
( speaks German )

275
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:01,812
Orson Bailey.

276
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,671
It's not possible.

277
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,640
Why? It's 1979.

278
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,810
So for them, no timeas passed.

279
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,839
Last night was our anniversary.

280
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,369
So between you and me,

281
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:14,539
what do you think
happened to them?

282
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,269
Where do you think they've been?

283
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,808
I don't know.

284
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,237
There had to be some kind
of ielligence behind it.

285
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:21,967
As in the hand of God
or little green men?

286
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,836
I'm not discounting anything.

287
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:25,806
Here, look.
This is an interesting one.

288
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,135
They're dead, aren't they?

289
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:29,505
This is Maia Rutledge.

290
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,264
She was the first one to disappear

291
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:32,704
as far as we can tell.

292
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:35,903
She's eight years old,
only she was born in 1938.

293
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:40,732
I'll be okay, mostly.

294
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,831
She's a tough little kid.

295
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,260
Look,

296
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,730
there's one returnee

297
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,799
I'd like to interview myself.

298
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,698
Yeah, so I've been told.

299
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,528
Returnee 2,117--

300
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:54,798
Shawn Farrell.

301
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,758
He's all yours.

302
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,427
All we're asking for is access.

303
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:04,226
These people deserve
to see their families.

304
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,795
To receive legal representation.

305
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,295
They're private citizens
who've done nothing wrong.

306
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,894
We don't know that.
It's been less than a week.

307
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:14,193
For all we know, these people
could be walking time bombs,

308
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:15,492
disease vectors, spies.

309
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,592
Sent by who?

310
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:19,092
She doesn't like us much.

311
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,851
We've just seen thousands of...

312
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,250
The feeling's mutual.

313
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,620
The government won't tell us
anything about it.

314
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,550
I believe a little
paranoia is warranted

315
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,019
and I believe that

316
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,219
the majority of the American
public agrees with me.

317
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:34,687
Well, fortunately, the American 
public has been know to disagree.

318
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,847
The Secretary of State is colored?

319
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,717
You mean black.

320
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:38,946
I'll take your word for it.

321
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,316
The National Security
Advisor, too.

322
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,315
Boy, the world sure
has changed since '51.

323
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,244
You should try to relax, son.

324
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:51,184
You're not going to get out 
of here any quicker

325
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,813
by wearing a groove in the floor.

326
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,782
Are you some kind
of jailhouse philosopher?

327
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,012
Barracks philosopher, actually.

328
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:58,211
Oh...

329
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,241
I was a combat pilot in Korea.

330
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,440
Nice tattoo.

331
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,980
Who's Lily?

332
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,639
A girl I ud to know.

333
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,879
Shawn Farrell, report
to interview room one.

334
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,938
I'll see you.

335
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:14,807
Medical exams for group F returnees

336
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:16,137
have been delayed by one hour...

337
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,974
What's your name again, sir?

338
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,334
Orson Bailey.

339
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,004
I want to speak
to someone in charge.

340
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,203
I mean, why can't I
just make a call?

341
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,529
Uncle Tommy, hi.

342
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,169
It's good to see you.

343
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:48,629
Look, what's going on?

344
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,897
Nobody will tell us anything.

345
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:56,266
We'll let you know
as soon as we find out.

346
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,696
I still can't believe it's you.

347
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:57,896
How do you think I feel?

348
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:01,894
Listen, do you know how long
they'rgoing to keep us,

349
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:05,863
because I really want
to go home.

350
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:15,021
Shawn,

351
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,890
do you remember anything?

352
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,860
Anything at all about what
happened that night?

353
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,918
Nothing.

354
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,957
Nothing.

355
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:32,017
One minute I'm sitting there
with Kyle on the beach.

356
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:34,086
The next it's three years later

357
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,586
and I'm standing next
to some mountain

358
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:40,454
with a couple thousand
strangers around me.

359
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,013
Listen, Uncle Tommy,

360
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:49,412
some people are saying
that we were abducted by aliens.

361
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,810
We can't rule anything out yet.

362
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,950
Well, can you give me anying?

363
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,749
How's my mom? How's Danny?

364
00:20:58,809 --> 00:20:59,810
Fine, they're all fine.

365
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,009
They miss you.

366
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,009
Great.

367
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,448
Hey, what about Kyle?

368
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:05,378
I mean, he mushave seen
something the night

369
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:06,548
that I disappeared.

370
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:08,947
Did he tell you anything?

371
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,406
He hasn't said a word.

372
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:16,275
He's okay, isn't he?

373
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:20,444
Isn't he?

374
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:23,844
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

375
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:26,842
What are you talking about?

376
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,401
What I'm talking about
is Kyle lying on a bed

377
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:29,902
with a ventilator down his throat

378
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,241
being fed through one tube
and pissing out another.

379
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,970
He's been like that ever since
the night you left.

380
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,968
He was fine last time I saw him.

381
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:45,437
We were having

382
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:46,367
a couple of beers.

383
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,496
Look, don't you lie to me, Shawn.

384
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:47,967
I'm no

385
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:49,766
Don't u lie to me!

386
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:50,766
I've been waiting

387
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,496
three years
to hear the truth from you,

388
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,795
so please don't lie to me.

389
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:57,964
I just told you the truth.

390
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:01,833
Is that what you've been
thinking this whole time?

391
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:04,792
That I gave Kyle something
that messed him up

392
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,762
and that I just took off?

393
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,059
Screw you, Uncle Tommy.

394
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:19,089
I just told you everything I know.

395
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:23,627
Goddamn it!

396
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:47,851
You look

397
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:51,120
as bored as I feel.

398
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,648
I wish there were windows
in this place.

399
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:00,148
I'd like to see the stars,
wouldn't you?

400
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:05,647
Do I look that bad?

401
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,976
No, it's just you

402
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:09,246
remind me of someone
I used to know.

403
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:11,545
How long you've been gone?

404
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:14,275
Since '51.

405
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,544
It wouldn't be me, then.

406
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:19,113
'93.

407
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:20,742
I'm Richard.

408
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:21,172
Lily.

409
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,210
My friend, her name
was Lily, too.

410
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:29,610
Lily Bonham.

411
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,309
That's my grandmother's name.

412
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:38,368
Lily Bonham from Saint Louis?

413
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:41,037
You knew my grandmother.

414
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:43,067
Is she still alive?

415
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:45,066
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,005
She died before I was born.

417
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,833
Are you all right?

418
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:03,231
Lily's dead and I'm sitting
here with her granddaughter.

419
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,430
It doesn't make any sense.

420
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,460
No goddamn sense at all.

421
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,130
I know how you feel.

422
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,199
I keep thinking I'm going
to wake up from this dream

423
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:12,859
and tell my husband
all about it.

424
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,228
You have... you have a family?

425
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,557
Yeah.

426
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:23,156
Brian and I
and our daughter, Heidi.

427
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:26,156
She was six months when I...

428
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,494
So, what was she like,
my grandmother?

429
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:31,794
Oh...

430
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:36,123
Everyone says I look
a lot like her.

431
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:42,051
They were right.

432
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,050
I'm sorry, that's not
possible right now.

433
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,919
Th is ridiculous.

434
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,089
You have no right  hold us
here like this.

435
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:52,488
We haven't done anything wrong.

436
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,247
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:58,117
This is for you.

438
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,849
Well, the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld a lawsuit

439
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:29,079
by the ACLU on behalf
of the families.

440
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:33,248
We don't have a legal right
to hold them.

441
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,547
Okay, but some of these people

442
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,277
have no place to go,
no familieleft.

443
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:37,576
The word is,gypt and China

444
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:39,076
are refusing
to repatriate its citizens.

445
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,245
India's on the fence.

446
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:43,415
Oh, wait a minute.
We're not kicking anybody out.

447
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:44,914
Whoever wants to stay can stay.

448
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:48,274
As far as American citizens,
whoever leaves will get whatever

449
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:51,742
assistance is required to get
their life back on track:

450
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:54,372
Medicare, unemployment,
rent vouchers,

451
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,372
vocational training.

452
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,441
Vocational training?

453
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,011
We need to isolate these people.

454
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:00,540
They're not virus samples,
they're human beings.

455
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,170
The order's been given.

456
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,640
We're letting them go.

457
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,069
I wouldn't book
your vacations just ye

458
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:16,537
Each Regional Homeland
Security Office

459
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:18,536
will be responsible
for the returnees

460
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:20,135
who settle in their region.

461
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,934
So, we'll be monitoring
79 people,

462
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:27,104
plus another 135 have chosen
to remain in quarantine

463
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:28,563
for the time being.

464
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:32,432
Each of our returnees
will check in once a week.

465
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:36,461
Any difficulties faced
by the rurnees in our district

466
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,660
will be handled by this office.

467
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,129
nally, we'll continue
with our ongoing investigation.

468
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:43,629
We'll all sleep better

469
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,699
once we know
what the hell's going on.

470
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,328
Thank you.

471
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:00,455
You look so lonely standing
there without an ID number.

472
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,994
I'm supposed to be 82 years old.

473
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,624
There's no one here
waiting for me.

474
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:05,124
So what are you going to
do now that you're out?

475
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,423
Head back to the old
neighborhood, I suppose.

476
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,751
What about you?

477
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:16,490
No, wait, let me guess.

478
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,490
Take your daughter
to Woodland Park.

479
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,989
We used to love that place.

480
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:28,288
Of course, Heidi was barely
crawling then and now she's 12.

481
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:32,546
Uh...

482
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,886
You've been a good friend.

483
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:56,309
They told me there'd
be a bus to the city.

484
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,940
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

485
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,409
Thanks.

486
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,109
Hey, Mom! Danny!

487
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,337
Shawn! Oh, my God.
Hey, buddy.

488
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:06,438
Oh...

489
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,106
Brian!

490
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,735
Brian!

491
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,904
Sorry, I...

492
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,274
How you doing?

493
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:22,673
Good. Let's...

494
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,972
Let's go.

495
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:25,202
Yeah, let's get out of her
Thank you.

496
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,119
Can I help you?

497
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,558
Heid

498
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,018
Yeah?

499
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,688
Heidi, it's Mommy.

500
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,217
Who?

501
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:23,957
Heidi...

502
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,016
It's, uh,
it's okay, sweetie.

503
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:27,986
I got it.

504
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,155
Brian.

505
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:32,785
Lily.

506
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,082
Look at you.

507
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:42,852
You han't aged a day.

508
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,511
Why didn't you come pick me up?

509
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:47,081
Didn't...
Didn't they contact you?

510
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:48,710
Yeah.

511
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,610
You have to try to
undersnd, Lil.

512
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,379
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again.

513
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:59,277
I'm married, Lily.

514
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,376
Carol has been a really
good mother to Heidi and...

515
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:09,844
we have a son now,
too, a little boy.

516
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:18,273
I'm sorry.
Lil, I'm...

517
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:21,372
Lily.

518
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,260
Elizabeth?

519
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,227
Orson?

520
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:22,756
Where have you been?

521
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:26,224
I've been waiting for you.

522
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,223
I know.

523
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,022
Where's the car?

524
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:42,281
We're going to be late
for dinner.

525
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,319
I'm sorry, hon.

526
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:54,547
Things got a little
out of control.

527
00:31:56,917 --> 00:32:00,415
But it won't happen again.

528
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:22,310
Hi, Mom.
Sweetie.

529
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,140
Hey, Shawn.

530
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,309
Oh, y, George.
Hey, guys.

531
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,310
Good to see you.

532
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,439
Hi.

533
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,108
Yeah, sorry your buddies
couldn't show.

534
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:29,968
I guess most of them
are away at college.

535
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:35,237
They're just jealous
I get to enjoy two more
years of high school.

536
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:36,866
High school's not that bad.

537
00:32:36,936 --> 00:32:38,865
Hey, Shawn.

538
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,135
Remember me?

539
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,734
Nikki?

540
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:44,335
No.

541
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:46,833
Last time I saw you, you
were just a little kid.

542
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:49,503
Now look at you. Lucky me, huh?

543
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,802
Yeah, guess so.

544
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,454
What the hell are
you looking at?

545
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,554
I used to live here.

546
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:25,753
Yeah?

547
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,393
Well, I live here now.

548
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:30,122
Get the hell out of here.

549
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,120
Why did you

550
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,889
bring me here?

551
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,389
I thought I'd put a human face

552
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:42,819
on the returnees for you.

553
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,018
Remind you they're
people, not viruses.

554
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:46,217
Tom.

555
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,388
You going to introduce me

556
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:48,647
to your new friend?

557
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:50,346
Uh, Linda, this is,
uh, this is my partner.

558
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,687
My work partner.

559
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:53,686
Diana Skouris. Diana,
this is my wife, Linda.

560
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:54,685
Hi.

561
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:55,685
Nice to meet you.

562
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,815
We're separated.

563
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:58,884
Oh.

564
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:00,084
Call me.

565
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,414
We need to talk.

566
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:05,783
Well, that was awkward.

567
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,382
Really?

568
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,382
Yeah.

569
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:10,382
I hadn't noticed.

570
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,710
Give me a second.

571
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,409
Hey, how you doing?

572
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:26,178
You look thirsty.

573
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,407
Thank you.

574
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,976
I-I just wanted you
to know I'm...

575
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,435
I really am glad you're back.

576
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,506
Whatever, Uncle Tom.

577
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:41,433
Geez.

578
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,232
Neck's broken.

579
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,601
Reflection must have
confused him, huh?

580
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah.

581
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:54,370
Why don't you come back inside?

582
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,670
You're missing your own party.

583
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,198
I know. It's just weird
being in there...

584
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:02,667
I guess he was just stunned.

585
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,468
Yeah.

586
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,666
Yeah, I guess so.

587
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,127
I'll see you in there.

588
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:30,020
lovely people and that,
thain Quarantine, right?

589
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,949
Besides, there's nothing

590
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,749
we can handle, right, Maia?

591
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,188
That would be nice.

592
00:35:39,248 --> 00:35:41,047
Well, we should get going.

593
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,717
It's a bit of a drive to Everett.

594
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,017
Yeah, terrific.

595
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,587
Good luck, Maia.

596
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:46,787
You'll see me again.

597
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,445
Yeah, next week.

598
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:49,845
Sooner than that.

599
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:59,912
And when we bought the building,

600
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:01,383
your mother said,

601
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:02,612
"What? That old thing?"

602
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:05,281
Can I get you anything?

603
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:05,742
Uh... water, that'd be fine.

604
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:07,741
Mary could you get
Mr. Bailey some water?

605
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
Just down here.

606
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,610
You know, I can't get over it.

607
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,279
You look exactly the same
as the last time I saw you.

608
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:13,739
And you were what, 1

609
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,538
Your father asked me
to show you the ropes.

610
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:18,678
Looks like I succeeded.

611
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,738
Please, have a seat.

612
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:21,977
Thank you.

613
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:23,476
So what can I do

614
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:25,406
for you, Mr. Bailey?

615
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:28,005
My old corner office,
for starters.

616
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:31,435
Thank you... A secretary,
some business cards.

617
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,834
I should be able to start

618
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:34,774
seeing clients within a week or so.

619
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,133
You're looking for a job?

620
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,672
This is still
Kensington & Bailey, isn't it?

621
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:38,832
I'm embarrassed. Uh...

622
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,331
Times are tight.

623
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,701
I just had to lay off
three of my actuaries.

624
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,930
I don't have any openings
right now, Mr. Bailey.

625
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,470
Openings?

626
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,669
I'm a partner here.

627
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:51,669
Mr. Bailey,

628
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,128
your interest in this company

629
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:55,298
was bought out
when you were declared dead.

630
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:58,128
Well, your wifet dead.

631
00:36:58,198 --> 00:36:59,397
accepted the settlement.
It is all legal.

632
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,497
Don't be too sure of that.

633
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:01,726
What happened to me...

634
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,996
there is no precedent.

635
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,495
You are right about that,

636
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:08,795
but it might be years until
precedent is established.

637
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,224
Until that happens,

638
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:10,824
all of you... returnees

639
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:14,923
are going to have to get in line

640
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:16,592
and plead your case
in front of a judge.

641
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:16,822
I mean, do you have
the kind of resources to...?

642
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:18,822
Have you seen
the place my wife is in?

643
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:21,821
I have to get her out of there.

644
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:23,221
I don't think we should
discuss is any further.

645
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,790
I need money. Now.

646
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,859
The living room...
and there's the kitchen.

647
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:32,988
Do you want

648
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:34,158
to see your room?
Okay.

649
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,557
I think it's really nice.

650
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:37,217
It's the one over here.

651
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:38,357
Come here.

652
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,856
We just had it redone.

653
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,215
It's a very nice room.

654
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:48,854
I got you a few outfits to start.

655
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:50,183
Tomorrow we'll go shopping.

656
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:51,784
You can pick out
some more yourself.

657
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,753
Okay.

658
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:58,252
Maia.

659
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,751
Honey.

660
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,080
We have a rule.

661
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,210
No shoes on the furniture.

662
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,210
I don't want them

663
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,449
to get wet.

664
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:08,749
Wet?

665
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,379
Why would they get wet?

666
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:13,877
Why don't you get cleaned up?

667
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:15,777
We're going to eat soon.

668
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:39,701
* Bye, bye, baby *

669
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:43,439
* Don't be long *

670
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,800
* I worry about you *

671
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:48,539
* While you're gone *

672
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,594
* Bye, bye, baby *

673
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:06,034
* Don't be long *

674
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,994
* I worry about you *

675
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:11,932
* While you're gone *

676
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,888
* I think of you in my dreams *

677
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:35,925
* You never know
just what you mean to me *

678
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:41,925
* To me *

679
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:10,377
* Bye, bye, baby *

680
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,776
* Don't be long *

681
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:16,245
* I worry about you *

682
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:18,814
* While you're gone *

683
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:33,111
* Bye, bye, baby *

684
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,741
* Don't be long *

685
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,439
* I worry about you *

686
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,138
* While you're gone *

687
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:59,164
* I think of you night and day *

688
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:06,932
* I never know just what
u meant to say *

689
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:14,830
* To say *

690
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,389
Anita?!

691
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:10,516
Adam, it's Orson.

692
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,415
Let me in.

693
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:14,415
I want to talk.

694
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,210
I know you

695
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,840
can hear me.

696
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,140
Let me in!

697
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,109
You want me to wake the
whole neighborhood?

698
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,030
Tom?

699
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,760
What are you doing here?

700
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,090
Your phone is off.

701
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,029
Ryland wants us to come in.

702
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,029
What's up?

703
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,189
There's been a murder.

704
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:52,359
The police are holding

705
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:56,987
one of the 4400.

706
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:05,185
That's him.

707
00:44:05,255 --> 00:44:06,525
That's Orson Bailey.

708
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:08,554
Bailey-- some kind of
businessman, right?

709
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:09,554
Right.

710
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:10,684
Life insurance?
Yeah.

711
00:44:10,754 --> 00:44:12,623
Disappeared in the '70s.

712
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,923
'79, declared dead in '86.

713
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,352
Seate police are holding him

714
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:16,782
in connection with a homicide

715
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,122
in Madison Park last night.

716
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:20,781
Do they know he's one of the 4400?

717
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:22,950
Bailey told them.
That why ty called us.

718
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,650
Well, I thought the returnees

719
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,220
were told not to
discuss their status.

720
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:27,849
Well, weounsel them to avoid it

721
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,619
if they possibly can,
but, you know,

722
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,048
we were talking job interviews

723
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,318
and housing applications.

724
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:33,748
There's not really a protocol

725
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,517
for being questioned
about a murder.

726
00:44:35,577 --> 00:44:36,976
You said holding, not charging.

727
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:40,046
That's right. There are
some conflicting reports

728
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:41,545
about what actually went on
at the crime scene.

729
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:42,775
We'll check it out.

730
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,375
Quietly.
I don't want to be

731
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:46,644
dodging microphones
at the 6:00 news.

732
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:48,274
Quietly it is.

733
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:50,143
Diana?

734
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:54,912
Hi, this is Linda.

735
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:56,471
I can't take your call
right now,

736
00:44:56,771 --> 00:44:58,511
but please leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

737
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:58,811
Linda, it's me again.

738
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:05,839
You said we needed to talk,
so pick up the phone.

739
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:08,669
Linda, come on.

740
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,668
All right, call me.

741
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:11,738
Everything all right?

742
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,367
Yeah, same old same old.

743
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:15,566
Call me, don't call me.
I wish she'd make up her mind.

744
00:45:15,636 --> 00:45:16,967
You know, I had
a boyfriend once.

745
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:18,206
Every time he'd tell...

746
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:19,405
A boyfriend?

747
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:21,406
Well, don't look so surprised.

748
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:24,634
Yeah, anyway,
the thing about this guy

749
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:26,534
that used to drive.
You can stop.

750
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:27,933
I barely got started.

751
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:28,233
All I'm ying is,

752
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:31,663
yodon't have to try
to make me feel better.

753
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:34,531
Well, it was more of an attempt
at bonding

754
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:35,962
via a shared similar experience.

755
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:37,261
Can you open the door?

756
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:39,930
How long did you go out
with this guy?

757
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Nine months.

758
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,829
Nine months?
Mm-hmm.

759
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:45,329
So, you're equating
your nine months

760
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:47,528
of dating with my 19
years of marriage?

761
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,028
Yeah, you're right.

762
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:50,328
Okay, forget it.

763
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:50,528
You want me to drive?

764
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:53,696
What for?

765
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:56,356
I don't know. So you can brood?

766
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:58,455
Just get in.

767
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:33,986
Look who floated in
on a ball of light.

768
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:37,815
Remember me, Farrell?

769
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:38,145
Rossi

770
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:39,885
Hi

771
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:42,383
Well, it looks like
the steroids finally kicked in.

772
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,713
Funny man.
Funny.

773
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:46,512
Always did appreciate
your sense of humor.

774
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:48,742
Like that time you sold me
those concert tickets

775
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:50,082
right before you disappeared.

776
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,581
To the Foo Fighters?

777
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:53,211
How was the show?

778
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:56,040
I wouldn't know; the cops were
waiting for me when I showed up.

779
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,740
Tickets were stolen, man.
You got me arrested.

780
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,739
You got arrested
for stolen tickets?

781
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:02,639
Yeah, I had five
tabs of X on me.

782
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:06,437
I had to pee into a cup once a week
for two years because of you!

783
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,937
Stop it!
Hey, hey! Come on!
Get off of him.

784
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:11,936
This is between me
and your brother.

785
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,335
Yeah? Well, I'm making
it between you a me.

786
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,274
See you around, freak.

787
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:21,834
Oh, by the way, how'd you like

788
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:23,303
the new paint job on your ride?

789
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,670
You okay?

790
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,199
I'm fine.

791
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,229
The security cameras
caught everything.

792
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:42,128
The guy definitely had
a bug up his ass.

793
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:45,298
Except, as far as we can tell,
he never went inside.

794
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,527
Kensington fell into all
that glass and impaled himself.

795
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,026
You've been through
all the footage?

796
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:51,496
Every scrap. Bailey never
made it past the gate.

797
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:53,425
Wait. Hold on a second.
Did you see that?

798
00:47:59,624 --> 00:48:01,863
That's glass.

799
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:03,522
Yeah.

800
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:06,222
Something blew out the windows,
but from the inside.

801
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,791
Yeah, we're still trying
to figure that one out.

802
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:08,991
There was no seismic activity.

803
00:48:10,461 --> 00:48:12,320
No evidence of a bomb
or a gas leak.

804
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,660
And Bailey's not talking?

805
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,689
We've sent half a dozen guys
in there,

806
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,889
but he hasn't given us anything.

807
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,687
Look, I've been over
and over this with you people.

808
00:48:21,757 --> 00:48:24,357
We're not the police.
We're Homeland Security.

809
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,086
Well, tell the bozos out there

810
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,116
that I had nothing to do
with what happened to Adam.

811
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:30,755
Let's just go over your d again.

812
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:31,555
You went to see

813
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:32,985
Adam Kensington about a job,

814
00:48:33,055 --> 00:48:34,784
and even though
your name is still

815
00:48:34,854 --> 00:48:34,984
on the company letterhead,
he brushed you off.

816
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:39,683
I know how that'd make me feel.

817
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,982
I admit it, I was angry.

818
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,211
I went to Adam's house to, uh...

819
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,251
I don't know why I went,

820
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,011
but I didn't kill him.

821
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,410
Let me read you an e-mail

822
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,010
Kensington sent his attorney

823
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:55,678
after your visit.

824
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:56,678
It's not imptant.

825
00:48:56,949 --> 00:48:57,878
Just a sec.

826
00:48:57,948 --> 00:48:59,378
"Bailey is making desperate claims

827
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,407
"regarding his financial
stake in the company.

828
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:03,047
"He actually threatened to sue.

829
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,646
"I don't think he realizes

830
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:05,776
"that there are
probably going to be

831
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:07,546
"hundreds of lawsuits
involving the 4400.

832
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,145
"It'll take years.

833
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:12,844
"The poor bastard,
he really is a rather...

834
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:13,744
pathetic case."

835
00:49:21,142 --> 00:49:23,341
I am not a lawyer,

836
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:25,971
but I'm not an idiot either.

837
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,100
You've had me here for 12 hours.

838
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,869
Now, either you charge me

839
00:49:29,939 --> 00:49:31,839
with something.

840
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:37,398
...or let me go.

841
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:48,565
So, we're just going to let him 
walk, after what happened in there?

842
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:50,535
Yeah, looks like it.
But for futureeference,

843
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:53,093
if I ever want to play good 
cop/bad cop, I'll let you kwow.

844
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:54,233
Which one do I get to be?

845
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:55,663
This isn't a joke.

846
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:58,292
There's a time to lean on a guy,
and that wasn't it.

847
00:49:58,632 --> 00:49:59,432
You shut him down.

848
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:00,862
Look, I'm sorry.

849
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:04,091
But Bailey admitted he
was angry with Kensington.

850
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:05,491
He was at his house.

851
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:07,929
I didn't say it was over, did I?

852
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,551
Do you think
they ever thought about me?

853
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh, sweetie!

854
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,020
They were your parents.

855
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:43,950
I am sure that they thought

856
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,950
about you every day.

857
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,819
Thanks for bringing me here.

858
00:50:52,478 --> 00:50:53,648
This place used to be so nice.

859
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,977
Now thkids leave their
garbage everywhere.

860
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:57,847
Ah, it really is a shame.

861
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:00,346
You don't have to worry.
Crown Ridge is nice.

862
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:02,746
Crown Ridge Cemetery?

863
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:04,375
Yes.

864
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:06,775
That's where you'll be.

865
00:51:07,174 --> 00:51:07,974
Be...?

866
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:10,073
Be what?

867
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:12,073
Buried.

868
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,910
Kensington's a popular guy
around here today.

869
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,139
The whole staff's been through
to look at the postmortem.

870
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,709
Yeah, why's that?

871
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:29,568
Well, he might have been a boring
old suit when he was alive,

872
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:32,368
but in death... he's a rock star.

873
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:33,967
God, look at that!

874
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:36,806
Those were his parietal bones?

875
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:39,736
We've seen beating deaths in
here as bad as you can imagine.

876
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,005
Even the guy that jumped
off the Space edle

877
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,264
and had to be brought
to us in a garbage bag.

878
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,863
But I have never seen a skull
in this kind of shape before.

879
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:50,803
Thousands of tiny little
bone fragments...

880
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:51,103
Kensington was impaled.

881
00:51:52,302 --> 00:51:54,962
Are you saying that's not
how he died?

882
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,661
Oh, that would have killed him,

883
00:51:56,731 --> 00:52:00,060
but he was already dead
from a shattered skull.

884
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:11,497
Hello?

885
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:14,027
Hello.
Is, uh... Lily there?

886
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:15,126
Who?

887
00:52:15,526 --> 00:52:16,426
Is this Heidi?

888
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:17,655
Yes.

889
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,425
I'm Richard Tyler.

890
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:21,554
A friend of your mother's.

891
00:52:21,624 --> 00:52:23,255
My mother's name is Carol.

892
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:23,524
Are you sure you have
the right number?

893
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:27,693
This is the Moore residence,
isn't it?

894
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:28,993
Yeah, buthere's no one

895
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:30,852
named Lily here.

896
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:32,652
Sorry.

897
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:50,447
Well, I'm afraid I can't give you

898
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:53,186
any medicine for the nausea.

899
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:55,046
Why not?

900
00:52:55,116 --> 00:52:56,846
Because it wouldn't work.

901
00:52:57,116 --> 00:52:58,985
You're not sick, Lily.

902
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,084
You're pregnant.

903
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:03,114
That's impossible.

904
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:07,383
The-the quarantine doctors
would have told me.

905
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:08,482
You said they gave you

906
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:11,142
a full screening
seven weeks ago.

907
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:12,441
If you just conceived,

908
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:13,141
it wouldn't have shown up
in their tests.

909
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,181
Conceived...?!

910
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,010
en?

911
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,079
I assume it happened
right before you disappeared.

912
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,278
But there's no mistake.

913
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:27,107
You're definitely pregnant.

914
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:31,706
Now, there's nothing
to worry about.

915
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:34,435
I would like to see
you again next week,

916
00:53:34,936 --> 00:53:37,535
and you can get used
to the information.

917
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,771
Shawn!

918
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:49,832
Hey.

919
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,101
How you doing?

920
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,371
Mm... good.

921
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,500
What's up?

922
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:55,200
You get your car fixed?

923
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,430
It's going to be

924
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,229
in the shop for about a week.

925
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:00,429
Yeah. You know, Danny
and I are going

926
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:02,728
to a party tonight at
Eddie Tobin's house.

927
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:04,728
You should come.

928
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:07,027
I don't think so.

929
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,866
Why not?

930
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,165
Um, well, they're going
to be listening to music

931
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:13,466
I've never listened to,

932
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:16,024
talking about movies
I've never seen.

933
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:17,064
School is bad enough.

934
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:19,294
Partying with a bunch
of runts from...

935
00:54:19,364 --> 00:54:21,593
Is that how you saw me, a runt?

936
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:26,222
You were 14, Nikki.

937
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,122
And now?

938
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,389
I'm late for class.

939
00:55:03,812 --> 00:55:05,251
Where's my wife?

940
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:09,150
My wife, where is she?

941
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,680
Mr. Bailey, you have our deepest
condolences.

942
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,680
What?

943
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,849
We called your hotel room,

944
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:14,849
there was no answer. Elizabeth?

945
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:15,178
It was a pulmonary embolism,

946
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,878
about 1:00 this morning.

947
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,407
We tried to revive her.

948
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:20,348
No!

949
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:21,108
A pulmonary embolism...

950
00:55:21,178 --> 00:55:21,707
Please, Mr. Bailey.

951
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:22,647
Calm down.

952
00:55:22,707 --> 00:55:23,606
Don't tell me e's dead.

953
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:24,446
Mr. Bailey, just calm down.

954
00:55:24,506 --> 00:55:26,176
She's all I have!

955
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,305
Let go of me!

956
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,945
No!

957
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,273
No!

958
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,943
Get away from me!

959
00:56:02,636 --> 00:56:03,537
So the red dots

960
00:56:03,597 --> 00:56:05,396
mark the spots where
the American members

961
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:07,695
of the 4400 originally lived.

962
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,565
You mean the returnees.

963
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:10,794
Not according to the press.

964
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,964
It's the 4400.

965
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,833
You know, you have to admit,

966
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,093
it's a bit strange,

967
00:56:16,163 --> 00:56:19,062
a nice round number like that.

968
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:21,231
ff
I wonder if it has any significance.

969
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:24,231
So you're saying that
if 3,781 people

970
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,130
had suddenly showed
up that night,

971
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,930
it wouldn't have been as strange?

972
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,529
I'd say... slightly less strange.

973
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,928
This, however, is downright weird.

974
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:36,687
Here's where the 4400 are right now,

975
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,557
two weeks after their release.

976
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,186
65% are still in Seattle.

977
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:41,787
They're just not going home.

978
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,886
And none of them can come up
with a good reason as to why.

979
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:44,325
You think it means something?

980
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,885
In the CDC, we'd call this

981
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:50,853
a statistically significant
disease cluster.

982
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:54,023
Yeah, well, in the FBI,

983
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,253
we'd call it a freaky coincidence.

984
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:58,652
Well, I don't believe
in coincidences.

985
00:56:58,722 --> 00:57:01,851
Disease clusters.

986
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:02,381
I lieve in those.

987
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:07,949
What do you mean,
you're pregnant?

988
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:08,949
I just found o a few days ago.

989
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:10,679
I don't understand.

990
00:57:10,749 --> 00:57:12,278
When you were disappeared,
I'd been in New York

991
00:57:12,348 --> 00:57:13,248
for weeks studying for the bar.

992
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:14,447
I can't explain it.

993
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:15,548
I haven't been with anyone else.

994
00:57:15,618 --> 00:57:16,547
So what are we talking,

995
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:17,677
immaculate conception?

996
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:18,776
I don't know what
we're talking about.

997
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:20,816
I wish I did.

998
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,874
You know, when you disappeared...

999
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:30,614
I would have given
anything in the world

1000
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:32,273
to talk to you again.

1001
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:33,742
I had whole conversations

1002
00:57:33,812 --> 00:57:34,943
with you in my head.

1003
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:38,371
I missed you so much, Lily.

1004
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,209
But we can't do this.

1005
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:46,439
I have another family now.

1006
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:51,768
And I'm sorry, I know
that's not fair  you, but...

1007
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:53,367
Brian, I'm still
part of your life,

1008
00:57:53,438 --> 00:57:54,907
whether you want me to be or not.

1009
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:57,636
Lily, you haven't been a part of
my life for 11 years.

1010
00:58:00,505 --> 00:58:02,305
I want to see Heidi.

1011
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:05,264
I'm sorry, that's impossible.

1012
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:06,564
She's my daughter.

1013
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:07,864
She doesn't know that.

1014
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,363
She thinks that Carol is her mother.

1015
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,703
You never told her about me?

1016
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:13,902
She was a baby when you left.

1017
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:14,332
Hell, we were babies when you left.

1018
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:18,201
You can't stop me from seeing her.

1019
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,830
I already have.

1020
00:58:26,058 --> 00:58:26,728
What is that?

1021
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:28,098
It's a temporary

1022
00:58:28,298 --> 00:58:29,658
restraining order.

1023
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,058
Brian,
I haven't done anything wrong.

1024
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,297
Lily, I'm a lawyer.

1025
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:34,796
I know how to work the system.

1026
00:58:34,856 --> 00:58:36,296
Now, I don't want to u this,

1027
00:58:36,356 --> 00:58:37,826
but I will if you force me to.

1028
00:58:38,196 --> 00:58:40,155
My first priority has
to be to protect my family.

1029
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,294
I am your family.

1030
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,095
I wish you were,

1031
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,424
but you're not.

1032
00:58:44,494 --> 00:58:45,993
Not anymore.

1033
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:46,194
I'm sorry, Lil, I'm asking you,

1034
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:51,353
please, stay away from Heidi.

1035
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,221
And from me.

1036
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,348
I'm sorry, Lil.

1037
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:15,716
At first I thought
it was an earthquake.

1038
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,745
Everything was shaking, falling
off the walls.

1039
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:20,045
But then-- I can't believe
I'm going to say this--

1040
00:59:20,115 --> 00:59:22,914
things started to fly
around the room.

1041
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:25,044
Paper, chairs.

1042
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:26,743
What do you mean, fly?

1043
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,313
I mean fly, like it was a tornado.

1044
00:59:29,383 --> 00:59:30,712
Except there was no wind.

1045
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:32,681
Everybody was screaming,
Mr. Bailey was shouting.

1046
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:35,311
My head felt like
it was going to burst.

1047
00:59:35,381 --> 00:59:36,980
And then suddenly it was over.

1048
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,580
What about Bailey?

1049
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,640
Oh, he looked scared.

1050
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,009
Like the rest of us.

1051
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:42,938
That's when he ran away.

1052
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:44,478
The staff... everyone's saying

1053
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:45,838
he's one of these people,

1054
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:48,207
the 4400.

1055
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:49,977
Is that true?

1056
00:59:50,037 --> 00:59:51,706
Listen to me very carefully.

1057
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:53,135
You are not going
to talk about this

1058
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:53,406
to the press or anyone else,

1059
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:55,635
and the same goes for your staff.

1060
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,504
If I pick up a paper
and see a word of this

1061
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:58,905
or I see it reported on the news,

1062
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:00,904
I'm going to take an
interest in this place.

1063
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:01,333
Things flying around the room.

1064
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,233
I know, but we got
a half dozen witnesses

1065
01:00:04,303 --> 01:00:05,403
all saying the same thing.

1066
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,702
Yeah, flying.

1067
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:09,772
I've got to do a briefing
for Home Sec DC

1068
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,571
in the morning and I'm
going to tell them what?

1069
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:11,831
Well, I'd go with

1070
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:12,831
"the incident is
under investigation."

1071
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:13,871
Bailey checked out
of his hotel

1072
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,100
after he left the nursing home.

1073
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,799
He could be on the run,
we're not sure.

1074
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:17,830
Find him.

1075
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,229
You bought us some time,

1076
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:21,498
but this story's going to leak

1077
01:00:21,568 --> 01:00:25,197
and I want Bailey in our
hands before it does.

1078
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:25,427
So is calculus everything
you remember it to be?

1079
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:27,427
Uh, you heard about

1080
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:31,265
Williamson and
Ms. Sinclair, right?

1081
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:31,866
No.

1082
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:33,096
No?

1083
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,265
Oh, they found them in
the janitor's closet.

1084
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:35,464
What is that?

1085
01:00:35,524 --> 01:00:37,065
Making out, not dead.

1086
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:38,324
What?

1087
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:40,423
Everybody in school's
been talking about it.

1088
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:41,793
Yo, freak.

1089
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:43,962
You still hiding behind
your little brother?

1090
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:48,221
You know what,
Brad?

1091
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:49,861
You need to shut it down.

1092
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:51,091
You want to shut me down?

1093
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,159
You know, the only thing I'm
shutting down is you, bitch.

1094
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,389
You're really starting

1095
01:00:58,459 --> 01:00:59,758
to piss me off now.

1096
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:01,288
Come on. Bring it.

1097
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,518
Shut me down.

1098
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:34,310
Let him go.

1099
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,809
Shawn!

1100
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:46,706
What did you do to him?

1101
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:03,072
I dHey, keep your voice down,
here anyshe'll hear you.

1102
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:04,341
It's bad enough she tells us

1103
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:06,271
we're going to be buried
at Crown Ridge Cemetery,

1104
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:07,671
but the next day we get a brochure

1105
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:08,800
from the place in the mail?

1106
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,799
It a coincidence.

1107
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:14,099
Look, she's not what we expected,

1108
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:15,738
so let's just talk to her.

1109
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:19,267
Yeah. I...

1110
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:28,535
Maia...

1111
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:34,033
It's okay.

1112
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:34,193
I knew I wasn't going
to be here very long.

1113
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,431
Come on.

1114
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:43,761
Come on, let's go.

1115
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,030
Give me the ball.

1116
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:51,159
Your shot, space boy.

1117
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:53,388
What is your problem, Danny?

1118
01:02:53,788 --> 01:02:54,458
What's my problem?

1119
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:55,828
Yeah, what's your problem?

1120
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,987
at'd you do to Brad?

1121
01:02:59,057 --> 01:02:59,826
Come on, Danny.
Not you, too. Come o

1122
01:03:01,856 --> 01:03:03,785
The way he went down,
that's not normal.

1123
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:06,855
You know it, I know it,
everybody saw it.

1124
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:07,655
What are you saying?

1125
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,424
You tell me.

1126
01:03:09,855 --> 01:03:10,954
I didn't do anything to him,

1127
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:12,153
all right, Danny?

1128
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:13,923
Not a thing.

1129
01:03:18,422 --> 01:03:20,152
And is this all that's
left when you're done?

1130
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:22,750
I mean, poor Mrs. Bailey.

1131
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,451
It's a box of trinkets.

1132
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,520
They're not trinkets,
they're memories.

1133
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,349
The kind you leave behind,

1134
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,179
you know, for your
family and friends.

1135
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:32,078
I should get to work on that.

1136
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:34,378
I'm not going there.

1137
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:36,477
Well, believe it or not,

1138
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:38,316
some of us arhappier alone.

1139
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:39,876
No one's happier alone.

1140
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:42,175
If they think that,
they're kidding themselves.

1141
01:03:42,245 --> 01:03:44,045
I thought you weren't going there.

1142
01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:45,915
You see this?

1143
01:03:45,975 --> 01:03:48,814
This looks promising.

1144
01:03:50,813 --> 01:03:53,373
"Wyler Summer Cabin."

1145
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:54,642
Wyler was Elizabeth's
maiden name.

1146
01:03:54,712 --> 01:03:57,071
Orson's panicking,
he needs a place to run.

1147
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:59,641
Well, there's no address.

1148
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,870
We'll have to find one.

1149
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:12,738
It's better this way.

1150
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:14,237
For everyone.

1151
01:04:14,837 --> 01:04:17,367
Everyone?  Or just you?

1152
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:26,704
Maia, honey, you know
this isn't about you.

1153
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:26,864
You are a wonderful girl.

1154
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:28,863
It's just, Kenneth and I,

1155
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:33,862
we just made a mistake.

1156
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:36,162
We're t ready to be parents yet.

1157
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:37,701
It's okay.

1158
01:04:37,761 --> 01:04:41,460
No, it's not.

1159
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,199
But, sweetie, those things you say,

1160
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:47,658
they can scare people
if you're not careful.

1161
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,827
Do you understand?

1162
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:52,857
Good.

1163
01:04:59,956 --> 01:05:02,654
For you.

1164
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:04,553
Go ahead, take it.

1165
01:05:04,623 --> 01:05:04,854
Wh is it?

1166
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:07,153
A CD I burned.

1167
01:05:07,223 --> 01:05:10,193
Think of it as a crash course
in all things new and cool.

1168
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:11,492
The Darkness,

1169
01:05:11,552 --> 01:05:13,891
Handsome Boy, Modeling School,
Killing Joke.

1170
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,592
All the bands you never heard of.

1171
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:16,621
Thank yo But, Nikki,

1172
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:19,191
I could listen to all the music
and watch all the shows,

1173
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:20,790
but it wouldn't matter

1174
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,519
'cause they're still going to
look at meike I'm differt.

1175
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:24,919
At least you'll be listening

1176
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,218
to some good music.

1177
01:05:26,288 --> 01:05:27,688
I don't understand.

1178
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:29,448
See, because everybody
has been looking at me

1179
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:30,887
like I'm somkind of monster

1180
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:33,987
since the fight. But you...

1181
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:34,786
aren't you afraid
to be seenith me

1182
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:37,385
No.

1183
01:05:37,445 --> 01:05:39,915
What do I care
what those creeps think?

1184
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,084
If you like the CD,

1185
01:05:42,683 --> 01:05:45,143
I'll burn you another one.

1186
01:05:45,213 --> 01:05:46,643
Sounds great. 
All right.

1187
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:47,712
Okay.
Okay.

1188
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:48,713
See you.

1189
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:49,812
I'll talk to you later.

1190
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:50,942
Okay.

1191
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,099
Hello?

1192
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:44,697
Okay, bring up the satellite shots.

1193
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,727
So we're looking for a small house

1194
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:46,897
with a north-facing exposure

1195
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:51,466
somewhere within the vicinity
of Appleton Lake.

1196
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:53,065
If it's still standing.

1197
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,895
No structures in grids one,
two, three and nine.

1198
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:56,125
Four and seven each have one,

1199
01:06:58,094 --> 01:06:58,964
but they're the wrong shape.

1200
01:06:59,023 --> 01:07:00,364
Let's eliminate all those.

1201
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:01,463
That leaves us with

1202
01:07:01,523 --> 01:07:02,923
five, six and eight.

1203
01:07:02,993 --> 01:07:03,992
That's too small.

1204
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,592
at's the wrong orientation.

1205
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:08,591
That's too small, that's too big.

1206
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:09,621
Nothing but trees in eight.

1207
01:07:09,991 --> 01:07:10,791
It's not there anymore.

1208
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:11,021
Hang on a second.

1209
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,220
Get in a little tighter on this.

1210
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,959
Well... it looks like
it could be a house.

1211
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:19,889
No, this was taken 50 years ago.

1212
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:21,758
These trees would be huge by now.

1213
01:07:21,818 --> 01:07:21,918
Enlarge again.

1214
01:07:27,886 --> 01:07:29,756
Bingo.

1215
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:30,915
Thers your house.

1216
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:31,855
Bingo.

1217
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:36,554
Appleton's what, aut 70 miles?

1218
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:38,154
Yeah.

1219
01:07:38,214 --> 01:07:42,112
Look, when we get up there,
I'll handle Bailey.

1220
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:43,652
All right.

1221
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:44,912
Are we leaning on him?

1222
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,081
No leaning.

1223
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:47,111
No problem.

1224
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:49,181
Excuse me. You Tom Baldwin?

1225
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:51,010
Yeah, who are you?

1226
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,610
You've been served.

1227
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,649
Sorry, man.

1228
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,648
You're getting sued?

1229
01:08:03,977 --> 01:08:06,676
Linda's filed for divorce.

1230
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:50,065
Lily.

1231
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:52,434
Richard!

1232
01:08:52,494 --> 01:08:53,793
Richard.

1233
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,633
Oh.

1234
01:08:58,232 --> 01:08:59,493
I don't understand.

1235
01:08:59,563 --> 01:09:03,031
I... I thought you went home.

1236
01:09:03,091 --> 01:09:05,791
I did, but there was
nothing there for me.

1237
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:06,960
But, uh...

1238
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,029
How did you find me here?

1239
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,259
Woodland Park, right?

1240
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:13,558
This is where you used
to bring Heidi.

1241
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:18,187
Richard, was terrible.

1242
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:22,686
Brian's remarried.

1243
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:23,185
Heidi doesn't know anything...

1244
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:37,983
Hello, Maia.

1245
01:09:38,052 --> 01:09:39,582
Hello.

1246
01:09:39,652 --> 01:09:42,350
Oh... I like it out here.

1247
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:46,949
It's much better
than my stuffy office.

1248
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:48,550
But you didn't bring me out here

1249
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:49,079
to talk about the weather.

1250
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:53,078
You're a very smart little girl.

1251
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:56,017
Thank you.

1252
01:09:56,077 --> 01:09:57,147
The thing is...

1253
01:09:57,217 --> 01:10:01,116
that the Griffins didn't
really give a reason

1254
01:10:01,176 --> 01:10:03,445
why they brought you back.

1255
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:06,875
Maybe they didn't have a reason.

1256
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:09,674
Could be.

1257
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:12,013
Were they mean to you?

1258
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:14,242
No.

1259
01:10:14,312 --> 01:10:14,972
Were you mean to them?

1260
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:19,941
No.

1261
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:22,570
Why do you think you're back here?

1262
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,369
I don't think they like kids mh.

1263
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:28,009
Why do you say that?

1264
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:31,068
They brought me back and I'm a kid.

1265
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,867
You don't really want to tell me
the reason, do you?

1266
01:10:39,066 --> 01:10:41,036
That's okay.

1267
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:44,004
Maybe you'll change
your mind one day.

1268
01:10:44,064 --> 01:10:45,665
Maybe.

1269
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:48,933
Hi, this is Linda.

1270
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:50,463
I can't take your call right now,

1271
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:53,062
but please leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

1272
01:10:54,431 --> 01:10:56,761
What, she's still not answering?

1273
01:10:56,831 --> 01:10:59,331
Nope.

1274
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,060
Can I ask you a question?

1275
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,730
No.

1276
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:05,229
Well, I'm going to ask you anyway.

1277
01:11:05,299 --> 01:11:09,728
So your son, how long
has he been in a coma?

1278
01:11:10,128 --> 01:11:12,627
Three years.

1279
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:14,297
That's a long time.

1280
01:11:14,497 --> 01:11:16,396
You have no idea.

1281
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:20,495
Maybe you and your wife,
you can work things out?

1282
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:24,724
You know, one day
Kyle's going to wake up

1283
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:28,124
and I'll have to tell him his
whole family's fallen apart.

1284
01:11:28,194 --> 01:11:29,823
I go to that hospital every day

1285
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:32,521
and I tell myself that
makes me a good father.

1286
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:33,852
Oh, you are a good father.

1287
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:37,190
Kyle's lucky to have a dad like you.

1288
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,420
Not everyone does.

1289
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,719
You can trust me, 'cause I know.

1290
01:11:46,318 --> 01:11:49,348
A baby?

1291
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:51,287
You sure?

1292
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:54,486
I had the doctors
do the test three times.

1293
01:11:54,546 --> 01:11:56,786
'Cause the thing is that Brian

1294
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:59,185
was out of town when I disappeared

1295
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:02,884
and I haven't been with
anyone since I've been back.

1296
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:05,183
I don't understand it.
How-how could you be...?

1297
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:06,343
I don't know.

1298
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:12,612
I'm sorry to be dumping this
on you.

1299
01:12:12,682 --> 01:12:14,441
It doesn't...
It's not really fair.

1300
01:12:14,511 --> 01:12:17,340
It's okay.

1301
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,040
I want to help.

1302
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:24,808
There's some sort of connection
between us, isn't there?

1303
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:25,138
I feel it.

1304
01:12:26,578 --> 01:12:29,177
I can feel it, too.

1305
01:12:29,237 --> 01:12:31,207
That's why I came back.

1306
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,404
But it's more complicated
than that.

1307
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:41,674
Your grandmother and I,

1308
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:45,833
we weren't just friends,
it was... it was more than that.

1309
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,272
We were going to start a family.

1310
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:55,730
I think part of me already knew that.

1311
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,599
The way you talk about her.

1312
01:12:59,729 --> 01:13:02,598
The look in your eye.

1313
01:13:02,668 --> 01:13:05,767
Here it is, I thought
I was playing it so safe.

1314
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:10,496
It must have been difficult,
the two of you,

1315
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:13,165
a white woman
and a black man in the '50s.

1316
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:15,425
Mmm. Black. Back then

1317
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:20,324
I was Negro, colored or worse.

1318
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:24,593
We didn'care.

1319
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:27,862
We figured after the war,

1320
01:13:27,922 --> 01:13:29,791
we'd take off to some big city

1321
01:13:29,861 --> 01:13:36,189
like Chicago or New York or Paris.

1322
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:39,189
But you never made it home.

1323
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:41,788
No.

1324
01:13:41,857 --> 01:13:43,458
I never did.

1325
01:13:51,555 --> 01:13:52,785
I'm glad you found me.

1326
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:57,954
Me, too.

1327
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,913
* Bye, bye, baby *

1328
01:13:59,983 --> 01:14:02,653
* Don't be long *

1329
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:05,551
* I worry about you *

1330
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:07,681
* When you're gone *

1331
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,648
* Bye, bye, baby *

1332
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:24,646
* Don't be long *

1333
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,876
* I worry about you... *

1334
01:15:13,234 --> 01:15:16,233
Mr. Bailey, it's Tom Baldwin,
Homeland Security.

1335
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,591
We met at the police station,

1336
01:15:24,661 --> 01:15:26,160
remember?

1337
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,290
Mr. Bailey, we're here

1338
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,460
to help but you've got
to talk to us.

1339
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,129
Go away.

1340
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:32,759
I'm afraid we can't do that.

1341
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,588
I just want to be left alone.

1342
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:36,457
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1343
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:38,957
That's good because we don't
want anyone else hurt.

1344
01:15:39,027 --> 01:15:41,086
If you leave, I promise

1345
01:15:41,156 --> 01:15:42,926
no one will ever see me again.

1346
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:45,355
I'll just stay here...
Listen to me...

1347
01:15:45,425 --> 01:15:46,725
...away from everyone.

1348
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:48,825
We both know that's not going
to work, Mr. Bailey.

1349
01:15:48,885 --> 01:15:50,484
Now please, open the door.

1350
01:15:50,554 --> 01:15:52,184
We can figure this out together.

1351
01:15:52,254 --> 01:15:53,953
I'm on your side.

1352
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,652
No, you're not.

1353
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:56,823
No one is.

1354
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:58,182
My nephew, he's one of the 4400.

1355
01:15:58,252 --> 01:15:59,222
Just like you.

1356
01:15:59,282 --> 01:16:00,821
I've seen how hard it is for him.

1357
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:03,221
I know it's even harder for you.

1358
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:05,080
You don't know anything.

1359
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:05,480
My wife, she was

1360
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,579
everything to me.

1361
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:10,318
Believe me, I'm sorry
for your loss.

1362
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:11,649
I don't want any pity
out of you.

1363
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:12,648
Go away!

1364
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:13,878
I just want

1365
01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:16,078
to be left alone.

1366
01:16:16,148 --> 01:16:17,547
We can't do that.

1367
01:16:17,617 --> 01:16:19,446
I said...

1368
01:16:19,516 --> 01:16:23,075
get away from me.

1369
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:35,473
Stay away, please.

1370
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:50,738
Tom.

1371
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:53,467
Your nose.

1372
01:17:09,434 --> 01:17:11,363
Hold on...

1373
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:23,900
I can't control it.

1374
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,259
I can't control it.

1375
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:30,258
Whatever it is you're
doing, Mr. Bailey, stop it.

1376
01:17:30,328 --> 01:17:31,957
I can't control it.

1377
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,927
Stop it now!

1378
01:17:44,424 --> 01:17:45,594
You all right?

1379
01:17:45,653 --> 01:17:47,124
Yeah.

1380
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:54,951
I'll call for an ambulance.

1381
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:55,351
Okay.

1382
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:09,147
We're going to get you
some help, Mr. Bailey.

1383
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:13,946
Just don't die on me.

1384
01:18:19,015 --> 01:18:20,785
Well, he's alive.

1385
01:18:20,845 --> 01:18:24,643
But it doesn't look like he's 
going to be talking to us anytimsoon.

1386
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:27,813
As far as the general public's
concerned,

1387
01:18:27,883 --> 01:18:30,242
we're going to deny it
ever happened.

1388
01:18:30,442 --> 01:18:31,882
Yeah, but we know better.

1389
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:33,681
The question is,
will it happen again?

1390
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:33,841
So what do you suggest we do

1391
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,310
Round them all up and put
them back in quarantine?

1392
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,010
You saw what Bailey could do.

1393
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,978
I mean, you felt it...
same as me.

1394
01:18:43,038 --> 01:18:45,878
Who knows what the rest
of them are capable of.

1395
01:18:47,237 --> 01:18:48,938
I sure as hell don't.

1396
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:52,036
But then again,
it's not my job to find out.

1397
01:18:52,106 --> 01:18:54,106
It's yours.

1398
01:18:57,704 --> 01:19:00,474
Aren't you glad you wanted back in?

1399
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:18,400
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1400
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,899
I never shot anyone before.

1401
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:22,629
But seeing him lying
there like that...

1402
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:23,798
You going to be okay?

1403
01:19:23,868 --> 01:19:24,628
Yeah, I'll get there.

1404
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:28,397
You know, I meant what
I said to Ryland back there.

1405
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:28,627
If Orson can do those things,

1406
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:31,665
who knows where all this is going?

1407
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:33,526
So far we've got one case

1408
01:19:33,596 --> 01:19:36,294
and maybe that's all
we'll ever have.

1409
01:19:36,364 --> 01:19:36,624
You ever noticed anything
unusual with Shawn?

1410
01:19:39,164 --> 01:19:40,923
Because I just need to know

1411
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:44,622
if you had, you'd tell me.

1412
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:49,461
There's nothing to tell.

1413
01:19:58,089 --> 01:19:58,719
Wha...?

1414
01:19:58,789 --> 01:20:00,718
Yeah, look at this guy.

1415
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:02,888
There's like three other
sites just like this,

1416
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:05,357
but this one's got a lot more 
stuff than the other ones.

1417
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,657
What are you guys doing?

1418
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,785
Research.

1419
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:13,585
On T 4400 scoop.com?

1420
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:17,114
It's just...

1421
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:21,583
You know, the web, there's
a site for everything.

1422
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:25,982
"The Forty-Four Hundred Menace"?

1423
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:28,051
I know this guy.
I was in quarantine with him.

1424
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:28,211
They're saying he killed someone
just by thinking about it.

1425
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:36,879
So that makes me

1426
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:38,678
some kind of freak?

1427
01:20:38,748 --> 01:20:40,078
No. No, we were just...

1428
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:43,577
I want to know how you
took Brad down so fast.

1429
01:20:45,477 --> 01:20:45,607
Come on, he did someing
to him, you saw it.

1430
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:51,875
Danny, you have no idea what
you're talking about.

1431
01:20:55,074 --> 01:20:56,703
Neither do you.

1432
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:04,702
Shawn.

1433
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:10,140
What?

1434
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,099
You were thinking the same thing.
