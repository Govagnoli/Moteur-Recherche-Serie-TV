1
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,201
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,566
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,370
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,778
I've been offered a job

5
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,043
working with the children
at the school.

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,153
I blew the surprise, didn't l?

7
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,551
I just wanna make one thing clear.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,050
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,319
Okay.

10
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,462
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,328
I'm the guy who killed you.

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,068
Is this list complete, huh?

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,672
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

14
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,772
What's up? Who are these guys?

15
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,344
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.

16
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:25,143
I know you find this hard to believe,
Tom, but we are on the same side.

17
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,486
One of our members
has been compromised.

18
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,451
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.

19
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,648
If you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC. They'll take care of it.

20
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,125
Daniel Armand's inside. He's all yours.

21
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,897
This is it.
The last member of the Nova Group.

22
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,593
It's the last one
we know about, anyway.

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,671
If this tip is good
and we bring in Gary Navarro,

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,933
this could pretty much
be the end for the Nova Group.

25
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,167
The tip is good.

26
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,782
All right, here they are. Let's go.

27
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,722
Move. Move.

28
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,796
Gary! It's over!

29
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,471
- Go. Go.
- Downstairs.

30
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,309
- Room searched.
- You two, that way.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,575
- Got it.
- Clear.

32
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,545
Check over here.

33
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,344
Clear, sir.

34
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,884
There's nobody here.

35
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,083
Looks like he just left.

36
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,886
In the middle of making lunch?

37
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,090
He must have known we're coming.
Someone must have tipped him off.

38
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,042
Isabelle.

39
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,769
Isabelle.

40
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,278
You're not hearing me.

41
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,973
Sure, I did.

42
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,379
You said you don't wanna
be with me anymore.

43
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,583
I just don't see why.

44
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,519
The Nova Group's gone.

45
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,182
My dad knows about us now.

46
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,225
There's nothing to stop us
from being together.

47
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,957
Yes, there is.

48
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,862
Me.

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,469
This is because of what happened
to Matthew, right?

50
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,865
You think I killed him.

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,507
And the people
from the Nova Group too.

52
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,145
I wasn't in my right mind, lsabelle,
so I don't know what happened.

53
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,678
Well, then I'll tell you.

54
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,611
Matthew had a stroke,
some terrorists died

55
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,651
and you got better.

56
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,879
What's to question?

57
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:50,056
I just think that you and l
got a little too intense, too fast.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,994
See, I thought that was the best part.

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,963
Sorry for the interruption.

60
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,606
Shawn, there's someone here
to see you.

61
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,476
She's a friend of yours.
She says it's important.

62
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,441
Nikki. Oh, my God.

63
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,845
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

64
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,956
It's been a long time, Shawn.

65
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,687
Yeah.

66
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,322
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,933
- I should have called first.
- No.

68
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,693
No, it's fine.

69
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,336
You look great. How have you been?

70
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,406
Good. Good. School's kind of fun.

71
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,936
It's just...

72
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,636
My father.

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,206
He's been sick.

74
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,316
Oh, your dad? I'm sorry to hear that.

75
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,009
It's cancer.

76
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,818
It's in his pancreas.

77
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,620
There's nothing they can do.

78
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,590
Shawn?

79
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,153
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,024
I just need to deal with this thing now.

81
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,499
So we'll talk later, okay?

82
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,803
Okay.

83
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,543
So, Amy, you used to call
your grandmother Mimi?

84
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,674
Yes. I'd go stay with her
for two weeks every year.

85
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,818
But when I came back
with all the other 4400s,

86
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,384
my mom told me she was gone.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,549
Alana Mareva?

88
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,627
We're from
the National Security Agency.

89
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,924
You need to come with us.

90
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,627
What is this about?

91
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,860
The Pentagon has commissioned
a study on the membership

92
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,526
and the origins of the Nova Group.

93
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,337
We've been authorized
to interview all persons of interest.

94
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,997
And why would I be
a person of interest?

95
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,440
Ma'am, we have a list.
Your name is on it.

96
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,675
Let's not make a scene
in front of the child.

97
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,482
How did my name get on the list?
What am I being accused of?

98
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,521
We have evidence that suggests
you're a member of the Nova Group.

99
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,684
I wrote a check.

100
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,419
My friend, Ryan, at the Center,

101
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,191
came up to me one day
about six weeks ago.

102
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,130
He said he couldn't pay his power bill.

103
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,601
They were gonna shut it off
if he didn't come up with the money.

104
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,304
It was a small loan, $1 65.

105
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,138
- No big deal, right?
- Ryan Freel?

106
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,041
We picked him up three days ago.

107
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,842
He's one of the names
Daniel Armand gave us.

108
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,545
So they were right. He was in Nova.

109
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,119
They say they can hold me

110
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,455
for providing financial support
to terrorists.

111
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,222
It was just a loan, Thomas.

112
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,161
How long are they
gonna keep me here?

113
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,162
They can hold you for questioning,
without any charge, for 36 hours.

114
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,828
But it's not gonna come to that.
This is harassment.

115
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,236
It's not gonna continue.
I'm gonna talk to Ryan Freel.

116
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,468
I'll get him to admit
that this is just a casual thing.

117
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,407
That it had nothing to do with Nova.

118
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:05,045
Alana, I promise this is all
gonna be over soon, just--

119
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,343
Just sit tight, okay?

120
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,017
I love you.

121
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,694
I know it's frustrating,
but there's nothing we can do.

122
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,565
Nina, it's harassment, pure and simple.

123
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,467
Yeah, I know it is.
And I don't like it either.

124
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,665
But the Nova Group
made a lot of people nervous.

125
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,743
Now that it's broken, the military wanna
make sure that it's dead and gone.

126
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,901
Yeah, we all do.

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,913
It's still no excuse to hold an innocent
woman based on absolutely nothing.

128
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,072
Well, I agree.

129
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,946
But the Pentagon
went around us on this one.

130
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,108
They went private.

131
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,346
They hired the Haspel Corporation
to conduct the study.

132
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,855
Haspel Corp? They do a lot
of defense contracting, don't they?

133
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,016
Yeah, right now, they're focusing
on this Nova report.

134
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,287
NSA even loaned them agents
to do field work.

135
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,593
Now some conglomerate has
the right to arrest and detain people?

136
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,258
Where is the oversight?

137
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,768
There isn't a lot.

138
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,633
Look, this whole thing
runs on the discretion

139
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,434
of the executive in charge of the study.

140
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,775
So who's this executive?

141
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,277
I appreciate your frustration, Tom.

142
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,248
It's unfortunate that your girlfriend
got involved in this mess.

143
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,315
But my people are just being thorough.

144
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,085
Your people?

145
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,488
Alana's being held
by the National Security Agency.

146
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,758
The way I remember it,
your life in public service ended

147
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,834
with a perp walk through NTAC.

148
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,300
Yeah, there were
some unpleasant moments.

149
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,302
But that's the past.

150
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,603
I was censured for my part in the
inhibitor scandal, I guess you'd call it.

151
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,269
"Scandal"? Why don't you try
"murderous plot."

152
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,207
Your opinions
are already a matter of record.

153
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,851
Not that the majority of people
agree with you.

154
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,649
Anyway, after the government saw fit
to terminate my employment,

155
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,759
I weighed my offers
and wound up here. Haspel Corp.

156
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,454
And Alana just happened to wind up
in your crosshairs, right?

157
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,025
Tom, do you think
I would use your girlfriend

158
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,261
to prosecute some kind
of personal vendetta?

159
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,303
Actually, Dennis, yeah, I do.

160
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,241
So that's his punishment
for causing the deaths of 28 4400s?

161
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,571
A six-figure consulting gig
and a corner office.

162
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,906
Don't act so surprised, Tom.

163
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,346
We always knew Ryland
had a lot of support for what he did.

164
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,691
Learning anything new?

165
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,689
Yeah. She's incredible.

166
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,355
In a week, we've made discoveries
we thought it would take years to get to.

167
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,023
Where'd you find this girl?

168
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,732
He didn't find me.

169
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,842
I found him.

170
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,406
Shawn.

171
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,808
It's all right, Jimmy.

172
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,684
Hey.

173
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,418
That was amazing.

174
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,657
It looks like my father could walk
out of here this afternoon.

175
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,817
Good.

176
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,623
And I know my whole family
just thanked you again and again

177
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,394
but I wanted to say it too.

178
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,561
- So thanks.
- It's all right, Nikki.

179
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,773
You look so different.

180
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,639
Last time I saw you, I don't think
you even owned a belt.

181
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,181
You used to wear the same
flannel shirt every day for a week.

182
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,947
A lot's changed, I guess.

183
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,282
And now you're doing so great.

184
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,087
Kind of makes me wonder
why you never call

185
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,730
just to say hi, you know?

186
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,697
I was just trying to put everything
behind me, I guess.

187
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,604
But I thought about you a lot.

188
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,582
- I've gotta go, I guess.
- Yeah.

189
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,724
Tell your dad not to hurry back
to the office, okay?

190
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,192
He always was a workaholic.

191
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,803
We just got the phone records
in from Gary's safe house.

192
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,072
A call came in at 1 1 :1 4 a.m.

193
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,641
Eleven-fourteen?
That's right before we got there.

194
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,580
It's a tip-off call. It had to be.

195
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,914
It came from inside the 4400 Center.

196
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,121
Look, I really don't know what to say.

197
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,527
I can't tell you why that call
came from my office,

198
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,228
but I didn't make it.

199
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,628
Heather, we've got phone records
that say it came from your extension.

200
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,632
You said the call
was made around 1 1 :1 0, right?

201
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,630
Then there's no way
it could have been me.

202
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,297
I was teaching a class
from 1 1 to noon.

203
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,210
I was standing in front
of 1 2 students for the entire hour.

204
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,777
I never left the room.

205
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,811
Anyone else have access
to your office?

206
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,875
Just the janitor. But you'd have
to ask Maintenance about that.

207
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,782
We will. We'll need to talk
to your students as well.

208
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,256
Look, Heather,
NTAC isn't the only organization

209
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,949
investigating the Nova Group.

210
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,527
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking at those phone records.

211
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,789
They're all gonna be less friendly
than we are.

212
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,193
Sorry, guys.

213
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,097
It's like I said. I was in class.

214
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,204
That's all I know.

215
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,337
I got a little worried about you
this afternoon.

216
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,948
You were gone all day again.

217
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,379
I was out walking.

218
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,819
I like to do that now.

219
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,993
Dad, I need you to talk to Shawn.

220
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,854
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.

221
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,893
I can't do that.

222
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,993
For one thing, I don't think it is.

223
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,828
I know how much it must hurt
right now, but you'll get over it.

224
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,665
Don't talk to me like I'm a teenager.

225
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,574
There are things I have to do.
They're going to be really hard.

226
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,907
Dangerous.

227
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,573
And if Shawn's not with me,
it's gonna make things worse.

228
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,584
Worse for who? You?

229
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,188
No. Everyone else.

230
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,058
And what if he says no?

231
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,929
Be more convincing.

232
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,196
Heather. What's up?

233
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,697
I need to talk to you.

234
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,710
Listen, I've been thinking
all day about this.

235
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,641
I didn't tell you everything
this afternoon.

236
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,546
There was someone
who had the key to my office.

237
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:50,112
Okay, this person,
I need to know who it was.

238
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,883
Tom, it was Alana.

239
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,000
I didn't wanna say anything
in front of your partner.

240
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,159
I'm sure you understand why.

241
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,869
Tom, did Alana know

242
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,066
that you found out
where this guy Gary was living?

243
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,705
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

244
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,012
I was on the phone with her
when the tip came in. I told her.

245
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,980
She knew we'd been
chasing Gary for a long time.

246
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,949
Heather, come on, it wasn't Alana.

247
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,217
There has to be
some other explanation.

248
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,985
I hope so.

249
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,620
And I hope you find it.

250
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,664
But what do I do while you're looking?

251
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,267
You said it yourself, you're not the only
one with access to those records.

252
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,666
You're not the only one
who's gonna come asking questions.

253
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,001
You tell anyone who asks the
same thing you told me this afternoon.

254
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,040
Your alibi checks out.

255
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,234
Unless you say differently,

256
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,246
no one is gonna be able to prove you
lent that key to Alana or anyone else.

257
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,515
Heather, Alana didn't make that call.

258
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,778
If you just stick to your story for one
more day, this whole thing will be over.

259
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,483
What if I say no?

260
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,183
She comes after me? You?

261
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,090
I don't know.

262
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,788
I know she's determined
to get you back.

263
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,833
It's like she sees you
as her one connection to the world,

264
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,266
to people, to a normal life.

265
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,565
So, what you're saying
is it's like my job,

266
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,799
to keep her, I don't know, human?

267
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,069
It sounds that way, doesn't it?

268
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,807
Look, Shawn...

269
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,009
...I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
But I do know this.

270
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,721
Isabelle's not giving up.
Not without a fight.

271
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,882
And we've both seen what happens
when my daughter decides to fight.

272
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,548
Is everything all right, Thomas?

273
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,685
Don't think about it as informing.
You're helping us catch a criminal.

274
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,349
Now, I need you to tell me, who
did you lend Heather's office key to?

275
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,554
Sweetie, please. This is important.

276
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,494
Somebody compromised
our investigation.

277
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,267
I didn't give the key to anyone.

278
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,830
It was me, Thomas.

279
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,841
I called Gary Navarro.

280
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,118
I don't understand.
Are you a member of the Nova Group?

281
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,625
- No, of course not.
- Then why?

282
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,427
I trusted you.

283
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,799
I told you what we were doing
and you used it to betray me.

284
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,460
I wasn't betraying you. I did it for you.

285
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,467
How many times have I heard you say
that you felt responsible

286
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,110
for what happened to Gary Navarro?

287
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,269
He came to you for help

288
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,610
and instead the government used him
and turned him against his own kind.

289
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:09,277
I don't like what happened to Gary.
But he chose to become a terrorist.

290
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,646
He joined Nova of his own free will.

291
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,348
Gary wasn't with the Nova Group
anymore.

292
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,426
What?
How would you even know that?

293
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,586
A lot of people at the Center know it.

294
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,532
After the Nova Group
had T.J. Kim murdered,

295
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,258
he turned his back on them.

296
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,766
How can you even believe that?

297
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,337
Gary personally tried to murder
Dennis Ryland.

298
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:32,000
Ryland is responsible
for the death of 28 4400s.

299
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,975
Twenty-eight people that might
have changed the world for the better,

300
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,546
were they allowed to live.

301
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,309
He declared war on us.
I almost died, Thomas.

302
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,010
All Gary did was fight back.

303
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,678
You should have told me
what you were gonna do.

304
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,789
I wanted to.

305
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,988
But I couldn't.

306
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,857
You were bound by your job.

307
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,055
You couldn't give Gary
another chance.

308
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,860
So I did it for you.

309
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,935
And now you're gonna stand trial
right alongside of him.

310
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,002
You made that phone call
from the Center.

311
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,472
It's right there
on Gary's phone records.

312
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,237
They'll figure it out it was you, Alana.

313
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,448
So, what?
Am I supposed to lie for you now?

314
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,778
Am I supposed to become
Gary's accomplice too now?

315
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,648
I'm not asking you to do anything,
Thomas.

316
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,786
If you want to turn me in, fine.
But I believe I did the right thing.

317
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,493
And I hope the man I love
would believe it too.

318
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,738
Nikki, if I did pay off
your dad's hospital bill--

319
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,874
And I'm not admitting to anything.

320
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,442
--let's just say
that it's not that big of a deal, okay?

321
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,479
I'm glad to do something
with my money.

322
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,613
Giving up my social life to work
seven days a week at this place

323
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,844
has to have its perks, right?

324
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,812
I have a hard time believing
that you don't have a social life.

325
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,720
Running this place is a big job.

326
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,623
You know,
it kind of cuts you off from the world.

327
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,297
Well, I don't have $60,000.

328
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,860
But if you're feeling isolated,

329
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,666
you know, maybe I can
pay you back in another way.

330
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,944
There's a new sushi place
that opened in Belltown.

331
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,742
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

332
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,612
You like sushi now?

333
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,813
You're not the only one
who can change.

334
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,683
Just give me a second, okay?

335
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,791
Hey, Shawn.

336
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,694
Have you seen my copy
of The Republic in here?

337
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,061
No, you know what? I haven't seen it.

338
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,265
Hello again. I'm lsabelle.

339
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,834
Nikki. Nice to meet you.

340
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,404
I've heard of you.

341
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,378
Well, let me know if you find my book.

342
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,483
I'm right in the middle of it.

343
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,255
So tomorrow night?

344
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,519
You wanna check out
this new sushi place?

345
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,620
Yeah.

346
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,464
Oh, my God.

347
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,659
Tom, I'm so sorry.

348
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,631
Anything I can do to help?

349
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,238
I don't know.

350
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,742
I don't know what I can do.
I can't just turn Alana in.

351
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,513
If we do catch Gary,
eventually he's gonna give her up.

352
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,812
So, either way, her life is ruined.

353
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,545
Well, Tom, there's no way
you can try

354
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,417
and shake this agency off
Gary's scent.

355
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,888
You'll wind up a felon yourself.

356
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,457
I have to do something, Diana.
We're talking about Alana.

357
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,259
And one way or another, we've been
together for more than a decade.

358
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,963
I have to protect her.

359
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,368
Once I know she's safe,
then I can figure out how we move on.

360
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,033
If we move on.

361
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,678
You need to keep yourself safe too.

362
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,306
I think that the best thing
that we can do,

363
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,780
the only thing we can do...

364
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,578
...is to take ourselves off this case.

365
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,020
And do what?

366
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,549
Cross our fingers.

367
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,655
Hope Gary buys himself
a one-way ticket to Costa Rica.

368
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,608
What did you expect to happen?

369
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,805
I don't know.
But it's only for 36 hours, right?

370
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,282
- That's all they can hold her for.
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

371
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,415
They can hold her for as long
as it takes to investigate her alibi.

372
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,387
We're talking about
Dennis Ryland here.

373
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,186
You told me a dozen times,

374
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,795
he'll do whatever it takes
to get information.

375
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,023
He's going to interrogate her
and I don't know how far it's gonna go.

376
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,567
Alana, I'll call his office
in the morning.

377
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,764
I checked out
Heather's alibi myself.

378
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,967
I'll give them my notes.
It'll all go on the record.

379
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,172
Right now it's all I can do.

380
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:16,888
You know, I'm always happy
to talk to one of the 4400.

381
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,621
But I have to say,

382
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,732
I was surprised to find you
waiting outside my office this morning.

383
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:29,306
You can release Heather Tobey.
That phone call to Gary Navarro,

384
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,635
I was the one who made it.

385
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,777
Dennis, thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

386
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,789
What were you thinking, Tom,

387
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,622
to get romantically involved
with a 4400?

388
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,596
What Alana did was misguided.
It was wrong.

389
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,563
But Gary wasn't part
of the Nova Group anymore.

390
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,331
Are you actually gonna stand here
and defend Gary Navarro to me?

391
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,474
The Nova Group isn't a bridge club.
You don't just leave.

392
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,636
Even if Gary tried to,

393
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,978
that doesn't absolve his other crimes,
which include attempted murder.

394
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,551
If the doctors had gotten to me
30 seconds later,

395
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,778
I would have been dead.

396
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,185
I know how badly
you want him, Dennis.

397
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:23,225
If it was up to me, Gary Navarro
would never even make it to trial.

398
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,659
Okay, forget about Gary.

399
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,456
Can we just concentrate on Alana?

400
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,830
Well, I'm afraid it's not possible
to make that distinction.

401
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,198
They're kind of intertwined,
aren't they, Tom?

402
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,864
Alana will be prosecuted like
any other member of the Nova Group.

403
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,738
She's not a member
of the Nova Group.

404
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,838
Dennis.

405
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,082
Dennis.

406
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,010
We've known each other
for 25 years.

407
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,419
You have to help me.

408
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,890
Like you helped me
when my back was to the wall?

409
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,297
Okay, I'm not a petty man, Tom.

410
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,601
I'll honor our relationship.

411
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,967
Thank you.

412
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,545
I appreciate anything you can do.

413
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,573
I'll tell NSA
you had nothing to do with this.

414
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,455
You may be a dupe,
but you're not a traitor.

415
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,318
And as for Alana,

416
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,893
the best chance of seeing mercy
is to cooperate fully

417
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,688
and help us find Gary Navarro.

418
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,594
Now you wanna catch
Gary Navarro?

419
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,865
Tom, we've already passed
the case off to Roth and Tierney.

420
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,632
We've got to get him before they do.

421
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,572
We've got to get him before
Ryland does. Before anyone.

422
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,806
Look, Ryland wants Gary.
It's a personal thing.

423
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,348
If we get can get Gary first,
we can deal with Ryland directly.

424
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,681
A straight-up trade. Gary for Alana.

425
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,683
So Ryland gets his hands on Gary
and it happens with no official record.

426
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,295
No arrest.
None of that sticky due process.

427
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,830
You really think
that Ryland's gonna agree to that?

428
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,990
If we dangle Gary in front of him?
In a heartbeat.

429
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,795
Look, Tom, l...

430
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,165
You saved my daughter's life.

431
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,070
I owe you everything for that
and I'll do what you want here.

432
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,337
But this is dangerous.

433
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,913
And it's a lot of trouble to go to for...

434
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,443
...a woman
who just betrayed you.

435
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,851
I owe her that much. More than that.

436
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,491
My son is incarcerated, Diana.

437
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,786
Alana's been right there with me
all the way through it.

438
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,966
And she doesn't deserve to rot in some
secret prison for the rest of her life.

439
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,765
Well,

440
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,666
any idea where we'd start?

441
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,100
Yeah.

442
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,316
Hey, Shawn.

443
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,312
Isabelle.

444
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,782
What are you doing in here?

445
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,221
I came by to talk.

446
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,357
I know you're still thinking about us,
but we're still friends, right?

447
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,692
I can still drop by.

448
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,661
Well, lsabelle, usually friends knock.

449
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,361
What's up?

450
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,470
I came to talk to you about Nikki.

451
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,268
I know you pretty well.

452
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,373
I don't think
she's the right girl for you.

453
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,976
Well, I don't know
why you think she's my girl.

454
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,511
You're entitled to your opinion,
though, I guess.

455
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,620
I'm just trying to protect you.

456
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:46,858
I just have this feeling
that if you guys get together...

457
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,198
...it's going to end badly.

458
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,769
Isabelle, what does that mean?

459
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,841
- Are you threatening Nikki now?
- Of course not.

460
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,944
Why would I threaten Nikki?

461
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:06,482
It's just, I have this feeling
that if you two hook up,

462
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,846
it's not going to end well.

463
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,052
Not for you.

464
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,014
Especially not for her.

465
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,017
It's always harder on the girl,
you know?

466
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,697
Hey.

467
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,261
Are you doing okay?

468
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,801
Yeah, more or less.

469
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,939
I want to help you, Alana.
I want to get you out of here.

470
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,480
- I don't think you can.
- I do.

471
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,341
I think there's a way,

472
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,612
but I need you to trust me.

473
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,192
I think you should cooperate
with Dennis Ryland.

474
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,622
Tell him whatever he wants to know.

475
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,533
I can't do that, Thomas.

476
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,501
That would be a betrayal.

477
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,298
Learn to live with it.

478
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,267
Listen to me, if you don't cooperate,

479
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,241
I don't think you're ever
gonna get out of here.

480
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,142
I can't.

481
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,953
Then I can't help you.

482
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,814
Thomas.

483
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,659
I was supposed to take the students

484
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,093
on a field trip to the aquarium
this afternoon.

485
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,964
I need you to go there
and leave them a note.

486
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,505
There's a bulletin board
outside the aquarium.

487
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:42,004
You should put it there
and it should say "field trip canceled."

488
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,876
Some of the kids will show up
with their parents.

489
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,113
When you see them,

490
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,812
give them my apologies.

491
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,486
I'll make sure they understand.

492
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,268
It was a code. At least I think it was.

493
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,637
She was telling me
how to get ahold of Gary.

494
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,213
Well, I don't know, Tom.
It's already been two hours.

495
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,474
Let's give it another 1 5 minutes.

496
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,189
Diana.

497
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,425
Gary, stop!

498
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,405
- Oh, my God.
- Get down, get down.

499
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,038
- Move along.
-Get down, get down, get down.

500
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,943
- Look out.
- Get out of the way.

501
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,723
Look out, look out.

502
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,525
Get out of the way.

503
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,392
- Hey.
- Go get the gun.

504
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,157
Come on.

505
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,965
Get the kids, get the kids.

506
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,600
Look out, get back.

507
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,301
- Go, move.
- Watch out, watch out.

508
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,909
Don't move, Gary. Don't move.

509
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,677
It's over, Gary.

510
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,057
Come on, get up.

511
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,397
So you're gonna turn me over
to Ryland.

512
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,669
You know
what he's gonna do to me, right?

513
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,305
Ryland is gonna interrogate me.

514
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,602
Yeah, you know all about that.

515
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,167
You've seen that firsthand.

516
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,670
And then he's going to
disappear me.

517
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,748
No trial. No record.

518
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,443
I'm not a mind reader, Gary.
Not like you.

519
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,815
I have no idea
what Ryland's gonna do with you.

520
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,583
That's how you get through this
hand-off with your conscience intact?

521
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,354
All right, you wanna know?
I'm trading you for Alana.

522
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,660
She helped you, now it's your chance
to help her. You owe her that much.

523
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,597
You made your own bed, Gary.

524
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,362
Nobody forced you to join Nova.
Nobody forced you to kill people.

525
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,165
I was a baseball player.

526
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,509
I was worried
about making the major leagues.

527
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,971
That's it.

528
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,511
If I hadn't met you two,
I'd be shagging grounders right now.

529
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,255
Okay, you should go.
If you still want to, that is.

530
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,523
But if you make this deal with Ryland,
it's forever.

531
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,190
I mean, we live with this.

532
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,302
I'll call you after the meet.

533
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,997
You're gonna have to
move him right away.

534
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,538
Seven-thirty, on the nose.

535
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,044
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

536
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:09,015
A big mogul like you,
figured that you'd keep a girl waiting.

537
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,326
You ready to go?

539
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,757
Nikki,

540
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,821
Iisten, we can't do this.

541
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,969
Do what? Dinner?

542
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,536
Shawn, it's not a big deal.
That's what people do at night.

543
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,602
You know this is about
more than just dinner.

544
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,441
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to stand you up.

545
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,447
I just can't do this right now.

546
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,852
Shawn, I don't get it.

547
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,411
What happened?

548
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,252
Did some adviser tell you
that I don't fit in with your PR strategy?

549
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,656
No, nothing like that.

550
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,070
It's gonna sound like
a stupid guy thing.

551
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,671
Me leaving here right now
is the best thing I can do for you.

552
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,914
All right, then.

553
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,418
Go.

554
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,596
Bye.

555
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:37,164
So, Tom, I'm guessing

556
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,041
that if I don't agree
to this trade you're proposing,

557
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:48,377
you're not gonna drop Navarro off
at the nearest police station, are you?

558
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,815
You say no

559
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,081
and you can forget about
getting your hands on Gary Navarro.

560
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,083
I'll get him a passport,
a plane ticket.

561
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,126
He'll be in a Third World country
by this time tomorrow.

562
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,260
And if I decide to play along?

563
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,160
You want to know whether I'll be
asking questions about Gary Navarro

564
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,963
after you drive away with him?

565
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,539
No,

566
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,836
I won't be.

567
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:18,306
It's gonna be tricky to make
the charges against Alana go away.

568
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,409
You can do it, Dennis.
I have faith in you.

569
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,033
Let's go.

570
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,040
Listen, take this key ring.

571
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,242
The blue key
opens a safe-deposit box.

572
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,651
There are eight letters inside,
and I'd appreciate it if you'd mail them.

573
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,384
These letters,
who are they addressed to?

574
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,960
Eight families. All over the world.

575
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,361
Your NSA work.

576
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,867
Those are the families of the 4400s
that you helped target.

577
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,831
Right. I figure...

578
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,372
...it's time to let them know
what happened.

579
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,275
Give them a sense of closure.

580
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,344
Seems like the least I can do.

581
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,879
Seems like the only thing I can do,
actually.

582
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,751
You okay?

583
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,295
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,396
It's all right.
I know it wasn't your idea.

585
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,311
Nice working with you again, Tom.

586
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,163
Well, that went well.

587
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,006
Tell me, why do I have
such a weird feeling in my stomach?

588
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,600
It's not easy
to sentence a man to death.

589
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,150
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

590
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:16,884
Quiet back there.

591
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,561
It's all right. Let him pray.

592
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,857
Forgive us our trespasses as we...

593
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,270
Look out. Pull over.

594
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,518
Get out of the car. Get out.

595
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,484
Keep your hands
where I can see them. Up.

596
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,880
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

597
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,390
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

598
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,998
Tom, you need to think about this.

599
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,260
Tom, you're letting a terrorist
walk free.

600
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,200
No, I was a soldier.
You created me.

601
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,764
All I did was switch sides.
Well, guess what?

602
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,205
Now I'm done fighting.

603
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,413
- I'm walking away from the war.
- There is no walking away.

604
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,481
You've got numerous federal charges
hanging over your head,

605
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,447
including attempted murder.

606
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,779
Murderers walk free
all the time, Dennis.

607
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,889
Some of them even get cushy jobs
at Fortune 500 companies.

608
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,615
Very cute, Tom.

609
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,192
Have you thought about
what this means for your girlfriend?

610
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,923
Making her a fugitive is kind of
a funny way of showing your love.

611
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,464
I'd rather be on the run

612
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:33,626
than be responsible
for handing over a 4400 to you.

613
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,608
Skouris, you're supposed to be
the level-headed one.

614
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,142
Are you really gonna
throw your career away

615
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,338
because your partner
is on some personal crusade?

616
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,415
Oh, I don't see it that way, Dennis.

617
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,382
And if you want to hold on to your job,
you won't say anything about this.

618
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,654
A 4400 you personally signed out
of a military detention facility?

619
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,118
A secret trade in a remote location?
It's all kind of messy.

620
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:02,297
I'm guessing this one
stays off the books.

621
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,996
Let's go.

622
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,243
Nice working with you again, Dennis.

623
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,263
There's two lDs in there, and there's
enough cash to last you for a while.

624
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,632
The Canadian border's
about 30 miles away.

625
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,536
I'd-- I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.

626
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,475
Yeah.

627
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,283
You know, it's been almost two years
since I've met you two.

628
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,018
And I remember that you said
that you would help me.

629
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,994
Well, it's been a long time coming,
but I guess you finally came through.

630
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,060
Thank you.

631
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,540
I didn't want us to end, Thomas.
Ever.

632
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,615
And especially not here, like this.

633
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,914
It doesn't have to end.

634
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,250
I can come with you.

635
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,821
You can't.

636
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,922
You need to be here.

637
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,265
You're one of the only good men
left in this fight.

638
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:48,235
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.
