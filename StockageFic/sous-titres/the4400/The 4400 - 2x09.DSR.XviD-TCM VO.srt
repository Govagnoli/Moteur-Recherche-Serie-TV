1
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,631
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,904
I'm blacking out.

3
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,992
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.

4
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,145
What's he going to do ?
Turn me over to NTAC medical ?

5
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,019
Let me see if i've got this straight.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:59,362
You two met, fell in love, and spent eight years
together in some kind of alternative reality ?

7
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,698
Liv, you were pretty far
gone last night.

8
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:04,375
When i O. D., it's not going
to be any big loss, right ?

9
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,790
Maybe i can save you.

10
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,338
Whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.

11
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,851
That's easy to say.
You don't know what "it" is.

12
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:15,078
You told me everything
that happened that night, right ?

13
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,158
Yeah.

14
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:18,974
If you need some time
to clear your head

15
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,557
and get away from everything
so you can figure stuff out,

16
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,201
I can make that happen.

17
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:23,973
dad,

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,099
i had to leave. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,416
Look, i'm not interested in excuses.

20
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:35,043
I don't care how you do it,
who you have to lean on,

21
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:37,438
You just get him out of
lock-up and over to L. A. X.

22
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:39,000
I want him on
the next plane out.

23
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,508
Skouris, where's Baldwin ?

24
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:49,056
He's not in yet. Why ?
What's going on ?

25
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,095
L. A. P. D. Is holding some piece of street garbage
who wants to see daylight again.

26
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:55,735
Says he can make the dealer
who sold the Collier murder weapon.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,414
Who's handling
the l. A. Interview ?

28
00:01:57,437 --> 00:02:00,161
Nobody. I'm having him shipped
up here for questioning.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,390
This one feels good.

30
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,091
My partner's going to
like hearing that.

31
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,543
You can fill me in when
i get to the office.

32
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,905
Look, i know we're not ready
to pop any champagne yet, but

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,555
this witness has intel we kept out of the media,
specific details about the Collier murder weapon.

34
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,210
Sounds like we finally
caught a break.

35
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,901
Look, Diana, i really have to go.

36
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,505
Are you okay ?
You sound a little distracted.

37
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,583
It's personal business.
Not your worry.

38
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,568
Well, any idea
what time you'll be in ?

39
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't really say just yet.

40
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,405
Look, i'll get in touch with you
as soon as i can, okay ?

41
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,591
Okay, no problem.

42
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:32,331
Bye.

43
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,924
How long has this been going on ?

44
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,640
Calm down.

45
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,786
No. I asked you a question.
How long ?

46
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,890
Look, Kyle told me, like, a month ago.

47
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,054
Look, you remember that night ?

48
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:43,735
Wha...

49
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,189
What night ?

50
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:49,148
The night that he almost got arrested
for smashing that store window.

51
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,261
You mean when he got drunk ?

52
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,126
He never said he was drunk.
You said he was drunk.

53
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:54,887
Kyle said he blacked out.

54
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,591
It happened a bunch of times
after that. One minute,

55
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:03,198
he'd be one place, the next thing
he knew, he was someplace else.

56
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,854
He never mentioned it to me.

57
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:06,803
He never said anything.

58
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,952
Well, he tried once,
but you wouldn't listen.

59
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,737
Look, you could have
come to me, Danny,

60
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:13,733
Told me what was going on.
He's your cousin, your friend.

61
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,753
Which is why i promised him not to.

62
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,229
The last thing Kyle wanted was to
be thrown back into quarantine.

63
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:26,102
Danny, Kyle never came
home last night.

64
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,424
If you know where he is,
please, tell me.

65
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,512
He went to stay with Shawn
over at the 4400 center.

66
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,346
Great.

67
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,332
Uncle Tommy...

68
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:39,551
There's something else
you ought to know.

69
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:43,027
Kyle thinks he did something
during one of his blackouts.

70
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,897
He wouldn't tell us what it was,

71
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,963
But he really seemed
freaked out about it.

72
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,586
This is the committee
latest recommendation

73
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:55,559
37-Year-old pipe fitter from Detroit.

74
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,870
He was diagnosed with hodgkin's
disease four months ago.

75
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:58,926
When do we fly him in ?

76
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,772
Two days from now.

77
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:00,500
Shawn.

78
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,768
Where is he ?

79
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,069
Who ? Kyle ? He's not here.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,157
Don't play games with me, Shawn.

81
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:09,210
Can you excuse us, Lucy ?

82
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:10,114
Thank you.

83
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,803
Danny said Kyle came here.

84
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:15,538
Yeah, well, Danny needs to check his text
messages, because Kyle never showed.

85
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,541
You're not listening to me, Shawn.
I want my son.

86
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,880
You're not hearing me.

87
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,485
He's not here. Where do you think
i have him stashed, in the basement ?

88
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,586
I wouldn't put it past you.

89
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,747
Oh, my g...
Uncle Tommy !

90
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:29,516
Just because Kyle is having a rough time
does not make it my fault !

91
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,831
Been known to happen, Shawn.

92
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,238
He's not here !

93
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,197
he's not here.

94
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:52,661
Kyle ?

95
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,074
Thomas.

96
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,526
I picked this up
in a village outside Barcelona,

97
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:04,149
And they said it was very special.

98
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,270
What's wrong ?

99
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,169
Kyle never told me any of this.

100
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,637
At least i'm not the only one
out of the loop.

101
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,030
I thought the doctors said he was
fine when he left quarantine.

102
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,064
They did...

103
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,876
But he spent three years with a separate
consciousness living inside of him.

104
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,042
I don't think the doctors
knew what to do with that.

105
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,598
Have you called the police ?

106
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:29,558
I can't get them involved,
not until i know what Kyle did.

107
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,953
What about Linda ?

108
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:36,145
Well, she says she hasn't heard from him.
Promises to call if she does.

109
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,713
I'm sorry about all of this.

110
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:45,388
I'm just glad i'm back.

111
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,027
Where are you going ?

112
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:51,164
Well, i'm not going
to find him sitting here.

113
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:52,585
I'll come with you.

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,412
No. Look... I'd rather you
stay here by the phone.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,044
This way, if he calls...

116
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,193
You'll be here.

117
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,155
Okay.

118
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:03,551
I'll stay in touch.

119
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,386
and this guy is some
big-deal media consultant ?

120
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,729
oh, he's more than that.

121
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,181
Keith Petrick has prepped prime
ministers, members of parliament.

122
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:17,140
I'd say an interview with Sky News
merits a few hours' homework.

123
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:20,869
So he's going to tell me what ? Just new and
different ways to say "we're not a cult ?"

124
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:21,726
No,

125
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:24,286
he's going to teach you
to stay on message.

126
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,810
The british press loves
to play "gotcha."

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,446
Keith.

128
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,900
Matthew Ross. Thank you for coming.

129
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,685
This is Shawn Farrell.

130
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,258
Hi. Nice to meet you.

131
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:34,961
Shawn.

132
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,627
Just one minute. Sorry.

133
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,035
Uncle Tommy came to see me.

134
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:46,855
Yeah. That's what i figured.
He came here, too.

135
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:47,760
What'd you tell him ?

136
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,437
Well, the truth.
Kyle ditched us. He never showed.

137
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:52,491
Listen,

138
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,309
you know, he might still show up.

139
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:55,807
- You know ?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,620
I'd give you the big tour, but...

141
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,159
Yeah. No. Things are crazy. I get it.

142
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,671
Wait, just wait, just wait.
Liv. Liv. Hey.

143
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:03,977
This is Danny, my brother.

144
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:04,892
- Hi.
- Hey.

145
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,642
This is Liv.
She's one of our first keys.

146
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,027
Actually, i'm second key now.

147
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:08,755
Really ?

148
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,916
I'm impressed. Star pupil.

149
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,657
Hey, do you think
you could give him a tour ?

150
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,973
You know, Shawn, you don't have to...

151
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,835
I want you to see the place.
Just hold on. Is that cool ?

152
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,209
Sure. Yeah.

153
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,207
It's cool.

154
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:21,851
You two kids have fun.

155
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,838
I've got to... I have to
go back to work, so...

156
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,734
That's my brother,
off to heal the world.

157
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,554
Somebody has to.

158
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,043
You ready ?

159
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,510
Yeah. I'm all yours.

160
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,252
I know who sold the rifle
that killed Collier.

161
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,612
That's a start.

162
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,268
Does we have a name ?

163
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:45,450
Victor Rios.

164
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,110
R- I-O-S.

165
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,985
He lives at 43207

166
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,559
Sumac Drive.

167
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,294
S- U-M-A-C...

168
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,550
I've got it. Thank you.

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,331
I'm at Victor's place last month.

170
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,787
He gets all cranked up and starts
waving this cannon around

171
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,519
Like he's the second coming
of Tony Montana.

172
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,212
He wants to swap it
for some of my product.

173
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,619
I told him i wasn't interested.

174
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:15,097
Can you describe
the weapon, mr. Kovec ?

175
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,187
I watched him put
that sucker together.

176
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,302
.50 caliber.
Never saw bullets so big.

177
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,625
And it had this humongous
scope on it,

178
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,830
Like a huge neon sign
saying "can't miss."

179
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,368
What makes you so sure this was
the weapon that killed Collier ?

180
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,059
Because...

181
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:35,685
Next time i saw Rios, he was bragging on
how much he scored for that piece.

182
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,200
This was, like...

183
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:40,667
Two days before Collier
got taken out.

184
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:43,497
I figure that's not a coincidence.

185
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,998
What do you think ?

186
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,101
I ask you to give him a quick tour,
and two hours later...

187
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,296
She's a good guide.
Really sells this place.

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
Danny was expecting
shaved heads and robes.

189
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,842
Yeah. I didn't see
a single tambourine.

190
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,829
Are you disappointed ?

191
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:00,764
Ah, you don't hear
me complaining.

192
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,300
So, hey, listen, big boss man,

193
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,496
You let your workers off
the farm at night ?

194
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:08,596
So i invited Liv to a party,
but she's too shy to ask if it's okay.

195
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,802
Think of her like a missionary...

196
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,479
A lot of potential recruits
out there at the northmount campus.

197
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,367
Could be cool. I haven't left
the center in a while.

198
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,427
I don't think it's a good idea.

199
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,938
I'm sorry, man. You're going to have
to find yourself a different date.

200
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,276
Who are you, her warden ?

201
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:25,897
Danny.

202
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:32,319
Listen, you guys can hang out here
as much as you want, no problem.

203
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,374
But a kegger,
that's an different story.

204
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:37,272
The wise and powerful
Shawn has spoken.

205
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,395
I hear and obey, your majesty.

206
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:43,424
I'm serious.

207
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,065
Since when did Shawn have
such a problem with keggers ?

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,906
Since he developed
a messiah complex.

209
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,189
So what time's this party ?

210
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:08,995
All right.

211
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:14,138
I woke up in the middle of the night and there
was Kyle, out here, crouching in the hallway.

212
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,171
With no idea how he got there.

213
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,158
That's right.

214
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,600
And i sent him away.

215
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:21,960
You were, uh..

216
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,717
you were scared.
It's understandable.

217
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,607
Not as scared as he was.

218
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,400
I told him he needed to get help, that
he should talk to you about these blackouts.

219
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,582
I wish he had.
We'd have worked it out.

220
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,238
Well, he wanted to.

221
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,504
Then what stopped him ?

222
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,382
Look, Mr. Baldwin, your relationship
with your son is none of my business...

223
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,159
Agreed, but if you have
something to say, say it.

224
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,846
I'm sure Kyle loves you...

225
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,807
But i don't think he really trusts you.

226
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,563
What ?

227
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:55,292
He told you that ?

228
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:56,431
Pretty much.

229
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:01,901
Eggs, butter, walnuts,
cocoa powder.

230
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,366
Who said making
brownies was difficult ?

231
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,619
Don't forget to preheat
the oven at 350 degrees.

232
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:08,511
Uh-Oh.

233
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:11,106
Now things are getting
really complicated.

234
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,043
Relax.

235
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,039
I'm just kidding.

236
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,437
Yeah ?

237
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:24,267
Now ?

238
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:30,939
No. That shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to get a sitter first.

239
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,297
If there's a problem,
i'll call you back.

240
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:37,113
I'm sorry, sweetie, i've got to go
to work. I'll call mrs. Skalka, see...

241
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,970
No, wait. Don't go.

242
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,878
Well, i have to. We can make
brownies another time.

243
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,203
That man...

244
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,517
You don't want to catch him.

245
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,654
What man ?

246
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,646
The man you're chasing after.

247
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,818
Someone's going to get hurt.

248
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:57,283
Who ?

249
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:00,383
Is it someone i work with ?

250
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,814
I don't know.
Just don't go.

251
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,947
Are you worried about me ?

252
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:08,405
Don't go.

253
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,166
Do you think i should get to
my car and head for the border ?

254
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,395
Or ask to be assigned
to another case.

255
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,542
Hmm. Hand the risk
off to another agent ?

256
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,068
It's not an option.

257
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,248
Have you told Tom ?

258
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:30,032
No, not yet. He's been off
the case for a while.

259
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,449
Might be better for his health
if he stays that way.

260
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,253
She said someone was going to
get hurt, but she didn't say who.

261
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:38,871
I don't know.

262
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,323
Maia's visions
aren't usually so vague.

263
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,445
This time, she's had a vision
involving her mother.

264
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,310
Maybe she doesn't want
to see it too clearly.

265
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,230
You're not making me
feel any better.

266
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,072
Okay.

267
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:00,996
How about this ?

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,657
Hmm ?

269
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:06,655
Any better ?

270
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:07,911
Sure.

271
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,539
You recognize that man,
Mrs. Rios ?

272
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,357
He was a customer
of your husband's.

273
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,484
Husband ?

274
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,593
He got me my green card
and more trouble than i need.

275
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,106
Why don't you ask victor ?
If you can find him.

276
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,752
Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.
Your husband has left the country.

277
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,478
Now, we know he's in puerto rico.

278
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,321
You see ? You know more than me.

279
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,801
He didn't tell you he was leaving ?

280
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,350
I haven't seen him in two weeks.

281
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,101
Look, i need to get back to work.

282
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,352
A month ago, your husband
qold this man a weapon.

283
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,902
Your husband is implicated
in a murder, Mrs. Rios.

284
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,004
This is not a very good
thing for you.

285
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,458
Particularly if you value
your green card.

286
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:45,619
Why don't you just take
another look at the sketch ?

287
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,288
I remember the beanie.

288
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:58,618
Not a regular customer.
He only stopped by once.

289
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,765
He was the one
who bought the big rifle.

290
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:03,104
And the handgun.

291
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,029
What handgun ?

292
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,845
Uh, you know.
What do you call it ? A 9 mm.

293
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,301
Anything else ?

294
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,775
He was young... In his twenties.
Very quiet.

295
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,919
He only stayed a few minutes,
then left in a taxi.

296
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,588
How do you know that ?

297
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,490
I called it for him.

298
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,592
Oh, we're going to
need that number.

299
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,114
We were in the middle
of a bio-lab practical,

300
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,776
Kyle stood up, said he'd be
right back, and that was it...

301
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:31,950
Bye-Bye.

302
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,122
Didn't see him again
till the next day.

303
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,118
About what time did he leave ?

304
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,547
Had to be 7:00, 8:00, tops.

305
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,904
He's wrong, as usual.
It was closer to 6:00.

306
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,664
Don't you remember ?
We broke up right after Kyle ditched.

307
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:45,779
Yeah, look.

308
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:48,092
Anybody remember the date ?

309
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,438
End of last month, wasn't it ?

310
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,128
It was the 25th.

311
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:54,241
You sure ?

312
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,372
Yeah. I remember when i got back to
the dorm, it was all over the news.

313
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,376
Jordan Collier's murder.

314
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,012
Baldwin.

315
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,055
You going to grace us
with a visit tomorrow ?

316
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,613
Yeah, i'm hoping, but right now
it's looking doubtful.

317
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,913
Doubtful doesn't cut it.

318
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:37,882
We're closing in on this guy. Look,
we've got real leads, and i need you in here.

319
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,291
What kind of leads ?

320
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,429
You want to know ?
You get your ass into work.

321
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:53,181
Thomas, it could be anyone.

322
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:56,011
Look closer.
Tell me there isn't a resemblance.

323
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:59,355
This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier ?

324
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:02,208
If it happened during one of the blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

325
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:05,331
Not if the future wanted
their number one prophet dead.

326
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:10,024
So you think they were
controlling him again ?

327
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,924
Yeah, directing his actions,
moving him around like a puppet.

328
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,439
Anything's possible.

329
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,646
Well, in that case,
he wasn't responsible.

330
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:21,169
The "body snatcher" defense ? Alana,
i'm not sure the jury's going to buy it.

331
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,610
What the hell do
they want from Kyle ?

332
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:27,181
They took four years of his life.
Isn't that enough ?

333
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,377
They warned us
about this, remember ?

334
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,787
They said you'd be
facing a crisis.

335
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,748
What, and that makes it all right ?

336
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,486
They warned me ?

337
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:39,959
I don't remember them telling me
they'd turn my son into a murderer.

338
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:41,332
There must be a reason.

339
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:44,444
Don't defend them, Alana.
Just don't ! They used me...

340
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,295
All of us... Kyle, Shawn.

341
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,233
I'm fed up.

342
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,287
I love him too.

343
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:54,163
I know. I know you do,
Alana. Just...

344
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:02,487
I've got to find him
before ntac does.

345
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,968
I've got to find him.

346
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,909
Stop it.
Serious business.

347
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,688
Your answers are going to determine
how far you would go in the center.

348
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:18,140
If that security guard comes by,
we'll both get kicked out.

349
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,361
Is that far enough ?

350
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,989
Okay... question number one...

351
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:25,786
Did you have fun tonight ?

352
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:28,088
Aren't you glad
we didn't listen to Shawn ?

353
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,062
That's two questions.

354
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,013
- Shh.
- Oh !

355
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,612
You're supposed to think about your
answers, not say them out loud.

356
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,218
- Right.
- Rules are rules.

357
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:36,158
Okay.

358
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:41,019
What, are we done ?

359
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,263
Question number two...

360
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,856
Are you ready for
the night to be over ?

361
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,284
If your answer to question
number two is "no,"

362
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:00,315
Remove your goggles

363
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,511
and take your medicine.

364
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:11,484
Percocet.

365
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,150
Where'd you get these ?

366
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,871
At the party. Your buddy had
them in the medicine cabinet.

367
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,513
So you stole them ?

368
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:26,685
What's going on in here ?
This area's closed.

369
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:35,398
Thanks so much, mrs. Skalka.

370
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,172
I couldn't sleep.

371
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:56,093
Was that because of me ?

372
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,475
Well, i'm home now, sweetie.

373
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:01,718
No worries.

374
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,547
You know this case
that i'm working on,

375
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:11,103
Can you tell me anything else
about what you saw ?

376
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,475
Anything at all ?

377
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,878
Because if you're keeping
something from me...

378
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,541
I told you everything.

379
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,958
Don't you believe me ?

380
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,121
Of course i do.

381
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,724
Are you going to work tomorrow ?

382
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:32,861
Well, honey, it's my job.

383
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,305
Can i go to sleep now ?

384
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:40,592
Sure.

385
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,084
Here.

386
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,107
Linda.

387
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:58,915
Have you heard from Kyle ?

388
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:02,673
No. I would've called you if i had.
I was hoping you'd heard something.

389
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,551
Linda, you two talk all the time.

390
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,882
Yeah, i don't remember any law
against it in the divorce settlement.

391
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:09,594
Listen, Linda, if you have
any idea where he is...

392
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,896
What, you think i'm holding
something back ?

393
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,446
You're the one with all the secrets.

394
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,917
Look, you're his mother. It makes
sense you'd try to protect him.

395
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,467
In any way i could.

396
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,874
But i thought that's why he was
living with you, wasn't it ?

397
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,577
Protecting him was
supposed to be your specialty.

398
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,625
You want to blame me ? Fine.
Go ahead, but i've got to find Kyle now.

399
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,474
What if he doesn't want
you to find him ?

400
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,567
I think he may be in trouble.

401
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:33,117
Serious trouble.

402
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:36,675
Tom, what is it ?

403
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,788
What did he do ?

404
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,480
At least give me a hint.

405
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,488
You don't want to know.

406
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:49,691
It's like i said...

407
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,785
You're the one
with all the secrets.

408
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:09,283
Hello ?

409
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,078
Kyle, i just spoke to your father.

410
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:13,961
You didn't tell him where i was.

411
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:17,683
You came to me because you didn't want to
go back to NTAC. That's what you said.

412
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:20,090
Mom, i can't talk to you
about this. I told you.

413
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,992
Well, that's not the whole story, is it ?

414
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,289
Mom, please.

415
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:26,767
Kyle, tell me what's going on.

416
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,427
Could you excuse me
for a moment ?

417
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:43,731
- Sure.
- Thank you.

418
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,352
Just don't tell me
"i told you so."

419
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,841
Okay, i won't, but i did.

420
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,764
Don't go blaming Danny for any of this.
It was all me, okay ?

421
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,580
The night just got away from me.
I had some beers, and i...

422
00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:10,173
You shouldn't be having beers, Liv.
You shouldn't be having anything.

423
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:12,043
A month ago, you were an addict.

424
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,953
We can quit the lecture.
I've already packed my bags.

425
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,783
You know, you want to quit,
i can't stop you.

426
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:21,965
But if you want to stay...

427
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,932
and you can promise me that nothing like this
is ever going to happen again, then please,

428
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,693
enjoy life as a first key.

429
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm a second key.

430
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:32,226
Not anymore.

431
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:37,146
Mr. Farrell ? Are you going
to be much longer ?

432
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:39,200
No.
Come in.

433
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,559
So i've...

434
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,409
i've got a bunch o
new songs i've written.

435
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:48,180
Maybe i can play them
for you sometime.

436
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,401
Yeah. We'll see.

437
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:09,662
It's not like i know him better
than you, but we do talk.

438
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,069
And he told you where his
secret hiding place was ?

439
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:14,810
No, but you looked
in all the obvious places,

440
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,006
And Kyle likes his privacy.

441
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:19,483
Maybe you do know him
better than i do.

442
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:50,733
No...

443
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:54,443
I didn't want to believe it, i kept...

444
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:56,962
I kept hoping i was wrong
about this.

445
00:25:56,985 --> 00:26:00,505
Thomas, this is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold on to that.

446
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:01,785
okay...

447
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,632
Wait, don't turn around.

448
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:37,848
Alana,

449
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:39,938
take this, hide it in the house.

450
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,265
What are you going to do ?

451
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:43,015
Go back to work.

452
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,679
All right, i want
this area secured.

453
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:54,791
Garrity, i want a warrant to have these
lockers opened and searched, a. S. A. P.

454
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,597
Well...

455
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,168
Look who came out of retirement.

456
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:02,828
Good timing, Baldwin.
Your partner can bring you up to speed.

457
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,470
That is, assuming
you intend to stick around.

458
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:06,961
- I'm here.
- Mm-Hmm.

459
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:11,326
Well, we do know that two days
before the assassination,

460
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,262
Our man arrived at this station
with a bag full of firearms.

461
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:15,870
Well, he could've gone
anywhere from here.

462
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:17,899
Yes, so we're canvassing
all the metro routes,

463
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:21,035
We're talking to the baggage handlers,
ticket agents, bus drivers...

464
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,916
That sounds right.

465
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:23,806
Meantime, we just had
a shoeshine guy

466
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:28,068
I. D. The sketch. He claims he helped
our man make change to buy a locker.

467
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:29,641
Does he recall which locker ?

468
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:31,213
He thinks it's in that
group there.

469
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:34,336
but all the people who use
these lockers in a month...

470
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:37,853
The odds are, like, 1 in, what, 10,000
we'll turn up anything useful.

471
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,662
Yeah, so why are
we even bothering ?

472
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:42,092
You never know.
All we need is one print.

473
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:43,947
Yeah. We can only hope.

474
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:44,957
I guess.

475
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:47,800
You okay ?

476
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,567
Maia had another vision.

477
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,761
Now, she says if
we catch this guy,

478
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:57,527
Someone's going to get hurt.

479
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,026
Did she say who ?

480
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:06,542
Welcome back.

481
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,631
Is Tom here ?

482
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,239
Uh, no, he isn't.

483
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,644
You must be Alana.

484
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:24,981
I'm Linda.

485
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:26,974
I know.

486
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,287
That my interview ?

487
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:38,725
I don't want to see it.
I know i sucked.

488
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:41,238
I wouldn't go
so far as "sucked."

489
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,927
But you could do
with more eye contact,

490
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,445
Better enunciation.

491
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:48,709
But they didn't drag any unnecessary
dirt out of you, and that's something.

492
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:52,619
I was all distracted. Liv was here right
before, and we got into this thing...

493
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,132
Because you told that junkie
not to go out with your brother.

494
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,316
Ex-junkie.

495
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,393
I'm just trying to protect
her, that's all.

496
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,342
I'm sure that was part of it.

497
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,723
What do you think, i'm jealous of Danny ?

498
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:08,893
You do realize that a relationship
with this girl is out of the question.

499
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:09,867
Matthew,

500
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,263
advise me all you want
about the center...

501
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,762
But that's where it stops.

502
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,098
You don't understand, Shawn.

503
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,211
You are the center.

504
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,982
Everything about you,
everything you do.

505
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,448
You cannot afford to have
an inappropriate relationship.

506
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,749
Jordan Collier was all about
inappropriate relationships.

507
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:32,695
I mean, every girl in this place
was fair game to him.

508
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,479
All the more reason
not to repeat his mistakes.

509
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:41,126
So what girl is worthy
of the great Shawn Farrell ?

510
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,922
I will let you know
when you meet her.

511
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,540
On to more important things...

512
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,450
I wish i had time
to wipe that locker clean.

513
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,845
Kyle's prints could be all over it.

514
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,572
We've got to find him,
get him out of town.

515
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:57,934
Out of the country.

516
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:00,928
You didn't get anything else out of Linda ?
Something she wouldn't tell me ?

517
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,924
No, she's as scared as we are.

518
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,307
I felt guilty lying to her.

519
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:07,984
The less people who know
the truth, the better.

520
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:11,953
Still, i know how hopeless she feels.
Her son is missing. She needs answers,

521
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,780
And all she has to go on
is a three-line goodbye note.

522
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,705
Did you tell her about the note ?

523
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:20,912
No.

524
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,695
She brought it up herself.

525
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,262
I never mentioned it to her.

526
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,831
Kyle...

527
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:36,309
Dad.

528
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:49,895
No, Kyle, wait !
Wait !

529
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,434
Goddammit,

530
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:53,141
- Stop it !
- Let go of me !

531
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,707
Enough !

532
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:56,774
Enough, Kyle.

533
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:13,821
Then i have been up on that roof, watching
Collier through the scope, the way the

534
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:15,944
trigger felt
when i pulled it,

535
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:17,788
And how his body

536
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,452
twisted before it hit the ground...
I mean, i remember all of it,

537
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,929
But it just feels like
somebody else's memories.

538
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:24,889
They are.

539
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:28,256
You weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

540
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:31,561
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

541
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,776
I haven't had another blackout since.
You think it's over ?

542
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,359
Let's hope so.

543
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,630
How long do you think
i'll be put away for ?

544
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:47,442
Kyle, i am not going to let them put you
in prison for something you did not do.

545
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,128
- Do you hear me ?
- Yeah.

546
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:54,074
I just only wish
you would have

547
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,526
told me about these blackouts
when they first started.

548
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,791
You tried.
I didn't listen.

549
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:09,342
You know...

550
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,744
It's not a new thing, dad.

551
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,737
I... I know i haven't always
been there for you, Kyle, but i

552
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,236
i thought we had
a pretty good relationship.

553
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,599
We do. It's just,

554
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:32,298
you know, growing up with a dad who works for
the FBI, NTAC... It can be pretty intense, you know ?

555
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,159
You mean i can be
pretty intense.

556
00:34:37,194 --> 00:34:39,191
You can be scary at times.

557
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:42,393
If you don't believe me, ask mom.

558
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,108
I don't have to.
I believe you.

559
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:55,425
I'm sorry, dad.

560
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,290
Me too.

561
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:19,391
Hey, baby.

562
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:22,397
- Kyle.
- Hi.

563
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,334
I packed a few things for you.
Anything else you need, we'll get in brussels.

564
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:28,519
What time is the flight ?

565
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:29,294
Noon.

566
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:32,500
All right, we'd better check in at
the airport. We'll be safer there.

567
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,765
Okay, i emailed my friend,
and they'll meet us when we land.

568
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:37,925
They promised
to take good care of Kyle.

569
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:39,886
Say goodbye to mom for me, okay ?

570
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:40,849
- Sure.
- Yeah

571
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:43,198
I promise to break
the news to her gently.

572
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:47,070
- I'll come and visit you as soon as i can, Kyle.
- That'd be good.

573
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:47,833
Okay.

574
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,334
- I love you.
- I love you.

575
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:58,114
All right.

576
00:35:58,385 --> 00:35:59,735
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.

577
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:02,752
Alana...

578
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:06,518
Keep a close eye on him, okay ?

579
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,418
I will, Thomas.
I will.

580
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:01,569
So far, we've found two ounces of hash,
some bootleg dvds,

581
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:05,350
and three dop kits that belong to people
who shower in the terminal bathrooms.

582
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:11,270
I'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat "X"
marked through it, all covered in usable prints.

583
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:12,291
Yeah.

584
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,463
Is everything okay at home ?

585
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:24,281
Because if you need to take care
of business, now is a good time.

586
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:26,876
I can hang with Forensics
i case something turns up.

587
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,247
Thanks. I'll, uh...

588
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,431
I'll stick around here.

589
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:34,611
Skouris.

590
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,768
When did that happen ?

591
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,433
No. We'll be right there.

592
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:42,969
That was Jarvis.
She just got a call from metro west.

593
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,266
They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago,
claim he's our guy.

594
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,618
Roy Keith Marsden.

595
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,036
25, unemployed,

596
00:38:29,882 --> 00:38:33,134
Made threats against Collier
after his uncle joined the 4400 center.

597
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:34,485
Oh, and get this...

598
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:37,091
He owned a .50-caliber JHLP-6.

599
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:18,678
Alana ?

600
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,879
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

601
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:23,408
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.

602
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:41,358
You know, if you're here to give me
grief about Liv, you can forget it.

603
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:44,258
What happened was
your screw-up, not mine.

604
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:46,008
You know,

605
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:47,780
you could've pulled me aside,

606
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,956
Told me she had this drug problem.
I would've backed off.

607
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:52,447
So

608
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:56,498
if you're expecting me to apologize
and kiss your robe, you're wasting your time.

609
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:58,341
I didn't come here for that.

610
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,259
Look, i just don't want
this to become a big thing.

611
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:07,359
Ok, when we were kids
we used to fight like crazy.

612
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,374
Yeah. All the time.

613
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:15,247
Yeah, and then the next day, we'd blow it off.
Everything would go back to normal.

614
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,159
Yeah.
Simple as that.

615
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,954
Nothing wrong with simple.

616
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:29,338
Are you, uh, planning on standing there,
or are you going to help me out here ?

617
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:30,803
With the car ?

618
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:34,807
I don't wash cars anymore.
I've got people that do that for me.

619
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:35,723
- Oh, yeah ?
- Yeah.

620
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:37,892
Yeah, well, i don't, so...
Grab a sponge.

621
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,243
Oh, see, now...

622
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,117
I should've known
i was going to get wet.

623
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:45,407
Yeah, attaboy.
Get your hands dirty.

624
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:47,114
It's been a while, huh ?

625
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:31,442
Come on.

626
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:40,342
Hey, sweetie.

627
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,197
Hi.

628
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:43,412
Look, i know you've
already had dinner,

629
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:45,941
But what do you say we take
another crack at those brownies ?

630
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:46,845
Okay.

631
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,083
Great.

632
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:49,880
So how was your day ?

633
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:50,969
Pretty good.

634
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:52,202
Good.

635
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:55,009
Aren't you going
to ask me about mine ?

636
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:58,543
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for, and guess what.

637
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,410
Nobody was hurt.

638
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:02,954
So there's nothing to worry about.

639
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,467
It's all over.

640
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:09,799
Not yet.

641
