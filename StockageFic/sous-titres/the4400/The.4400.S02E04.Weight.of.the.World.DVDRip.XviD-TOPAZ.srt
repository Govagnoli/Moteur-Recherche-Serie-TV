1
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:06,005
We're not sure what's just happened.

2
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:09,044
The light is gone,
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,120
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.

4
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,599
I thought I was being re-assigned to field duty.

5
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:15,053
You are, effective immediately.

6
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:16,028
Work's been a little crazy lately...

7
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:17,002
Oh, the job?

8
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:18,259
I've been waiting for that one.

9
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:19,820
It finally feels like old times around here.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,436
April, glad to hear from you. You're my sister.

11
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,293
Surprised?

12
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:24,667
How come I've never met you before?

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,146
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.

14
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,847
I'm Shawn Farrell.
I am one of the 4400.

15
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:29,960
Can I sign you up for a tour?

16
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,639
I was looking for my cousin, Shawn Farrell.

17
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:33,964
Policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.

18
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:35,561
I've been to that place where you're living.

19
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,339
There's some serious Stepford Wives vibes going on there.
You know that, right?

20
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:41,743
These centers, they're a chance to bring people together.

21
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,507
Sounds like someone got inside your head.

22
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,438
I will not allow these shadows from your past
alter your perceptions.

23
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,091
The goal is what matters.

24
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:52,026
Ensure the future.
Save the planet.

25
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,989
If Maia's having visions, you should know about it

26
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,563
and you should know what they are.

27
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,535
Isabelle is six months old.

28
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,553
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

29
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,525
- Talks?
- NTAC? Collier?

30
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:04,109
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.

31
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:05,200
Start packing.

32
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,450
How'd it go today, daddy?

33
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,209
That bad, huh?

34
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:26,248
Nobody wants to buy time shares in Wilmington, Idaho.

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,908
Baja, California maybe.

36
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:31,451
If I were you, I'd go in there
and tell them "either let me have the good listings,

37
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,240
or I quit".

38
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,788
The whole staff wants Baja, honey

39
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:35,997
and I don't have the seniority.

40
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,248
How is that fair?
You've been a salesman longer than any of them.

41
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,691
Salesman, not telemarketer.
It's different.

42
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,319
Hey, hey. Appelbaum.

43
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:45,622
Payday.

44
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,096
Leave him alone!
He's trying to pay you back!

45
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,935
This your beer, Appelbaum?

46
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,528
You don't mind if I quench my thirst, do you?

47
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,665
Honey, stay back.
Stay back.

48
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,270
I just need a couple more weeks.

49
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:04,879
Something will turn around.

50
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:07,800
You know, in my business
you hear every sob story in the book

51
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,773
but I got to tell you, yours is a new one.

52
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,471
"disappeared 15 years ago, came
back in a ball of light, wife died

53
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:16,146
daughter dropped out of school".
You got a bad break,

54
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:19,117
but you borrowed the money,
and now you're going to have to pay me back.

55
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,878
I'll figure something out.

56
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:24,331
Oh, you do it quickly,
because you and I are going to talk again in 48 hours.

57
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,842
I thought you 4400s got special powers.

58
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,249
How come you're such a big nothing?

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,893
Just lucky, I guess.

60
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,709
All right, let's go.

61
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:42,456
Thanks for the beer.

62
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,625
We should be at Eric's place tomorrow.

63
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:58,158
Be nice to see a friendly face,
maybe sleep in for a change.

64
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,508
Sounds good.

65
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,046
You like Eric, right?

66
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:03,360
You guys got along in quarantine.

67
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,239
Richard, I'm late.

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,942
Like, "I might be pregnant" late.

69
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,151
You sure?

70
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,347
No, I'm not sure.
I'm late.

71
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,433
Well, we just have to wait and see.

72
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:21,770
Wait and see?

73
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,339
We could go to the drugstore, maybe...

74
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:28,500
get one of those test things.

75
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,224
And what would you want it to say?

76
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,809
I'd like it to say, "Congratulations.

77
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,899
You have a job, a house, and a future.

78
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:37,808
You're ready for another child".
But I don't think it's going to say that.

79
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,215
No.

80
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,223
Probably not.

81
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:47,972
$3,150... 32, 33...

82
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,392
$3,400.

83
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,882
Well, that should keep
that creep happy for a while.

84
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm sorry about your car.

85
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,618
I'll ride the bus to work.

86
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:58,767
Sorry about the television.

87
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:00,786
I'll read a book.

88
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,943
Appelbaum, the miracle man, huh?

89
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,759
You notice anything different about me?

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,588
My god...

91
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,686
75 pounds in two days.

92
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,305
Now, at first, I thought the termites had gotten me.
You know, I was sick

93
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,402
cancer. Doctors ran all the
tests. Turns out I'm fine. But

94
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:21,351
how could I lose all that weight?
Then

95
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,572
I thought of you.

96
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,658
Me and you, we shared a bottle of beer,
and you're one of those 4400s.

97
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:26,668
What does that prove?

98
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:30,519
Nothing yet. But let's-- let's
find out. I want you to take a sip.

99
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,797
Because if I'm right,
you made me lose all this weight,

100
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:35,554
and then the same thing
should happen to my wife, who...

101
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,515
though I love very much,
I do-

102
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,411
could stand to lose maybe 20 pounds.

103
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:40,714
30.

104
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:42,828
Go ahead.

105
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:44,108
Drink up.

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,702
Applebaum...

107
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,473
these people who took you,
they set you up for life.

108
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:51,598
They snatched up a bum salesman,

109
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,066
and they sent you back...

110
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,533
... "the human diet".

111
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,106
"The human diet".

112
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,088
I like that.

113
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,157
Go ahead.

114
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,168
Chloe! Want you next the door.

115
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:20,917
When is your next CD promo?

116
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,631
Thank you. Thank you.

117
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,574
Reading Jordan's book was an absolute revelation.

118
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,157
I bought copies for all my back up dancers

119
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,588
and we discuss it every night after the show.

120
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,656
She cut her tour short.

121
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,282
Yes, because I felt like I had to be here.

122
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:39,640
Obviously, I'm not one of 4400.

123
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:43,116
But I expect to be treated
just like any other student here.

124
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,407
If I'm lucky enough

125
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,072
to tap into an ability,

126
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,231
I will use it to ensure the world

127
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,139
a brighter future.

128
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,181
Congratulations, Chloe Grenzer, you have achieved...

129
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,532
... "first key".

130
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:05,280
Thank you.

131
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,954
Last year, she was into Compila.

132
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,984
It's amazing, I lost 23 pounds.

133
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,755
I haven't weighed less than 130 since college.

134
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:20,338
Told you Applebaum was a real deal, right?

135
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,843
You have been happy harrassing him anymore.

136
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,461
Honey, what we got from him is way more

137
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:25,940
than he owns me, right?

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,669
Turn around.

139
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,336
Question of the day...

140
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,988
Who is Trent Applebaum and why
is Drandix corporation calling me about him.

141
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,266
Applebaum disappeared in the late 80's.

142
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,074
He's in phone-sells, right?

143
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,176
And now he's selling himself.

144
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:44,323
He claimed that his saliva
is a catalyst for weight loss.

145
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:47,117
Applebaum backed his claim up?

146
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,618
Two good satisfied customers...

147
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:50,663
Married couple,

148
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,271
one drop 75 pounds, the other 23,

149
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:54,539
practically over a night.

150
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,525
My god.

151
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,226
They got a hand of the future on this one.

152
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,314
If they really gave him this ability,
it could be the cure for obesity.

153
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,453
Yeah, it will change the world.

154
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,696
That's about to change Trent Applebaum's world.

155
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,727
He hired a lawyer, an agent,

156
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,395
they were asking 20 million dollars

157
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:11,048
but Trent's in a bidding war with three other company so...

158
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,713
who knows what the final number will end up.

159
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,212
A 4400, selling exclusive rights to his ability, is it legal?

160
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,924
Our lawyer is looking into an injunction,
but at the moment,

161
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,043
no legislation specifically prevents it.

162
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,075
Then our guy stands to be a very rich man.

163
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,012
Maybe we should go see him.

164
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:27,419
Yeah, find out if he's really worth 20 million dollars.

165
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:39,556
Hey hey! Jet pilot!

166
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,888
...

167
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,034
...

168
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,917
- Did I get it right?
- Close enough.

169
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:47,310
So... you sounded a little freaked out on the phone.

170
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,896
Anything I should know about?

171
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:52,752
Better that you don't.

172
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:55,746
Hey!

173
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,235
Look at you two,

174
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,524
love birds from quarantine, building B.

175
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,399
This little cutie must be Isabelle.

176
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,489
Your daddy told me all about you.

177
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,651
I bet he did.

178
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,839
Look, come on in.
I'll show you guys the guest room,

179
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:13,105
or maybe somebody sleep on the couch.

180
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,134
A minus.

181
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,635
Not too shabby from my first college assignment.

182
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,911
It was a good paper, well fall out.

183
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,461
So what's the minus for?

184
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,455
Well, I always like to leave
a bit of room for improvement.

185
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,849
"Last Days of Pompeii".

186
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,681
Yeah, they throw that party every year.

187
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,971
You should go, go out
some steam you've earned it.

188
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:37,352
I hate to go alone, you're up for it?

189
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:40,686
I probably flaunted to have
rememberance of that threat.

190
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,354
Not my scene, but...

191
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:43,720
don't let me stop you.

192
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:47,337
I don't know how it works,
they put something inside me.

193
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,661
One of those enzyme or whatever.

194
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:52,902
So someone drinks from the same bottle
as you do and they lose weight.

195
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:54,370
Maybe we should give him a demonstration.

196
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,815
Cut it out, Elise.

197
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,412
She thinks she needs to lose eight pounds.

198
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,596
- Try ten.
- Sweetie, you're beautiful...

199
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,122
... you don't need to lose anything.

200
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,036
He's right about that, you don't.

201
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,924
A lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen.

202
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,120
Elise had to take a job at a diner.

203
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,705
We were apart for sixteen years,

204
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:13,169
but while I was gone,
they gave me a way to make it up to her.

205
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:18,885
Mr. Applebaum, no one's telling you
not to provide for your daughter,

206
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,244
but a 4400 putting his gift
on the open market is a first.

207
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,590
We wanna make sure nobody gets taking advantage of that.
Not you, not the buyer, other 4400...

208
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,557
You don't have to teach me about selling.

209
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:29,424
I've been a salesman my whole life.

210
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,573
Most of the stuff I paddled?

211
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:32,500
Junk.

212
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,186
But now I've got a product that everybody wants

213
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,439
and only I can provide, I am the damn product.

214
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:41,439
Nobody is putting Trent Appelbaum
back in the bottle.

215
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:45,842
My father fought in Korea, infantry.

216
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,532
I flew in F-36.

217
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,704
Eric told me.

218
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,301
Daddy admired you guys.

219
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:53,131
He said there were only 25 black pilots
in the whole Air Force

220
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,610
who were allowed to fly like everybody else.

221
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,193
There weren't a lot of us, it's true.

222
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:59,305
The first person I met along time
he couldn't mention the Korean War.

223
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,995
That was a big deal in our house,

224
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,853
Veterans Day, I'd be off from school, we always go to pray.

225
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,497
Yeah, my grandfather and my mom said
he'd take me too.

226
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,022
except it was called "Armistice Day" back date.

227
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,419
For world war one,

228
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:13,387
he put on those boot, dress,
go watch with his buddy.

229
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:16,381
Daddy looks so handsome in his uniform.

230
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,919
I bet you did too.

231
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,845
I'd like to meet him sometime.

232
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,899
Yeah, well, too late.

233
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,787
He passed away, two years ago this August.

234
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,138
I'm sorry to hear that.

235
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:27,241
Thank you.

236
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,449
He would really love to have met you too.

237
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:31,137
The guy was 81,

238
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,051
he was born four years after I was.

239
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:35,094
Well, lucky for you, I like older man.

240
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,983
So Richard, we've known
what were you up to in 1951...

241
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:39,354
... how about lately?

242
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:42,723
Well, I've been working as a auto mechanic...

243
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:43,827
Oh, really?

244
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:47,725
So what brings you to this part of the country?
It's kind of remote for vacation.

245
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,957
They came to see me,

246
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:51,787
as 4400s, we gotta stick together.

247
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:55,263
We have a bond that you mere humans
will never understand.

248
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:59,072
Eric, you freak me out
when you talk that 4400 unity crap.

249
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,604
Not much of a talker, are you, Lily?

250
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:11,653
I'm not really used to be in
social situation these days.

251
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,929
You are a lucky man.

252
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,531
With this one here,

253
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,647
it's "iap iap iap",

254
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,666
but I guess you already noticed that, didn't you?

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,957
I have to pee,

256
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,071
for about 75th time today.

257
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,668
I have to change Isabelle.

258
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,639
That thing is beautiful.

259
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,398
Other all are beautiful.

260
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,862
I just like them better in this book
than I do on somebody's shoulder.

261
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,424
You don't get it, Dia.

262
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,901
These drawings are not meant live on the page,

263
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,589
they're meant to live on the skin.

264
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:48,728
That's very deep,

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,065
but you're right, I don't get it.

266
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,946
I do.

267
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,852
Ok, you got to let this brilliant little girl

268
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,021
go with me tomorrow.

269
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,607
It's a tattoo shop.

270
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,086
A body art emporium.

271
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,178
And for five hours tomorrow,

272
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,798
I'm the featured artist.

273
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,724
You must be pretty good.

274
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:10,802
Can we go?

275
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,643
Just for a little while?

276
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,319
One hour.

277
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,370
Shawn, have you seen Chloe's schedule?

278
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,378
Why would I see Chloe's schedule, Devon?

279
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:28,502
She has an interview with media
three o'clock tomorrow?

280
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,202
Oh, hopefully, she will mention the center.

281
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,867
But her nutrition and purification class
is at three o'clock.

282
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:37,191
Yeah, I think I heard Jordan say
she was excused from that.

283
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:39,974
She's been on the macrobiotic diet
for three years.

284
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,535
Or so she says.

285
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:42,404
Look,

286
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:46,171
I'm sure Jordan plans on treating Chloe
like any other student.

287
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,380
Ok?

288
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,683
No, I'm ready to close.
I don't wanna wait,

289
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,196
just tell him it's done
and I'll be in tomorrow.

290
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:12,322
Alright,

291
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,578
thanks, Celine.

292
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,480
How much?

293
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,194
40 million dollars.

294
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,640
Where is the next round? Come on.

295
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:23,708
It's on its way.

296
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,951
But sir, this will be your fourth steak.

297
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:26,947
- We're hungry.
- Ok,

298
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,885
just hate to see make yourself sick.

299
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,752
No one is sick, we're hungry,

300
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,616
and starving, now go go.
Get your hands up, please, go.

301
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,261
I'm starving.

302
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:50,206
Morning-- you're not dressed?

303
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,859
Those guys from Arkham Films
are here to pitch us.

304
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,656
Oh, the recruitment video.

305
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,192
Yeah, well, you can handle that meeting,
can't you?

306
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,108
Well, yeah, sure,
if you're too busy, yeah.

307
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,189
Hey.

308
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,643
Guess Jordan's getting a late start this morning.

309
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,508
My bad.
I'm going to just jump in the shower, okay?

310
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:08,302
Shower sounds good, Chloe.

311
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,273
Close your mouth, Shawn.
You'll draw flies.

312
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,900
One-on-one tutoring with a first key?
That's...

313
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:17,875
... that's new.

314
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,057
First key or not,
Chloe demands-- deserves

315
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,569
a different level of attention.
She's our entree, Shawn,

316
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:24,932
into the entertainment community.

317
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:29,634
Jordan, you have an entire chapter in your book
that rips celebrity culture.

318
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:32,370
It's a cancer that separates people,

319
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,625
that helps define the haves and have-nots.

320
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,361
And 4400 culture is all about unity, yes.
Please, Shawn...

321
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,051
... do not quote me back to myself.

322
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:43,006
The fact is, celebrities have deep pockets
and deeper insecurities,

323
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:45,437
and we can use both to our advantage.

324
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,871
You can be a manipulative prick.

325
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,775
You know that?

326
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:50,585
Yeah.

327
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:51,807
Well.

328
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,942
It helps to use your entire skill set

329
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,527
when you're trying to change the world.

330
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,005
You and Lily should think about putting down
some roots here.

331
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,293
I think all this running is fraying you both
around the edges.

332
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,197
You noticed.

333
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:09,348
Hard not to.

334
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,585
You can do a lot worse than White Bird.

335
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:13,783
It's quiet.

336
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:16,202
Everyone minds their own business.

337
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,251
Eventually you're going to have to stop
criss-crossing the highways.

338
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,839
Might as well do it here,
before you run out of road.

339
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:25,682
Thank you, by the way.

340
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,629
For not asking what we're running from.

341
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,107
I figured if you wanted me to know, you'd tell me.

342
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,317
Look, Richard.

343
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,699
I got all the work I can handle up in Livingston,

344
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,446
keeping up these movie stars' second homes.

345
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,278
I could use a hand.

346
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,292
You offering me a job?

347
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:49,249
They used to call us handymen.
Now we're property managers.

348
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,615
Either way, you'd be working with me,

349
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,884
not for me.

350
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,760
And if you'll just sign right here..

351
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,795
as agreed--

352
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,439
your signing bonus.

353
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,054
When do I start?

354
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,485
You're making breakfast.

355
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,996
As you pour the milk over your cereal,

356
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,273
you notice that there's a photo

357
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:35,490
of a missing child on the side of the carton.

358
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,977
It takes you a moment to realize
that it's a picture of you

359
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,138
at 10 years old.

360
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,595
This one's giving me the chills.

361
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,204
Who's making this stuff up?

362
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:46,777
Moron.

363
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,137
Devon, do not let Jordan hear you say that.

364
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,814
The two of them hooked up last night.

365
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,630
Yeah, and by the looks of it, probably this morning, too.

366
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:58,649
There's a telephone number

367
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,411
on the missing persons report.

368
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,367
It's the number of your childhood home.

369
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:23,689
Stay here?

370
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,542
You mean permanently?

371
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,986
It's a nice town,

372
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:30,687
and Eric says I can start work tomorrow.

373
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,352
Look, Lily.

374
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:37,379
We've got to get you off the road,

375
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:39,023
especially if you're pregnant again.

376
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,350
I'm not.

377
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:42,558
You sure?

378
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,305
Positive.

379
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,683
Please don't try to pretend you're not relieved.

380
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:51,759
Relieved?

381
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,011
Lily, I was trying to wrap my head around it,
that's all.

382
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:00,683
Especially if we're not going
to be running anymore.

383
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,679
I don't know about this place, Richard.

384
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,887
- Isabelle thinks...
- Oh,

385
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,343
let me guess.

386
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,611
We should move on.

387
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:09,992
I was hoping we could go to Salem, Oregon.

388
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:11,788
I have some relatives there.

389
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,536
I think they might be willing to help us out
and keep quiet about it.

390
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,142
Salem?
That's a city.

391
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:20,830
Maybe we could get lost in a crowd for a change.

392
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,403
This place

393
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,491
this life, it feels right to me.

394
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,381
This is Eric's life.

395
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,284
It's not yours.

396
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,205
It's not ours.

397
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,247
No, this is not a negotiating stance.

398
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:47,525
It's my answer-- no.
Goodbye.

399
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,176
So let me guess-- the answer is no?

400
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,701
That was a rep from the Yoyotron corp.

401
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:57,421
They want to sign Maia to a $300,000-a-year holding contract.

402
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:59,235
But Maia doesn't have any ability anymore.

403
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,088
Well, you don't need any
to make any of these deals.

404
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:06,066
They're signing 4400s up on spec.
They want them in their pocket in case something develops down the line.

405
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,593
Well, you did the right thing

406
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,982
by saying no.

407
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,156
Tom.

408
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:11,753
About Maia.

409
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,193
What? She's okay, isn't she?

410
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,685
She's fine.

411
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,585
I've been trying to figure out
the right time to tell you this.

412
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:24,368
I probably should have done it right away, but...

413
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,299
you know, those visions that Maia used to have?

414
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:32,704
It turns out she was only pretending
that they stopped.

415
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:38,551
How long have you known?

416
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:39,593
Not long.

417
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,388
I only found out because I read her diary,

418
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:44,877
but it was an eyeful.

419
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,460
You going to tell Jarvis?

420
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,902
I'd rather not.

421
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,614
Turn my daughter's diary over to the government.

422
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,385
Hey, don't give me that look, Tom.

423
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,047
You kept Shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

424
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,943
Guess we're even now.

425
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,057
See how cool that looks?

426
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,783
Your aunt, she's a real artist.

427
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:14,578
Oh, say it again, Billy boy.

428
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,257
I don't think my sister heard you.

429
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,650
Oh, I heard him.
You're a star.

430
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:19,425
Believe it.

431
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:22,677
As soon as I heard April was appearing here,
I booked my time right away.

432
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,626
So did pretty much all of my buddies.

433
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:26,200
That's impressive.

434
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:28,173
I'm proud of you.

435
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:29,488
Wait a minute.

436
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,118
You didn't actually just say
that you were proud of me?

437
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,208
Cut it out. Of course I am.

438
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,721
I always thought you thought I was a loser.

439
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,842
Did you really think that?

440
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,216
Yeah, I really did.

441
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:41,967
April.

442
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,174
All I said was that I liked the tattoo.

443
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:48,014
You don't always wear your helmet, do you?

444
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,150
You should wear one tonight.

445
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,324
Why's that?

446
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,858
You won't make it over to
Monica's house if you don't.

447
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:58,512
Does that hurt?

448
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,435
How do you know about my girlfriend?

449
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:05,461
I really think you should wear your helmet.

450
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:18,556
- You killed her.
- Dimitri?

451
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:19,718
What happened to you?

452
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:21,262
My wife, she's gone.

453
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,163
Doctors say that she starved to death.
I'm next.

454
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,160
You killed us both.

455
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:43,380
How many times am I supposed to tell you?
I don't know how I got to that store.

456
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,696
and I sure as hell don't
remember breaking any window.

457
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,245
Not remembering is no excuse.

458
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:48,652
And stop telling me somebody spiked your drink.

459
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,113
The police ran tests, Kyle.
There's no GHB in your system.

460
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,216
What else could it be?

461
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,528
You spent three years in a coma.
You have no business drinking anything!

462
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:58,663
Okay. So I screwed up.
I'm sorry. What more do you want?

463
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,753
How about acknowledging that this was serious?

464
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:03,025
Do you know how close they were to
charging you with breaking and entering?

465
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:04,845
Which by the way, is a felony.

466
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:07,562
If I didn't play the NTAC card,
you'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.

467
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:08,355
Can I go to bed?

468
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,617
No. This is serious.

469
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:12,634
You want to make up for last time, Kyle.
I get it. I get it.

470
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,994
But we need to talk about
some ground rules for you.

471
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,721
I'm not a kid.
I don't need ground rules.

472
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,681
I wouldn't know that from tonight.

473
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:21,698
Answer it.

474
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:25,010
What?

475
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,173
You're kidding me.

476
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,431
Yeah. I'll be right in.

477
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,012
We'll finish this later.

478
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:41,301
What happened to laying down the law?

479
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,492
Oh. right. Something more important came up.

480
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,332
Just go upstairs, Kyle.

481
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:50,222
Just go upstairs.

482
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:05,604
Richard?

483
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,541
What are you doing out here?

484
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,926
Oh. I'm just getting some air.

485
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,676
Well, hop in. We'll give you a ride back.

486
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:27,006
I was reading about your airforce unit
on the internet yesterday.

487
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,485
No kidding.

488
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,493
I looked at it a couple times too.

489
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,064
You guys were one of the most
decorated flying squads--

490
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,835
Tara. Will you stop pestering the man
about his past?

491
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,324
It's okay.
I don't mind.

492
00:25:39,228 --> 00:25:41,999
Well, as long as you're feeling talkative,
I've got a question for you.

493
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:46,437
What did a brother have to do back in the 50s
before they'd let you fly a plane, huh?

494
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,682
Polish the officer's boots on the weekends?

495
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:49,668
David.

496
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:51,934
No, no, no. Seriously. I mean,
I'm wondering.

497
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:55,797
Boy must've done some serious bowing and
scraping before they'd hand you them keys, right?

498
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,216
Okay. That is enough.

499
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,893
I'm so sorry, Richard.

500
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:00,896
No problem.

501
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,289
Some people the less they know
the more they talk.

502
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:06,602
Oh. I know some things.

503
00:26:06,954 --> 00:26:08,811
I know a lot more than you realize.

504
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,643
What's that supposed to mean?

505
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:13,179
It means quit fawning over the man
and keep your mouth closed.

506
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:14,647
Why don't you just let me out right here?

507
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,466
Hey.

508
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:17,462
You sit back and relax, huh?

509
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,012
Now this here?

510
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,114
It's called marriage.

511
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,814
That's all.

512
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,082
You know what I'm talking about.

513
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:31,260
Dimitri's dead?

514
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:34,266
Organ failure resulting from
malnutrition just like his wife.

515
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,888
They were supposed to lose 20 or 30 pounds.
Not starve to death.

516
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,544
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?

517
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:46,860
Family?
Friends?

518
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:47,412
No.

519
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:49,040
Did you kiss anyone?
Share a drinking glass?

520
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:50,592
No. There's no one else.

521
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,011
We think we know what happened to the Kazars.

522
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:57,590
There's a protein in your saliva
that hyper-accelerated their metabolism.

523
00:26:57,627 --> 00:27:01,232
It's a cagey one too.
It stimulates the brain to release epinephrine

524
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:04,261
and it breaks down fat cells at the same time.

525
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:07,056
No wonder they burned up calories faster
than their bodies could take them in.

526
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:10,423
Well, they could eat anything and everything
and still starve to death.

527
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,301
That doesn't make any sense.

528
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,697
We're supposed to be helping people, right?

529
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,397
That's why we were sent back.

530
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,160
All I wanted was to make good for my daughter.

531
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:23,228
Now I'm a murderer.

532
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:24,952
You didn't mean to do it, Trent.

533
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:26,537
That supposed to make me feel better?

534
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,016
We're going to have to keep you here.

535
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:31,116
Try and find a way to remove the protein
from your system.

536
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,988
Well, the good news is we caught it early.

537
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,973
A lot more people could have been infected.

538
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,033
Oh, no.

539
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:40,346
I was at Drandix this morning.

540
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:44,385
I spent two hours in their lab
giving tissue samples.

541
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:53,087
Look this isn't my fault.
And I have the documents to prove it.

542
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:54,308
How many people did you test?

543
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:57,378
Look, my bosses, they wanted a clinical trial up
and running by the end of the day.

544
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,527
- They said "Make it your top priority".
- How many?

545
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:01,664
A hundred.

546
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:08,323
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. What's going on?

547
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:09,626
What's going on?

548
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,694
Why would Devon try to kill herself?

549
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:34,536
Obviously she's a very troubled young girl.

550
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:38,196
But she's going to be okay though?

551
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:41,331
Yeah. They were able to pump her stomach out
at the emergency room.

552
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,671
She's at home recovering.

553
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:43,198
Okay.

554
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,900
I think what we need to do right now
is continue our work.

555
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:52,860
Kyle, if the cops say you didn't get "g"ed,
you have to believe them right?

556
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,443
They could have screwed up the test.
I didn't drink that much.

557
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,637
Well maybe your dad's right.
Maybe you shouldn't drink at all.

558
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,545
I hope it was just the booze.

559
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:02,741
Well. What else could it have been?

560
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,259
When I first came out of my coma,

561
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,286
I wasn't quite myself.

562
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,879
I hope it's not happening again.

563
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,509
I don't know exactly what you mean,

564
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:22,029
but if you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.

565
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,942
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to NTAC medical?

566
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,469
I'm not going back into quarantine.

567
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,432
No way.

568
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:41,663
If you're looking for Eric--

569
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,727
Now there's your goddamn apology.

570
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:45,608
What are you talking about?

571
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,064
She was at me all morning.

572
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,335
"Richard this". "Richard that".
"I should go apologize".

573
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:53,412
From here on in,
you stay the hell away from my wife.

574
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,973
You're crazy, right?

575
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,664
I've got nothing going on with your wife.

576
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,977
Now you'd better step away
and take a deep breath or something.

577
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,349
Man, I step where I please.

578
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,514
Now, listen to me.

579
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,345
You're going to go home,

580
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:09,224
and you're going to apologize to Tara.

581
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:11,660
And if you've got any brains at all,

582
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,709
you're going to start treating her better.
Because if you don't,

583
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,290
one day someone is going
to take her away from you.

584
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,273
Now get your ass out of here.

585
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,165
Trent. This isn't helping.

586
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,186
I had to see what I did.

587
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,158
You want to do something?
Get back to the lab.

588
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,978
Help them work on a way to counter this.

589
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:43,443
Just let me call Elise first, huh?

590
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,320
She'll be wondering where I was all night.

591
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:00,825
Help me.

592
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,460
Elise?

593
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:03,610
Daddy?

594
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:06,064
Help me.

595
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:14,478
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,765
I just wanted to lose 10 pounds.

597
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,008
Baby.

598
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:22,943
I told you you were perfect.

599
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,956
I used one of your water glasses.

600
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,471
We're going to get you help.

601
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:31,242
We're going to get everybody help.

602
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:35,500
Tom.

603
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,108
We've got something.

604
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,153
What?
Tell me.

605
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,333
Well. I asked the guys downstairs
if we could approach this like a smallpox vaccine,

606
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:45,837
use trace amounts of the antigen to build
resistance and counter the effects of the disease.

607
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:47,140
These people are starving to death.

608
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,984
Yeah, but it's because of a chemical reaction.

609
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,506
Now they biopsied Trent's liver.
That's where the protein is coming from.

610
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,962
So if we extract this protein,

611
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:57,776
they can make a serum that will
stimulate antibody production in the victims,

612
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,967
but they're going to have to
harvest tissue to do it.

613
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:02,132
How much of his liver would they have to use?

614
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:04,950
Given how much time we have,
they want to take all of it.

615
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:18,340
I've never seen a sunset like that.

616
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,242
The way it takes forever to go down,

617
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,918
it's like it doesn't want to give up the sky.

618
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,256
It's a pretty sky.

619
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,685
Worth holding on to.

620
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:32,659
I'm sorry.

621
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:33,998
What for?

622
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,061
For letting you believe even for a second
that I wouldn't want to have another child with you.

623
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,090
I want to build a future for us Lily,

624
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,861
I just need to get my feet under me first.

625
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,647
Well maybe if we stay here you can.

626
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:52,266
I mean it Richard.

627
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,461
You love it here.

628
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:56,657
I don't want to stand in the way of that.

629
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,467
I'd sure hate to give up that sky.

630
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:03,546
Me too.

631
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:11,079
Are you even sure this will work?

632
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,028
Well. It's Elise's only shot.

633
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:14,520
Her and all the others.

634
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,234
We've got a matching donor lined up.

635
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,958
It's still a big risk,

636
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,825
but say the word and the liver's on its way.

637
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:21,669
Okay then.

638
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,189
You want to close this deal?

639
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:26,656
here's the fine print--

640
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:28,981
You want Elise to go to school.
It's already done.

641
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,891
I talked to Drandix. They've agreed
to open up a college fund in her name.

642
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:38,550
- Sold.
- Great.

643
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:43,153
Your mom put them in a vase for me.

644
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,994
She's a very nice lady.

645
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,789
They're very pretty Shawn,

646
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,644
but you didn't have to.

647
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,897
Well I wanted to.

648
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,273
I hope Jordan's not too upset.

649
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:58,647
No.

650
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:00,230
No.
Hey.

651
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:03,506
He's probably too busy with his pet superstar.

652
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:04,375
Devon.

653
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,459
What are you doing thinking
about Jordan and Chloe right now?

654
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:11,324
Hey.

655
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:12,580
Hey.

656
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,593
You have no idea how I feel about him.

657
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,443
How deep it runs.

658
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:24,714
I worship Jordan

659
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,933
for everything he's giving me.

660
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,068
For allowing me to be so close to him.

661
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:33,766
He took me to a place I never thought possible.

662
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:35,680
Devon.

663
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,952
Are you telling me that you and Jordan... ?

664
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:43,944
Jordan's heart is full of love.

665
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:48,042
He shares that love with me.
It's an honor.

666
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,047
An honor that Chloe doesn't deserve.

667
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,296
She's not a real student of Jordan's.

668
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,449
Billy?

669
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:02,363
God. What happened to you?

670
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:06,332
At the shop the other night. I got clipped
by a car on the way out of the parking lot.

671
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:09,091
But you were wearing your helmet, weren't you?

672
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:11,637
Yeah.
Doctors said it saved my life.

673
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:15,042
How'd you know that was going to happen to me?

674
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:17,649
Children's intuition.

675
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:20,441
I'm glad you're okay.

676
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:21,204
Yeah.

677
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,153
Me too.

678
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,660
It's a shame to lose you so soon.

679
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,011
Sucks huh?

680
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,749
I thought my Atlanta dates were pushed.

681
00:35:31,772 --> 00:35:34,026
Now they're threatening to sue if I don't show.

682
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:35,952
You've made such progress

683
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,973
in such a short period of time.

684
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:38,666
Yeah.

685
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,556
Believe me, that doesn't happen very often.

686
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:41,449
Well.

687
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:43,128
I sure as hell hope not.

688
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:44,875
You know me Jordan--

689
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:46,766
I like feeling special.

690
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:50,931
You are.

691
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,160
This was amazing.

692
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:55,863
I can't wait to get back here.

693
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,434
Goodbye.

694
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,444
Talk about a quick study.

695
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:07,549
Third key status in less than a week huh?

696
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,463
Noblesse oblige Shawn.

697
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,612
She benefits and so do we.

698
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:15,509
It's too bad all of the women that you screw
don't share the same benefits.

699
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,184
That's cheap and childish.
I expect more of you.

700
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:21,350
I know the feeling.

701
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,245
I am so sorry, you two.

702
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,658
- What's wrong?
- It's David.

703
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:31,516
He just looked on the website for the 4400s.

704
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,026
It said that you two were missing.

705
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,332
That you hadn't reported
in the way you were supposed to.

706
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:37,199
I heard him on the phone just now.

707
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,437
He's reporting you guys to the government.

708
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:51,196
Sorry about that idiot David, man.

709
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,986
I would have loved to have you two around.

710
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,348
Thanks for putting us up.

711
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,749
I can't.

712
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:04,432
Take it, man. Call it a down payment on
your next house, wherever that may be.

713
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:09,304
Hope you find a safe place.

714
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:11,126
I thought it was here.

715
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:40,986
Is my dad going to be all right?

716
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:42,865
Well. he's going to be in intensive care for a while.

717
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,767
But the transplant, it went well.

718
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:46,152
Your dad's a hero.

719
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:50,907
I'm going to tell him that when he wakes up.

720
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,800
If you have something to say,
now would be a good time.

721
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:00,939
You know what?

722
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:03,498
You want to hand out keys
like they're junk mail, you be my guest.

723
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,739
That woman will play to 20.000 people every night,

724
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:09,158
wearing our insignia, promoting our image.

725
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,138
Image?

726
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,543
How does nailing your secretary
help our image, Jordan?

727
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:16,210
I'm not perfect.
I never pretended--

728
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,100
I don't need perfection!

729
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:22,609
I just want you to stop giving me reason
to think of you as some kind of hypocrite.

730
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:25,060
When you're running this place, Shawn,

731
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,526
you can behave as nobly as you'd like.

732
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:28,501
Meaning what?

733
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:31,589
Meaning one day all of this will be yours.

734
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:35,079
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.

735
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:36,581
Everything's in place.

736
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,963
But you're not going anywhere?

737
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,196
Nevertheless.

738
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,519
I sleep better,

739
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,135
knowing my life's work is in the hands of the...

740
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,356
the saintly,

741
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,771
the unsullied Shawn Farrell.

742
00:39:00,762 --> 00:39:03,780
So we thought we had a cure
for the world's obesity problems.

743
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,868
Yeah. And instead, we've got two dead bodies,
a hundred other people in recovery,

744
00:39:06,903 --> 00:39:09,451
and one corporation scrambling to cover its ass.

745
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:12,086
It looks like the great 4400 gold rush is over.

746
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:15,186
Making the point of this little exercise what, exactly?

747
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,618
Well, maybe they got it wrong.

748
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:18,649
They thought they had a cure, but they didn't.

749
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:21,526
I mean, they're from the future,
but they're still human beings, right?

750
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,233
Let's not rush to judgment.

751
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:26,673
We know rapid weight loss is
the effect on the human body.

752
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,067
But if the purpose of this protein is
to provoke metabolic chemical change,

753
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:32,143
it could have other applications.

754
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,176
Like...

755
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,372
I don't know-- breaking down toxic waste.

756
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:37,321
It could rid the ocean of pollutants.

757
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:39,481
maybe even restore in the ozone layer.

758
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,250
So in other words,
the possibilities are pretty much endless.

759
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,599
That's all they are right now though,

760
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,499
possibilities. I mean we're years away
from practical use.

761
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:51,937
But with his new liver, Appelbaum won't be able
to produce the chemical anymore.

762
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,111
He doesn't have to.

763
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:55,365
Now that we've got it isolated,
we can reproduce it

764
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,798
and find out what we've really got here.

765
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:59,240
So Trent earned his golden parachute after all.

766
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,511
Maybe his daughter can study chemistry in college.

767
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:14,229
Hey.

768
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:16,659
All right.

769
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:19,806
There won't be any interruptions on my end.

770
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:22,330
Is this a good time to talk?

771
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:23,107
Yeah.

772
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:26,631
Okay.

773
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:27,851
Um.

774
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,477
Here to say thanks,

775
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,484
for getting me off the hook with the cops.

776
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:37,445
Look, Kyle.

777
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:41,636
I know you're going to make mistakes.
I did when I was your age.

778
00:40:42,012 --> 00:40:45,790
The only thing I ask is you
let me help you learn from them.

779
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,693
Makes sense.

780
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,884
So I just need to know,

781
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:57,226
you told me everything that
happened that night, right?

782
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:07,319
Yeah.
