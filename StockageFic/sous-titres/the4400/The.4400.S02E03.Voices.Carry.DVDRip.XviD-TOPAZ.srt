1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,810
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,180
We're not sure what's just happened.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,590
The light is gone, and thousands of
people have just suddenly appeared.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,930
- We're letting them go.
- We're letting them go?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,710
You don't have a legal
right to hold them.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,600
You're pregnant?

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,160
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,970
but I was when I got back.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,980
What's all this?

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,360
What's it look like?

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,070
That baby could be
the key to the future,

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,810
And it has to be
protected, and I can do that.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,570
Go ahead. Run!

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,600
That baby belongs with me.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,520
This is your new house?

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,590
It's yours too.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,010
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.

18
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,770
Diana Skouris,

19
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,240
your adoption of Maia Rutledge is
hereby complete, legal, and binding.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,060
Her visions stopped about
four months ago.

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,310
We're not sure why.

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,760
Mrs. Usher next door
is getting a kitten.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,400
Mommy's bosses will be
punished for betraying us.

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,880
It wasn't me!

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,220
That creature made me pull the trigger!

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,720
Getting dressed from the top down now?

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,310
That the way they do it on the Mariners?

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,590
Mariners?

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,130
Gary's got his eyes on the Sox.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,580
No, you mean the Sox
got their eyes on him.

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,630
How's it feel, all those
scouts in the stands?

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,870
You bend over to tie a
shoelace, they make a note.

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,990
How about a little respect, huh?

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,740
You're in the presence of
the new Jackie Robinson.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,520
First 4400 to make the big leagues.

36
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,700
Don't worry about the scouts, man.

37
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,010
I'll float you some
right down the middle.

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,350
You just get into your rhythm, forget
they're even out there, all right?

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,430
Can't blame him.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,030
Six scouts.

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,330
I'd be afraid I was going to choke.

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,670
I'm not gonna choke.

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,100
Barnes can't serve them
any better than that.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,140
Just... just give me a second.

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,980
He's throwing him a beach ball.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,070
He's scared, man.

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,640
What was wrong with that?

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,100
What a loser.

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,700
Follow through. Follow through.

50
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,610
This time try taking the
bat off your shoulder.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,630
Why don't you try kissing my ass?

52
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,160
What's your problem, Gary?

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,590
Navarro!
Get your head in the game. Focus.

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,150
I want to see some contact.

55
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,010
The majors?

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,620
Kid doesn't look like
he's ready for rookie ball.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,470
Just shut up!

58
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,540
Will all of you just shut the
hell up and let me concentrate?

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,880
Whoa, Gary...

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,630
Take it down a notch.

61
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,760
Yeah, you're a flake, aren't you?

62
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,840
Go ahead. Take a swing at me.

63
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,720
I'll plant you where you stand.

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,230
I am not going to hit you!

65
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,280
Who said anything about hitting, man?

66
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,030
That's it, Navarro.
You're done for the day.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,320
I want to see you in my
office after practice.

68
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,160
There's nothing wrong with me.

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,500
There is nothing wrong with me.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,160
- Keep walking, mister.
- There is nothing wrong with me!

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,790
Keep walking, mister. Now.

72
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,230
Gary, man, take it easy.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,510
Don't touch me!

74
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,380
This kid isn't ready, man.

75
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,610
This was a big waste of time.

76
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,060
Ready for the bigs, my ass.

77
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,520
What was wrong with that?

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,090
You shut up.

79
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,900
Shut up!

80
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,410
You shut up!

81
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,790
Shut up!

82
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,450
There's nothing wrong with me!

83
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,310
Well, it beats that ditch in the woods.

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,180
Not by much.

85
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,440
It's just a day or two.

86
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,450
Let Isabelle get rested up,

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,410
then we'll push on the rest of the way.

88
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,010
We got enough to make it to White Bird?

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
New car...

90
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,960
Trip to the emergency room...

91
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,990
It's going to be close.

92
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,180
All this running and hiding,

93
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,520
sometimes I forget we
haven't done anything wrong.

94
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,790
Three dead men in the
woods might disagree.

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,860
Do you want to shower first, or should I?

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,370
You go ahead.

97
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,090
Give Isabelle her bottle, okay?

98
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,440
That was you, wasn't it?

99
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,920
Who stopped those men in the woods?

100
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,850
Daddy sure would like to know.

101
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,000
But you're not going to tell me, are you?

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,620
What's funny?

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
Marmaduke.

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,790
Can we get a dog?

105
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,050
Oh, smooth, how you slid that in there.

106
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,660
No.

107
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,030
Skouris.

108
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,480
April.

109
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,210
No, no, no, no.

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,140
I'm glad to hear from
you. You're my sister.

111
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,240
It's just... it's been
a while, that's all.

112
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,080
No, we're here, just having breakfast.

113
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,890
Hang on a sec.

114
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,120
- Mrs. Lennox must've forgotten her key.
- I'll get it.

115
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,240
No, no. No, I'll get it.
You just keep eating.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,160
I just have to let Maia's teacher in.

117
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,250
Coming!

118
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,710
One more sec.

119
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,070
Surprised?

120
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,250
April...

121
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,150
How's it going, sibling?

122
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,080
Good.

123
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,920
You look good.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,390
Yeah, you too.

125
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,630
Thanks.

126
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,870
What are you doing here?

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,270
The "Pacific Northwest Body Art Expo".

128
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,800
I have a booth.

129
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,730
Don't tell me you haven't
gotten your tickets yet.

130
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,520
Uh, no.

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,010
Hello.

132
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,640
Oh, my god.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,100
You must be Maia.

134
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,560
April Skouris, black sheep of the family.

135
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,380
Di, you are so lucky.

136
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,960
Look at this fabulous kid you got.

137
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,170
And no labor, no stretch
marks, no diapers...

138
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,400
No crappy husband.

139
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,270
Oh, wait, that was me.

140
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,390
How come I never met you before?

141
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,100
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.

142
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,310
Okay, we'll stick with "busy".

143
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,330
Whatever.

144
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm here now.

145
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,390
So where are you staying
while you're in town?

146
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,350
This couch looks comfortable.

147
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,780
It's not an execution, Shawn.

148
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,290
Last time I was on stage was
my fourth-grade spelling bee.

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,180
These people are interested in us.

150
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,370
They want to hear what we have to say.

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,940
You'll think of something.

152
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,390
Hello.

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,720
My name is Shawn Farrell,

154
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,010
and I am one of the 4400.

155
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,020
Uh, a few months ago,

156
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,220
I never thought anyone would
ever clap when I said that.

157
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,220
But we didn't know
then what we know now...

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,960
The future of mankind is in jeopardy,

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,450
and right here, with your help,

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,340
is where we start to
set things straight.

161
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,150
If you join us here...

162
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,310
- Mr. Collier, Mr. Dravitt's here for you.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,580
... the best version of yourselves.

164
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,530
Ian.

165
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,790
Thanks for fitting me in.

166
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,720
Interesting place you got here.

167
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,990
I'm not going to be
abducted by aliens, am I?

168
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,510
No, Ian. They weren't aliens.

169
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,410
They were from the future...

170
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,350
I know. So you've told me, ad nauseum.

171
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,470
Look, it's all the same sideshow to me.

172
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,040
So, here I am.

173
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,930
Here you are.

174
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,330
What say we get down to business?

175
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,980
Ian Dravitt.

176
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,630
Founder and CEO of
"Executive Projections",

177
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,970
a multinational corporation
based in Zimbabwe.

178
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,520
Your company wants to do
business in a third world country,

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
they'll show you the lay of the land.

180
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,650
It's all perfectly legitimate...

181
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah, on the surface,

182
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,570
but Dravitt's real money comes from
mercenary activity and arms dealing.

183
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,520
Sold grenade launchers to the I.R.A.,

184
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,810
white phosphorus landmines to the
"Shining Path" guerrillas in Peru...

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,740
- So what's he selling to Collier?
- Good question...

186
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,840
But our observation teams can't even
tell you what time Collier takes lunch.

187
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,960
Beyond the lobby, that
place is a mystery.

188
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,150
I mean, we've sent our agents in
disguised as air conditioning guys,

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,490
fiber optics repairmen...

190
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,930
Yeah, we get a bug in, it's
yanked before the day is over.

191
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,640
Probably sweeping the
place every few hours.

192
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,020
As far as Collier's
pow-wows with Dravitt...

193
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,650
All we can do is guess.

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,170
You think he's stockpiling weapons?

195
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,770
Oh, arms, anthrax...

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,340
Nothing would surprise me.

197
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,010
I mean, Collier's all but said he's
at war with the U.S. government.

198
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,710
Could be laying down a defense
perimeter around the center.

199
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,920
That way, if we ever have to
go in there, he'll be ready.

200
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,020
Think Waco.

201
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,020
Jonestown.

202
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,860
Jarvis.

203
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,250
I'll send them down.

204
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,280
Mr. Navarro?

205
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm Agent Skouris. This is Agent...

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Please... please, don't talk.

207
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,280
It's too noisy.

208
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,200
Your voices and your thoughts, they
just all bleed together.

209
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,080
The E.R. report said you
were going on about...

210
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
No voices.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,420
Just concentrate on
what you want to ask me,

212
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,660
and I'll hear you.

213
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,220
A couple of weeks ago.

214
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,360
It was during a game.

215
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,290
I could hear everyone's thoughts.

216
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,180
At first, it was just the pitcher, which
was pretty good, actually...

217
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,260
Because I knew everything he was
going to throw before he threw it.

218
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,340
Went five for five.

219
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,780
Two homers, two singles, and a double.

220
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,790
That is exactly what...

221
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,400
Yeah, it was great when it started,

222
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,140
but I can't control it.

223
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,160
First, it was everyone on the team,

224
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,740
and then everyone in the stands,

225
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,420
and then, I don't know, it was just...

226
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
... just everyone.

227
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,170
It's like this ocean of noise
crashing around in my head.

228
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,290
I want someone to make it go away.

229
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,020
That's what I want.

230
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,050
I was this close...

231
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,040
To making it to the
majors when I got snatched.

232
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,690
This time, I'm gonna make it.

233
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,780
I have to make it.

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,970
What, so Navarro is really
some kind of mind reader?

235
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,700
I believe "telepath" is
the word you're looking for.

236
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,950
Well, call it something else if
the word makes you uncomfortable,

237
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,930
but the guy definitely
knew what we were thinking.

238
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,470
Interesting gift.

239
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,700
I could think of a few
practical applications for it.

240
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,640
Dr. Ostman gave him some Haloperidol.

241
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,850
It calmed him down, quieted
the noise some.

242
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,310
So he can function as long
as he's on antipsychotic meds?

243
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,960
We don't have to fit
him for any straitjacket,

244
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,880
but he's not going to be
hitting any knuckleballs either...

245
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,390
... which is all he wants to do.

246
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,990
Yeah, I'll put NTAC medical on it.

247
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,010
If they can help him, they will.

248
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,320
Great.

249
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,220
Kyle Baldwin.

250
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,060
Social security number?

251
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,150
There it is.

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,260
Baldwin...

253
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,860
Nope.

254
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,250
You're not eligible to register.

255
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,560
Sure I am. I got in last semester.

256
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,790
I just took deferred admission.

257
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,510
Except your tuition hasn't been paid.

258
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,420
What are you talking about?

259
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,650
My dad sent a check.

260
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,880
Nope.

261
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,820
Baldwin.

262
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Glad I caught you.

263
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,660
I've got Navarro's
transfer forms right here.

264
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,820
You sign them, he's on
his way to NTAC medical.

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,800
- Yeah, I will, but not just yet.
- Why not?

266
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,110
Well, we want to know what
Collier and Ian Dravitt are up to.

267
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,620
A 4400 who can read minds just
walked through the front door.

268
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,630
You want to use Navarro as a mole?

269
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,680
Is that even legal?

270
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,530
Mm-hmm.
D.C cleared it.

271
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,910
Well, how about ethical?

272
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,120
Guy's asking us for help.

273
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,960
Hell, he's even begging us.

274
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,030
And we'll help him.

275
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,390
But he's got to help us first.

276
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,160
What if he says no?

277
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,740
Then you'll get him to say yes.

278
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,590
Excuse me.

279
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,690
Can we get one more blanket?

280
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,450
The one we have is kind of thin.

281
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,960
Yeah, well, they're all kind of thin,

282
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,210
but if you want to bring
it down, I'll switch you.

283
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,510
Oh, I think we might need both.

284
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,780
You might think you need them,

285
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,330
but you aren't going to get them.

286
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,260
See, there's only so many
rooms and so many blankets.

287
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,390
And you have your allotment.

288
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,620
My baby is cold.

289
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,110
Can I please have one more
blanket so she doesn't get sick?

290
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,010
I'll give you five dollars.

291
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,990
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.

292
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,540
He wasn't very nice to us, was he?

293
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,870
Here.

294
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,960
Thank you...

295
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,130
What if they catch me?

296
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,450
We'll be monitoring you
every step of the way.

297
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,840
We plant a tiny transmitter/receiver
behind your ear under the skin.

298
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,960
Takes 10 minutes, no scar.

299
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,610
If things go south we'll
be in there like the cavalry.

300
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,450
When I was a kid, my, uh...

301
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,870
... my favorite show was
"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.".

302
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,720
30 years, just gone in a snap.

303
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,510
My little brother is retiring...

304
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,400
... from the Tacoma police
force at the end of the year.

305
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,310
He's 53.

306
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,220
The guys I played ball with?

307
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,340
The ones that made it
to the majors are...

308
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,080
... signing autographs at card shows now.

309
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,570
The game is all I have.

310
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Yeah, I get that.

311
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,350
What, did you play ball?

312
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,280
Senior year in college.

313
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,480
I blew my knee out trying
to slide under a tag.

314
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,830
What position?

315
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,260
Third base.

316
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,060
Another infielder, huh?

317
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,070
You miss it?

318
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,670
All the time.

319
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,100
But what we do here, Gary...

320
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,310
... what we're asking you to do for us...

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,340
... it's not the world series...

322
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,440
... but it's pretty damn important.

323
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,640
I do this for you guys...

324
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,460
You're gonna fix me, right?

325
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,440
You have my word.

326
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay.

327
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,290
Sorry about dinner.

328
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,260
New case.

329
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,480
Well, I'm glad you didn't wait for me.

330
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,310
That's what you're sorry about?

331
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,430
Dinner?

332
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,540
Ask me how my first day of college was...

333
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,700
How was your first day of college?

334
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,840
I didn't have one.

335
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Nobody paid my tuition!

336
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,680
What are you talking about?

337
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,350
Of course I did, that's ridiculous!

338
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,020
I tried calling you a bunch of times...

339
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,290
... you didn't answer your phone.

340
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,350
I was in meetings all day...

341
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,560
I know I wrote that check.

342
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,230
That's great, dad.

343
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,180
I'm sorry, Kyle, I must have forgot...

344
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,710
We've been talking about this for months,

345
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,770
how could you forget?

346
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,290
Here. Bring it in tomorrow.

347
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,630
I'll send a note.

348
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
Or I'll talk to the registrar myself.

349
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,100
Whatever you want.

350
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,990
Here...

351
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,280
Kyle! Don't walk away from me...

352
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,240
Just... look...

353
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,980
... I admit it.

354
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,770
I'm not denying it, I screwed up...

355
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,780
But work's been a little crazy...

356
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,150
Oh, the job?

357
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,020
I've been waiting for that one.

358
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,240
Finally feels like old times around here.

359
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,330
What's this?

360
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,500
Lily?

361
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:00,300
What is it?

362
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,670
Did you spend all the
cash buying this stuff?

363
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,370
Then what? Talk to me.

364
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,600
The cash register at the front desk...

365
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,650
... itas open...

366
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,980
... and we needed food...

367
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,510
... and Isabelle needed diapers...

368
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,970
You stole money?

369
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,150
It's not like I planned it.

370
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,070
I mean, I had to beg for a blanket,

371
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,690
and the drawer was open, so...

372
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,930
He left you standing there
with the cash register open?

373
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,050
No, no, he closed it.

374
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,070
At least I thought
he did I don't know...

375
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,840
It wasn't open, and then...

376
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,270
... and then it was open.

377
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,160
That still doesn't make it right.

378
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,570
That's not how I live my life.

379
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,730
Have you looked around?

380
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,240
'Cause this isn't how
I planned to live my life either.

381
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,180
Look, I know it was wrong.

382
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,230
I don't need you to tell me it was wrong.

383
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,790
Stop shaking your head.

384
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,610
Just eat something, okay?

385
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,470
It's silly for all
this food to go to waste.

386
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,000
Go ahead.

387
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,590
I'm not hungry.

388
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,970
How much fun was that?

389
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,930
I liked it. Thank you.

390
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,210
So where have you two been?

391
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,910
Your note just said "out".

392
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,420
Lots of places... the pier, Pike Street...

393
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,090
... and even the ferry.

394
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,850
What have you done to...

395
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,200
You didn't!

396
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,070
I told you she'd freak!

397
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,740
Relax, they're rub-ons.

398
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,040
As in "fake".

399
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,910
But they're pretty, aren't they?

400
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,760
Oh, yeah, they're very pretty

401
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,790
Now why don't you go get
started on your homework?

402
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm in trouble

403
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,660
Do you at least like the shirt?

404
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,830
And by the way...

405
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,910
You live in Seattle...

406
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,340
... and your kid's never
heard of Kurt Cobain?

407
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,820
What's wrong with you, Di?

408
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,250
Thank goodness you're here to teach her

409
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,820
all about tattoos and
suicidal rock stars.

410
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,930
And by the way...

411
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,420
... who gave you permission
to take her out of school?

412
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,660
I'm her aunt,

413
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,600
I didn't know I needed permission.

414
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,230
Well, if you're going to send her teacher
home for the day. You do.

415
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,560
Sitting at your kitchen
table all day long?

416
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,890
Yeah, that's a big loss.

417
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,020
What are you keeping
this kid locked away for?

418
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,690
If I wanted your opinion on
how I'm raising my daughter...

419
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,460
... I'd ask.

420
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,320
Mommy?

421
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,250
What's wrong, sweetheart?

422
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,130
I think I have to throw up.

423
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,850
What did you give her to eat?

424
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,380
Anything she wanted...

425
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,100
Oh. Good going, aunt April...

426
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,490
Okay, guys, I'm going in.

427
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,940
Collier's going to want to meet you,

428
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,920
You're one of the 4400.

429
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,730
Anything you can learn
about him is great,

430
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,250
but our main target is Ian Dravitt.

431
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,930
See what you can find out about him...

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,350
... and why he's there.

433
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,560
You have a two-week
supply of Haloperidol.

434
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,680
It should keep your mind clear...

435
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,800
... but hopefully you'll be
done in a couple of days.

436
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,020
Excuse me.

437
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,650
Cute. Nice shoes.

438
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,860
Steer him over to the brochures.

439
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,180
Welcome to the center.

440
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,750
My name's Devon.

441
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,120
I'm Gary Navarro.

442
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm kind of interested in
finding out what you guys do here.

443
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,370
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.

444
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,130
Have you read Mr. Collier's book?

445
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,690
I didn't have to, I lived it.

446
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,100
I'm one of the 4400.

447
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,190
Oh.
Well, welcome home.

448
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,700
Gary Navarro.

449
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,040
Jordan Collier.

450
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,010
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

451
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,710
Well, that's a nice firm grip.

452
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,350
I'd expect nothing less of
a promising second baseman.

453
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,690
How did you know I played ball?

454
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,790
Well, it's my business to
know everything about the 4400.

455
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,280
So, uh... has anything shown up yet?

456
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,500
An ability, or...

457
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,570
No, not me.

458
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,150
I, uh, have a hard enough time
hitting a split-finger fastball.

459
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,110
It's kind of disappointing, isn't it?

460
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,190
All those years lost?

461
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,190
No abilities.

462
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,430
Pass him off to Devon.

463
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,480
Get back to Dravitt.

464
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,740
Jordan, we need to talk.

465
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,930
Absolutely, Shawn.

466
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,440
First, I'd like you to
meet a fellow returnee...

467
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,870
Gary Navarro. Shawn Farrell.

468
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,980
- Hi.
- How're you doing?

469
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,720
Shawn here's a little
luckier than you and I.

470
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,760
He came back with quite
a remarkable ability.

471
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah, I'm blessed, all right
see the halo around my head?

472
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,960
I really need to talk to you.

473
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,840
Give us a second...

474
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,510
I've been doing some poking
around on the internet.

475
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,470
I found out some stuff

476
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,100
that you need to know
because, let me tell you,

477
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,080
I really hope that
you don't know already.

478
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,620
If it can be found on a search engine,

479
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,310
believe me, I know it.

480
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,050
You're okay with this Dravitt guy?

481
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,290
Eyes on the prize, remember?

482
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,820
Doing business with our friend
does not make us our friend.

483
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,100
Dravitt's not my friend.

484
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,820
He's a dangerous prick.

485
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,040
I'll meet you outside in 10 minutes.

486
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,550
As soon as I get Gary squared away here.

487
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,620
We'll talk about it.

488
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,090
Here you go.

489
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,260
Hello?

490
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,010
Hello?

491
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,830
Are you all right?

492
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,040
Whoa. Where was I?

493
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,500
Far away, I think.

494
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,070
First day meltdown?

495
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,690
Just lost and late.

496
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,130
And begging my way into classes
I don't even want to take.

497
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,450
Not such a good day, then.

498
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,770
"Introductory survey of
19th-century novellas".

499
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,750
Kill me now!

500
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,940
Maybe it'll enlighten you in
ways you never could have imagined.

501
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,510
Not likely...

502
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,260
It was the only thing open this period.

503
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,570
Well, this is Olin Hall...

504
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,560
Take the stairs inside to your left

505
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,050
Thanks.

506
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,840
Maybe I'll see you around.

507
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,730
You never know.

508
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,850
Hello, everybody.

509
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,970
I'm Wendy Paulson.

510
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,130
Welcome to "Intro to
19th-century novellas".

511
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,920
Is everyone in the right place?

512
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,130
I will speak to you after class.

513
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,230
I can't hear anything.

514
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,770
I'm going to try to get closer.

515
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,830
Gary, what are you doing?

516
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,060
Collier and that kid...

517
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,180
... your nephew...

518
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,170
... I think they're arguing
about that guy Dravitt.

519
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,450
Where are you?

520
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,740
Gary, go inside...

521
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,540
Getting a good eyeful?

522
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
I'm just...

523
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,450
Should we pull him out?

524
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,040
No, no, no...

525
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,590
Not yet. Not yet.

526
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,820
Maybe he can talk his way out of it.

527
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,070
Now what the hell do
you think you're doing?

528
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,130
Let him go.

529
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,320
You should be careful who
you let in your manor, my son.

530
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,930
We detained him as a
professional courtesy.

531
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,580
Jordan, these guys are thugs.

532
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,240
No need for name-calling.

533
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,150
We merely happened upon this gentleman...

534
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,060
... in the process of
spying on the two of you.

535
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,200
I had a couple of
questions for you that's all...

536
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean, I saw you guys were
having an argument or something,

537
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,530
what am I supposed to do, interrupt?

538
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,630
Want to know what we were talking about?

539
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,730
Because it's no big secret.

540
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,270
I'll tell you exactly what
we were talking...

541
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,350
You're going to find I'm
tied up a lot of the time.

542
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
Gary, if you have questions,

543
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,390
any of my staff... will be happy to help.

544
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah, sorry next time I'll know better.

545
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,930
All right.

546
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,450
Go on back inside.

547
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,170
Careful where he wanders.

548
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,240
No one's getting between
me and $30 million.

549
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,090
Richard?

550
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,570
What is it? What's wrong?

551
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,430
The police...

552
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,150
Oh, my god.

553
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,460
I'm so sorry.

554
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,820
I'll tell them I took the money.

555
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,680
You didn't have anything to do with it.

556
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,960
Police, open up!

557
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,320
Give us a minute!

558
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,570
Open up. Now!

559
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,230
They're not after us.

560
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,390
We're okay.

561
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,820
Guys? You there?

562
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,870
Go ahead, Gary.

563
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,850
Yeah, sorry I've been so out of touch.

564
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,270
They had me in these classes all morning.

565
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,990
I haven't even seen Collier all day...

566
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,160
... or that other guy.

567
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,210
Well, that's okay.

568
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
You just go where they tell you.

569
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,610
Yeah, but I thought you
said you wanted to know more

570
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,450
about that money that
Collier's shelling out?

571
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,510
Where are my meds?

572
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,300
Gary, what's wrong?

573
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,440
My meds, they're gone. I don't...

574
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,000
Uh, excuse me?

575
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,320
I, uh, I had a prescription...

576
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,830
... some tranquilizers in my room...

577
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,050
... and now they're gone.

578
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,760
You don't need those.

579
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,860
You've been conditioned
to think you need them.

580
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,330
Taking anything that
suppresses your natural openness

581
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,350
is counterintuitive to our program.

582
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,200
Maybe you should sit through

583
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,480
the nutrition and
purification lecture again.

584
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,850
Did you hear that, Baldwin?

585
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,430
They took the Haloperidol!

586
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,370
Yes, Gary, I heard it.

587
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,920
You want to abort? You
want to walk out of there?

588
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,940
- Everything is just
- Just...

589
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,160
... getting louder in my head already.

590
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,560
It's already getting worse.

591
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,370
Voices are starting to
bleed through the walls.

592
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,990
Just calm down, Gary.

593
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,160
We'll come and get you if we need to.

594
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,370
It's your call.

595
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,730
Gary, talk to me.

596
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,200
Okay. Um...

597
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,690
Y- y-you guys are
going to hold up...

598
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,200
... your end of this deal, right?

599
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,800
Yes. Of course.

600
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,460
Okay, okay.

601
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,090
I'll, uh, I'll hold up my end,

602
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,080
and I'll hang in as long as I can.

603
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,860
Good. We'll hang in with you.

604
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,710
Now, listen, Gary,

605
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,200
someone's going to be on
this channel 24/7, remember?

606
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah, right.

607
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,230
Right.

608
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,090
I read "The Secret Sharer" last night.

609
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,210
Just like your syllabus
said. That's a good start.

610
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,980
Well, not just the first 20 pages.

611
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,090
I got really into it,
I read the whole thing.

612
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,300
19th-century novellas not quite
the hell on earth you expected?

613
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,640
It definitely wasn't boring.

614
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,060
I've got a lot of questions, though.

615
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,030
Okay, well, I have office
hours wednesdays, one to four.

616
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,810
Okay, yeah, I'll try to stop by.

617
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,930
Or we could run by the
coop and grab some coffee?

618
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,110
Like, right now?

619
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,240
I like talking about Joseph Conrad.

620
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,660
It's why I picked this for a living.

621
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,680
Where did you learn to do all this?

622
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,210
Mom never taught us to cook.

623
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,520
I don't know I just learned how.

624
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,670
Had to be better than you at something.

625
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,470
Aunt April, do you have any kids?

626
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,650
Nope.

627
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,960
No kids.

628
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,830
Are you married?

629
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,780
I used to be.

630
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,010
Ask your mom what she
thought of my ex-husband.

631
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,010
Don't start.

632
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,810
You didn't like him?

633
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,970
Neither did April, apparently.

634
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,030
She only stayed with Trevor
for what, seven months?

635
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,260
You were hostile from day one.

636
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,030
You never gave him a chance.

637
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,970
I didn't really think he
deserved much of a chance.

638
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,350
He was... kind of a moron.

639
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,600
He was 22.

640
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,820
Show me one guy who isn't a moron at 22.

641
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,840
He knew you hated him,

642
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,430
and that didn't make it any easier

643
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,660
for us to stay together.

644
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,040
Come on you can't keep
blaming that on me.

645
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,650
I mean, just grow up.

646
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,400
Okay, this was a mistake.

647
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,950
I thought it was a
good idea to come here,

648
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,580
but obviously I was wrong.

649
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,370
I'll go pack.

650
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,920
There's a little hotel up the street.

651
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,810
No!

652
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,480
It's okay, honey. We'll still see...

653
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,890
But the power's going
to go out there tonight,

654
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,420
and you won't have any lights.

655
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,440
What is she talking about?

656
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,350
Can I please be excused?

657
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,650
Mr. Navarro, is something wrong?

658
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,080
This is no good.
I need my Haloperidol.

659
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,760
Where's Collier?

660
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,190
Mr. Collier's in a meeting.

661
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,400
Mr. Navarro?

662
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,500
Mr. Navarro...

663
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,490
Gary, what's wrong?

664
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,440
I just got to talk to Collier.

665
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,420
That's not a good idea, Gary.

666
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,240
Mr. Navarro...

667
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,980
He's in a meeting!

668
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,600
Make it stop.

669
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,320
Please, make it stop!

670
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,020
Make it stop...

671
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,730
I need my medication.

672
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,830
Whatever's eating you, old son,
we'll make it stop.

673
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,820
Count on that.

674
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,660
A 4400 who can read minds?

675
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,600
So you do have an ability.

676
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,270
You shouldn't have lied to me, Gary.

677
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,390
You mean to tell me

678
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,690
That this guy knows what I'm thinking?

679
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,730
Because I do not like
anyone inside my head but me.

680
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,340
Jordan, this guy's one of us.

681
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,230
We can't just stand here
and let him get killed.

682
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,610
Nobody's killing anyone.

683
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,030
First we determine
what our man here knows...

684
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,960
... and then we discuss his fate.

685
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,590
Because there are things
I know that could get you killed!

686
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,650
That could get all of you killed.

687
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,990
Call Jarvis. Tell her we're going in.

688
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,290
Look, Ian...

689
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,620
Shut up!

690
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,800
Shut up now!

691
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,150
Hi. I'm Evan.
Welcome to the 4400 center.

692
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,170
Second level's not open to visitors.

693
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,820
We're not visitors.

694
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,300
Hey, look, buddy, I've got a badge too,

695
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,910
and this is private property.

696
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,500
What the hell's he doing to him?

697
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,810
Let him go,

698
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,640
or god help me,

699
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,360
I'll splatter your brains

700
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,420
all over your highly polished floor.

701
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,290
Now, that is enough.

702
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,820
Drop that weapon! Now!

703
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,330
How the hell did you get in here?

704
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,910
You don't sound so happy to see us.

705
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
Well, now. What in the hell is this?

706
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,340
NTAC agents.

707
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,140
I don't appreciate the government
interfering in my business.

708
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,900
You should be more careful
who you do business with.

709
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,910
They're not buying weapons.

710
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,290
They're planning a coup
overseas, some tiny country.

711
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,460
You sent a spy in here, uncle Tommy?

712
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,120
Good job, you almost got
us all killed.

713
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,570
You too, Mr. Dravitt.

714
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,870
Well, it'll be interesting to see

715
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
If your friend's impressions
will stand up in court.

716
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,400
I guess I'm the one
should be more careful

717
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,480
Who I do business with.

718
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,430
Shawn, you can come with us if you want.

719
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,910
Great.

720
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,410
I'll tell your mother you said hello.

721
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,960
Gary, you should have come to me first.

722
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,590
I'd have treated you
better than they ever will.

723
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,000
We're at war here.

724
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,280
Don't pick the losing side.

725
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,770
Look at the cute little baby.

726
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,200
I think somebody wants
to try your toy, Walt.

727
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,130
I think you're right.

728
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,900
Hi.

729
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,810
Put her back in the car?

730
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,930
Why?

731
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,900
Now, please.

732
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,460
What's your problem?

733
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,990
That little boy was
being sweet with her.

734
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,840
I just didn't want anybody getting hurt.

735
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,650
Hurt? Who's going to get hurt?

736
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,760
What if she doesn't want
to give the toy back?

737
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,700
What's going to happen then?

738
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,510
Don't look at me

739
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,100
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

740
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,520
Those three men in the woods...

741
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,120
... they wanted us dead.

742
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,690
You saw what happened to them.
That was Isabelle.

743
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,770
We both know it, and there's no use in
pretending otherwise.

744
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,890
Whatever Isabelle does, she
does it out of love for us.

745
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,260
She's our daughter, Richard.

746
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,260
I know she is.

747
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,750
I love her right back, but
she's something else too,

748
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,350
and I wish to god I knew what that was.

749
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,610
What is it?

750
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,350
What's wrong?

751
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,780
I'm fine.

752
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,990
So, what?

753
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,030
So Collier planned to spend $30 million

754
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,420
funding mercenary activity in Sao Tome?

755
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,090
They've had three coups since
their independence in '75.

756
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,150
My guess?

757
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,350
Collier was trying to buy number four.

758
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,908
Did Gary happen to hear why Collier's

759
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:54,160
so interested in an island
off the west coast of Africa?

760
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,310
Without his medication,

761
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,370
we're lucky to have got
that much out of him.

762
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,120
Yeah, but we do know

763
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,010
that Collier thinks he's headed
towards a conflict with someone...

764
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,390
... NTAC, the entire government, I don't know.

765
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,750
He installs a friendly
government in Sao Tome,

766
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,510
it could have been a place
to go when things heat up.

767
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,980
What, like a homeland for the 4400?

768
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,030
Too bad you can't prosecute a
man for delusions of grandeur.

769
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,360
They're not delusions

770
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,320
if you can make them come true.

771
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,030
We're always one step behind Collier

772
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,320
because we keep seeing him
as some kind of cult nut.

773
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,530
What we should be asking ourselves is,

774
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,010
before Collier was abducted,

775
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,360
did he ever set his mind to something and...

776
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,580
... not get it done?

777
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,040
They didn't make him any
dumber in that ball of light.

778
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,990
Well, anyway, we wanted to know
what Collier was thinking.

779
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,830
Gary found out for us.

780
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,910
Time to turn him over
to NTAC medical, right?

781
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,450
Soon.

782
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,200
"Soon"?

783
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,460
The NSA is CC'd

784
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,980
any time we register a new 4400 ability.

785
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,270
They have been leaning on DC

786
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,030
to borrow Gary for an
op they've got planned.

787
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,450
No... no more
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

788
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,540
He'll sit in on a few conferences.

789
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,740
You know how it is with diplomats.

790
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,270
They don't always say what they think.

791
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,160
That wasn't the
agreement I made with him.

792
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,420
But terms have changed.

793
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,370
Gary's too valuable.

794
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,460
I gave him my word.

795
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,010
You're turning me into a liar.

796
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,650
You've been in the game almost 20 years.

797
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,670
My guess is, you've committed all
the seven deadly sins,

798
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,070
just like the rest of us.

799
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,540
I should have let him stay with Collier.

800
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,060
He might have used him, but
he would've helped him too.

801
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,350
Don't you ever use me again.

802
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,880
All I wanted was to play ball.

803
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,380
You guys promised to help,

804
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,080
but you can't do that, can you?

805
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,580
We're worried about the 4400.

806
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,700
It seems more and more like
they should be worried about us.

807
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,570
You know that bar, Mel's?

808
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,510
Corner of Lancaster and Third?

809
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,580
You feel like joining me?

810
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,930
We don't go to bars.

811
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,960
Well, I'm going tonight, with
you or without you.
