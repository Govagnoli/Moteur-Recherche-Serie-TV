1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,040
previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,570
a comet cannot change course.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,220
this one has.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,990
then it's not a comet.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,830
we're not sure what's just happened.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,800
there appears to be something out there.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,430
the light is gone,

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,170
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.

9
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,830
diana skouris. tom baldwin.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,130
you two will be one of the teams

11
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,870
that's responsible for investigating

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,230
what happened to the returnees?

13
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,550
-we're letting them go. -we're letting them go?

14
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,120
we don't have a legal right to hold them.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,300
why disappear a little girl from the 1940s,

16
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,850
hold her for 60 years,

17
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,260
and then send her back with the ability

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,050
to predict the future?

19
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,920
can i go home?

20
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,100
home? with you.

21
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,770
i don't like being here alone.

22
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,890
shawn farrell...

23
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,760
uncle tommy. hi.

24
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,730
he's all yours.

25
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,000
hey, what about kyle?

26
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,360
kyle's in a coma, shawn.

27
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,680
what the hell did you do to kyle?

28
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,990
i don't know what happened.

29
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,050
i put my hands on him.   that's it.

30
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,610
he woke up.

31
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200
you're talking about   some kind of ripple effect.

32
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,170
diana skouris    to the head of the class.

33
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,590
the incidents themselves are just catalysts for change.

34
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,660
i swear to god.

35
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,150
i'll ask you one more time...

36
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,280
where's my son?

37
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,360
-kyle! kyle! -no! tom, don’t!

38
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,320
you're not my son.

39
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,540
who are you? what are you?

40
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
i'm human.  i come from a different time.

41
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,070
your future.

42
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,920
in my time, humanity is dying out.

43
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,750
only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening.

44
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,850
that's why they've been altered

45
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,630
and seeded back into the timeline.

46
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,050
you mean it's all going to end?

47
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,090
you have to help them.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,500
help them? how?

49
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,250
dad?

50
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,570
kyle...

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,950
i intend to provide a safe haven

52
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,610
for any 4400 in this country who needs one.

53
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,060
you goddamn freak!

54
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,410
danny, stop it!  stop blaming me  for nikki!

55
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,310
i guess what i'm asking is if i could stay here for awhile.

56
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,660
tell me a little more about this...ability of yours.

57
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,150
i wasn't pregnant  when i was abducted,

58
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,420
but i was when i got back.

59
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,000
that baby could be the key to the future,

60
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,540
and it has to be protected,and i can do that.

61
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,980
go ahead! run!

62
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,170
i will find you.

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,870
that baby belongs with me.

64
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,190
isabelle...

65
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,080
isabelle...

66
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,170
what is it,baby?

67
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,680
bad dream?

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,380
same one.

69
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,830
she's fine,richard.

70
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,400
we're all fine.

71
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,070
come back to bed.

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,010
it's probably just a raccoon--

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,680
who was it?

74
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,080
they took off  before i could ask.

75
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,450
they left something behind.

76
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,780
someone tracked us down.

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,830
who?

78
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,290
ntac?

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,370
collier?

80
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,260
this look like their calling card to you?

81
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,170
i don't know who it is,

82
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,520
but someone knows we're 4400s.

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,900
start packing.

84
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,700
i'll drive into town    tomorrow morning

85
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,660
to pick up my last paycheck,

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,870
and then we're out of here.

87
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,980
can't we just go now?

88
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,190
we're gonna need that money,lily.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,430
mr. and mrs. sumlin.

90
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,460
peter.

91
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,290
if you'll follow me.

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,690
forgive our appearance.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,260
as you know,

94
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,630
the center doesn't officially  open until tomorrow.

95
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,300
peter doesn't have time to wait.

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,470
that's where you're wrong,mrs. sumlin.

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,700
peter has   all the time in the world.

98
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,360
hi,peter.

99
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,150
my name is jordan collier.

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,500
just this way.

101
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,650
our medical lab isn't quite ready,

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,930
so we thought peter would be more comfortable up here.

103
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,110
hello,peter.

104
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,640
i'm shawn.

105
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,250
what do you say we get started?

106
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,420
yeah?

107
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,390
okay,buddy.

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,950
i want you to take my hands.

109
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,680
try and relax.

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,820
okay?

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,520
you're okay.

112
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,160
you're doing good.  you're doing so good.

113
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,880
it's okay.

114
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,000
oh,my god.

115
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,390
is he okay?  he's fine.

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,150
just watch.

117
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,390
it's okay.

118
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,010
you're okay. you're okay.

119
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,250
peter?

120
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,930
how do you feel,honey?

121
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,100
son?

122
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,690
thank you for your   generous donation.

123
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,790
we tried everything.

124
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,920
radiation,bone marrow transplants...

125
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,430
is he really cured?

126
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,820
take him back   to his doctor.

127
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,340
run some tests.

128
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,370
peter's leukemia is gone.

129
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,890
this is a miracle.

130
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,930
for now,it has to remain   a private miracle.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,480
may i remind you that the confidentiality agreement

132
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,290
you've signed is strictly binding.

133
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,300
but people should know  about that young man.

134
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,750
and they will.

135
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,350
in time,they'll know everything.

136
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,770
very nice.

137
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,030
floating the five.   floating the five.

138
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,450
you nervous?

139
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,750
aren't you?

140
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,640
no,not at all.

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,320
well,maybe a little bit.

142
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,710
okay. a lot.

143
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,840
now,you really want to do this,right?

144
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,220
right.

145
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,510
let's go.    okay.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,340
says here    she registered an ability

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,620
under the dinstman-lenhoff bill.

148
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,520
some kind    of precognitive insight?

149
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,580
yes,her visions stopped about four months ago.

150
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,310
we're not sure why.

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
oh,too bad.

152
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,980
i was going to ask if teledex will hit its quarterly projection.

153
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,720
well,we'd like to get started,if that's all right.

154
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,770
certainly.

155
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,700
if you'll just sign  where indicated.

156
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,200
diana skouris,

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,350
your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete,

158
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,060
legal,and binding.

159
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,330
so witnessed by me,henry biederman,

160
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,780
10th circuit family court of seattle.

161
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,000
you know,some of us have to look far and wide

162
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,480
to find the people  we'll call "family."

163
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,690
you two had to look   clear across time.

164
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,860
diana,let me introduce you to your daughter maia.

165
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,170
maia,say hello  to mommy.

166
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,370
i'm not doing it.

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
i mean it this time. no way.

168
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,070
it's just    a cat scan,kyle.

169
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,380
you've had them before.

170
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,740
this one's gonna tell them the same thing

171
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,600
the last 150 told them--nothing.

172
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,670
there's nobody in here but me.

173
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,690
i know that,

174
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,560
and sooner or later,

175
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,810
they're going to stop looking.

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,660
when? when?

177
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,220
i wish i knew,

178
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,400
but with ntac,the government,

179
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,590
they've got bigger issues  than you or me,okay?

180
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,820
just--

181
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,690
kyle,they're still  trying to make sense

182
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,250
about what happened that night   at highland beach.

183
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,740
that's all.

184
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,050
they're afraid   if they let me out

185
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,080
i'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret?

186
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,930
well,they can relax,

187
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,270
because i just want to get out of you and be normal again,

188
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,820
and normal people don't go around

189
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,460
sounding off   about future humans

190
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,150
and the end of the world.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,920
besides,i don't even remember what happened.

192
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,430
i know.

193
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,610
you listening?

194
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,190
<i>i don't remember!</i>

195
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,440
<i>just calm down.</i>  <i>just calm down.</i>

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,360
<i>dad,get me</i>  <i>out of here.</i>

197
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,680
talk to someone. anyone.

198
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,510
please,'cause--

199
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,290
shh. okay,okay.

200
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,070
okay. okay.

201
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,380
tom.

202
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,790
been awhile,huh?

203
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
yeah,you know how it is.

204
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
us desk jockeys don't have much cause

205
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,730
to mingle with you hot-shot field agents.

206
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,410
someone feeling a little sorry for himself today?

207
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,970
"the path to oblivion  starts here."

208
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,840
the 4400 were sent back to save humanity,

209
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,180
and i'm supposed to help them.

210
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,340
i was there on the beach,remember?

211
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,530
they gave me a mission,

212
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,940
and what's my biggest accomplishment of the week?

213
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,030
i convinced my son to take another cat scan.

214
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,910
somehow,i don't think that's what they had in mind.

215
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,170
diana,you ready to roll?

216
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,550
in a minute.

217
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,400
it's just we have to check in on three more returnees.

218
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,870
i want to make sure we get our reports in by 5:00.

219
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,500
okay,why don't you keep the car warmed up?

220
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,600
and i'll be right there.

221
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,240
you bet.

222
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,610
vic hubbard's the best lead investigator you could find?

223
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,280
oh,no,he's the fourth one this year.

224
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,210
two more,i break a record.

225
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,750
we've got to get you out from behind that desk.

226
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,740
i'm lucky to have a job here.

227
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,650
i put a gun to another agent's head,remember?

228
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,310
yeah,well,

229
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,060
i never said it was going to be easy.

230
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,050
it's obvious what really happened.

231
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,940
are you going to start in with your negative energy again?

232
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,560
white holes.    see,they're the answer.

233
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,430
that's how they took them,

234
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,650
and that's how they brought them back.

235
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,150
yeah,but white holes--  the second law of--

236
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,860
yeah,because i'm right.

237
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,860
switch it up.    switch it up.

238
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,580
guys! what's it like to not be right?

239
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,710
am i interrupting?

240
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,830
brady's back on his "white hole" kick again.

241
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,280
well,one day you'll explain to me the difference

242
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,080
between the white ones and the black ones,right?

243
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,060
well,how about tonight?

244
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,250
how about you just give me  that thing that we discussed?

245
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,090
can't.

246
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
why not?

247
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,510
i already sent it upstairs.

248
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,570
i wonder    if anyone's read it yet.

249
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,120
when they do,i'm sure you'll hear about it.

250
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,330
i owe you one,handsome.

251
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,270
h.p. lovecraft's

252
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,640
<i>the mountains of madness.</i>

253
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,040
are you trying  to tell me something?

254
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,860
which orderly did you steal it from?

255
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,250
matt?

256
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,210
arlo?

257
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,670
you're so sweet.

258
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,610
you're the only  person here

259
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,120
who doesn't    want me dead.

260
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
i wish i could take you with me when i go,

261
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,330
but i can't.

262
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,710
they only want me.

263
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
but i'll be    leaving soon.

264
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,570
very soon.

265
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,040
joanne? paul?

266
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,920
what are you doing?

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,260
sex maniac.

268
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,530
don't go flashing    those bedroom eyes at me.

269
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,710
joanne,i'm serious.

270
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,960
put that stuff down before you hurt yourself.

271
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,720
we're building something.

272
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,170
i can see that.

273
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,370
can you really?

274
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,630
it's gonna be gigantic.

275
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,550
humongous.

276
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,340
rival the pyramids.

277
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,980
but some things are better left to the imagination,joanne.

278
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,010
besides,

279
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,070
you two   have physical therapy now.

280
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,970
let's go.

281
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,020
building something...

282
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,590
building nothing.

283
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,940
help me get rid of this junk.

284
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,160
i'm sorry. too hard?

285
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,250
oh,no. hey,go ahead.

286
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,490
give it your best shot.

287
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,220
whatever you do,

288
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,390
you must be pretty good at it.

289
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,150
uh,yeah,i work with my hands.

290
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,060
same as you.

291
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,810
my apartment doesn't look   anything like this.

292
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,930
well,it helps to have friends in high places.

293
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,140
i'm always open to making new friends.

294
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,710
come in.

295
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,940
speak of the devil.

296
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,260
give us a moment.

297
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,480
has anyone ever told you your timing sucks?

298
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,580
if they did,i probably fired them.

299
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,940
for you.

300
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,920
it's in bookstores   tomorrow.

301
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,600
jordan,this is gonna sell,like,a million copies.

302
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,590
people are gonna freak out  when they read this.

303
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,640
big ideas make a loud noise when they land,shawn.

304
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,280
you wanted to see me,nina?

305
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,010
are you sleeping    with tom baldwin?

306
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,450
should i come back in?

307
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,490
maybe we could start over--

308
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,110
answer the question.

309
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,690
never even held hands.

310
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,930
do you owe him money?

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,030
okay,what game  are we playing here?

312
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,950
because if i knew the rules--

313
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,710
i am playing   the theory room paper game.

314
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,610
i don't know that one.

315
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,590
well,let me give you a hint.

316
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,760
"the necessity for the immediate reassignment

317
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,550
of thomas baldwin to active field duty."

318
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,670
catchy title.

319
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,770
did you come up with it    yourself,

320
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,560
or did the big brains    in the basement pitch in?

321
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,160
let's just say that i agree with the sentiment.

322
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,720
tom is the best agent i've ever worked with,

323
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,420
maybe the best  you've got in this division.

324
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,360
in the three months that baldwin was investigating the 4400,

325
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,310
this department learned more,far more,

326
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,400
than it has in the entire year   he's been shuffling paper.

327
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,950
he threatened  another agent's life.

328
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,310
he was trying   to protect his son,

329
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,940
who these future people,whoever they are,

330
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,730
chose as their spokesman.

331
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,680
that's not to mention that his nephew shawn is one of the 4400.

332
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,060
all of which sound like major conflicts of interest to me.

333
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,510
that's not  what dennis ryland believed.

334
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,580
dennis ryland  is no longer in charge here.

335
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,300
maybe you should call washington    and talk to him.

336
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,680
i don't have to call washington.

337
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,700
they've got me on speed dial.

338
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,020
congressmen,senators,

339
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,050
committee chairs,subcommittee chairs,

340
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,370
all of them looking   to this department,to me,

341
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,020
for answers.

342
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,600
which is why you can't keep an agent 

343
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,290
like tom baldwin on the shelf.

344
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,930
he's a major player  in this case.

345
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,550
he's maybe the major player.

346
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,390
see,funny,that's exactly what it says in this paper.

347
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,840
maybe marco had me check it   for typos.

348
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,860
uh,the next time that you want  to send me a message,

349
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,220
put your own name on it.

350
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,690
mr. walcott!

351
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,790
get down from there!

352
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,360
arlo!

353
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,880
mr. walcott,get down from there!

354
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,030
arlo!

355
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,760
you heard the man!

356
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,590
mr. walcott,

357
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,460
get down from there this instant!

358
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,100
i'm calling security if you don't come down right now.

359
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,310
arlo!

360
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,170
this is your last chance.

361
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,740
what the hell are you    doing up there?

362
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,570
i got it.

363
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,940
arlo!

364
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,510
arlo,this is your last warning.

365
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,120
arlo,please!

366
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,720
be careful!

367
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
i'm coming down.

368
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,910
arlo,be careful!

369
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,520
watch what    you're doing.

370
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,230
i got it.

371
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,170
i got it.

372
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,490
oh,oh--oh,my god.

373
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,180
oh,my god!

374
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,310
no!

375
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,480
lily,i'm home.

376
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,430
lily,relax.

377
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,960
we don't   have to leave.

378
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,960
some nut papered the entire town   with these things.

379
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,020
he wasn't singling us out.

380
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,690
well,i still think  we should go.

381
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,050
i was scared  last night too,

382
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,660
but did you read this?

383
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,890
it's a rant,not a witch hunt.

384
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,720
maybe,but richard,

385
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,260
we still don't feel safe here    anymore.

386
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,010
you mean   isabelle doesn't feel safe.

387
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,330
richard,we've gone over this a dozen times.

388
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,760
i don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

389
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,460
"talks?"

390
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,740
communicates.

391
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,700
whatever.

392
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,910
did she happen to mention    where we should go?

393
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
does she have a place   picked out,

394
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,380
or will she know it    when she sees it?

395
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,460
we can find the town.

396
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,650
we already did.  right here.

397
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,020
isabelle is six months old.

398
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,030
i know she's   a special kid,

399
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,510
but we're still  her parents.

400
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,740
we make decisions for her.

401
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,400
she doesn't make them for us.

402
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,050
i know.

403
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,570
it's time we get out of here.

404
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,880
you're right.

405
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,330
you're absolutely right.

406
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,420
we're staying put.

407
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,810
maia?

408
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,250
party time.

409
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,390
macaroni and cheese,mashed potatoes,

410
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,940
and white bread.

411
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,670
everything i like.

412
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,070
the only things you'll eat.

413
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
you've got to promise me

414
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,350
that you'll    outgrow this phase soon.

415
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,900
mommy,how do you make this taste so good?

416
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,520
well,it's a hidden talent,i guess.

417
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,530
you just called me "mommy."

418
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,760
you're my mom now,right?

419
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,980
now and forever.

420
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,210
i like that.

421
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,720
me too.

422
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,510
so do you think  i'll ever go back to school?

423
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,520
weren't you just telling me you got,

424
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,750
like,a 97   on your math test?

425
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,340
not home-school.

426
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,980
real school,

427
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,130
with a playground,and recess.

428
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,430
well,sure you will...

429
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,980
you know,when you get  a bit older.

430
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,420
how much older?

431
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,250
i'm not seeing things that are going to happen anymore,

432
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,950
so it should be okay for me to be around other kids.

433
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,820
i think i'd be happy at school.

434
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,560
aren't you happy now?

435
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,780
i'm glad you're my mom for real,

436
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,510
but i could still use a...

437
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,180
like,friend or two.

438
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,620
more mac and cheese,please.

439
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,990
just a little.

440
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,830
sign this.

441
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,350
what is it?

442
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,740
your letter of resignation.

443
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,990
i thought i was being reassigned to field duty.

444
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,420
you are,effective immediately.

445
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,160
i need results.

446
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,220
we have a high-priced collection of sheepskin in the basement

447
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,260
that tells me you're the best way to get them,

448
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,320
so i'm willing to take a risk,

449
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,680
but i need  some insurance.

450
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,010
this.

451
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,650
i left the date blank.

452
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,860
you cross the line,i fill it in.

453
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,720
fair enough.

454
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,440
good.

455
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,740
here,look at this.

456
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,980
tess doerner.

457
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,830
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 15.

458
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,540
disappeared from abendson psychiatric hospital in april of 1955.

459
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,940
let me guess,they sent her back without bothering to cure her.

460
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,450
curing people was not part of their agenda.

461
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,010
we just got a call from the c.a.  over at the hospital.

462
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,350
one of their orderlies is dead.

463
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,170
he claims that there's    some kind of connection.

464
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,420
so...

465
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,520
we'll check it out.

466
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,610
hold on.

467
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,560
there's still one piece of business we need to get straight.

468
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,770
you're setting conditions?

469
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,360
this is your new house?

470
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,940
it's yours too.

471
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,710
well,all your stuff is here.  i...

472
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,930
kind of looks like  our old place,huh?

473
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,840
well,i tried,anyway.

474
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,950
only one thing missing.

475
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,800
mom.

476
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,950
yeah,i know.

477
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,070
sometimes i can't believe she's not here,either,

478
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,250
but we tried,kyle.

479
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,370
you know,we really tried to make it work.

480
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,300
i wish you both would have tried    a little harder.

481
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,950
i'm sorry. it's just...

482
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,000
you know,when something terrible happens to a family,

483
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,650
like when you were in the hospital,it can...

484
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,140
bring people closer together,

485
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
or drive them apart.

486
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,520
your mom and me...

487
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,080
i'll have to call her,

488
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,150
let her know i'm out of quarantine.

489
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,990
yeah,you should do that.

490
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,060
you know,it'd make her really happy.

491
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,790
shawn's gonna freak out too.

492
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,470
what?you know i'm gonna go see him,right?

493
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,930
you're a good cousin.

494
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,810
just don't expect too much.

495
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,740
you know,people change in four years.

496
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,920
i can't believe  you're standing here.

497
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,300
i've been looking forward to this moment for too long.

498
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,110
hey,you remember how we used to love to go to the batting cages?

499
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,010
you never could hit that curve ball.

500
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,240
me?no,it was you,

501
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,750
and i got plenty of quarters saved up,so...

502
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,620
maybe we should stop off    at the driving range too.

503
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,060
you want to learn    how to play golf?

504
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,370
i used to beg to teach you.

505
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,340
lot of things i want to try now,dad.

506
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,290
you make a list.

507
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,780
you want it,and we'll do it.

508
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,130
anything.

509
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,130
you can show me  tonight,okay?

510
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,280
you're leaving? i just got here.

511
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,870
it's my job,buddy.

512
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,070
now,get started on that list.

513
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,270
you people take your arts and crafts seriously,don't you?

514
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,490
you're sure tess drew this  before they started building?

515
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,760
she made her first sketch two weeks ago.

516
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,810
that thing started going up yesterday.

517
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,330
and you think that the orderly who died

518
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,010
is connected  to all of this?

519
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,470
arlo was on the ledge of "b" building,

520
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,910
prying loose a weather vane.

521
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,470
i believe it was this weather vane.

522
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,740
so why don't you just confine all the other patients to their rooms?

523
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,640
well,i've been tempted,

524
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,170
but this kind of cooperative behavior,

525
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,670
it's unheard of with these illnesses.

526
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,450
besides,i wanted you to get a look at that thing

527
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,970
before we tore it down again.

528
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,810
it's all right,kevin.

529
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,560
they're just here    to talk to tess.

530
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,040
he's very   protective of her.

531
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,160
she's his only friend in here.

532
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,260
really,it's okay.

533
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,630
i'll just let her know you're coming.

534
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,180
great.

535
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,260
we saw some of the pictures you did,tess.

536
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,640
they're really good.

537
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,570
they'll hear you.

538
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,260
there's microphones  in the walls.

539
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,560
they broadcast by satellite   to the submarines.

540
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,120
who does?

541
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,770
the doctors.

542
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,370
the doctors  here in the hospital?

543
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,600
some of them  are in the hospital.

544
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,110
some of them are stationed    on the submarine.

545
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,580
all right,we'll just talk really softly.

546
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,800
they took my crayons away,but they're too late.

547
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,310
yeah? why's that?

548
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
because it's gonna get built anyway.

549
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,040
they want me to  get in touch with them.

550
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,160
that's why they put the plans in my head.

551
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,290
uh,now,are we talking about the doctors here in the hospital 

552
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,050
or the doctors under the sea?

553
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,230
neither.

554
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,640
we're talking about the people  who took me,stupid.

555
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,550
so the people who took you...

556
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,290
they want the patients here  to build that tower?

557
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,200
they'll do anything to get me back.

558
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,180
they like me.

559
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,020
did you ask the other patients for help,tess?

560
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,980
i don't like talking to them.

561
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,900
they're crazy.

562
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,910
was arlo crazy?

563
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,070
i never thought he was...

564
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,740
but maybe crazy is catching.

565
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,190
so my first day back,and what's going on?

566
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,810
nothing much.

567
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,090
just a bunch   of mental patients

568
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,080
building a machine   to contact the future.

569
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,780
well,that's what tess thinks,anyway.

570
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,160
she also thinks there are doctors

571
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,590
stationed under the pacific ocean,

572
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,880
listening to a radio broadcast

573
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,650
of her private conversations.

574
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,520
could be some kind  of collective hysteria.

575
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,190
doesn't explain   this guy arlo,though.

576
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,570
he's a middle-aged hospital orderly whose wife just left him.

577
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,030
it could have been suicide.

578
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,390
lost his nerve  at the last minute,

579
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,610
tried to grab    the weather vane.

580
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,070
i wonder how long it is since marco got some sun,you know?

581
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,690
i was thinking we could bring him down to have a look

582
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,770
at that thing they're building.

583
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,830
a road trip for marco?

584
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,600
he goes outside,tom,

585
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,780
but,you know,we could    have some sunblock handy.

586
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,350
it would be something,though,huh?

587
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,750
if she could actually do it.

588
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,320
contact the future.

589
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,190
tess is right.

590
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,680
maybe crazy is catching.

591
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,310
he was dictating a letter.

592
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,040
i don't know what happened.

593
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,260
he just grabbed his head and started screaming.

594
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,550
wait outside. now.

595
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,510
hold still. hold still.

596
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,340
thanks.

597
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,810
thank you.

598
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,860
they're getting worse.

599
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,200
jordan...

600
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,690
they're coming more often too.

601
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,130
you okay?

602
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,840
i'm fine.

603
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,570
i don't get it.

604
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,460
i don't get why these attacks    keep coming back.

605
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,540
i've cured...

606
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,120
emphysema,leukemia...

607
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,490
broken bones...

608
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,380
that baby really kicked your ass.

609
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,120
well,you just remember that when we find richard and lily.

610
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,700
you u und pretty confident,jordan,

611
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,010
but it's been a year.

612
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,910
sometimes i forget they're still out there.

613
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,130
i never forget,

614
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,860
and neither do the men i'm paying to find them.

615
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,840
okay,but if i were you,

616
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,610
i wouldn't want to be in the same time zone

617
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,600
as that kid.

618
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:14,070
if you two meet up again,it might just finish you off.

619
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,320
i have my reasons.

620
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,710
now,get some rest,okay?

621
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,770
all right.

622
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,420
big day tomorrow.

623
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,670
<i>in breaking news,</i>

624
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,840
<i>a revelation</i>  <i>about the origins of the 4400.</i>

625
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,920
<i>in his newly published</i>  <i>autobiography,</i>

626
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,820

629
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,290

<i>that threatens</i>     <i>the survival of mankind.</i>

638
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,150
why didn't you tell me?

639
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,720
<i>collier charges</i>

640
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,220
<i>that the government has</i>  <i>had this information</i>

641
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,190
<i>for more than a year,</i>

642
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,410
<i>but has kept it secret</i>

643
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,890
<i>in an effort to avert</i>    <i>a public panic.</i>

644
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,740
<i>the government claims</i>

645
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,870
<i>that the documents</i>  <i>are purely speculative</i>

646
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,250
<i>and have been quoted</i>  <i>out of context.</i>

647
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,220
don't care   who took them.

648
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,020
don't care who sent them back.

649
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,600
the government should have   kept them behind bars.

650
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,520
didn't you hear what the man said?

651
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,800
they're here to save the world.

652
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
what do you expect him to say?    he's one of them.

653
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,970
you're awful quiet.

654
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,990
i deal in facts...

655
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,220
and the fact is,

656
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,970
i've got to flesh the ... before lunch.

657
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,930
you'll be happy to hear that mr. collier's anonymous source

658
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,770
is anonymous no more.

659
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,510
agent hubbard will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

660
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,980
so,what about collier?

661
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,830
guy bought national secrets  on the black market.

662
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,000
i'm sure we'd all like to see collier charged with treason,

663
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,690
but it's unlikely.

664
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,690
i doubt we'll be able  to trace the payments directly to him.

665
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,600
now,as for this so-called "4400 center,"

666
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,980
round-the-clock surveillance  is in effect

667
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,960
until further notice.

668
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,970
i want pictures of everyone

669
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,710
who comes within a hundred yards of that place.

670
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,100
is it true that collier's filing for tax-exempt status?

671
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,790
apparently.

672
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,280
he's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion?

673
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,070
more like a cult.

674
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,090
well,"cult"is what the big congregation calls the little congregation.

675
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,860
cult,religion,whatever.

676
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,960
what's he basing it on?

677
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,620
have you read this thing?

678
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,530
collier claims that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody.

679
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,750
so he expects a guy punching a clock in pittsburgh

680
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,070
to believe he has some kind of latent superpower?

681
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,280
most of the 4400

682
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,030
don't even have    those kinds of abilities.

683
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,920
not yet,anyway.

684
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,120
no,but if you thought there was a chance

685
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,900
that you had an ability    locked away inside you...

686
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,430
you sound like you're ready to sign up.

687
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,060
no,

688
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,190
but i wouldn't blame anyone for being curious.

689
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,480
we keep telling the public that biologically,

690
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,090
the 4400 aren't any different  than the rest of us.

691
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,200
they haven't been altered  genetically,neurologically--

692
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,450
as far as we can tell,

693
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,440
but if collier thinks people are just going to sign their lives

694
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,390
and their life savings over to some metaphysical pyramid scheme,then...

695
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,410
he's in for    a rude awakening.

696
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,230
welcome to the center.

697
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,480
my name's devon.

698
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,570
what's yours?

699
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,430
kyle.

700
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,560
nice to meet you,kyle.

701
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,260
can i sign you up for a tour?

702
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,820
uh,thanks.

703
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,830
i'm just looking for my cousin.

704
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,150
shawn farrell?

705
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,730
i'm sorry.

706
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,670
mr. farrell's    not available right now.

707
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,760
could you tell him kyle's looking for him?

708
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,650
he does live here,right?

709
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,640
i'm afraid policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.

710
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,860
i'm not looking    for a discussion.

711
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,030
i just want to say hi to my cousin.

712
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,220
if you'd leave your name--

713
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,970
i'm not leaving anything.

714
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,740
what is the problem here?

715
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,950
there's no problem.

716
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,830
then tell shawn i'm here!

717
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,040
if he doesn't want to see me,fine,

718
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,180
but that's up to him,right?

719
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,300
would you lower your voice,please?

720
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,330
look,i've got nothing against you.

721
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,150
personally,

722
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,500
i hope the pod people return your body to you someday.

723
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,530
if it's all the same,i'll find shawn myself.

724
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,120
this way,sir.

725
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,140
get your hands off me!

726
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,990
you have    to leave.

727
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,470
you guys didn't tell me this thing was so big.

728
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,200
it wasn't.

729
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,760
not yesterday.

730
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,460
and those don't look like patients to me.

731
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,550
they're not.

732
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,530
dr. clayton.

733
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,840
i know what you're going to say.  we're falling behind.

734
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
we'll make up the time   this afternoon.

735
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,540
so is the entire hospital working on this thing?

736
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,530
it's the only way to get it done.

737
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,430
excuse me.

738
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,220
uh,randy,winston,we need a little help here.

739
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,250
dr. cho's back there with the satellite dish.

740
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,150
okay.

741
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,540
so first the patients,now the staff.

742
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,440
if this is some kind of mass hysteria,

743
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,280
it's spreading.

744
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,060
who does daddy love?

745
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,360
mommy...

746
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,660
and isabelle.

747
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,430
yes,he does.

748
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,020
you know what he sees  when he looks at you?

749
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,830
a beautiful baby. yes,he does.

750
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,250
but mommy sees  much more than that,

751
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,330
and you know why?

752
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,930
because you communicate   with mommy.

753
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,140
but you never talk to daddy.

754
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,140
so how about it?

755
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,710
anything you want to say    to daddy?

756
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,620
huh?

757
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,930
because i'm listening.

758
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,850
okay,then.

759
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,140
guess i'm left to muddle along   all alone.

760
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,390
richard.

761
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,600
we got to get  a copy of that book.

762
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,510
i want to read it.

763
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,800
you and me both,but i checked in town.

764
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,750
they won't have any copies till tomorrow.

765
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,850
i don't know about you,

766
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,170
but i kind of got used   to the idea

767
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,470
we'd never know  where she came from.

768
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,270
well,if we went to the future,

769
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,860
at least we came back    with a souvenir.

770
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,050
the people who took us,

771
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,760
they made all this happen,right?

772
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,180
they saw to it  that we got isabelle.

773
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,670
they must have   something in mind for her.

774
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,170
i have something in mind  for her too--

775
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,180
a normal life.

776
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,790
sounds good,

777
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,880
but we left normal behind    a long time ago.

778
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,640
this is outrageous!

779
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,830
we have work to finish here. important work.

780
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,560
the doctors want to work.

781
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,460
tell them to make their rounds.

782
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,330
no one's stopping them from taking care of their patients.

783
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,460
but the courtyard and the tower   are off-limits,you got it?

784
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,720
got it.

785
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,860
man,look at the size of that thing.

786
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,320
wouldn't mind having one of those  in my backyard,huh?

787
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,170
road trip's over. wait in the car.

788
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,960
so yesterday,

789
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,120
a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,

790
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,690
and today it's the entire hospital.

791
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,480
if we get tess out of here,

792
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,090
do you think   this compulsion will fade?

793
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,290
i don't know.

794
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,560
it's worth a try,isn't it?

795
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,130
all right,i got you.

796
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,140
it's okay.

797
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,190
i'm not a bad person.

798
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,060
i'm not.

799
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,530
no,no,no one's saying you are,tess.

800
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,070
then why are you going to    stick wires in my brain?

801
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:18,810
i promise,tess.

802
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,760
no one's   going to hurt you.

803
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,040
that's what everyone says,right before they hurt you.

804
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,140
why am i being punished?

805
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,240
i'm a good person. really.

806
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,040
i'm only doing what they want.

807
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,360
guys! guys! get over here!

808
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,360
kevin!

809
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,620
kevin...

810
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,090
okay,tess. let's go. come on.

811
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,170
come on.

812
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,510
it's all right.    kevin...

813
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,100
do you have a seven?

814
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,700
go fish.

815
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,920
i am   so sorry i'm late.

816
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,860
who do we have here?

817
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,990
this is carrie. she lives downstairs.

818
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,620
the u.p.s. man left their package with us by mistake,

819
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,370
and when her mom came to get it,carrie was with her,

820
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,620
and now i'm invited to her birthday party,

821
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,510
and it's a sleep-over.

822
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,330
i can go,right?

823
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,950
hi,carrie.

824
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,300
i'm diana.

825
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,470
it's nice to meet you.

826
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,260
nice to meet you.

827
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,400
i already said it's okay.

828
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,950
well,i think we should probably   talk to carrie's mom first,

829
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,820
don't you?

830
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,220
oh,look,you know what?  it sounds fine to me.

831
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,920
thank you,thank you,thank you,thank you.

832
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,180
you never told me    i was a prisoner.

833
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,850
have you ever seen a prison cell,shawn?

834
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,480
it looks nothing like your apartment.

835
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,400
goddammit,jordan,since when do you decide

836
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,090
who i see and talk to?

837
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,860
this is about your cousin,isn't it?

838
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,590
so you did know  he was here.

839
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,170
i know he was rude and aggressive,

840
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,630
and had to be escorted from the premises.

841
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,490
you mean thrown out.

842
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,720
it might have been handled more smoothly,shawn,

843
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,660
but all in all,

844
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,580
i'd have to say it was for the best.

845
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,720
kyle is my friend.

846
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,500
he was your friend.

847
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,750
look,a year ago,

848
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,920
you came to me looking for a new life,

849
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,020
your old one in shambles.

850
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,850
kyle,friend or not,

851
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,500
is part of that old life.

852
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,520
so what do you   want me to do?

853
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,890
you just want me to cut him loose and forget he exists?

854
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,700
he's no different    than your mother,

855
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,660
your brother,or your friend nikki.

856
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,950
don't you-- they do not understand

857
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,400
what it is we're trying to accomplish here.

858
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,230
you know,maybe i don't either.

859
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,230
well,then,i suggest    you pack your bags and...

860
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,860
leave.

861
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,720
so,what happens next time you start screaming out in pain?

862
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,580
do what's right for you,shawn.

863
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,010
i'll take care of myself.

864
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,960
i just got the full medical workup on tess.

865
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,590
let me guess--

866
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,170
physically normal across the board.

867
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,070
you can say this for the 4400--

868
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,340
they're consistent.

869
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,230
tess draws a picture of a...

870
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,450
a tower,or a monument...

871
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,440
yeah,or a beacon...

872
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,540
and the people around her drop everything and start building it. 

873
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,000
well,they can't help themselves.

874
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,420
they have to work.

875
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,730
it's like ants.

876
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,070
come here.

877
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,830
the queen secretes a chemical,

878
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,470
tells the other ants what to do.

879
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,060
the drones don't stop working until the job is done.

880
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,680
doesn't matter if one of them dies,

881
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,960
or if a storm comes  and washes away the anthill.

882
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,650
they just keep working...

883
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,090
unless you take the queen away.

884
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,080
let's hope our drones respond the same way.

885
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,810
right,so the future sent back    a schizophrenic queen ant

886
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,920
with a blueprint for what,some interstellar walkie-talkie?

887
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,600
let's see what tess can tell us.

888
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,580
we'd just better not get too close,

889
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,770
because if your  theory's right,

890
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,970
anyone who gets exposed to her  could be vulnerable.

891
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,240
all right,i'll talk to tess.

892
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,590
you check in with garrity    at the hospital.

893
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,200
these friends of yours,

894
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,540
the ones who took you,

895
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,160
what do you think they want to talk about?

896
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,870
they're so much smarter than you,

897
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,670
it isn't even funny.

898
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,930
yeah,well...

899
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,490
yeah,i don't doubt it.

900
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,640
i mean,they figured out how to take you

901
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,340
and how to send you back.

902
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,030
sending me back was a mistake,and they know it.

903
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,490
i'm supposed to be there.

904
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,520
where exactly is "there?"

905
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,440
there were doctors there too.

906
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,780
they were nice. all of them.

907
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,710
they were nice.

908
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,380
you remember  where you were taken?

909
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,670
we slept a lot,but not all the time.

910
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,890
we wore gray clothes.

911
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,640
there was a giant building.

912
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,980
the doctors wore shiny jackets.

913
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,170
i miss it so much.

914
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,240
go on.

915
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,130
i really like hearing you talk about it.

916
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,870
our rooms had round windows.

917
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,360
high doorways with arches in them.

918
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,300
the stones had writing in them.

919
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,360
math symbols or something,

920
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,180
inscriptions,

921
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,840
jars of purplish metals,

922
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,610
and rods with stained tips.

923
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,280
these symbols,tess,what did they look like?

924
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,920
tess?

925
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,950
tess,do you remember   what the inscriptions said?

926
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,870
they're waiting to hear from me.

927
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,560
i need to get in touch   with them.

928
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,190
tess. tess.  just wait--

929
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,740
tess,just wait.

930
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,780
garrity,why haven't you been   picking up your cellphone?

931
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,420
<i>i'm sorry.</i>

932
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,730
<i>it's been kind of crazy</i>  <i>down here.</i>

933
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,040
so is everything all right?

934
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,060
<i>yeah. fine.</i>

935
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,460
<i>we're just about</i>  <i>done here.</i>

936
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,080
done?

937
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,840
well,the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up,

938
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,360
but we'll get 'em.

939
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,670
come on,people.

940
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,890
let's get those dishes secured.

941
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,770
we don't have all day.

942
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,740
i just had the most unbelievable conversation with tess.

943
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,370
well,it couldn't    have been any more unbelievable

944
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,320
than the one i just had  with garrity.

945
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,220
can't say   i see it that way.

946
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,370
no other way to see it.

947
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,920
that book is blasphemy.

948
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,670
well,don't buy it  if that's how you feel.

949
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,490
"the third angel blew his trumpet,

950
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,120
"and a great star fell from heaven,

951
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,960
burning like a torch."

952
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,220
revelations 8:10.

953
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,480
i'll take your word  for it.

954
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,440
the day they came back

955
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,550
was the beginning    of the end times.

956
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,840
sounds like you've done  a little more thinking on it than i have.

957
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,830
either remove the book from the store,

958
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,260
or my boy here will remove it for you.

959
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,300
like hell he will!

960
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,870
do you know what  you're carrying there,woman?

961
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,060
it's just a book.

962
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,970
it's the doorway to hell.

963
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,100
that child yours?

964
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,340
that's my daughter.

965
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,570
abomination begets abomination.

966
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,880
richard!

967
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,310
what's going on?

968
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,530
we've got to get out of here.

969
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,000
now.

970
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,000
these new guys you sent us  are no good.

971
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,040
park told me he had experience with a welding torch.

972
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,140
experience at what? starting fires?

973
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,350
now our schedule's in the toilet.

974
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,210
did either of you call the fire department?

975
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,330
time to go.

976
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,050
hurry,richard.

977
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,080
hurry!

978
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,340
as of tonight,abendson state hospital

979
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,930
is officially    under quarantine.

980
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,850
the patients will remain locked down.

981
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,850
hospital staff and affected ntac personnel

982
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,060
will be confined to the site

983
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,980
until we've isolated  the source of the compulsion.

984
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,820
that sounds like a good plan,

985
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,470
but who's going to watch over them?

986
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,440
the last group we sent was compromised within hours.

987
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,590
which is,quite frankly,

988
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,020
a little disturbing,

989
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,580
if you think of this like an epidemic...

990
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,710
in the cdc,

991
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,650
we'd call tess   "the sole disease vector."

992
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,840
you remove her,you remove the urge to build,

993
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,250
except as far as we know--

994
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,260
none of those agents   had any contact with tess.

995
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,870
so it's like the flu,

996
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,260
or any other  airborne virus.

997
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,160
you catch it,you can pass it on.

998
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,740
what is this thing supposed to be,anyway?

999
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,610
my guess,

1000
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,550
and i cannot emphasize the word "guess"strongly enough,

1001
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,170
is that tess is telling us the truth.

1002
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,220
it's some kind of communication device.

1003
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,710
to contact who?

1004
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,440
the future?

1005
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,400
the only way to find out

1006
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,320
is to let the patients   finish building it.

1007
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,350
that night on highland beach,

1008
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,470
they were trying  to tell us something.

1009
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,710
the conversation was cut short.

1010
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,570
which is why we've been stumbling around in the dark this last year.

1011
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,370
tess is the only 4400

1012
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,960
who remembers  where she was taken--

1013
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,510
no,claims to remember  where she was taken.

1014
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,510
she's also the only paranoid schizophrenic,

1015
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,930
and it sounds to me like you two 

1016
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,920
have been spending a little too much time around her.

1017
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,660
well,maybe i caught    the bug too,

1018
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:28,960
but,uh...

1019
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,050
i agree with them.

1020
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,300
the quarantine orders at the hospital remain in effect

1021
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,430
until further notice.

1022
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:38,640
the guards will rotate shifts to minimize their exposure.

1023
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,790
so where does that leave us?

1024
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,220
until we're sure the compulsion's not spreading anymore,

1025
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,340
you two aren't going  anywhere near that facility.

1026
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,140
isabelle's asleep.

1027
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,380
rainy day came sooner than expected.

1028
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,900
do you think we lost them?

1029
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,500
i'm not ready to stop    for pie just yet.

1030
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,300
i got 1,200 here.

1031
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,920
another 300    in my pocket.

1032
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,870
i'm carrying two.

1033
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,410
we're going to have to get those back windows replaced in the morning.

1034
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,760
this should be enough to carry us through  to montana.

1035
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,610
what did eric say when you called?

1036
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,180
he was a little  surprised to hear from me,

1037
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,710
but even back   in quarantine,

1038
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,020
he used to say how us 4400s should stick together.

1039
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,330
yeah,we didn't have much choice back then,

1040
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,390
though,did we?

1041
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,600
the bank will  wire us our savings when we get there.

1042
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,700
if things get really bad,we can sell these.

1043
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,840
i put that ring on you forever.

1044
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,640
guess you and isabelle   were right.

1045
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,000
we should have taken off when we had the chance.

1046
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,830
it's gonna be a long night.

1047
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,130
you want me to drive a shift?

1048
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,220
get some sleep.

1049
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,720
maia,what's wrong?

1050
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:25,450
i'm sorry.

1051
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:26,370
i know it's late,

1052
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,370
but maia really wanted to come home.

1053
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,650
why is that,sweetie?

1054
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,890
i don't want to talk about it.

1055
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,750
some of the girls,not my daughter,

1056
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,050
but some of the other girls,

1057
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,310
were teasing maia.

1058
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,170
i guess she said she has a crush on frank sinatra.

1059
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,330
well,ol' blue eyes.    do you blame her?

1060
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:46,510
most nine-year-olds don't even know who frank sinatra was.

1061
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,390
i want to go to bed.

1062
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,760
i guess it got   pretty nasty.

1063
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,950
i feel terrible.

1064
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,880
maybe maia can come back  another time?

1065
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,360
just her and carrie.

1066
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,770
yeah. we'll talk about it.

1067
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,180
thank you.

1068
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,930
good night.

1069
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,320
good night.

1070
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,900
maia.

1071
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,840
i know you didn't fall asleep   that fast.

1072
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,240
it was awful.

1073
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,870
you were right.

1074
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,390
well,i didn't want to be right.

1075
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,300
i don't need any friends.

1076
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,400
everyone needs friends,maia.

1077
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,400
come on,i really think   we should talk about this.

1078
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,740
well,i don't.

1079
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,670
buck's burgers.

1080
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,430
good as i remembered.

1081
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,520
kind of a strange thing to have on top of your list,

1082
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,470
but hey,you know what?

1083
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,000
i'm glad i could make   your dreams come true.

1084
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,470
kyle,shouldn't you  be in bed?

1085
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,830
dad,i'm 21.

1086
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,490
so i have to keep    reminding myself.

1087
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,670
i'm making some popcorn. you want some?

1088
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,290
you're kidding me.

1089
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,570
you could eat more?

1090
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,580
i've been eating quarantine food for a year.

1091
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,160
you guys might be keeping the country safe,

1092
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,880
but your cafeteria sucks.

1093
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,120
hello?

1094
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,880
hello?

1095
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,180
kyle.

1096
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,920
we got to get the baby out of the cold.

1097
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,950
i don't think there's any motels on this road.

1098
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:11,320
i was thinking we'd head south,catch the 35.

1099
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,530
guy should lose his high beams.

1100
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,790
that's the first car we've seen in,what,like,15 miles?

1101
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,460
get your head down.

1102
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,770
ah... oh,my god,richard.

1103
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,120
it's them.

1104
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,020
hold on! hold on!

1105
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,150
everybody okay?

1106
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,670
yeah,i think so.

1107
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,590
okay. let's go.

1108
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,760
spread out.

1109
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,320
hey,maia,sweetie.

1110
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,700
it's wake-up time.

1111
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,710
okay.

1112
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,050
huh?

1113
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,600
it was a late night,huh?

1114
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,670
all right. 15 more minutes.

1115
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:10,420
you know what?

1116
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,680
frank sinatra is the coolest,

1117
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:15,330
and don't you let anyone ever tell your dear friend.

1118
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,250
so you didn't read any of it?

1119
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:34,690
no.

1120
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,470
i wouldn't want my daughter reading my diary.

1121
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,600
you keep a diary? am i in it?

1122
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,610
oh,come on,don't flatter yourself.

1123
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,180
so,really,you don't even know

1124
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,040
if "what she sees" means...

1125
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,290
things during the day,

1126
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:49,040
tv shows,ponies,whatnot...

1127
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,310
or it could be "what she sees,"

1128
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,350
a week,a month,a year down the line.

1129
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,690
she hasn't had  one of those visions in,like,four months.

1130
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,780
well,that's what she tells you,anyway.

1131
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,670
why would she lie?

1132
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,430
she wants to be normal,right?

1133
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,570
every time she makes a prediction,

1134
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,710
someone calls her a freak.

1135
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,560
look,i understand.

1136
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,450
you're her mom now.

1137
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,360
there are certain protocols.

1138
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,090
next time i'm over,why don't i take a peek?

1139
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,840
you think that'd be  any less of a betrayal?

1140
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,540
respecting maia's privacy   is no small thing,

1141
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:22,050
but you've got to weigh that against the information

1142
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,990
that could be in that diary.

1143
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,950
you know what?

1144
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,210
when you stop   trusting a parent,

1145
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,430
it's really hard to start again,

1146
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,570
and yes,i'm speaking    from experience.

1147
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,110
hey.

1148
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,360
i'm glad it's not my decision,

1149
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,460
but if maia's having visions,you should know about it,

1150
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,530
and you should know what they are.

1151
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,730
is it bad?

1152
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,960
i just jammed it    when we spun out.

1153
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,590
just need to walk it off a little more.

1154
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,170
we'll follow this stream south.

1155
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,790
hike through the water a bit,

1156
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,630
throw 'em off our trail.

1157
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,110
it'll be cold.

1158
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,610
it'll keep us awake.

1159
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,960
after a mile,we'll...

1160
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,540
we'll double back west.

1161
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,750
head straight for the highway.

1162
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,460
sounds easy when you say it.

1163
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,320
we can do it.

1164
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,920
we're going to do it,right?

1165
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,090
keep her quiet.

1166
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,010
she's going to bring them right to us.

1167
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,280
does the name "gene pecusa"  ring a bell?

1168
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,430
yeah,returnee 927.

1169
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,110
oh,let me guess.

1170
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,210
he still has the ability

1171
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,600
to turn 20 bucks into a crushing hangover.

1172
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,040
and a night in  the drunk tank.

1173
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,250
we've got to ferry him   back to his halfway house.

1174
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,580
give it to mortimer and falcone.

1175
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,860
we got something else    on our plates?

1176
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,800
everything's quiet   at abendson.

1177
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,960
no one's been allowed    near the tower.

1178
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,620
that's the problem,isn't it?

1179
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,790
tom... tom,no.

1180
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,200
you do remember

1181
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,320
that jarvis has still got   your letter of resignation.

1182
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,260
she wants results.

1183
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,610
i'm going to give them to her.

1184
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,500
and besides,you want to know 

1185
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,170
what that thing is as badly as i do.

1186
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,630
i'm trying not to    think about it.

1187
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,960
yeah,well,i can't think of anything else.

1188
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,810
so it sounds like tess    has got her hooks in you.

1189
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,930
i don't have the urge to pick up a tool belt.

1190
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,890
i'm coming with you.

1191
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:43,610
it's all right,tess.

1192
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,970
we're taking you back to abendson.

1193
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:47,590
we signed you out,tess.

1194
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,010
no one from ntac is coming after you.

1195
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,570
not you people. the doctors in the submarines.

1196
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,110
they're watching us.

1197
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,340
what,you're having second thoughts?

1198
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,270
no,just get in.

1199
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:16,500
so you still owe me four or five dollars

1200
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,790
for those   two six-packs?

1201
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,630
something like that?

1202
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:19,470
i've got a 20 right here,

1203
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:22,410
if you think you can take it from me.

1204
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,740
look at you,man.

1205
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,320
back among the living.   you look great.

1206
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,600
i walk. i talk.

1207
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,330
i seem to have full control of my limbs.

1208
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,770
you still hit    like a girl.

1209
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,210
nothing's changed.

1210
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,300
four years? plenty's changed.

1211
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,100
what are you talking about?

1212
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:40,010
we saw each other right when  you got out of the hospital.

1213
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,660
i don't remember any of that.

1214
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,900
you don't?

1215
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,750
so you don't remember sitting naked in the sprinklers?

1216
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,750
no.

1217
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,600
sounds like something you'd do.

1218
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,750
well...

1219
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,390
thank you.

1220
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,510
i never got a chance to say that.

1221
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,580
for getting me out of the coma...thank you.

1222
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,760
you know,if it  hadn't been for me,

1223
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,800
you wouldn't have been  in that stupid hospital

1224
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,240
anyway,so...

1225
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,700
no,i'd have been the one who disappeared into 4400 boot camp.

1226
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,910
maybe i'd have come back with the magic hands.

1227
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,440
all right,all right.    okay.

1228
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,480
speaking of disappearing,you jerk...

1229
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,290
oh,kyle,don't go there yet.    come on.

1230
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,220
don't go there?

1231
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,210
your mom   is so freaked out.

1232
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,340
you haven't seen her in a year.

1233
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,010
you haven't seen anybody.

1234
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,910
your brother.

1235
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,050
my dad.

1236
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,670
what was going on  with you and nikki?

1237
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,320
kyle,i don't want to talk about nikki.

1238
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,620
we're all really worried about you,man.

1239
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,890
you don't need to be.

1240
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,820
i mean,i'm fine.

1241
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,400
i've been to that place  where you're living.

1242
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,500
there are some serious   <i>stepford wives</i> vibes

1243
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,750
going on there,you know that,right?

1244
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,450
all that stuff about "unlocking the 4400 inside everybody..."

1245
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,050
yeah?

1246
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,600
you don't really believe  collier can do that,do you?

1247
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,110
kyle...

1248
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,890
look around us,man.

1249
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,890
the world is in a total freefall.

1250
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,370
these centers,

1251
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,090
they're a chance    to bring people together,

1252
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,650
maybe our last chance.

1253
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,100
i don't just believe that he can do it.

1254
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,820
i believe that he has to do it.

1255
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,850
sounds like someone  got inside your head.

1256
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,260
he said you wouldn't understand.

1257
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,330
collier?

1258
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,840
i got to tell you,man,he was right.

1259
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,710
richard!

1260
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,670
god. what happened?

1261
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,520
guess i wasn't looking   where i was going.

1262
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:08,600
okay. we just need to rest.

1263
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,370
you think they're stopping for breaks?

1264
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,600
come on,richard.

1265
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,340
five minutes.

1266
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,100
all right,people,come on!

1267
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,150
everyone out to the tower.

1268
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,180
come on.

1269
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,770
we've got a lot of work to do,and not a lot of time to do it,

1270
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,700
so let's go,come on.

1271
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,380
go,go.

1272
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,890
come on,you heard me. let's go.

1273
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,520
this one's mine.    stand over there.

1274
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,250
hey,kevin!

1275
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,710
look. i escaped.

1276
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,850
always thinking of me.

1277
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,850
kevin's a genius,you know,

1278
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,140
but he doesn't brag about it.

1279
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,770
i bet in a couple of days all these berries will be ripe.

1280
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,950
don't eat them now.

1281
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:17,500
the last thing we need    is to start cramping up.

1282
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,000
look.

1283
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,930
i thought you said   they weren't ripe.

1284
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:59,070
they weren't.

1285
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,950
well...

1286
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,840
isabelle?

1287
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,360
had to be.

1288
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,130
way to go,little girl.

1289
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,770
they're going to   have to work fast.

1290
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,590
i'm going to help them.

1291
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,400
that's not funny,diana.

1292
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,270
i really want to do this.

1293
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,660
no,you'd only be    in the way.

1294
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,450
you don't understand.

1295
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,020
i really need to do this.

1296
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,160
have these sent to my house.

1297
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,050
shawn,i've been looking for you.

1298
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,110
yeah,i took a walk.

1299
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,010
we have a special visitor    tonight.

1300
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,690
she has pancreatic cancer.

1301
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,610
her husband is willing   to donate real estate

1302
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,860
for a 4400 center    in los angeles.

1303
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,750
well,tonight doesn't really  work for me,jordan.

1304
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,260
well,you have five...

1305
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,180
no,six hours  to get in the mood.

1306
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,870
mood's   got nothing to do with it.

1307
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,340
i'm just not working tonight.

1308
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,030
richard,please.

1309
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,320
don't do this.

1310
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,770
we don't have another choice.

1311
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,510
there's three of them.

1312
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,530
they're going to kill you.

1313
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,750
not if i get my hands on one of those shotguns.

1314
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,500
you can barely walk.

1315
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,120
it's our only chance.

1316
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,220
i've got to do it now,

1317
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,780
while i still have the strength.

1318
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,330
if i'm not back by sundown,

1319
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,280
take the baby and walk due west.

1320
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,600
it's that way.

1321
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,430
just keep going in a straight line.

1322
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,150
understand?

1323
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:50,790
i'd give up another 50 years if it meant finding you again.

1324
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,890
you knew about this,didn't you?

1325
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:18,950
knew about what?

1326
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,020
baldwin and skouris signed tess doerner out of here

1327
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,970
and took her back to abendson.

1328
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,040
they're rebuilding the tower.

1329
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,680
that would be one theory.

1330
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,220
no crying. you can't cry now.

1331
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,180
drop it.

1332
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,510
i'll cut you in half.

1333
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,490
turn around.

1334
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,030
i taught you boys    better than this.

1335
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,230
get up!

1336
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,160
diana,how's it going?

1337
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:11,080
well,it turns out we're in better shape than i thought.

1338
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,610
the fire missed  most of the wiring.

1339
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,210
so how soon till it's ready to go?

1340
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,640
well,we've got to finish    triangulating the dishes,

1341
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,830
and then we're good.

1342
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,140
just get it done.

1343
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,650
baldwin.

1344
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,420
we've got your man!

1345
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,680
either you come out,

1346
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,590
or the next sound you hear

1347
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:32,660
is him being blown straight to hell!

1348
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,960
i told you,she's miles away by--

1349
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,040
open your mouth again,

1350
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:39,990
i'll cut your tongue out.

1351
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,030
watch him.

1352
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,490
lily! run!

1353
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,350
are you sure you don't want to say goodbye to me?

1354
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,610
 ..

1355
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,810
last time,bowen,unlock the door.

1356
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,120
can't do that

1357
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,240
you said you want results.

1358
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:29,910
listen to me bob,when you are not in your right mind.

1359
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,820
it's not the results that we was talking about.

1360
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,940
you step awey before you get hurt.

1361
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,990
take

1362
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,700
no,no,just wait

1363
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,140
we need a

1364
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,810
just listen,listen to me

1365
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,290
it's a risk,i know.

1366
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,280
it's sometime you want to get the tureth 

1367
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,770
you have to take a ...

1368
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,800
just listen to me.

1369
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,100
you want the trueth?

1370
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,850
tess sdores the memery...

1371
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:14,970
they are not memeries.

1372
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,820
she read the short... 

1373
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,830
step awey from that tower.

1374
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,330
where are you?

1375
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,310
where are you?

1376
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,900
let's get everyone back in their rooms.

1377
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,910
we need a full head count before the next round of medications.

1378
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,720
where are you?

1379
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,720
i did what you wanted,right?

1380
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,280
talk to me.

1381
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,860
come on,tess.

1382
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,550
we all could use a little rest.

1383
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,770
but they lied to me.

1384
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,360
or did i lie to you?

1385
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:48,760
well,somehow   i wanted more.

1386
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,830
i don't know what i expected.

1387
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,280
another ball of light,

1388
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:54,880
a booming voice from the sky...something.

1389
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:57,570
could we have built it wrong?

1390
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,120
maybe.

1391
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,770
all i know is that i don't feel like  picking up a hammer anymore,

1392
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,770
and 10 minutes ago,

1393
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,330
that was all i could think of.

1394
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,220
i want to be updated as soon as there's    new information.

1395
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,540
norad said the pulse dissipated before it left the atmosphere.

1396
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:19,380
could be all this sound and fury   was for absolutely nothing.

1397
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,910
now,our first priority is to help the hospital personnel

1398
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,660
restore order here,okay?

1399
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,660
and then i want all of you who were infected    with this thing

1400
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,560
to be checked out    by ntac medical.

1401
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,410
you including me in that order? because i'm not sure--

1402
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:32,450
you were infected,

1403
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,020
because if you're standing here telling me you weren't,

1404
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,860
i'm putting a date on that letter of resignation.

1405
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,840
i was definitely infected.

1406
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,160
i thought so.

1407
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,460
we could use a little help policing the area here,

1408
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,370
and we need to get rid   of these tools

1409
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,740
before  one of the patients hurts themselves.

1410
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,600
you heard the man.

1411
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,040
excuse me. dr. clayton?

1412
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,480
kevin...

1413
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:02,170
did you just speak to me?

1414
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:05,010
i guess i did.

1415
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:12,070
i haven't said anything    for a long time,have i?

1416
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:15,370
try six years.

1417
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:25,660
i can think again too.

1418
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,780
i don't know   what happened,

1419
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,530
but...

1420
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:33,270
i feel...

1421
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,040
better.

1422
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,550
you had me followed?

1423
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,660
i could have had your   conversation recorded.

1424
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,620
i just thought    that might be pushing it.

1425
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,790
god,kyle's right.

1426
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,770
i am some kind of prisoner.

1427
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,720
shawn,i've told you,

1428
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,170
you can leave here   any time you want,

1429
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,690
and i meant it,

1430
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,680
but until you do,

1431
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:05,450
i will not allow these shadows   from your past

1432
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,680
to alter your perceptions

1433
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,420
of what it is we're trying   to accomplish here.

1434
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,590
you're too important.

1435
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,540
no,no,you mean you need me

1436
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:14,600
to help bring in the big checks.

1437
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,580
shawn,the money...

1438
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,100
is a means to an end.

1439
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,280
the goal is what matters.

1440
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,460
ensure the future.

1441
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,570
save the planet.

1442
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,080
i can't do that without you.

1443
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:38,700
you want proof the future works   in mysterious ways?

1444
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,680
look no further than mr. kevin burkhoff.

1445
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,040
yeah,instead    of contacting the future,

1446
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,190
we got him.

1447
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,850
well,not as disappointing as it might seem at first blush.

1448
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,510
burkhoff was a tenured professor of neurochemistry at stanford university.

1449
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:50,890
neuroscience.

1450
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,910
only class i ever got a "b" in.

1451
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:55,090
yeah,you're not alone.

1452
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:58,420
only a handful of people work at the top of the field at any given time.

1453
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,430
our mr. burkhoff was the heir apparent,

1454
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,140
until he suffered his first delusion at the age of 30,

1455
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,950
and he was institutionalized two years later.

1456
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,430
what was he working on?

1457
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,940
you want a ripple effect?

1458
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,220
how's this?

1459
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,520
burkhoff specialized   in dormant neural pathways.

1460
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,930
he was trying to wake up   parts of the brain

1461
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,260
that we can't use.

1462
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,560
parts that would do what?

1463
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,650
well,parts that could lead to all kinds    of special new abilities,

1464
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,310
like...precognition.

1465
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,260
right,marco?

1466
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,350
precognition,

1467
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,250
telekinesis...

1468
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,680
stop me if any of this sounds familiar.

1469
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,790
maia rutledge.

1470
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,310
orson bailey.

1471
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,460
you're saying that burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology?

1472
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,690
it's possible.

1473
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:43,450
and we just woke him up.
