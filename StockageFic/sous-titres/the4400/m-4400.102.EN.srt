1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,437
Previously on "The 4400".

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,777
Listen up, everyone.
We're Defcon One.

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,530
- It's not a flyby.
- A comet can't change course.

4
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:16,032
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:20,286
There appears
to be something out there.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:24,666
The light has gone and thousands
of people have suddenly appeared.

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,378
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son is my job.

8
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,255
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.

9
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:34,676
You will be one of the teams responsible
for investigating the returnees.

10
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:36,553
What about my parents?

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,304
They're dead, aren't they?

12
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:43,059
This is Maia Rutledge. She's eight
years old, only she was born in 1938.

13
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:44,644
No time has passed.

14
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,981
Returnee 2,117, Shawn Farrell.

15
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:50,942
- Uncle Tommy.
- He's all yours.

16
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,570
- What about Kyle?
- Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

17
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:57,907
We're letting them go. We don't
have a legal right to hold them.

18
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,326
Shawn!

19
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,203
- Remember me?
- Nikki?

20
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,789
- I'm Richard.
- Lily.

21
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:08,126
- Lily Bonham from St Louis?
- You knew my grandmother.

22
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,545
Some people have no place to go.

23
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,880
- What you looking at?
- I used to live here.

24
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:15,717
Heidi? Heidi, it's Mommy.

25
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,595
It's OK, sweetie.

26
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:22,140
- Brian.
- Lily.

27
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,851
There's no mistake.
You're definately pregnant.

28
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,688
- It's a restraining order.
- You can't stop me seeing her.

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,649
Who knows where all this is going?

30
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:34,319
We've got one case.
Maybe that's all.

31
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:38,156
You haven't noticed anything
unusual with Shawn?

32
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:41,909
I need to know if you had you'd tell me.

33
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,920
What looks good today, Carl?

34
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,341
I have a white fish with your name on it,
Mrs Martino.

35
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:04,098
When you were gone, in 18 months,
I haven't got a decent piece of fish.

36
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,893
You... you take care of me.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,064
- You are such a sweetheart.
- Oh, it's easy being nice to you.

38
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,444
Tell me, how does it feel to be back?

39
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,863
It's OK. It's good.

40
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,282
Carl.

41
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,785
It's like I never left.

42
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:28,581
What do you think
you're doing out there?

43
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,000
I was helping a customer.

44
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,795
Rosie and Derek
can help a customer.

45
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,713
I said stock the display cases.

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,257
But I've known Mrs Martino
since I was a kid.

47
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,136
And I'm supposed to care?
Now, get that flounder on ice.

48
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,773
Grace.

49
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,654
- So how'd it go today?
- Slow as usual.

50
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,740
It's the neighbourhood.
It's not like it used to be.

51
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:07,036
- It's not that bad.
- It's gotten worse since you were away.

52
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:10,456
- I don't see it.
- You don't want to see it.

53
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,544
OK, I admit it.
It's not like when we were kids.

54
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,754
No one cares about the place any more.

55
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:21,050
There's no pride.
There's no sense of community.

56
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,261
I didn't know you were so unhappy.

57
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:26,222
I'm not unhappy. I got you back, didn't I?

58
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,392
I got nothing to complain about.

59
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,394
Yeah.

60
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,604
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:36,190
Fish smell.

62
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,192
I don't mind.

63
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,653
I'll hop in the shower
when we get back.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,450
- Let's cut across the park.
- Nobody goes into Bradley Park. No.

65
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,328
Yeah? Sure they do.
How do you think I got here?

66
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:54,500
It's not safe. There's nothing but
lowlifes and junkies in there.

67
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:59,672
Grace, 15 years ago
I proposed to you in this park.

68
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:06,012
15 years ago I was a size 2 and you had
your hair down to your shoulders.

69
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:10,474
Things change. From now on,
you take the long way around.

70
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,894
Grace, I just wish that you'd...

71
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,900
...stop worrying.

72
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:54,727
- Marry me, Gracie.
- Of course I will.

73
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,285
Yo, what are you doing
in our park, man?

74
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,454
Your park?

75
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,206
Just give up your wallet.

76
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:18,417
- You're mugging me?
- Now you're catching on.

77
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:21,962
- Seven bucks!
- It's all I have.

78
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:52,511
The complaints started after her foster
parents brought her back to quarantine.

79
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,638
What kind of complaints?

80
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,892
Well, for instance, yesterday

81
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:00,728
Maia spoke to a cafeteria employee.

82
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:04,648
She told her that her daughter would be
in the hospital soon, but would be OK.

83
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:07,234
Then the little girl was in a car accident.

84
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,654
So you're saying she's got
some kind of second sight?

85
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,949
I have five stories just like that one.

86
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:16,160
Why hold a little girl for 60 years

87
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:19,246
and then send her back
able to predict the future?

88
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:21,248
What were they thinking?

89
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:24,793
- We don't know if there is a they.
- He, she it, take your pick.

90
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,963
Let's leave that for the team
in the theory room.

91
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,174
We're not playing video games.

92
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:32,384
That's why they're intimidated.

93
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,678
They feel your hostility.

94
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,472
Good.

95
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,058
Don't worry too much
about the big brains.

96
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,435
Just talk to that girl.

97
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,611
Thanks.

98
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,781
I never meant to scare anyone.

99
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,367
We know that, sweetie.

100
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,245
But why did you say those things to
Mrs Krause about her daughter?

101
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,168
- Because they're true.
- But how did you know?

102
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,836
I just do.

103
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:16,470
If I asked you if it was going to rain next
Sunday, would you know the answer?

104
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,472
Maybe.

105
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,892
I don't know.

106
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,064
What's going to happen to me now?

107
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,318
The doctors here are going to take
another look at you.

108
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,821
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

109
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,865
I don't believe you.

110
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,326
It's gonna hurt, isn't it?

111
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:45,374
You might be uncomfortable some of the
time, but mostly it's going to be boring.

112
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,587
- Will you look in on me now and then?
- Me?

113
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,881
To see that I'm all right.

114
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,763
Sure.

115
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,310
- It's expensive.
- Rental vouchers will cover it.

116
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,730
So... do you have any questions?

117
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:13,902
The small bedroom, do you think it'll
get too much light for a nursery?

118
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:17,322
It's a northern exposure,
so you should be all right.

119
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,662
So what do you think?

120
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:27,958
- I like it.
- Me, too.

121
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:33,130
- Is this your first baby?
- Oh... we're not actually a couple.

122
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,883
Oh, so it's just you and the baby.

123
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,468
No, it'll be the three of us.

124
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:45,976
Why not? You can't stay in that hotel
forever. We can share this place.

125
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,814
Unless you don't want to.

126
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:54,151
No. No, I'd like that.

127
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,571
Great. I'll go do the paperwork.

128
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:06,580
- I hope I didn't embarrass you.
- No. It's...

129
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:11,960
It's not that. I figure he wouldn't rent
you the place if I was part of the deal.

130
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:16,924
I know, I know. It's not 1951 any more.
Times have changed, but...

131
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:22,304
Sometimes I'm just surprised
at how much.

132
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,683
Good. It's settled, then?

133
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,575
Oh, God.

134
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:46,787
Lily? Lily, what is it?

135
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,582
- Oh.
- Lily?

136
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:53,710
I don't feel so good.

137
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:56,213
You need to sit down.
Shall I call a doctor?

138
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,468
- No, no. No, let's just leave.
- And go where?

139
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,679
Anywhere but here.

140
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,685
Carl, where have you been?

141
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:13,105
- I got mugged.
- Oh, God. Are you all right?

142
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,316
- Did they hurt you?
- I didn't get hurt. They got hurt.

143
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,403
- Who did?
- I learned something important tonight.

144
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:24,324
I'm a different man. Those aliens, or
whoever took me, they did something.

145
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:27,577
They took me. They changed me.
They made me better.

146
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:31,998
First thing in the morning call
the counsellor and make an appointment.

147
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,835
I don't have time for that.
I've got things to do.

148
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,421
- What kind of things?
- The park, Gracie!

149
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:41,508
I want to make it like it was before.
People will bring their kids again.

150
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:44,761
You and me, we can have
our picnics at the old spot.

151
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:48,098
- Carl, you're scaring me.
- Wh...

152
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:51,518
There's nothing to be scared of,
not any more.

153
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,949
Linda, any idea why
Dr Mayhew wants to see us?

154
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,160
He didn't say.

155
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,127
So how have you been?

156
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:18,795
Good.

157
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:26,636
My lawyer was asking if you'd signed
those divorce papers yet.

158
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:31,391
I thought maybe if we had dinner
one night... we could sign them together.

159
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:35,103
You mean make plans
that you cancel at the last minute?

160
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:41,735
I'll bring the papers, we'll have a good
meal, a couple of glasses of wine...

161
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,945
And a good cry.

162
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,324
That, too.

163
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,661
Stefano's?

164
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,997
Yeah. Where else?

165
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,958
Tom, Linda, thanks for coming in.

166
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,670
I reviewed Kyle's EEG readout
and noticed something peculiar.

167
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:02,088
What now?

168
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:05,008
Last Thursday he had
a burst of brain activity.

169
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,510
It was brief, no more
than a few seconds.

170
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:09,304
That's good, isn't it?

171
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,514
Technically, yes.

172
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,683
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

173
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,728
I'll run tests,
see if I can find out what happened.

174
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,189
We've had three years of tests.

175
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:22,692
I understand your frustration,
but we need to look into this.

176
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:26,621
- It's a roller coaster, isn't it?
- Never ends.

177
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:28,415
Linda.

178
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:32,168
So Stefano's, right?

179
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,587
How does Thursday night sound, 7:30?

180
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,716
I'll be there.

181
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:47,600
- Dorothy.
- Yeah.

182
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,396
Did anyone visit last Thursday night,
besides his mother and me?

183
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,398
Let me check.

184
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,985
Yes. He had one other visitor.

185
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,195
Your nephew Shawn.

186
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,689
Shawn!

187
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:14,654
Yeah, I went and saw Kyle
on Thursday night.

188
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,198
He's my cousin. I wanted to see him.

189
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,909
- What about it?
- Nothing happened there?

190
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,620
I was only there for a couple of minutes.

191
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,789
So you saw nothing, did nothing?

192
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,501
What could I have done?

193
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:33,297
At your welcome home party, a bird
smacked into the window, remember?

194
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:35,466
It was stunned. What about it?

195
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:40,221
No, it was more than that.
And then... you picked it up.

196
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:42,974
Suddenly, it was alive and well.

197
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:45,309
What the hell did you do to Kyle?

198
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:48,604
Argh! I didn't do anything to him.

199
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:56,571
Look, I really like these chats we have,
Uncle Tommy, but I gotta go to class.

200
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,451
Shawn.

201
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,911
- We'll talk again.
- Oh, I can't wait.

202
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:08,458
We're going to see
Fountains Of Wayne this weekend.

203
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,460
Have fun.

204
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:14,338
You know,
this whole loner thing is so tired.

205
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,549
Well, it works for me.

206
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,887
Fountains of Wayne... Friday night!

207
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,640
What is with you?
Why do you keep pushing him?

208
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,060
Someone has to.
I don't see you doing anything.

209
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,689
I'm giving him his space, let him
figure things out for himself.

210
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,900
You should try it sometime.

211
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:37,862
Ugh!

212
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,369
Marco.

213
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,705
Skouris. Good. I checked out your idea.

214
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:51,042
- What idea?
- So am I a genius or am I crazy?

215
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,878
We don't make that distinction.

216
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:57,757
I visited a sampling of disappearance
sites on the west coast.

217
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,468
You were right.
The gravity there is weaker.

218
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:04,889
- But only by five parts per billion.
- That's barely measurable.

219
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:08,142
Not to mention barely understandable.
English, please.

220
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:11,771
The gravity changed at some places
people disappeared.

221
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,191
The question is, was it natural
or was it manipulated?

222
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,902
If it was manipulated,
the question is, by who?

223
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,237
So back to alien abductions?

224
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:23,741
I won't rule out little green men.
I need more measurements.

225
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:26,410
In other words,
you've made no progress.

226
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,582
Er... you explain it to him.

227
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,587
Oh, hold on!
You remember Adam Kensington?

228
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,340
The insurance guy Orson Bailey killed.

229
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,925
Yeah, what about him?

230
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,344
Not one of the good guys as it turns out.

231
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:47,014
He was in an insurance scheme
to defraud policy holders.

232
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:50,351
Bailey saved Washington state
a billion-dollar buy-out.

233
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:53,938
- Could have been Enron all over again.
- That's interesting.

234
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,399
Brings up all kinds of possibilities.

235
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,527
Well, er... don't be a stranger.

236
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:07,702
So are you saying whoever sent him
back meant him to go after Kensington?

237
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,830
It's a theory.
That's why they call it the theory room.

238
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,718
That's tight.

239
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,928
Oh, no. I suck.

240
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,894
Hey, is this about the concert thing?

241
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:37,064
No, no, it's got nothing to do with that.

242
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:43,112
I just want to know what's
going on with you and Nikki.

243
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,990
Me and Nikki what?

244
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,826
I just want to know what's going on
between you.

245
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:52,413
- What do you think's going on?
- Something.

246
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,666
She's always talking about you.

247
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,336
Can't go anywhere without
her wanting to bring you along.

248
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:03,841
- How's that my problem, Danny?
- Just do me a favour. Leave her alone.

249
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:08,345
I thought that's what I'd been doing.

250
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,850
Look, you got a problem with her,
go talk to her about it.

251
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,521
Yeah. We're the same age.

252
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:22,318
- I'm not your little brother now.
- Then stop acting like a two-year-old.

253
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:25,946
You're my brother. She's your girlfriend.

254
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:31,702
It's all good... right?

255
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,205
Yeah, right.

256
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,261
Richard, I am so glad I found this place.

257
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,681
Now we have a new apartment,
we can get you a computer.

258
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,893
Forget about the computer.
Let's get you to a doctor.

259
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,686
I'm fine.

260
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:02,107
I know this is going to sound strange,
but that other place we looked at,

261
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,109
the baby didn't like it.

262
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,613
Maternal instincts
kicking in already, huh?

263
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,160
No, it's not that. It's that somehow
I know what the baby's thinking.

264
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:18,582
Lily, the baby's barely two months along.
It's not thinking anything.

265
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:23,963
I can't explain it any more than you can
explain where you've been for 50 years,

266
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,383
or what's happened to us
during the time we've been gone.

267
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,514
I don't sound too strange, do I?

268
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,558
Of course not.

269
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,458
Lily?

270
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,629
I used to rock Heidi like that
when she was a baby.

271
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:12,094
- It feels like yesterday, but it wasn't.
- No.

272
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:18,016
It was what... 11 years ago?

273
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:23,105
I want to see Heidi. I miss her.

274
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:25,315
Lily, give it some time.

275
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:29,319
Once Brian's used to you being back,
he'll drop the restraining order.

276
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,544
Don't move!

277
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:30,339
Stop it! Cut it out! It isn't funny!

278
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:33,717
Shut up! Just shut up!

279
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,970
Hey, guys,
why don't you leave her alone?

280
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:39,389
- Get lost!
- No!

281
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:43,393
You get lost.

282
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,729
Go get him, man! Come on!

283
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,425
Hey, Maia.

284
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:19,054
How long have they left you like this?

285
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:23,100
A while. I think they all went
on their coffee break.

286
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,686
Oh! Well!

287
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:29,898
You know, that's pretty dumb
of them, isn't it?

288
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,779
- Will you stay until they come back?
- Of course.

289
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:39,950
When they show up, your doctors
and I are going to have a little talk.

290
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,996
- And then can I go home?
- Home?

291
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,457
With you. I don't like being here alone.

292
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:53,755
- You want to stay with me?
- You don't like being alone either.

293
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:58,719
I can always come back
for my checkups. Please.

294
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:06,018
Look, Maia, I'm not even sure I'm
the kind of person I want to live with.

295
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:10,480
No, I... eat cold pizza for breakfast and...

296
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:13,442
- That sounds all right to me.
- Yeah.

297
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:17,946
You know, Maia, just let me
think about it, OK?

298
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:32,544
- Where have you been?
- I was looking in on Maia.

299
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,130
- Really?
- I promised her, didn't I?

300
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:39,509
- So what have you got?
- Sid lent us his research clippings.

301
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:42,471
I think I found something
worth checking out.

302
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,724
One guy taking on three attackers
isn't far-fetched.

303
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,602
But if you saw him,
you'd think it was impossible.

304
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:55,692
He was... 35, 40, maybe five-foot-six,
weighed 150 pounds.

305
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,571
- So not exactly the Rock, huh?
- It was the way that he moved.

306
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,324
Could he have been on drugs,
maybe PCP?

307
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,118
He didn't act like he was on drugs.

308
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:09,664
You know, most guys
would have walked away.

309
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:15,837
Or, er... maybe called the cops later,
after it was too late.

310
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:20,509
But, er... this guy, he saved me.

311
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,095
I'm sorry.

312
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,889
Baldwin.

313
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,891
Linda.

314
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:32,896
Dinner. Yeah, no... Linda, I'm s...
Don't hang up, Linda. Just...

315
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,736
- Anything else you can remember?
- One thing.

316
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:44,908
This guy... I don't mean to be rude
or anything, but... he smelled funny.

317
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:46,826
Like day-old fish.

318
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,208
So that was your wife on the phone?

319
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,086
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Fair enough.

320
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,755
So are we in Orson Bailey
territory here?

321
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:01,841
I wouldn't rule it out,
which would give us what?

322
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:05,804
A telekinetic insurance salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year-old,

323
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,306
and now some kind of super vigilante.

324
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:12,185
- Hell of a trio.
- They're only the ones we know about.

325
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:14,813
Unless you can think of anyone else.

326
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,107
Just take it one case at a time.

327
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:21,194
Heidi, can you remember the formula
for an isosceles triangle?

328
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,531
Hey.

329
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:31,788
I'm probably not the best at this, but...

330
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:41,381
Oh!

331
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:04,977
- Richard?
- Lily. Thank God. Are you all right?

332
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:09,232
- I was worried sick. Where are you?
- I've been arrested.

333
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:18,199
Carl, I have my grandchildren
coming for dinner.

334
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:22,662
- How about some nice swordfish?
- You can't go wrong with swordfish.

335
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:26,040
- Carl!
- Give me a second, Burt. You got like...

336
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:29,710
What did I tell you about chatting
when work has to be done?

337
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:32,129
- Please stop with the finger.
- Stop?

338
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:34,507
I asked you not to do that.

339
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:36,717
Let go!

340
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:39,804
I mean it.
I show up on time. I do my work.

341
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:42,014
Now just leave me alone.

342
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,058
- OK?
- OK, OK.

343
00:26:57,405 --> 00:27:01,409
So... how much swordfish
are we talking here?

344
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:08,082
There's a lot of chatter in DC about
putting the 4400 back in quarantine.

345
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:10,376
Not that I agree.

346
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:15,840
If they're dangerous, how is cramming
them into one space going to be safer?

347
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,888
...so I took my pistol
and I shot her in the forehead.

348
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,932
Shot who?

349
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:29,729
Do us a favour, Tom,
sign the divorce papers.

350
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:32,231
Do me a favour, Dennis, stay out of it.

351
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,735
- I spoke to her.
- What are you doing talking to Linda?

352
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:39,655
I danced with her at your wedding,
now I'm not supposed to talk to her?

353
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:42,325
- I was in the middle of an investigation.
- Tom.

354
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,661
You asked her for dinner
and you stood her up.

355
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:47,788
It slipped my mind.

356
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:49,790
Maybe.

357
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:55,004
Maybe you just don't want
to admit the truth to yourself.

358
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,941
- Brian Moore?
- Yeah.

359
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,198
- I'm Richard Tyler, a friend of Lily's.
- You another one of those 4400?

360
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,075
Is that a problem?

361
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:27,828
Look, I told her to stay away,
but she wouldn't listen.

362
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:33,042
I understand you're upset,
but Lily's in jail. You don't want that.

363
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:37,463
What I want is a normal life
for my daughter, for my family.

364
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,550
- It won't happen again.
- I'm supposed to take your word for it?

365
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:46,555
I promise, if you drop the charges, she'll
never bother you or Heidi ever again.

366
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,728
You used to love her once, remember?

367
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:54,939
Yeah, I remember.

368
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,110
- I want you to stop.
- I can't!

369
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,320
What do you mean, "can't"?

370
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:04,740
What you're doing is dangerous,
not to mention illegal.

371
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:07,535
You can't just go around
beating people up.

372
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,955
I've been given an opportunity
and I'm going to take it.

373
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:15,042
I'll clean up that park
and then I'll clean up the neighbourhood.

374
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:19,463
Oh, God, you sound like a crazy man.

375
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,091
You promised me
you'd call your counsellor.

376
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:25,845
- I never said that. You said it.
- Tomorrow, I'm going to call him.

377
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,222
You'd call Homeland Security on me?

378
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:30,766
The way you're acting,
can you blame me?

379
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:34,186
What I'm doing here,
I'm doing for us, Grace.

380
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:38,315
This is where we live. I just want us
to be happy and not be afraid any more

381
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,276
and it starts with Bradley Park!

382
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:43,529
- I don't want it to end there.
- It won't. I won't let it.

383
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:46,365
They can't hurt me. No one can.

384
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,537
You're just one man.

385
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:57,209
I lost you once
and I don't want to lose you again.

386
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,798
I can do it.

387
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:06,302
I can make
this neighbourhood safe again.

388
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:12,099
For you, for Mrs Martino... even Burt.

389
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:17,730
So please stop worrying.

390
00:30:17,897 --> 00:30:21,150
This is what I was meant to do.

391
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,403
This is my destiny.

392
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:14,495
This was brand new when I disappeared.
And it's a... What do you call it?

393
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:16,705
Golden oldie.

394
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,916
I guess I'm a golden oldie, too.

395
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,502
No, not to me.

396
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:28,467
Hey, we have to talk about
what happened last night.

397
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:33,722
No, there's nothing to talk about.

398
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:37,476
Do you know what I saw when I looked
through Brian's window?

399
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:41,271
A happy family.

400
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:45,067
I realised Heidi doesn't need me.

401
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:54,034
- Maybe one day...
- I'll be there for her if she does.

402
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:59,998
But until then I'll stay away.

403
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:07,840
This is where I want to be now,
here with you.

404
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:12,761
Where I'm happy. And the baby's happy.

405
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:16,849
Well, that makes three happy people.

406
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,726
All you've done for me...

407
00:32:21,436 --> 00:32:25,899
...it's not because I remind you
of the other Lily, is it?

408
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,865
Maybe at first.

409
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,827
Now all I see is you.

410
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:08,233
- Danny's inside.
- I'm not here to see Danny.

411
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:25,584
Cute. Can you turn it back on, please?

412
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,378
Did Danny say something to you?

413
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:32,799
Is that why you're acting like his? Our
friendship has nothing to do with him.

414
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:39,848
Nikki, we don't have a friendship, OK?

415
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:43,143
Shawn, listen to me...

416
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,936
Ah! Ah! Ah!

417
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,356
Hey, hey, come here. Let me see it.

418
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:49,316
Let me see.

419
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:59,076
It's gone.

420
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:05,248
It doesn't hurt any more.

421
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:10,837
It must not have been that bad of a burn.

422
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,924
Yes, it was.

423
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:19,346
You did something to it, didn't you?

424
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:23,186
Tom. See, the thing about vigilantes
is that they're not very common,

425
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:27,482
except in Charles Bronson movies,
so I have to create my own profile.

426
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:31,986
Now, we know he's a white male,
slender, somewhere between 30 and 50.

427
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:34,197
He works a blue-collar job,

428
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:37,116
has low self-esteem,
lives in a high-crime area.

429
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,118
I'm with you so far.

430
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:42,330
I cross-checked my profile
with the members of the 4400

431
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:46,000
in and around the Seattle area
and I came up with 37 names.

432
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,419
You're not taking me through all 37.

433
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:53,216
Of those 37, I was able to eliminate 24.
I'm sure you don't care how.

434
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:57,095
- And that left me with 13.
- I'm on the edge of my seat.

435
00:35:57,261 --> 00:36:01,516
Here are my two favourites -
Robert Lorenzano and Carl Morrissey.

436
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:05,019
They both fit the profile,
but Carl, he's our guy.

437
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:07,897
Check out his occupation.

438
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,776
- Supermarket employee.
- Yeah, I called the store.

439
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:14,654
Carl works in the seafood section.

440
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:19,450
- And our guy smelled like day-old fish.
- Oh, yeah. I'm good.

441
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:34,715
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
I just cleaned that!

442
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:50,106
Come on!

443
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,860
We'd like to talk to your husband.

444
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,403
Why?

445
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,823
- Any idea where he was Tuesday night?
- He was here.

446
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,701
- You sure about that?
- I just told you.

447
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:05,121
Have you heard of
the "Bradley Park vigilante"?

448
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:08,207
What does that have to do with Carl?

449
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:13,254
You tell us, Mrs Morrissey.

450
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:18,009
You're not going to throw him
back into quarantine, are you?

451
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:20,595
- We want to help him.
- That's funny.

452
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:22,805
That's all Carl wants to do is help.

453
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:25,600
People grumble
but nobody does anything,

454
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:28,603
nobody tries to make anything better,
except Carl.

455
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:31,397
Where is he, Mrs Morrissey?

456
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,746
- Carl.
- Grace.

457
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:49,206
I got rid of all the graffiti.

458
00:37:49,373 --> 00:37:51,542
Oh, my God, Carl.

459
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:57,298
You should have seen it.
They were falling like bowling pins.

460
00:37:57,465 --> 00:38:00,968
I didn't see the knife.
I don't know why I didn't see the knife.

461
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:03,721
- This is Agent Baldwin...
- Get an ambulance!

462
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:07,099
Get an ambulance to
Bradley Park right away.

463
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:10,978
I thought I could clean the whole
neighbourhood up myself.

464
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:14,523
I thought that's why they sent me back,
but I guess I was wrong.

465
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,402
No, no, no, no!
No, don't leave me, Carl. Please.

466
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:21,197
No! No!

467
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:26,369
I just want you. I just... want you.

468
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:28,579
No.

469
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,973
Why give him extra juice to think he can
make a difference, send him back...

470
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,184
Only to get himself killed.

471
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:53,354
- What's the point?
- I wish to hell I knew.

472
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:03,364
The wife of slain
Bradley Park vigilante, Carl Morrissey,

473
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:06,909
revealed that her husband
was one of the controversial 4400.

474
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:11,205
Mrs Morrissey stated that her husband
was a true neighbourhood hero,

475
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:13,999
a sentiment echoed
by many area residents.

476
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,919
Law enforcement officials
and a spokesperson

477
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:19,672
for the National Threat
Assessment Command

478
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,050
refused to confirm or deny
Mrs Morrissey's statement.

479
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:41,694
That paperwork.

480
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:45,030
OK. I need you to sign there.

481
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:47,992
And there.

482
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,870
And initial here.

483
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:53,289
- And sign there.
- That's it?

484
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:57,084
You got Mr Ryland to sign the approvals,
that simplifies things.

485
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:25,404
- I thought you were one of the doctors.
- Yeah. I thought you were asleep.

486
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:27,823
So you sure fooled me.

487
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:33,245
- How would you like to get out of here?
- Now?

488
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,206
Right now.

489
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:58,479
Look out, look out, look out!

490
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:08,822
- Where's Kyle?
- Surgery.

491
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:14,328
Dr Mayhew said he's got some kind
of fluid building up in his skull.

492
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,747
They're trying to relieve the pressure.

493
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,665
What do you mean "trying"?

494
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:22,086
They said that draining the fluid
might not be enough.

495
00:41:22,252 --> 00:41:25,464
That more might build up and if it does,

496
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:29,760
then Kyle could suffer permanent
brain damage within a week.

497
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:37,601
Uncle Tommy, Mom's on the way.
