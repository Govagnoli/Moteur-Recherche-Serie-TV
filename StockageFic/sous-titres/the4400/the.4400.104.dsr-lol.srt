1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,067
Previously on The 4400:

2
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:09,934
We're not sure what's just happened.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,767
There appears to be something out there.

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,934
The light is gone,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,734
and, and thousands of people

6
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,534
have just suddenly appeared.

7
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,133
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
You two will be one of the teams

9
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,367
that's responsible for investigating

10
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:22,601
what happened to the returnees.

11
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,868
We're letting them go.

12
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,400
We're letting them go?

13
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:26,567
We don't have
a legal right to hold them.

14
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,667
Shawn!

15
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,801
Why disappear
a little girl from the 1940s,

16
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,567
hold her for 60 years,

17
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:33,901
and then send her back

18
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,000
with the ability to
predict the future?

19
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,767
What were they thinking?

20
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:37,968
"They"? We don't even know
if there is a "they."

21
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,367
Whoever sent them back, you're saying

22
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,901
they, they planned
for these changes to take place?

23
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:43,601
You're talking about
some kind of ripple effect.

24
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,400
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,

25
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:46,033
but I was when I got back.

26
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:48,601
You haven't told your counselor

27
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,167
about this, have you?

28
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,634
My foundation has an opening
in the security dertment.

29
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,000
If you're intereed,

30
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,367
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?

31
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:56,901
I'll be there.

32
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:59,501
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security refuses

33
00:00:59,567 --> 00:00:59,968
to divulge the names or the whereabouts

34
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,734
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.

35
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,133
What you do isn't journalism.

36
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,801
You're getting ithe way
of my job, Barbara.

37
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,167
Well, what are you going to do,
disappear me?

38
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,133
About last night...

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
The kiss?

40
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,501
And other things.

41
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,601
We've kind of got a lot to talk about.

42
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,300
I was reviewing Kyle's EEG readout.

43
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,000
It seems last Thursday night,
he had a momentary burst

44
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,801
of increased brain activity.

45
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:29,167
Shawn, did you do something to him?

46
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,834
Talk to me.

47
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,133
How long have I been in the dark?

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Kyle?

49
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:46,501
So far, the test results
have been inconclusive.

50
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,667
But there must be something
we're missing.

51
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,734
People don't simply
regain consciousness

52
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,934
after three years in a coma
for no reason.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Honestly, we don't care

54
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,968
why this happened, right, Tom?

55
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,434
We're just glad to have Kyle back.

56
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,501
You've been poking and prodding him
for more than a week.

57
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,067
When can we take him home?

58
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,567
I don't see why you can't do it now.

59
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:06,901
That's wonderful.

60
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:07,200
Well, there is something else.

61
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,701
Patients like Kyle

62
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,701
often have difficulty
adjusting to their awakenings.

63
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,934
They do best in environments
as similar as possible

64
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,968
to what those they were in
before their comas.

65
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:18,200
In every detail.

66
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,634
The places, the people...

67
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,868
Hey, come on.

68
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:25,200
Why are we here?

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,033
We thought you'd be happier at home.

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,234
Then why take me here?

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Kyle, this is your home.

72
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,934
And this is your room, Kyle.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,133
It's just the way you left it.

74
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,133
Okay.

75
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,501
Whoa, whoa, whoawhoa.

76
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,200
I got you.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,634
This isn't my room.

78
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,834
And this isn't my house.

79
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,367
Kyle, Kyle.

80
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,734
Kyle?

81
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,868
Wha-what are you looking for, buddy, huh?

82
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,601
What are you looking for?

83
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,234
Maybe we can help.

84
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,868
Kyle, Kyle, talk to us.

85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,734
What is he doing?

86
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:33,868
Whatever it is,

87
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,367
I say we just let him work it out.

88
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,167
But he doesn't recognize
the house, or his room.

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Linda, the doctor told us
he'd be disoriented.

90
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,868
I'm glad you're moving back in.

91
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,968
I'll try to stay out of your way
as much as I can.

92
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,334
Yeah.

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, come on, Jordan,
aren't you overreacting?

94
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:57,367
No, I'm not, not at all.

95
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,334
Publishing the names and addresses

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,701
of the 4400 - it, it's a crime, Barbara.

97
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,968
It's a violation of the, uh, privacy

98
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,534
of over 4,0 people, and whoever did it

99
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,200
should be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

100
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,601
So, you're saying

101
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,834
that warning people
that they might be living

102
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,667
next to a public menace
is a crime?

103
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't think...

104
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,701
We don't want an

105
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,667
Shawn, it's your uncle.

106
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,501
Let me in.

107
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,133
Uncle Tommy.

108
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,634
Hey, Shawn.

109
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,367
Come to take the to?

110
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,067
Quite a procession out there.

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,834
Yup. They started driving by the house

112
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:42,467
the day my address and
name swed up on the net.

113
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,400
And they haven't stopped since.

114
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,300
Yay for us.

115
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,567
Well, I know this is hard for you, Shawn.

116
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:53,200
I just... I just stopped by
to say thank you.

117
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
You know, we took Kyle home yesterday,

118
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,300
and, um, I'm gteful.

119
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,868
He's doing good, right?

120
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:02,367
Yeah. He's got a lot of work
ahead of him, but... he's awake.

121
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,367
Aunt Linda-- does she know?

122
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,567
About what I did, I mean?

123
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,701
No, I figured you wouldn't want that.

124
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,968
Truth is, Uncle Tommy...

125
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,734
I don't know what happened.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,567
I put my hands on him,
that's it.

127
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,000
He woke up.

128
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:27,267
He woke up, and I don't know why.

129
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,734
See, Shawn, this,
this thing that you can do--

130
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,267
whatever it is,
we need to learn more about it.

131
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,467
Well, how? How?

132
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,667
What, I could go
into quarantine again?

133
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,267
They can study me some more?

134
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:42,267
No, because I'm done with all that--

135
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,901
with the hypnosis and the dream journals

136
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,100
and the counseling sessions.

137
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,367
I hear, I hear you.

138
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,467
But I can be an ally.

139
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,434
Maybe I can help you.

140
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:57,534
I don't think so, Uncle Tommy.

141
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,334
That was some movie.

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,968
Biggest screen I ever saw.

143
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,534
A-d the sound, and all those, uh, uh...

144
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,100
Special effects.

145
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,200
Yes.

146
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,868
So, did you like it?

147
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,033
Not really.

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,901
But it sure did look good.

149
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,501
Down!

150
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,307
The genie is definitely out of the bottle

151
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,735
Three different bombings in one day.

152
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,435
Yeah, each targeting the 4400s

153
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,585
whose addresses were made public.

154
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,600
Wait a second.

155
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,967
Pipe bomb, tripwire trigger.

156
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,334
That's about as basic as you can get.

157
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,867
Amateur.

158
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:08,867
Diana, I just found part of the casing.

159
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,134
Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,301
It's beautiful.

161
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:22,334
Shawn's name is on that list.

162
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,101
I had my sister upgrade
her security system, but...

163
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,234
Yeah, I'm worried

164
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,267
about Maia, too.

165
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,633
You ever think about bringing her

166
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,434
back into quarantine
until this blows over?

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,167
Yeah, I've thought about it.

168
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,267
I've even talked it over with her.

169
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:39,834
She started crying.

170
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,434
She wants to stay with me, Tom.

171
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,834
I'm gladt's working out.

172
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,867
Who would have thought?

173
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,034
How's Kyle adjusting 
to being back home?

174
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,201
He's still pretty weak.

175
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,301
His memory's a mess,

176
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,134
but he's out of that damn hospital.

177
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:02,967
What's his doctor think?

178
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:05,734
He's stunned, just like us.

179
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,234
Look, it's a miracle.

180
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:10,767
I don't know any other way
of putting it.

181
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,967
What about Shawn?

182
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,167
What about him?

183
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:22,867
Where was he... when Kyle woke up?

184
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:27,667
I have no idea.

185
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,934
All three bombs so far were identical

186
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,301
in design and composition.

187
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,667
Pipe casings, tripwire triggers.

188
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,867
I did a chemical analysis
of the explosive.

189
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,600
It's homemade plastique
basically boiled down fr bleach.

190
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,834
You get the recipe on the Internet.

191
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,500
Just like the list of victims.

192
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,800
I'd like to get my hands on
whoever leaked those names.

193
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:50,867
Come on, Tom.

194
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,201
Who do you think leaked them?

195
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:52,700
Barbara Yates.

196
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:54,667
You're ...damn right it was Yates.

197
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,067
It's just her style.

198
00:09:57,134 --> 00:10:01,734
Cheap, inflammatory, and
dangerously irresponsible.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,934
I'll handle Yates.

200
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,800
Meanwhile, I want you two
to back-trace hits

201
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,368
on every website that
published these bomb recipes.

202
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:08,600
We'll have the results soon.

203
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,067
So will I.

204
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:15,500
You own this entire complex?

205
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,500
80 homes.

206
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,734
Once we have this place off the ground,

207
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,967
I'm planning developments
in Chicago and in Los Angeles.

208
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,500
I intend to provide a safe haven

209
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,867
for any 4400 in this country
who needs one.

210
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,167
We're opening a little
sooner than I had planned,

211
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,167
but the bombings have made that necessary.

212
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:33,301
You do think big, don't you?

213
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,334
I'm a businessman.

214
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,167
But I've been given

215
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,900
a second chance to do something

216
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:42,633
with my life besides make money.

217
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,967
Because right now,
that's just not enough.

218
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:48,201
Or maybe I'm just
having a mid-life crisis.

219
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,468
93 Tomberra Lane. What do you think?

220
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,867
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're all beautiful.

221
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,001
Well, it's yours.

222
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,767
You'll be our first official residents.

223
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:04,401
Oh, we can't afford a house right now.

224
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,667
Consider it a gift.

225
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:10,967
For the two of you, and your new baby.

226
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:27,567
It's a small world.

227
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:31,034
You did it, didn't you?

228
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:34,001
Kyle waking up?

229
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,867
That was you.

230
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:41,001
You fixed him,
just like you fixed my hand.

231
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:45,934
Have you told Danny?

232
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,867
No, and I don't want you to, either.

233
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,167
But maybe if he knew
what you d, he'd...

234
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,767
stop thinking of you as...

235
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:59,734
monster?

236
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I've been doing some thinking...

237
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:11,434
This thing between Danny and
me... maybe it was a mistake.

238
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,267
I don't want to hear this.

239
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,967
It's not your fault.

240
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,101
I mean that.

241
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,867
Danny's sweet.

242
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:27,334
I like him, but...

243
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,434
that's all.

244
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,101
Well, he more than likes you.

245
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,633
I know.

246
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,667
Dennis Ryland?

247
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,500
Yeah.

248
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,401
How are you doing?
I'm Warren Lytell.

249
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,500
I believe Home Sec in DC
mentioned I was coming.

250
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,468
Oh, yeah, they warned me.

251
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:01,234
Right. Well, they're never happy.

252
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,067
They seem to think your department

253
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,334
needs to be a little more aggressive

254
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,934
investigating the 4400.

255
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:07,134
I'm just here to see
if I can't nudge things along.

256
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,167
The authority to review
all 4400 case files,

257
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:17,167
access to all meetings
and briefing sessions,

258
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:20,334
permission to with field
agents at your discretion.

259
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:22,600
It's a pretty broad mandate.

260
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,167
Well, they're looking at five murders,

261
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,500
three unsolved bombings,

262
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:28,600
Barbara Yates bashing us
all over the airwaves.

263
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,934
It seems to them you could
use a little bit of help.

264
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:31,101
I suppose it could look that way
from a conference room in DC.

265
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:36,067
I gotta tell you, Dennis,
it looks that way

266
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,967
from everywhere except
this glass tower of yours.

267
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:41,334
I have a thousand returnees
within 75 miles of Seattle.

268
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,134
I've got about two dozen agents

269
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,700
to ride herd on all of them.

270
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:45,934
You want to help me?

271
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,667
Get me some more personnel.

272
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:53,067
You want to help me?
Get DC off my back.

273
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:56,767
But you're not really here to
help me, are you, Warren?

274
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:02,533
No. I'm here to clean up your mess.

275
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,700
The hell you are. Where'd they
recruit you from? FBI? NSA?

276
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,101
It doesn't matter where I came from.

277
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,700
How long you been in public service?

278
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:10,134
15, 16 years?

279
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,434
And suddenly you got a shot

280
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,767
at a command of your own.

281
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:22,767
Now you come and take it
from me... if you can.

282
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,667
Kyle, what's going on?

283
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,900
They're lies.

284
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:48,368
What do you mean?

285
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:52,767
These pictures. I don't belong in them.

286
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,134
These people. I don't know them.

287
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,567
No, no, no, of course you do.

288
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,101
Look, wait, wait, wait.

289
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,267
Look, th is you at the zoo

290
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,101
with Grandma Fran when you were eight.

291
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,667
Remember?

292
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,567
And, and, uh, and this is your 
birthday party when you turned ten.

293
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,234
You remember George?

294
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,368
He was my friend.

295
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,334
That's right. That's right.

296
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,301
That's right. And Freddy,

297
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:16,934
Freddy, you have to remember Freddy.

298
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,234
Freddy was over here all the time
when you were little, remember?

299
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,934
Bugs Bunny.

300
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:22,234
That's right.

301
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,767
Exactly, the kid was crazy
about cartoons.

302
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:25,767
Don't, don't.

303
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,301
Don't touch me.

304
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,267
I'm sorry. I-I'm trying to help.

305
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,700
It's not my memory. You're my father.

306
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,934
I recognize you, but I
don't know who you are.

307
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,567
It's like you' a stranger.

308
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:53,567
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

309
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,867
Kyle, look. Just look at me.
Just look ate.

310
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:57,567
Just look at me. I need... I need...

311
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:57,967
Just look at me.
I need... I need help.

312
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,834
I want to help you.
I want to.

313
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,834
Why can't you help me?

314
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,401
I'm trying. I'm trying.

315
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,667
I'm trying.

316
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:16,300
Yeah the ripple effect.
What about it?

317
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,834
Every time we stop by the Theory Room,

318
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,467
you and Marco are always
talking about how every case

319
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:20,968
we work, there's a ripple effect.

320
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,434
Yeah, every case
but the Friday Harbor murders.

321
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
But what if these bombings
are that ripple?

322
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,934
The thing we couldn't figure out
about Knox is he went

323
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,400
from killing prostitutes
before his disappearance

324
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,734
to killing just random
women once he came back.

325
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:36,133
What if they weren't random?

326
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,601
at's interesting.

327
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,734
Yeah, we should start
looking into Knox's victims.

328
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,834
See if we can find out
some kind of connection there.

329
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,601
I can't condone these bombings,
but I do understand the fear

330
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,068
that motivates them.

331
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,834
The easiest way to stop
these acts of violence

332
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:54,534
is to put the 4400
somewhere out of harm's way,

333
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:58,334
someplace safe for them and for us.

334
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:02,633
Now, I know to some of you that
may sound harsh, heartless even.

335
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,967
And I assure you I don't mean it to be.

336
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,767
Just as I assure you
that there are those

337
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,568
among the 4400 who would jump

338
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,733
at the chance to find sanctuary...
Truck's ready to go.

339
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,334
Won't be happy till we torch them all.

340
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,600
They can all burn in hell.

341
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,434
Hey, I was listening to that.

342
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm sick of listening to it.

343
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:22,201
She's on our side, man.

344
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,633
That woman is a parasite, all right?

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,134
She doesn't give a damn about us,

346
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,401
or that our sister was murdered

347
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,134
by one of those 4400 bastards, okay?

348
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,934
Why don't you go unload
the fertilizer, huh?

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,501
And leave the air filter on.

350
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,401
These damn fumes are killing me.

351
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,700
Kyle? Kyle?

352
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:54,167
Hey. Mm. Hey.

353
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:03,434
It's good to see you, man.

354
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:05,900
What are you doing...

355
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:11,934
what are you doing
sitting out here in the rain?

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,468
What are you staring at?

357
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,534
Listen, you're looking pretty good.

358
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,934
The way your folks talk,

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,401
I thought you'd be some kind of zombie.

360
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,667
They w't leave me alone.

361
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:36,267
Asking me questions,
staring at me all the time.

362
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,600
They're just glad to have you back.

363
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,434
My mom did the exact same thing to me.

364
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:46,367
My parents had you
come here, didn't they?

365
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,900
To try to make me remember?

366
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:51,733
No, Kyle. Hey...

367
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,334
I'm going inside.

368
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,501
I've got reading to do.

369
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,667
You've got reading to do?

370
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,367
Kyle.

371
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,434
Comen, man, I just gotere.

372
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:11,101
Look at you.

373
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:14,401
I could have bought a car in my
day for the price of this suit.

374
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,468
How's it going?

375
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,234
Ah, we got a lot of work to do.

376
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,501
Five families moved in today.

377
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,067
Seven more by the end of the week.

378
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:24,234
Got a half a mile
of property line to shore up.

379
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:29,134
The fences are too short,
overhanging trees along the perimeter.

380
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:29,468
Along the perimeter?

381
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,434
Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:31,600
Well, as long as you're on the job

383
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,034
I feel safe, and so does the baby.

384
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:38,167
Two happy residents. That's a start.

385
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:44,878
It has been a crazy day. No.
Myssistant's out.

386
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,487
My phone sheet is, it's a mile long.

387
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:47,834
I never got to the end of it.

388
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:48,989
Anyway, I...

389
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,007
Ms. Yates,

390
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,434
Dennis Ryland would
like to speak with you.

391
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:01,167
Dennis. What a pleasant surprise.

392
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:06,700
Well, this is a bit
theatrical, don't you think?

393
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,334
Read this.

394
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:09,234
What is it?

395
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,900
It's a story. A good one.

396
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,301
About the 4400?

397
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,667
No, about a TV talking head

398
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,201
that was involved in an automobile
accident last year.

399
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:18,468
A hit and run, actually.

400
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:25,334
It was really ugly.

401
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:28,633
The pedestrian she hit
died instantly.

402
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,800
It was a shame.

403
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:34,000
Just 40 years old, father of three.

404
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,101
No wonder she spent so much
money covering it up.

405
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:44,134
So, you blackmailing me, Dens?

406
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,201
I shut up about the 4400

407
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:46,633
and this envelope goes away
in a vault somewhere?

408
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,301
Not good enough, Barbara.

409
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:54,667
What do you want me to do?

410
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,600
It's too late for you to do anything.

411
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,800
I gave you a chance and you refused.

412
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:07,700
Steve Smizik from the DA's office
wants to talk to you.

413
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:12,034
He's gonna charge you with
vehicular manslaughter,

414
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,900
among other things.

415
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,434
Look, face it.

416
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Shutting me up

417
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,767
is not gonna make the 4400 disappear

418
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,134
from the headlines.

419
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,501
And eventually, they will
cost you your job.

420
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,600
We'll see.

421
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,967
Good-bye, Barba.

422
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,867
Do you really think
this is the wisest move

423
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,867
to make under the circumstances,
Mr. Collier?

424
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,367
All these 4400s
in the same place?

425
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,568
You're a hell of a target.

426
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,367
There are always potential dangers,

427
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:02,534
but that's why I hired the security team.

428
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,367
Mr. Tyler, I know you're trying
to protect your family,

429
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,568
but you have to realize

430
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,000
that by staying here

431
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,934
you could be putting
urself in serious danger.

432
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,301
Maybe.

433
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,468
But you know, I was born in 1922...

434
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,534
in Missouri.

435
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,434
And my skin was as black then

436
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:20,534
as it is now.

437
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,401
So I've had to worry about fire bombings

438
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,434
and lynchings and beatings
my entire life.

439
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:27,900
If there's anything I learned, it's this:

440
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:31,967
eventually, a man's got to take a stand.

441
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:34,334
I'm making mine right here.

442
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:41,900
* To your old friend *

443
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:42,067
* You don't want to know *

444
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:51,501
* How do you then *

445
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:55,501
* Come back *

446
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:59,334
* To your new friend *

447
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,967
* When you don't nt to leave? *

448
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:08,301
* Crazy times ahead *

449
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:14,134
* Kee me running every day... *

450
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:17,600
Because he had a sprained ankle.

451
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:20,234
The other side.

452
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,334
Maia.

453
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,468
How'd you do today?

454
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,501
Miss Skouris, can we talk, please?

455
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,600
Well, give us a sec, can you?

456
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,334
I know I'm late again...

457
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:30,434
Please just understand.

458
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.

459
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,134
It's... We have to consider

460
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,101
the safety of the other students.

461
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,600
Has Maia been a problem?

462
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,767
No, not at all.

463
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:40,967
Maia's lovely.

464
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,834
But it's the bombings.

465
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,034
With Maia's name on that list,

466
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,667
we can't risk having her here at school.

467
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,534
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,934
I understand.

469
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry, Maia.

470
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,834
We'll, we'll find someplace else.

471
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,000
I promise.

472
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,401
It'll be okay.

473
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,767
No, it's not okay.

474
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,867
It's wrong.

475
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:06,700
No, I mean...

476
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:10,201
Someone's coming
who'll make everything better.

477
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:14,334
We just have to wait a little longer.

478
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,067
Oh. It got too warm.

479
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,334
Come on, let look pretty.

480
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:36,234
Well, don't you want
to look pretty?

481
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,934
That's better.

482
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,834
Is that a blasting cap?

483
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:12,467
It's a commercial detonator,

484
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,301
which means it'll be
a lot easier to trace

485
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:15,433
than a bottle of bleach.

486
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:15,667
We need to send it to the lab.

487
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:19,400
We need serial numbers, lot numbers.

488
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,034
A purchaser would be nice.

489
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,533
What do you have on the victim?

490
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,368
Uh... Mary Deneville, 27 years old.

491
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,634
The flower shop is her father's.

492
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,334
She disappeared in 1999,

493
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,101
but picked up her life
right where she left off.

494
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:33,634
Until today.

495
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,700
Are the 4400 that frightening to people?

496
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,001
I mean, are we just too close,
so we don't see it?

497
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,134
Something like this isn't fear.

498
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:46,201
This is hate, pure and simple.

499
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:52,533
Baldwin.

500
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,533
Right now?

501
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,001
What?

502
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,567
We have to go in.

503
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,533
Nikki?

504
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,767
Shawn.

505
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,967
There's something I need to tell you.

506
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,533
I know.

507
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,001
I saw you and Danny talking yesterday.

508
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:29,467
I just... want to make one thing clear.

509
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,700
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.

510
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,767
Okay?

511
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,201
Okay.

512
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:41,368
Did you ever feel like you just...

513
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,467
wanted to get away
from your life for awhile?

514
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,334
I did that for three years.

515
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,600
I don't recommend it.

516
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,368
You know what I mean.

517
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,700
Yeah.

518
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,834
Find a quiet place

519
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,201
where you can pretend that...

520
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,433
things are simple,

521
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,533
that nobody's angry at you,
or hurt... or sad.

522
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,034
I know just the spot.

523
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,600
Come on, I'll take you.

524
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,067
Yeah?
Yeah.

525
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:19,700
Ok.

526
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,234
I've been studying your case files.

527
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:28,067
Now, you're the first investigative
team that I've talked to,

528
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:30,767
but it seems like you two are the
right place to begin.

529
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,334
Where do you want to start--

530
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,500
Orson Bailey, Oliver Knox?

531
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,268
How about Maia Rutledge?

532
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,700
Age eight, disappeared in '46.

533
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,001
Well, what about her?

534
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,467
Well, it says in here
that her foster parents

535
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,967
returned her to quarantine,
no reason given.

536
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,234
Then there's all these reports

537
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,400
of her making predictions--

538
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,667
ones that come true.

539
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:52,867
Next thing you know,

540
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:54,934
she's been removed from quarantine

541
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,400
by one of our field agents.

542
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,101
I believe it goes on to say
"for further study."

543
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,634
But you haven't filed any
other reports, though, have you?

544
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,167
All of this was approved by Ryland.

545
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:07,034
I, uh, I don't see what the problem is.

546
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:09,800
Next case - Shawn Farrell, age 17,

547
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,268
disappeared in April of 2001.

548
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:15,268
It's a little thin, isn't it, Tom?

549
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:16,800
Why don't you accuse us

550
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,533
of whatever it is you're going
to accuse us of

551
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,667
and let us get back to work?

552
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,800
You two are good field agents,

553
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,567
but it was a mistake
to allow two people

554
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,268
with such obvious conflicts of interest

555
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:29,767
to remain on the 4400 investigation.

556
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,634
This is not a conflict of interest.

557
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,767
It is a unique perspective.

558
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,800
It is a window into these people's lives.

559
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,368
You have a gang task force,

560
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,001
you want people on
it who know gangs.

561
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,834
Same thing here.

562
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,433
We know the 4400 better than 
any other agents in the country.

563
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,001
That's why we belong on these cases.

564
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:44,400
That's a nice spin.

565
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,268
Is this what Ryland thinks?

566
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:46,467
Is that who you're after - Ryland?

567
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:49,800
You know what's ironic?

568
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,500
The Northwest Division 
used to be a backwater.

569
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,067
It was given to Ryland like

570
00:28:58,134 --> 00:28:58,368
a pat on the back
for a career of good service.

571
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,901
A nice quiet place where he could ride out

572
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,067
his last few years before retirement.

573
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,500
But his free ride ended
the night the 4400

574
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,400
showed up by that lake.

575
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:14,101
Now, there's going
to be a change around here

576
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,734
whether you like it or not.

577
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,533
You can either be part of it,

578
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:20,201
or you can get swept aside.

579
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,734
Lily Moore is here to see you.

580
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,734
Send her in.

581
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:35,634
Lily.

582
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,201
What can I do for you?

583
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:40,334
Um... yeah.

584
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,867
Chilean sea bass?

585
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,934
Tenderloin medallions?

586
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,467
Lobster sushi?

587
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:45,800
Jordan, I-I just asked
if I could use the common area

588
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,834
for our support group meeting.

589
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,767
I didn't mean for you to... cater it

590
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,134
like a black tie dinner.

591
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,567
Lily, people want to eat,

592
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,800
whether they're wearing tuxedos
or not.

593
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:59,134
It's going to be a really emotional night.

594
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,967
I mean, these people are like me.

595
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,767
Their mily reunions
didn't turn out as planned.

596
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,201
It's all paid for.

597
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:12,101
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a bit of a control freak?

598
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:14,134
Once or twice.

599
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:16,433
Or that the way you throw money at people

600
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,234
might make them question
what you want in return?

601
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:23,834
That sounds awfully serious.

602
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,834
Lily, if I've done anything

603
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:27,667
to make you uncomfortable...

604
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,034
Oh, it's just, um...

605
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,800
you go so far out of your y

606
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:32,467
to make sure I'm taken care of.

607
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:37,101
You give me more than I've thought about

608
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:37,268
or... asked for or neede

609
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:45,433
You know I'm in love with Richard, right?

610
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:50,800
Lily Moore, you are a blunt woman,

611
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,834
and I find that attractive,

612
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,134
which I know was not your intent.

613
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:55,500
Look, why would I try
to break up you and Richard?

614
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,867
One, I smart enough to know I'd fail.

615
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,567
Two... I just tould never do that.

616
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,500
Lily, thanks for coming by.

617
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,867
And I hope your support group
enjoys the lobster.

618
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,400
Yeah, it's the William Wayne
Construction Company.

619
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,134
That's who bought the blasting caps.

620
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,301
Okay, good.

621
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:19,600
Check their employee list

622
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,167
with the names we found
from the Knox case.

623
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:22,400
Yeah, I'm already onto it.

624
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:22,867
I'll call you back
if I find your ripple.

625
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:25,967
Thanks.

626
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:27,067
How is he?

627
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:29,201
You better see for yourself.

628
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,967
What are you doing, buddy?

629
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,867
I'm looking.

630
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,734
For what?

631
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,334
For me.

632
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,600
This is the spot?

633
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:10,600
Yup. Me and 4,399
of my closest friends

634
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,600
popped out of a ball of light
right about here.

635
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:16,301
It's so pretty.

636
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,734
I wonder why they sent you back here.

637
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,101
I mean, why not on the White House lawn,

638
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:27,134
or... in the middle of Times Square?

639
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,268
I don't know.

640
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:30,301
Maybe they just appreciate
a good view.

641
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:31,767
You think?

642
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:32,101
I have no idea.

643
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,334
You're such a jerk.

644
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,634
What, you're just
figuring that out now?

645
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,134
Hey, let me see this.

646
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,467
What are you doing?

647
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:46,001
Doctor's follow-up. Just...

648
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:48,034
It looks good.

649
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,001
* I want to make you feel beautiful... *

650
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:58,467
I keep thinking you're still 14.

651
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,834
* I know I tend to get so insecure *

652
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,034
I'm not.

653
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:07,201
I know.

654
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:10,167
* It doesn't matter anymore *

655
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:14,834
* I don't mind spending every day *

656
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:19,600
* Out on your corner in the pouring rain *

657
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:24,201
* Look for the girl with the broken smile *

658
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:27,901
* And ask her if she wants to stay a while *

659
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:30,533
* And she will *

660
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,567
* Be loved *

661
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:35,134
* And she will *

662
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,433
* Be loved*

663
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,901
* And she will *

664
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,301
* Be loved *

665
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,667
* And she will *

666
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,201
* Be loved... *

667
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:16,067
Tom? I found something.

668
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:28,033
What do you got?

669
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,367
Gone.

670
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,634
We got fertilizer.

671
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:34,401
And tire tracks.

672
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,534
They got a truck bomb.

673
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,100
The tire prints matched up
to phone company service trus.

674
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,167
So, we pulled their personnel records

675
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:47,033
and found one Dean Keating.

676
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
Keating?

677
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,000
As in Gayle Keating,

678
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:50,267
Friday Harbor murder victim?

679
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:52,267
Dean's her older brother.

680
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,567
Not only that,

681
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,701
Gayle's younger brother Glen
works construction,

682
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,267
and on his last job, the company

683
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:57,567
wound up short two dozen blasting caps.

684
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,567
So, one of the returnees
kills their sister,

685
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:02,167
and these guys get their revenge.

686
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,167
Yeah, and the 4400 go from being a threat

687
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,567
to being sympathetic victims.

688
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:08,900
The ripple effect.

689
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,167
All right,

690
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,067
put out an A.P.B. on the Keating's truck,

691
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,300
and you better not let that truck

692
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,434
get to where it's going.

693
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,367
Come on, come on, where are you?

694
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:25,467
Mr. Tyler, we're
looking for a truck mb.

695
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,434
You need to be on high alert.

696
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,900
Understood. Thanks.

697
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,567
We're running out of tim

698
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,868
There - truck number 85.

699
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,667
That vehicle's assigned
to Dean Keating,

700
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,933
and it's headed north on...

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,534
Aurora...

702
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:40,801
heading into Richmond Highlands.

703
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:42,868
We need a list of all the 4400s

704
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:43,334
in Richmond Highlands.

705
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:47,467
There's only one 4400 living in that area.

706
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:48,534
It's Tom's nephew.

707
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,734
Tom, hold up.

708
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,801
Operations, patch me through
to that phone number again.

709
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,534
This is the Farrell residence.

710
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,534
We're noin.

711
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:02,967
You know the drill.

712
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,134
Susan, Shawn, Danny, it's me again.

713
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,033
If you can hear this,
get out of the house now!

714
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,601
Is anyone there?

715
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,134
There it is, the number 85.

716
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,467
Get us down, now!

717
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:31,534
Put your hands
where I can see them! Now!

718
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:34,734
Get out of theruck!

719
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:38,701
Get your hands where we can see them!

720
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,234
What the hell? Shut up! Stay down!

721
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:45,300
You're not Keating.

722
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:46,534
Where's Dean Keating?!

723
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:47,300
He didn't come into work today.

724
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,267
No explosives!

725
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,067
The truck's clean, Tom.

726
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:51,900
They switched vans!

727
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:52,933
He's not Keating!

728
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,334
Come on! Let's go!

729
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,200
We got the wrong van.

730
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,200
Recheck all principal targets.

731
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,601
Report anything suspicious.

732
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:25,967
We got a twelve-foot step van

733
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:28,434
parked near Collier's housing complex.

734
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:29,634
No plates, new paint job.

735
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:31,234
That's what the phone company uses.

736
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,834
Patch us through to Collier's development.

737
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,434
Use any line you can find.

738
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:36,701
Nothing. All the phones are dead.

739
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:45,401
Code red, main gate.

740
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:54,634
There they are.

741
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:55,100
Get me over there.

742
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,534
Go!

743
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,601
Set it! Go!

744
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,768
Hands on your head!

745
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,267
Hands on your head!

746
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,100
Down, down, wn, down!

747
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,401
On your stomach, now!

748
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,167
You're being arrested as a terrorist.

749
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:28,000
You will be treated as an enemy combatant.

750
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:28,200
You do not have the right to remain silent.

751
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,434
You do not have the right
to an attorney.

752
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,667
And whatever you say will
damn sure be used against you.

753
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,467
Dr. Mayhew?

754
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:07,134
I'm Warren Lytel from Homeland Security.

755
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,801
I need to ask you a few questions

756
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:10,834
about Kyle Baldwin.

757
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,567
Tom? Tom, you have to come.

758
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,067
You have to come quick.

759
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:16,801
Just come on.

760
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,567
Kyle...

761
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:40,834
what are you doing?

762
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,834
I know what's wrong with me.

763
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,900
I finay understand.

764
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:49,100
What is it, Kyle?

765
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,367
Tell me.

766
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:55,033
There's only onexplanation.

767
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,134
Why I remember everything,
but can't feel anything.

768
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,701
Why all the people in my life
seem like strangers.

769
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,967
They're not the strangers.

770
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,401
I am.

771
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,933
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
