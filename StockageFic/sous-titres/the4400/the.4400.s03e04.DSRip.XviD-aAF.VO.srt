00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,140
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,040
All at once they were returned

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,970
With no memory of where they've been

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,650
They haven't aged a day

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,260
And some have returned with new abilities

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,550
All are trying to reconnect....

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,900
...with a life interrupted

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,600
We're not a threat.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,300
We're salvation.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,700
The worldwill have to deal with us.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,400
Previously on the 4400...

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
this is isabelle.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,100
You are the stewards of the future.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,700
Your daughter is the rosetta stone

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,600
for understanding what happened to the 4400.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Are you my mother?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,500
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
The only way for you to live is for me to die.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
Don't you understand who you are,

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,400
what you're here to do?

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
P.I....

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
promicin inhibitor.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
We did it to them,tom.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,000
We made them sick.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
We are in a war.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
This is a message from the nova group.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,400
The second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,900
You think I'm just going towrite you a check?

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
I need it tomorrow.

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,100
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked right in here and attacked the place.

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there all with abilities?

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,200
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
in case the government ever came after us again.

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
You lied to me,daniel.

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,900
You never said anything about killing people.

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,700
You sold us out.

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,900
You're a hero.

41
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm tyler.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,300
Maia.

43
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Where are we?

44
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,300
This is where they altered us...

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,700
gave me the ability to create the world we've
been living in for the last eight years.

46
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
People see her,they see a woman,

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
and they might forget that,inside,

48
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,500
she's just a little girl.

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
You are ticklish.

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Cut it out.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
It bothers me.

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
It bothers you?

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,700
It didn't seem to bother you a few minutes ago.

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,900
I could hold you like this.

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh,you could hold me like this?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Really?

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,900
What about that?

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,900
don't answer it.

60
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,300
I have to.

61
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm still the boss around here.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
Richard,hey.

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Sorry to bother you.

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,400
I was waiting for you down in your office.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh,you know...

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,300
yeah,sorry.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I'm just running a little late this morning.

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,100
What's up?

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Before lily...

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,600
um,before she passed,

71
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.

72
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
The healing work you do was really
important to her.

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,500
I remember.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm glad to have you aboard.

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
What do you need?

76
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,700
A better head for numbers.

77
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,400
I've been trying to decipher these
financial reports.

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
There's some pretty big cash payments.

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,500
You signed the transfers.

80
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,900
I figured you might remember what they were for.

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,600
no idea.

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm sorry,no idea.

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,500
Just checking.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
See you soon.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,700
Maybe we should tell him.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
No,no,I don't think so.

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,500
We just...

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,900
we've just got to be more careful
from now on,okay?

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
Okay.

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Thank you for doing this,thomas.

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,100
I know an open house at the center
isn't your favorite sunday activity.

92
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
Hey,I love a good barbecue.

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,000
You've been spending a lot of time here.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
If this place is important to you,

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,800
it's important to me.

96
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't believe you,

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
but I love you for saying it,

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,800
and don't be nervous.

99
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Everyone here's going to love you,too.

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
So help me out here,tom.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
You say you love alana,

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
and yet she's a 4400,

103
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,100
and you're an ntac agent.

104
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I mean,if I were you,

105
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,700
and I really loved her,

106
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
well,I'd quit that job.

107
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,200
First of all,you're not me.

108
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,900
You don't know anything about me.

109
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
You don't know anything about this relationship,

110
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,400
and frankly,I doubt you know much about ntac.

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,900
you did almost kill us all.

112
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Thanks for the input,ryan.

113
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,900
Nice chatting with you.

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I am so sorry,thomas.

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
He's usually not that rude.

116
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
We've been here an hour.

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
I've had four conversations like that.

118
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,800
You think we can call it a day?

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,500
Alana?

120
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,900
I didn't realize your thomas was tom baldwin.

121
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,800
Remember me?

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
Heather tobey.

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
Nice to see a friendly face.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
How are you?

125
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
I couldn't be better.

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Tom was my hero.

127
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,300
you mean heather was one of your assignments?

128
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
about eight months ago.

129
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
********

130
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,700
Heather,you seem great.

131
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you up to?

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,700
I teach at the school here now.

133
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
It's a good match,huh?

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
Finally found a place where they won't run me
out on the rails for being a 4400,

135
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
and now alana and i are going to be
working together.

136
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Isn't that cool?

137
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I've been offered a job working with
the children at the school.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
But I haven't decided if I'm going to take it yet.

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
I blew the surprise,didn't I?

140
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,900
So help me out here.

141
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Who's amy again?

142
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,400
Is she a 4400?

143
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Everyone in my class is a 4400.

144
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
She wants me to come over tomorrow.

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,700
********

146
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
Oh,it's not?

147
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,600
Well,I guess when you put it like that,

148
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
then there's no way i can say no.

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,700
Where's your sweater?

150
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,900
I left it upstairs.

151
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Quickly run and get it.

152
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,600
It's freezing by the water.

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,500
We're going to miss the ferry.

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
You're going to forget me.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,300
Excuse me?

156
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,500

158
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,900
Maia,do you mind explaining that,

159
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,500
because,frankly,it sounds a little creepy.

160
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,000
It's okay.

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
It's not your fault.

***

163
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,600
I would never forget you.

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,900
Not ever.

165
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Come on,you know that,don't you?

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll be right back.

167
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Okay.

168
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Maia,come on.

169
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Come on,sweetie,

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,900
we're going to miss the boat,literally.

171
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Maia,come here right now.

172
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,100
Mommy,it's okay.

173
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,000
-It's fine--
-who the hell are you?

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
How did you get in here?

175
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,900
I'm so sorry.

176
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,100
I didn't mean to upset you.

177
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,900
I was just knocking on your door
when maia came upstairs.

178
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
It's so great.

179
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,300
Tell her.

180
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
Tell me what?

181
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,600
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.

Sara rutledge.

183
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm maia's sister.

185
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,000
He was my dog.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,100
I know.

187
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,200
He slept on your bed,every night,

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,900
right until he died.

189
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,700
You really lived in my house?

190
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,100
22 white oak lane,crescent city.

191
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
My room was at the top of the steps.

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,600
I know.

193
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,900
It was always your room.

194
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,400
Mom and dad kept it all the same,just for you.

195
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
They missed you so much.

196
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Maia,I need you to give me some time alone
with sara.

197
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
Did daddy teach you to play poker?

198
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
We played for tootsie rolls.

199
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,300
Maia...

200
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,600
I think your mom needs a word with me,sweetie.

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't mean to sandbag you.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,300
I was going to leave a note.

204
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,800
**********

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Every phone number out of date,

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,400
every letter comes back "return to sender."

207
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Guyana,the ivory coast?

208
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
I've been hard to find.

209
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,500
**********

210
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,100
Which,I'm guessing,is...

211
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,500
is why you never told maia about me.

212
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm sorry,

213
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,800
what was I supposed to say?

214
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,300
"Sweetheart, you have an older sister,

215
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,900
"but it doesn't seem like she's terribly
interested in meeting you?"

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,900
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,200
I should have called first.

218
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,300
I just felt like i needed to do this in person.

219
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
I just want to know her.

220
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,500
That's all.

221
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
You think it's that easy?

222
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,400
There are a lot of people to get close to a 4400.

223
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Until you can prove to me that you are
who you say you are,

224
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
you're not seeing my daughter again.

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
*******

226
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm willing to take a dna test.

227
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,900
It's a good start.

228
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
You didn't even tell me you were thinking
about teaching,

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,300
that the possibility existed.

230
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,900
To be honest,I was avoiding it.

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,500
I know how you feel about the center.

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,100
*********

233
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,900
They're not fine with me.

234
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
What about your gallery?

235
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,900
I can still do all the buying,

236
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
and tina can handle sales.

237
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Okay,I'm sorry if this seems just-- sudden.I...

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
I told them about my ability at the center,

239
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,300
and they thought they could use it at the school.

240
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
You're going to use your ability?

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,300
Don't you think that's why we came back here
with these gifts?

242
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,900
To help other people?

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
No,it sounds great.

244
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,900
I just didn't think that...

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
I mean,does it even work with other people?

246
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I did an experiment with heather.

247
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,800
We went to paris for lunch.

248
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,400
Don't worry,

249
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
I don't think my batteries run out.

250
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,800
I'll save my best work for you.

251
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,900
I promise.

252
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,800
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our...

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,900
experiment,I guess you'd call it.

254
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
We've never tried a healing this large,

255
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,500
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.

256
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Before we begin,

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,900
I'd like to say that this foundation was
started by my late wife,lily tyler.

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,700
I'm proud to be carrying on her work.

259
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
She's the reason why we're all here today.

260
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,800
her,and the man i'm about to introduce to you...

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,300
shawn farrell.

262
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Thank you.

263
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay

264
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
,first off,

265
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,900
kids,

266
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I promise this is not going to hurt.

267
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,800
listen,I'd like to ask everyone here a favor.

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
When you leave here today--

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
and you will be leaving the hospital today--

270
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
please tell anyone that asks

271
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,900
that a 4400 made you better,

272
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,600
**********

273
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,100
because we're not bogeymen.

274
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,500
We're here to help.

275
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,300
So...

276
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,500
let's get this thing started.

277
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,400
Traitor!

278
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,100
You betrayed your own kind.

279
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,500
Next time it won't be paint!

280
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
You okay?

281
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
It's in her file.

282
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,200
Maia's parents had a baby five years after
she disappeared,

283
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,900
and her name was sara.

284
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,400
so it is possible.

285
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,500
No word at all for two years,

286
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
and then she just shows up?

287
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,500
You think she's the real deal?

288
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
I don't know,maybe.

289
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,600
What does your gut tell you?

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,500
it tells me that she's not going to see
maia again

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
until the dna tests comes back.

292
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,900
Smart gut.

293
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Her name is lindsey hammond.

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,100
She disappeared on november 23,1979.

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,800
You know,just once,

296
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
I wish a 4400 would smile for their picture.

297
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Is that too much to ask?

298
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Since her return,

299
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
she's been living with her stepfather.

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Until yesterday,that is.

301
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,900
What,she's missing?

302
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
her stepfather thinks she ran away.

303
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,000
Take a drive out to her house,

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
see if we need to be worried.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
That just came in.

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,700
***********Wasn't random.

307
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
Somehow you've become a target of the nova group.

308
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,900
Any idea why?

309
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,900
Two months ago...

310
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,100
someone called me.

311
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,900
They were trying to raise money to start
a defensive wing of the 4400.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,300
I made a couple of contributions.

313
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
You gave money to the nova group?

314
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Shawn,they murdered half a dozen people.

315
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,900
That was after.

316
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
Do you really think i would have given them money

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
if I thought that they were going to hurt anybody?

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,300
When they came back asking for more,

319
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,700
I said no.

320
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,300
You got the money from the foundation,didn't you?

321
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,500
That's what all those signatures were for.

322
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,000
You diverted money from my wife's foundation
to a terrorist group?

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,300
Richard,it was a mistake.

324
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,000
I know that.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Don't you think I know that?

326
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll serve to you.

327
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,900
We have to try to keep it going for
as long as we can.

328
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Okay?

329
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,900
Maia...

330
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,400
where's maia?

331
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,300
She's at a friend's house--

332
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,000
a girl from the class. Why?

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Preliminary dna came back.

334
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Negative match.

335
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Sara isn't maia's sister.

336
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,900
Where's maia?

337
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,300
They're in the yard.

338
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,900
I-is everything okay?

339
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,900
Maia!

340
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
She left.

341
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Where did she go?

342
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,800
She went with that lady, her sister.

343
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,600
Her picture's already on the wire.

344
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,700
An amber alert's been issued.

345
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,800
We'll find her,diana.

346
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I know we will.

347
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.

348
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,100
We're monitoring every toll booth,

349
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
every intersection we can.

350
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
If sara shows up on any of them,

351
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
we can be there in minutes.

352
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,100
You're going to keep an eye on things
yourself,right?

353
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,700
you got it.

354
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,800
Okay.

355
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
*******

356
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
What did the lab say?

357
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,100
Nothing good.

358
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
They ran the fingerprints from your apartment,

359
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
and the dna samples against every known database.

360
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,400
No names came up.

361
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,000
So she has maia.

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,900
We have no idea who she is.

363
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
No.

364
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
She said i was going to forget her.

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Mom really kept my room just like I left it?

366
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Sure she did.

367
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,500
She always believed that you were going
to come home.

368
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Maia,can I ask you a question?

369
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Do you see the future more clearly since
you stopped taking the inhibitor?

370
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
at first,I couldn't control it.

371
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,800
I thought i was going crazy,

372
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,600
but now i can see the future,

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
more when I want to.

374
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,300
It doesn't really sneak up on me anymore.

375
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,600
Not much,anyway.

376
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
That's great.

377
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
You're learning to focus your ability.

378
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,500
What if I asked you to predict something
right now?

379
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Wait.

380
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,700
We can go now.

381
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,600
You are a very special girl.

382
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,900
What do you think?

383
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,700
This is your house?

384
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,300
I bought it so I can stay in seattle.

385
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
We've spent enough time apart,

386
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,900
don't you think?

387
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Come on.

388
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Let me show you the inside.

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
There's a surprise.

390
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,900
my gosh.

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
It's just like my old room.

392
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,100
I told you mom kept it the same.

393
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Else how would I know?

394
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Sorry to interrupt--

395
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,500
hoping i could have a word?

396
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,900
Matthew...

397
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,700
come on in.

398
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,900
What's on your mind?

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,900
I was brought into this organization
by jordan collier.

400
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,900
I didn't always know what he had
in mind for it,

401
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,300
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.

402
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Six months after i came aboard,he died.

403
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,800
My new boss was a 19-year-old boy.

404
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,400
This is about shawn?

405
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,300
He's overwhelmed,richard.

406
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,400
Running this center requires substantive
decisions,

407
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,800
decisions that he's not qualified to make.

408
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,900
Now,you,on the other hand,

409
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,100
you were an officer.

410
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,400
You led men into battle--

411
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
stop.

412
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Shawn runs things here.

413
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,800
I am not interested in a palace coup.

414
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,200
I am not talking about getting rid of him.

415
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm talking about power sharing.

416
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,900
The two of you make decisions together.

417
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
It's a way of helping him,

418
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,800
giving him the benefit of your experience.

419
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
This is all very flattering.

420
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm not trying to flatter you.

421
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm trying to keep this movement alive.

422
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,700
Think about it.

423
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,100
And before you say no,

424
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,400
I want you to tell me,

425
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,900
could you,under any circumstances,

426
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,700
see yourself inadvertently funding
a terrorist attack?

427
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Look familiar?

428
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,500
Maia's been drawing it a lot the last few days.

429
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,200
Are you sure?I mean,it's all through
the margins of her journals.

430
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,300
I've never seen it before,

431
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,900
but she likes butterflies.

432
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
It might just be a doodle.

433
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,900
Did you find anything else,

434
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,600
anything we can use?

435
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,200
It's hard to say.

436
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I mean,it's all stream of consciousness.

437
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,000
You know,predictions about big events
right next to tiny things in her everyday life,

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
and there's no dates.

439
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I did find out how I'm going to die.

440
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,900
that was interesting.

441
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh,don't worry.

442
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,300
It's actually kind of cool.

443
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
,she did mention a friend's house.

444
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Just referred to the mom,though,mrs. Paspalis.

445
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,100
Amy paspalis?

446
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,700
That's the house she was taken from.

447
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
Great,show us that page.

448
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,500
Spooky.

449
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I could spend the rest of my career
working on these things.

450
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,900
Come on,marco,just...

451
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
here.

452
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,200
********

453
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
But I'm already gone."

454
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm in a circle with tyler downing."

455
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,800
Tyler downing?

456
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,600
Isn't he a 4400?

457
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
He goes to school with maia.
1
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,920
I told you,
I didn't do anything to maia.I swear!

458
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,040
Look,nobody thinks
that you did anything.

459
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,340
I just need you
to try and remember.

460
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,170
Now,did she ever talk to you
about a circle?

461
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,650
Did she ever mention XXXXXXXXXXX

462
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,470
no,I said already 10 times.
I'm not lying--

463
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,350
ma'am,I know you're worried about your kid.

464
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,930
You're scaring the crap out of my brother.

465
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,210
Diana...

466
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,370
there's nothing here.
There's no sign of maia or the woman.

467
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,620
"I'm in the circle with tyler downing."
Tyler's here,so where is maia?

468
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,330
I don't know.Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.

469
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,030
Is it a street? Barnaby circle?
There's a circle park--

470
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,760
well,we need to check them all,
because she's trying to tell me how to find her.

471
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,730
sara...

472
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,830
is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?

473
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,170
Sara?

474
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,530
Sara,the door won't open.

475
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,930
Sara?

476
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
You can yell
all you want.

477
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,640
She won't come.
She never does.

478
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,480
Who are you?

479
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,310
I'm lindsey.

480
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm a part of her collection.

481
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,990
We all are.

482
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
Now you are,too.

483
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,950
All of us are 4400s.

484
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,780
What is she
going to do to us?

485
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,520
Sell us to the highest bidder,
do experiments,I mean,who knows?

486
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,320
It doesn't matter.

487
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,700
We're not going to let it come to that.

488
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,150
Hello?

489
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,860
That was incredible.

490
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,150
Hi.

491
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,610
Oh,hi,thomas.I didn't hear you
come in.

492
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,310
Any word about maia?

493
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,590
Sorry to invade your house,tom.
Alana and i were just practicing.

494
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,830
I think I might take that job at the school.

495
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,450
Heather and I were just trying something.

496
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,620
Don't be shy about it.

497
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,540
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.

498
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,820
We just watched richard nixon fly away
from the white house after he resigned.

499
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,170
That's remarkable,huh?

500
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,780
Well,alana's an amazing woman.

501
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,080
She certainly is.

502
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,770
Are you all right,thomas?

503
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,980
Fine.I'm just...

504
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,590
I'm just worried for diana.

505
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,730
She's strong,
and so are you.

506
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,490
After heather leaves,XXXXXXXXXX

507
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,640
it might calm you down some.

508
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,270
No,I think I'm just going to
go to sleep,

509
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,180
hit the investigation fresh
in the morning.

510
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,840
So things are going well
between you and shawn?

511
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,650
Yeah,I think so.
We're having lots of sex.

512
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,690
Has he said
"I love you" yet?

513
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,760
No.

514
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,100
Do you think he should have?

515
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,490
Try this.

516
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,200
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.

517
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,180
Men can do things with their bodies
entirely unrelated to their hearts and minds.

518
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,890
Shawn likes me.
It's real.

519
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,720
Good.

520
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,690
Shawn's going to be having
a difficult time these next few days.

521
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,180
He's going to have
some decisions to make.

522
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,290
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.

523
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,560
You want me to use him?

524
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,480
Use him?

525
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,230
What does that even mean?
You're getting close to shawn,right?

526
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,580
So he'll value your advice.

527
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,470
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.

528
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,350
I guess.

529
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,420
- What do you want me to say to him?
- Just the truth.

530
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,650
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.

531
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,320
It's not a sign of weakness.
It's a display of strength.

532
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,000
Wear that.

533
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,010
Hey,kid...

534
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,720
you have to try
to be quiet,okay?

535
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,870
I just want to go home.

536
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,500
We all do,but crying is not
going to help.

537
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,750
Listen,we can do stuff.
They can'T.

538
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,910
That's why they want us,
but maybe we can use it against them.

539
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,340
Maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.

540
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,160
Everyone,tell me
what you can do,okay?

541
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,690
My sister and me,

542
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,150
we can make water move.

543
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,780
Back and forth.Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.

544
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,520
- Diffusion.
- Yeah.

545
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,950
We have to be together to do it,though.

546
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,800
What about you,kid?

547
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,760
I do stuff with electricity.
Currents.

548
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,090
I can make machines
in my kitchen stop working.

549
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,970
Okay,good,
that will come in handy.

550
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,140
I can see things,

551
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,450
things that are going to happen.

552
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,210
Really?
That's awesome.

553
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,800
Can you tell if they're going to
keep us here?Are they going to let us go?

554
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,440
Come on,tell us.

555
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,780
We're not going to be here long.

556
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,240
Why,do we get to go home?

557
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,150
I don't think so.

558
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,640
Sorry I asked.

559
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,270
Listen,I don't know
about the rest of you,

560
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,500
but I'm going to try to figure out a way
to get us out of here.

561
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,100
So are you guys up for it?

562
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,050
No,let me go!
Stop! Let me go!

563
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,840
Stop it!
Let me go!

564
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,070
Help me!
Let me go!

565
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,690
Help!
Stop it! Let me go!

566
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,150
No!

567
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,950
Tyler downing wasn't home when his sister
got back from her waitressing shift last night.

568
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,360
My god,that's the third
4400 kid missing.

569
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
No,try five.

570
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,880
Olivia and duncan germaine's parents thought they
went on a camping trip with their youth group.

571
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,250
Turns out they never showed.

572
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,430
Tom,update me here.
What are we doing to find this woman?

573
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:32,320
Well,maia's journal said
she was inside the circle with tyler downing.

574
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,540
We've checked out every street
with the name "circle" in it.

575
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,440
Skyline circle park, circle theater
on first hill. And there's nothing yet.

576
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,410
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.

577
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,190
We've already looked.

578
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,180
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in denny park.Maybe there.

579
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,090
It's over here.

580
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,980
Hey,I thought
you could use a jolt.

581
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,590
Thanks.

582
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,250
Didn't get
much sleep last night.

583
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,640
Any,actually.
This helps.

584
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,540
You were up all night?

585
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,770
You should go lie down
in the theory room for an hour.

586
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,950
Tom...

587
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,210
diana,
you all right?

588
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,270
Look.

589
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,670
"I'm in the circle..."

590
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,220
I don't believe this.

591
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,100
I tell you the truth...

592
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,620
and you use it
to kick me out.

593
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,810
No,shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.

594
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,500
You've got an impossible job.

595
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,420
Jordan collier left me in charge
of this place.

596
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,490
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.

597
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,580
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.

598
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,330
The center has a board of directors,
shawn,

599
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,510
and collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.

600
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,630
They approved it because that's what
jordan wanted,matthew.

601
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,600
Frankly,if jordan was here,
his thoughts on succession might change

602
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,210
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the united states government.

603
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,950
You've made yourself,and this place,
a target for terrorists.

604
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,760
Shawn...

605
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,750
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,

606
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,300
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.You need help.

607
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,120
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.

608
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
- I am.
- Really?

609
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,630
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.

610
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,950
Tyler,you have to talk to us.

611
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,070
No.

612
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,340
If we get out of the house,
can you make it so their cars can't start?

613
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,710
No,I'm not helping.

614
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,570
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl? They took her away.

615
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,580
- I don't want to go away.
- You will.

616
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,580
We all will if we don't do something.

617
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,290
Lindsey...

618
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,950
lindsey,are you okay?

619
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,930
Who are you?

620
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,000
What did they do to you?

621
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,500
Maia,do you want to come with me,please?

622
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,540
No.

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,100
It's okay,sweetie,it's not so bad.I promise.

624
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,150
Help!

625
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,770
Tyler! Duncan!Please!

626
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,540
Somebody help me! Help!

627
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,750
Seattle pd has the south edge.

628
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,980
We'll take center and work east.

629
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,260
It'd be nice if I knew what we were looking for.

630
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,380
A message.

631
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,650
A sign.

632
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,360
Anything.

633
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh...

634
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,100
do you like this?

635
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,200
You're seriously asking?

636
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,710
I knew you would.

637
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,360
I picked it out just for you.

638
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,690
Green's your favorite color,isn't it?

639
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,600
I can tell.

640
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,180
I know you now.

641
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,930
Isabelle.Isabelle...

642
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm not really ready for another
round right now,okay?

643
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,910
What are you so worried about?

644
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,430
If you don't want to share your job,don't.

645
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,160
What are you talking about?

646
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,210
I can do things,shawn.

647
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,640
Lots of them.

648
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,220
I figure out more every day.

649
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,880
If you want to keep your job,you can.

650
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,870
I can make it happen.

651
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,890
You can do whatever.

652
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,370
Who's going to say different?

653
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,120
Thanks,I guess,

654
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,720
but,uh...

655
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,750
just hold off on the air strikes,okay?

656
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,850
We're talking about your dad
and matthew here.

657
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,960
It's just an argument.

658
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,680
They're not the enemy.

659
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,550
Besides...

660
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,810
they do have a point,don't they?
I did screw up.

661
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,910
Okay.

662
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,810
Just so you know,it's your call.

663
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,080
Drink this.

664
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,160
It'll make you feel better.

665
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,410
You're frightened.

666
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,720
It's all right,I understand,
but you don't have to be.

667
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,100
We're not going to hurt you.

668
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,190
Soon,you won't even be worried anymore,
I promise.

669
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,290
These are just to relax you.

670
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,810
They'll help you get ready.

671
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,760
Now,drink up,okay?

672
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,570
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.

673
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,050
No.

674
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,770
Maia...

675
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,120
They're doing it.They're helping.

676
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,200
We'll take dexter south,swing around
for another pass.

677
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Wait,tom. Stop. Stop!

678
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,440
What?

679
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,730
Those butterflies.

680
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,180
XXXXXXXXXXX

681
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,050
She's here.

682
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,040
Maia...

683
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,470
what is going on?

684
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,370
Don't move!

685
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,220
Please.

686
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,310
Please,this house is for sale.

687
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,010
All the valuables are gone.

688
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,860
Is this a dream?

689
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,830
No,honey.

690
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,740
Remember the first time you were
taken away from your parents?

691
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,750
This is where we brought you.

692
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,300
No.

693
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,120
This isn't real.

694
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,010
Yes,it is.

695
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,330
We've brought you back.

696
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,850
You've been here ever since you
walked through the front door of my house.

697
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,750
You're in the future.

698
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,000
We had to bring you here,maia,
you and your friends.

699
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,560
We need your help.

700
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,710
XXXXXXX

701
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,630
The 4400 haven't changed the timeline.

702
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,430
The catastrophe,it's still coming.

703
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,530
We've found a way to fix it.

704
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,810
You and your friends,

705
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,070
you're going to save us all.

706
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,780
We found it all.

707
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,750
The circle,

708
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,870
the butterflies...

709
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,850
she's here.

710
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,020
I mean,she has to be here.

711
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,450
Come on,I'll take you home.

712
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,750
Here.

713
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,090
Sign here.

714
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,370
Thank you,shawn.

715
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,310
I know this wasn't an easy decision.

716
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,760
We all want the same things,

717
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,270
you're a good man,shawn.

718
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,100
It's an honor to be working with you.

719
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,640
Why are you giving this to me?

720
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,170
It's a thank you.

721
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,760
You did well.

722
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,310
Everything went smoothly with shawn.

723
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,000
I disobeyed you,matthew.

724
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,960
I told shawn he should keep his job.

725
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,210
I disobeyed you,and you know what?

726
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,960
Nothing happened.

727
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,390
There wasn't an earthquake.

728
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,780
I didn't melt.

729
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,600
I used to be scared of you,

730
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,010
but I don't think you have any
power over me at all,do you?

731
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,790
I didn't think so.

732
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,810
I'll do my own shopping from now on,okay?

733
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,330
Okay,sweetheart,we're ready to begin.

734
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,770
Don't cry.

735
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,400
You and the other children we took,

736
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,840
we tested your abilities,
and you are so special.

737
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,270
That's why you were chosen.

738
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,100
Now...

739
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,760
here's what's going to happen.

740
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,530
We're going to put you all back--

741
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,740
not the same year we took you from,
but earlier,much earlier.

742
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,230
We calculated wrong the first time.

743
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,280
We have to try again.

744
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,060
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.

745
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
I don't care.

746
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,590
I don't want to go anywhere.

747
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,640
I want to stay with my mom.

748
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
I know.It's hard.

749
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,870
I can make the pain go away.

750
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,010
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother,

751
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,980
marco,and your friends.

752
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,610
Please don'T.

753
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,930
They'll forget you,too.

754
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,320
It's better this way.

755
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,690
There'll be no sorrow,no pain,no loss.

756
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,810
As far as the world is concerned,

757
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,530
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1946 and was never found.

758
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,390
That's a lie.

759
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,440
My mom won't ever forget me.

760
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,950
She will.

761
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,890
It's happening already.

762
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,210
Now...

763
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,520
just lie still.

764
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,630
All the hope we have rests with you.

765
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,560
No...

766
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,800
don't do it,please.

767
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,430
Mommy!
