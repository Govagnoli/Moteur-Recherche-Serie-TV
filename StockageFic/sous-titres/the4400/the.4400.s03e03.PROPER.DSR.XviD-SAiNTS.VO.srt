1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,420
Over the last 60 years 4400
people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,690
All at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,120
With no memory of where they've been

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,140
They haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,060
And some have returned with new abilities

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,900
All are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,080
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,520
(缺一句)

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,600
Previously on the 4400...

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,610
lily,are you all right?

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,950
- Where's my wife?
- What are you talking about?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,370
Mr. Tyler,when your wife fainted this morning,
she was a young woman.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,020
When she woke up less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,890
Are you my mother?

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
(缺一句)

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,770
I understand there was an incident this morning.
You attempted to harm yourself.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,530
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand who you are?

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,670
What you're here to do?

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,860
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,760
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin,

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:26,010
and then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

22
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,070
That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,330
When she hit this place,T.J. Drove every man
in the building into a homicidal rage.

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,670
Ever since we took them off the inhibitor,

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,720
they're either developing new abilities or
they're refining the ones that they've got.

26
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,220
(缺一句)1

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,360
(缺一句)2

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,400
You sold us out.

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,380
I don't guess we'll be seeing
her in court any time soon.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,520
This is a message from the nova group.
We are the defensive wing of the 4400.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,170
Today,the world has seen what happens to
those who try to harm us.A new era dawns.

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,080
Hi.

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,260
Need your auxiliary rounds as well,
agent baldwin.

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,660
Oh,yeah.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,190
Of course.I forgot,ian.Thanks.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,550
- You can go in.
- Great.

37
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,140
Hi,T.J.

38
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,140
What do you want?

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,740
Dr. Burkhoff?

40
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,140
I have your prescriptions.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,310
Hello?

42
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,370
Say something if you're here.

43
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,180
Don'T.

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,490
Please.

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,890
I've been having migraines.

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,700
How severe?

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,780
Bad enough.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,590
Don't worry.They're just headaches.
I've been getting them for years.

49
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,830
7:45.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,750
You're just in time for my wake-up call.

51
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,860
(前面还有)How many a day are you up to now?

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,870
Six.

53
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,090
You've doubled your dosage?

54
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,400
I thought you weren't going to do that

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,870
we're talking now.

56
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,820
Look,I'm training my body to
produce a new neurotransmitter.

57
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,350
And I guarantee you i'm not the only one trying.

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,040
The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability,
an arms race began.

59
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Someone is going to produce a promicin serum

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,720
that will cause non-4400s to develop
extraordinary abilities.It will happen.

61
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,990
The only questions are who's going
to do it and who's going to control it?

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,630
Hopefully someone with a highly
developed sense of responsibility...

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,180
and some judgment.

64
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,490
Let me ask you--

65
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,330
in your day-to-day affairs?

66
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,580
Do a lot of them hold
high-ranking government posts

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,150
or sit on the board of
giant pharmaceutical companies?

68
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,540
Dr. Burkhoff...

69
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,420
I knew that you had some...

70
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,680
personality quirks,
but I never pegged you for a cynic.

71
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,790
I can't afford to have a charitable view
of human nature.There's too much at stake here.

72
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,880
If these experiments cost me
some headaches...some sores...

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,300
I'd say that's a price worth paying.

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,480
Wouldn't you?

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm here,right?

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Holy mother--

77
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,320
why are we doing this?

78
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,130
Everything I'm telling you,
it's all in my file.You know it already.

79
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,990
Relax,T.J.

80
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,410
I just think it's important we review
everything you've told the government so far.

81
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,400
Have we?

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,850
Yes.

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,120
(前面还有)That's everything I know.

84
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,340
Okay.

85
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,610
Thanks for your cooperation.

86
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,130
We're just trying to consolidate information.

87
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,840
You'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy.

88
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,610
Yeah,well...

89
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,780
I hope you don't expect me to say "you're welcome."

90
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,250
What are you doing?

91
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,550
What,this?

92
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,630
It's nothing.(后面还有)

96
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,740
Get geared up.We're leaving in two minutes.

97
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,930
What for?What's going on?

98
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,870
Your partner registered to
see T.J. Kim this morning.

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,700
When tom left the interview room,
T.J. Was dead.

100
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,570
- What?
- Two gunshot wounds to the head.

101
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,870
Apparently,tom snuck a small firearm
into the interrogation room.

102
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,900
By the time the guard went into the room and
found T.J.'S body,tom had already left the building.

103
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,850
- We're going to pick him up right now.
- Wait,wait.

104
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,320
This is tom we're talking about here.
There's got to be some explanation.

105
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Maybe T.J. Used her ability on him.

106
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,290
No,she had concentrated promicin
inhibitor pumping through her veins.

107
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,800
We've tried to contact tom,
but he hasn't been picking up his phone.

108
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,080
We need to get him in here
just let me talk to him first.

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,420
He trusts me.

110
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,100
Now,this is tom.

111
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,670
Come on.We owe him that much.

112
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah,okay.

113
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,910
I wasn't trying to drown myself.

114
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,900
I don't even know if I could.

115
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,350
Okay.

116
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,840
Isabelle,I just thought that after
everything that happened with lily--

117
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,130
shawn...

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,990
this has nothing to do with my mother.

119
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,700
I was teaching myself to swim.

120
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
In your clothes?

121
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,960
Well,I never wore a bathing suit before.
I didn't know what to get.

122
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,620
And I'm too old to ask for help.
It's embarrassing not knowing how to swim.

123
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,280
Everybody's got to learn sometime,isabelle.

124
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,930
I learned when I was a kid.

125
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,860
But I never was a kid.

126
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,260
That's why I never learned how to swim,
or how to drive,or ever went out on a date.

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,670
I keep reading about all these...
rites of passage.

128
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,460
Like stuff everyone goes
through before they grow up?

129
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah.Yeah,but I am grown up...

130
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,160
and I missed out on all of it.

131
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,690
It's not fair.

132
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,080
I've got to catch up,
so I made a list.

133
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,190
(缺一句)

134
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,710
Well,isabelle,
there's a pool at the center.

135
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,680
I could probably teach you the basics.

136
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,200
Really?

137
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,660
Thanks,shawn.

138
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,990
Dad?

139
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,060
How old were you when you learned how to swim?

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,140
(缺一句)

141
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,920
You want me to teach you?

142
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,430
Shawn said he'd do it.

143
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,110
(缺一句)

144
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,670
Well,just make sure he doesn't
throw you in the deep end right away.

145
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,400
That's what my grandmother did to me.

146
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,430
Look,isabelle...

147
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm going to be gone overnight.
If you need anything,see shawn.

148
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,970
Where are you going?

149
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm going to take your mother home.

150
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,430
I'm putting her to rest.

151
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,180
Well,can I come with you?

152
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't think so.

153
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,860
I'm flying,and...

154
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,680
I don't think you're ready to
be away from the center yet.

155
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,000
You want to be alone with her
when you say goodbye,don't you?

156
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,730
Yeah,I guess I do.

157
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,390
- Tom.
- God!

158
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,630
You scared the hell out of me,diana.
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,500
Why is your gun out?
What the hell is going on?

160
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,400
Jarvis is on her way over.
She's got everyone with her.You need to come in.

161
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,500
What are you talking about?

162
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,480
You shot T.J. Kim this morning.

163
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,870
- What?
- You don't remember?

164
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,580
Don't remember?I didn't shoot anybody.
I've been here all morning.

165
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,710
Can someone confirm that?

166
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,260
No.No.I was supposed to have a
conference call they canceled,though.

167
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,010
Look,I took a half a personal day,
diana.I went jogging.I wasn't at work.

168
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,020
You got to stop saying that,
because two dozen people saw you there.

169
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,370
Now,I don't know what's going on.

170
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,140
Maybe you're blacking out,like kyle did.

171
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,140
Maybe it's something else.

172
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,160
Maybe it's like some 4400 ability.
I mean,I don't know,but...

173
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,140
(缺一句)1

174
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,770
and what happens if I do?
I get arrested for murder?

175
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,230
You know,we'll figure it out,okay?

176
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,940
Everyone wants to help you.
You just--you just have to come in.

177
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,610
You mind if I get dressed first?

178
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,260
Sure.

179
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,840
Are you sure you remember
everything you did this morning?

180
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,770
There's no time gaps or anything?

181
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,790
You didn't take a nap?

182
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,720
Tom?

183
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,860
Tom??

184
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,390
Damn it.

185
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,540
Yeah,hi. It's me.He got away.

186
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,740
I-I don't know how.
They only sent one agent after him.

187
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,570
Look,sorry.He got away.

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,970
What?

189
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,690
No way. He's an ntac agent.
They'll be expecting that.

190
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,570
Okay.

191
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,620
You're right.This has to happen.I'll do it.

192
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,140
I was letting him get dressed.

193
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,600
I didn't think he would jump
from a second story window.

194
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,430
Well,obviously,you underestimated
your partner's resolve.

195
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,730
Does he still seem blameless to you?

196
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know.Look,

197
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,560
it was a really bad call,
and I take full responsibility.

198
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,940
I've alerted local law enforcement,the fbi.

199
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,730
I've told them that tom is wanted for
questioning in connection with a murder.

200
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,720
He's a fugitive now.

201
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,400
Oh,don't give me that look,diana.
I had no choice.

202
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,270
Sorry.

203
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,730
- It's tom.
- Yeah.

204
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,740
Tom?

205
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,350
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

206
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,640
Where are you?
- (缺一句)

207
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,560
I believe you.But you have to come in,
and we can figure out what's going on.

208
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,900
No,I'm not going to jail.

209
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,440
No one's going to put you in prison.

210
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,670
They did it to my son,diana.

211
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,170
Was it really him that pulled the
trigger the day jordan collier died?

212
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,190
He's incarcerated.(缺一句)

213
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,360
You're a fugitive,tom.

214
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,290
Every police department in
washington is looking for you.

215
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,320
Some local cop wants to be a hero,spots you,
you know how these things can end.

216
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,270
(缺一句)

217
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,210
Look,dig around,diana.There's got
to be some evidence that will clear me.

218
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,630
Just...help me find it.

219
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,020
Did he give you a location?

220
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,060
Marco,help me out here.

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,260
If you were trying to prove that your partner didn't
commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did...

222
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,720
where would you start?

223
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,720
Well,I guess I'd start by pretending
that my partner wasn't involved.

224
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,460
Okay,just think of it like any other case.

225
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,370
What's the first thing you do when you start?

226
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,250
Well,look at the evidence.

227
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,630
I mean,there's a dead body,
there's the gun that tom left behind,

228
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,440
and there's a bunch of
people that saw him here.

229
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,330
Well,they've got security cameras
down in the detention ward,right?

230
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,550
You're serious?You're really
asking me for all that footage?

231
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,990
Of course I'm serious.
Is that a problem?

232
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,590
Well,it's just...

233
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,050
I gave all the tapes to him,
like an hour ago.

234
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,380
what are you talking about?
I haven't been up here all day.

235
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,660
What is this,a joke?

236
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
Marco,come on.

237
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,130
You were just here.You signed for
all the footage from the detention ward.

238
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,920
This isn't so hard.

239
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,100
That's because i haven't let go yet.

240
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,300
All right...I'm going to move my hands.
Are you ready?

241
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,920
No,not yet.I'm kind of comfortable.

242
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,950
You're kind of comfortable?

243
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm freezing.

244
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,030
I don't know what's going on.
This pool's supposed to be heated.

245
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,510
- Want me to make it warmer?
- You can do that?

246
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,250
I think so. Hold on.

247
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,640
How did you do that?

248
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't know.How do you heal?

249
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,080
It's not the same,isabelle.
Healing's one thing.

250
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
That's what we can all do--one thing.

251
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,860
Not me.I guess I'm different.

252
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,120
Shawn.

253
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,740
Sorry to barge in.

254
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,730
We're scheduled to brief the board of directors.

255
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,190
- That's starting now?
- Five minutes ago.

256
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,280
They're on hold.

257
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,560
Psst.

258
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,080
Alana.

259
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,620
What are you doing here?

260
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm in trouble.

261
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,770
My bosses at ntac,
they think i did something.

262
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,260
I need you to come with me.

263
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,350
- What are you talking--
- I don't have time to explain.

264
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,770
Thomas!

265
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,500
- Hello?
- Alana,I'm right down the street.

266
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,480
I need you to come meet me.

267
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,170
Honey,I'm in trouble.
Everyone thinks I killed somebody.

268
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,040
Who is this?I know it's not thomas.

269
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,550
What are you talking about?

270
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,740
I'm looking at thomas right now.

271
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,100
Honey,listen,that's not me.

272
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,070
The man you're looking at,
he can impersonate me somehow.

273
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,730
I don't believe you.

274
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,530
He walked into ntac and
he shot someone this morning.

275
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,660
Alana,he's dangerous.Get away from him.

276
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,760
Alana,listen to me.

277
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,520
Your mother's middle name is madeleine.

278
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,970
You wanted a dog when you were a kid,

279
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,330
but your parents gave you a bird instead,
a parakeet named charlie.

280
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,120
Listen,we made love last night.
There were two candles burning.

281
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,550
Just hold on.I'll be right there.

282
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,310
Did I have a dog when I was a girl?

283
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,400
I don't have time for this.

284
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,880
- What are you doing?
- What's going on,tom?

285
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,880
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

286
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,550
- Where is he?
- He just ran through the back.

287
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,260
Hey!

288
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,550
Did you see a guy come down this alley?
He looked exactly like me.

289
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,470
- I didn't see anybody.
- (缺一句)

290
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,150
He's gone.

291
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,590
He's gone.

292
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,280
What do you mean?
He just ran out a few seconds ago.

293
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,710
There was no one here.Just some kid.

294
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,390
It was him.

295
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,440
It had to be.I had him.

296
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,980
Had who?What kid are you talking about?

297
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,370
The one who's impersonating me.

298
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,500
The guy who's framing me for murder.

299
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,100
He looked like you.He sounded like you.

300
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,000
He was standing as close as you are right now,
and he had me completely fooled.

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,700
(缺一句)

302
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
At least we know what's going on now.

303
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
He's a 4400,isn't he?

304
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
Somehow he can pass himself off as you.

305
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,100
Yeah. I'm not sure how.

306
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,400
I mean,maybe he's got some
kind of optical camouflage.

307
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,600
He can convince your brain you're
talking to whoever he wants you to see.

308
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
He's a boy.Why would he want to kill anyone?

309
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,400
Not just anybody.

310
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,400
T.J. Kim,I mean,think about it.

311
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,200
You get rid of the one member of
your cell who could testify against you,

312
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,900
you compromise a government agent,and ntac,

313
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,600
the one agency that's trying to hunt you down,
is wasting their time chasing one of their own.

314
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,100
Alana.

315
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,500
You might want to get in here.

316
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,800
There's all kinds of people
flashing badges everywhere.

317
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
They said they're ntac agents.

318
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Look,stall them.I want you to go home.

319
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,600
I want you to lock the doors,
and don't open it until this is all cleared up.

320
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
If I need to get ahold of you...

321
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,900
I'll use a password.

322
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,900
How about "death in venice"?

323
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,400
Your favorite book.That's a good choice.

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,900
Listen,shawn,thanks for letting me come in here.

325
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,100
I just didn't know where else to go.

326
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,100
Look,you guys must have
a database of 4400s here,right?

327
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,500
I need to get a look at it,here.

328
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,400
I can pull it up on my laptop for you.

329
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
This might take a while.
You mind if I let myself out?

330
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
There you go.

331
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,700
You know,uncle tommy,
you can stay here if you want.

332
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,900
I might take you up on it.

333
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,400
All right...

334
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,400
but hey,you get the couch.

335
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
Okay...

336
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
kidneys,huh?

337
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,900
That explains the blood in the urine.

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
Kevin,we had a deal.

339
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,500
I was going to help you through this as
long as it wasn't compromising your health.

340
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,800
Well,guess what--

341
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm calling the hospital.

342
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
But they won't let me take my shots.

343
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Oh,no.

344
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
You're done with your shots.

345
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,100
I know we had an agreement,
and I'll honor it.

346
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,400
Just let me show you something before you call.

347
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,400
What happened to your fingernails?

348
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,900
Uh,they fell off.

349
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,400
Dissolved,I guess you'd say.

350
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
If you're trying to change my mind,
you're not doing a very good--

351
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,000
Kevin...what the hell did you just do?

354
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,780
Kevin,you've developed a 4400 ability.

355
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,680
It's getting there.

355
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Doesn't always work?

356
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,300
I was nervous about that.

357
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,700
It's fun to drive fast.

358
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,100
Yeah.

359
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,100
All that information
about compression rates

360
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,800
and gear ratios just
seems completely irrelevant.

361
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,700
Well,you're not driving home.

362
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,200
Get out of there.

363
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,100
You're lucky you didn't
wrap my car around a pole.

364
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Is there anything on this list
of yours that involves,you know,

365
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
a little less risk of bodily harm?

366
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,600
We could have sex.

367
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,100
Come on.You have a big bed.

368
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,600
Whoa,isabelle,hey...

369
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,900
uh,no.

370
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,000
Why? It's on my list.

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,200
It's an important rite of passage into adulthood.

372
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,100
It'll be fun.I was good at driving.

373
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,700
(缺一句)

374
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,100
I don't know.

375
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
For one thing,your dad would kill me.

376
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,900
Why?I'm an adult.

377
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,400
Well,you are and you aren'T.

378
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,100
Let's just say he has a right to
have an opinion on the matter.

379
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
I don't know,isabelle.I feel like
I'd be taking advantage of you.

380
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
But I want to.

381
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Well,I'm flattered.I really am.

382
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,900
But I just don't think you're ready to
make that decision.We barely know each other.

383
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,500
I know you better than I
know anyone else in the world.

384
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
That may be true.
It's still not going to happen.

385
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,100
Lessons with isabelle going well?

386
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,900
They're not lessons,
and it's completely innocent.

387
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Do me a favor and don't ask about them again.

388
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
- This is skouris.
- His name's boyd gelder,diana.

389
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,400
He's a 4400.I know where he lives.

390
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Where who lives?Who's boyd gelder?

391
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,200
The kid who's doing this.

392
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,500
And not just imitate.

393
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,400
He can be me.
At least make you think he's me.

394
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,400
He lives with his mom.
I'm in schenley park.It's right by his house.

395
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,300
Well,can you wait for me?
I'll be 15 minutes.

396
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,100
I'll wait...but diana,just you.

397
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,000
Just me.

398
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300
We just got here.Where you going?

399
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,600
Schenley park.
I think we caught a break on tom's case.

400
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,900
Tom!

401
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,600
Tom!

402
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
(缺一句)

403
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
Just marco.

404
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,100
At least,I thought it was marco.

404
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,700
I looked across the park.
You were standing there.

405
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,500
But it wasn'T.

406
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,800
Tell me about it.You weren't the one
actually chasing yourself across the park.

407
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I mean,I don't really run like that,do I?

408
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
It's an amazing ability.Marco's
going to have a field day over this.

409
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
Good.Get him working on it.

410
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,100
We're going to need
a way to handle this guy

411
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,900
wait,wait,wait.No,
you don't need to skulk around anymore.

412
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,400
You can come in with me now.

413
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
I'm still on the hook for murder,diana.

414
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,700
No,you're not.

415
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,900
Boyd posed as you.He shot T.J.
Kim.You're not responsible.

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,700
Listen,I just saw his abilities
that's proof of something right there.

417
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
I will back you up on everything you say.

418
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Which means exactly nothing.

419
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,300
I mean,thank you,diana,
but you're my partner.

420
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Everyone expects you to stand up for me.

421
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,500
There's only one way to
prove I didn't kill T.J. Kim.

422
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,200
- I have to get boyd gelder.
- Okay,let's go.

423
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,000
You sure you want to come?

424
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,300
I'm your partner.
Everyone expects that I'll stand up for you.

425
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,400
I should be back by tonight.

426
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
I've...

427
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,600
been taking my time,stopping off at
all the places your mother liked.

428
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Everything okay?You been going
to your doctors' appointments?

429
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,400
Most of them.

430
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
We need to keep monitoring you.

431
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm fine.

432
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,300
Shawn's taking good care of me,just like
you asked.He's doing a really good job.

433
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,100
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.

434
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,300
He taught me the backstroke,
he let me drive his car...

435
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
and then I asked him to
have sex with me,but he said no.

436
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,800
He said you'd be angry.Is that true?

437
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Isabelle...

438
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
you're too young to be thinking about...

439
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,700
- that.
- (缺一句)

440
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,000
But I thought I was almost 20.

441
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,000
How old were you when
you lost your virginity?

442
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,900
It was...

443
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,700
things were a bit different in my day.
It's not the same.

444
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
It's not?

445
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,400
Why?

446
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,400
You know what,isabelle?

447
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,900
I'm not having this conversation
with you over the phone.

448
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,500
So shawn was right.You are mad.

449
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,300
I don't understand.

450
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,900
What does ntac want to
talk to my son for,anyway?

451
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,900
He's in some trouble.We can't discuss it.
We just need to talk to him.

452
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,900
Well,he's not here.

453
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,000
He went away on a ski trip with some friends,
and he won't be back till tomorrow.

454
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,300
Ma'am...

455
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,000
your son is not on a ski trip,and this
is serious.Is there any way you can contact him?

456
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,000
First tell me what's going on.I mean,
what is it you think my son did?

457
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,700
Mrs. Gelder,there are a lot of agents...

458
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
people get hurt.The sooner we
get to your son,the safer he'll be.

459
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,900
So why don't you call him and
convince him you need to see him.

460
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,600
(缺一句)1

461
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,100
(缺一句)2

462
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,800
Nice mom,nice house...makes you wonder...

463
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,100
if the nova group can turn this kid,
who else have they gotten to?

464
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Everyone keeps telling the 4400
they're here to save the world.

465
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,100
- Whatever that means.
- Exactly.

466
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,900
Say what you like about nova.
They do seem to have a game plan.

467
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,400
Well,I'm just guessing,
but I don't think that's boyd.

468
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,600
How the hell did ntac get here?

469
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,900
Maybe boyd figured out it
was a trap and tipped them off.

470
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,000
- (缺一句)
- Alana,open up.

471
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,500
There are ntac agents watching the house.

472
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,100
They just drove away.They must
be changing shifts.Come on,let me in.

473
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,400
Death in venice,okay?Open up.

474
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I don't want anyone to see me come on.

475
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,500
What did you do with your key?

476
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,600
I lost it.I must have lost
it while I was running around.

477
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,100
Come on.It's me,tom,alana.
I gave you the password.

478
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,900
Please don't make me.
I don't have anything against you.

479
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,100
Tom...says it's your house.

480
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,700
Alana?

481
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,900
I just wrote a letter on your computer.(缺一句)

482
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,300
- Boyd?
- It's a confession.

483
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,700
(缺一句)

484
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,900
You shot T.J.,And now you can't live with it,
so you've decided to kill yourself.

485
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,100
Where's alana?What did you do?

486
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,900
It's my "get out of jail free" card.

487
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,500
See,you're the only
one who could identify me.

488
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,900
Everyone else,they've just been
seeing double.They'll sound crazy.

489
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm not signing a suicide note,
boyd.Put alana on the phone.

490
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Oh,you'll sign,'cause either I shoot you...

491
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
or I shoot her.

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,800
It's a trade.

493
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Your life for hers.

494
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
You know what?

495
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,700
I don't think i can let you do this,tom.

496
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,500
We need to call jarvis.We need to block off
the street.We need to surround your house.

497
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
- He has alana.
- Tom,

498
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,800
he wants to kill you.The least thing we can
do is make it a little bit difficult for him.

499
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,800
If it was maia in there...would you call jarvis?

500
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,900
Do you like it?

501
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
Why did you bring this to me?

502
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,100
You're a young woman.(缺一句)

503
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,500
It's going to look good on you.
See for yourself.

504
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,200
Thank you.

505
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,200
I see you've been spending
a lot of time with shawn.

506
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,200
So?

507
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
(缺一句)

508
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Shawn's a very isolated young man.

509
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,000
He doesn't get to spend much
time around people his own age.

510
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,100
I think...you should get
as close to him as you can.

511
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,000
Matthew?

512
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,800
Shawn's nice.

513
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,600
What I'm doing with him is not for you,
and it's not because i'm trying to use him.

514
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Of course not...

515
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,700
but eventually,isabelle,

516
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,700
you and shawn are going to be on opposite
sides of a very large ideological divide,

517
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,500
so...enjoy your friendship...

518
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,900
but don't let your emotions run too deep.

519
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,400
It'll make things more difficult later.

520
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,700
What things?

521
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,500
You'll know.

522
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,300
It doesn't match your eyes.(缺一句)

523
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,300
You were a beautiful woman.

524
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Both of you.

525
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
You looked exactly alike.

526
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,700
I never could figure out why.

527
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,600
One way or the other,I've had a
lily in my life for over 50 years.

528
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,700
That's all gone now...

529
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,000
and I don't know what I'm going to do...

530
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,400
but,uh...

531
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,300
it makes me feel better knowing
the two of you are together...

532
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,600
forever.

533
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,600
This is it for you,you know.

534
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,700
I don't know what kind of fairy
tale the nova group sold you,

535
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,000
but it doesn't matter
what happens to me,or tom.

536
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Your life is over.
They sent you on a suicide mission.

537
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,000
I volunteered,and I don't think you're
in any spot to be giving me advice.

538
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,500
You're a 4400.

539
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,400
You're special.

540
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
You're supposed to be changing things.

541
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,400
Live with an ntac agent.

542
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,900
And what are you going to change,boyd?

543
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,600
You killed a girl.

544
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,500
How does that make the world better?

545
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,800
T.J. Kim was a soldier.

546
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,100
She would rather have me put a
bullet in her head than betray us.

547
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,900
Everyone talks about saving the world.

548
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
(缺一句)

549
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Everything's been turning bad,
one disaster after another...

550
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,600
but we're going to show the world a new way.

551
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,500
We're going to take them down a new path...

552
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,100
by force if we have to.

553
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,900
Why can't you see the real
catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing?

554
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,700
Did you hear that?

555
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Stop it!

556
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,900
Stop it,both of you!Stop,or I'll shoot.

557
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,000
Nice work,alana.We got him.Shut up!

558
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,700
Alana,death in venice.

559
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah,that's the password.

560
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,300
Come on,alana.Give me the gun.
We'll call ntac.It's over.

561
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
(缺一句)Ask me a question. Anything.

562
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Don't fall for it.

563
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,500
He's probably read my file.He knows
everything about us.Don't listen to him.

564
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Ask me something about us.

565
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Something only I would know.
Anything about us.

566
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
(缺一句)

567
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,500
Baby...

568
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,400
I am so proud of you.

569
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
(缺一句)

570
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
You know about billy?

571
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Yeah.That was your son.

572
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,400
He died in a car accident.

573
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,500
Alana,he did research.
Anyone could find that out.

574
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,400
Give me the gun.Just give me--
give me the gun.

575
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,800
Alana,give me the gun.

576
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,500
No.Alana...

577
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
give me the gun.

578
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
Get down on the ground.

579
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
What?

580
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,600
No,you've got the wrong one.
Think about this.

581
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,000
I said get down.

582
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Don't move.

583
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,100
You're just a boy.

584
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,200
I'm a soldier.

585
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,900
And there are more of us every day.

586
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,000
Let's go,soldier.

587
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,200
Welcome back.

588
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,600
Yeah,thanks.Everything go okay?

589
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah,thank you,and thank you
for keeping an eye on isabelle.

590
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,800
Oh,well,it's not a problem.
Didn't really do much.

591
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,100
Yeah,well,thank you anyway.

592
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,200
I worry about her.

593
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,700
You don't really need to.
She seems to be getting along really well.

594
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm her father. It's my job.

595
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
And it's harder with isabelle.

596
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,100
People see her,they see a woman,

597
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,200
a beautiful woman...

598
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,000
and they might forget that
inside she's just a little girl.

599
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,600
Still...

600
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm glad she has you around...

601
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,200
to be a friend.

602
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,400
(缺一句)

603
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
How did you get in here?

604
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,200
I can do stuff,remember?

605
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

606
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,700
So,what's up?What do you need?

607
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Just one thing.

608
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,500
It's on my list.

609
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,000
First kiss.

610
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,700
This isn't smart,isabelle.

611
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,100
Okay.
