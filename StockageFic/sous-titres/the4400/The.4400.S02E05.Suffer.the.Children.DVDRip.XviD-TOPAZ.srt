1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,099
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,438
We're not sure what's just happened.

3
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:07,276
The light is gone.

4
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:09,541
And thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.

5
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:11,781
Some of them have been missing over 60 years.

6
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,091
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.

7
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:15,057
I saw your brother.

8
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:16,926
Shawn?

9
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,355
You know those visions that Maia used to have.

10
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:22,119
It turns out she was only
pretending that they stopped.

11
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:23,504
Don't give me that look, Tom.

12
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,067
You kept Shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

13
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,437
I've cured emphysema, leukemia...

14
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,400
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.

15
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:32,839
That baby really kicked your ass.

16
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,289
Heidi, it's mommy.

17
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:35,452
Who?

18
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:36,874
I have another family now, and I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,728
I know that's not fair to you, but...

20
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:40,575
Brian, I am still part of your life.

21
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:42,136
If you're losing chunks of time,

22
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,859
you should talk to your dad about it.

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,306
You told me everything that happened that night, right?

24
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:46,994
Yeah.

25
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,757
It's okay, it's okay.

26
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:01,762
Jordan.

27
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,616
You don't have to keep vigil, Shawn.

28
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:21,019
Are you going to cancel the appearance at Riverfront Park?

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,463
No, that would be a mistake.

30
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:23,817
They're not just honoring me.

31
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,876
They're honoring the center and all the work we've done.

32
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,938
- A new neurological clinic just opened in Atlanta.
- No, look, look.

33
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,108
I've been to all the specialists, Shawn.

34
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:36,846
There's no name for what I have.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,341
We can't just give up.

36
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,868
There's got to be a way to
figure out what that baby did to you.

37
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,422
I know what that baby did to me.

38
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,544
It saved my life.

39
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:45,140
What?

40
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,307
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:49,833
When I touched Lily's pregnant
belly and was hit with that pain

42
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,563
I realized I'd been judged and found wanting.

43
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:55,943
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?
- In that moment...

44
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,701
I was forced to see the truth about myself,

45
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:03,304
about my motives toward the 4400,

46
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:06,097
and they were... not pure.

47
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,826
That baby tried to kill you.

48
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,483
And it succeeded.

49
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:12,286
It killed the old Jordan Collier,

50
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,832
and I was reborn,

51
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,088
pure of purpose.

52
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,522
All I've done since,

53
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,725
everything I've built,

54
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,019
I owe to Richard,

55
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:27,802
to Lily... and to that child.

56
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:33,095
I'll get it.

57
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:41,966
- Hey.
- Hi.

58
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,384
Come in. Lily...

59
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,116
... look who's here.

60
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,477
We would have called,

61
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:51,255
but Heidi wanted to surprise you.

62
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:53,442
Heidi...

63
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:54,880
hi, mom.

64
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,204
She's so cute.

65
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,852
Now that you guys are living on the block,

66
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,343
I figured it was time for Heidi to meet her real mom.

67
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,606
That makes you my second dad.

68
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,254
I guess so.

69
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,418
Mom, why are you crying?

70
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,714
Lily, are you all right?

71
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,712
- Lily?
- Lily?

72
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,300
Lily?

73
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,204
Lily?

74
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:19,346
Sweetheart, wake up.

75
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,625
It was a dream...

76
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,099
more like a nightmare.

77
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,761
No, no.

78
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,710
We were living next door to Heidi and Brian,

79
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,304
and we were all getting along.
And the house...

80
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,358
Richard, it was so pretty.

81
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:39,613
So why were you crying?

82
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,099
I guess I knew it wasn't real.

83
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,693
How long can we keep going
before someone catches up to us?

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,537
We just got to keep moving,

85
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,638
stay ahead of Collier and NTAC.

86
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,445
I'm just so tired of running.

87
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,670
We're going to find a place to stop running.

88
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:03,630
It's out there...

89
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:04,847
... got to be.

90
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:01,231
Nice use of color.

91
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:09,250
It's shaping up, Greg,

92
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:11,588
but I think it could use some work.

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,836
That's as good as it gets.

94
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:27,957
Don't waste your time.

95
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:43,829
Ms. Tobey,

96
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:45,977
would you come with us, please?

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,604
Harmon.

98
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:50,756
Harmon...

99
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,579
Sam...

100
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:53,986
... what's this all about?

101
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,438
Ms. Tobey, I'm placing you under arrest.

102
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:57,591
Arrest?

103
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,248
For what?

104
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:00,403
Child abuse.

105
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,510
Oh, my god. What...

106
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Look...

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I know his birth certificate says the kid's 21.

108
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,100
But emotionally Kyle is still a teenager.

109
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,700
I've got to accept the fact that he's gonna screw up like a teenager.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
He'll learn from his mistakes.

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Get it out of his system.

112
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,600
But Shawn...

113
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
it's been a year.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
How could he cut us out like that?

115
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,000
And Danny. He's eating himself up inside.

116
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,700
He used to be such a sweet boy.

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Yeah. I remember what pop used to say...

118
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,300
"You think you've got problems?

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,700
Wait till you become a parent.

120
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,400
Little did we know.

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,800
Yeah.

122
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
What do you want to bet they're talking about us downstairs?

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
That's what they live for.

124
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,200
If they didn't have us to worry about.
They'd die of boredom.

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,200
I've seen you around campus.

126
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
I saw you too.

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,800
Why didn't you say something?

128
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
It's been, like, four years.

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,500
I mean, what was I supposed to say?

130
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,100
"Welcome back from coma world"?

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know. I guess

132
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
seeing you reminded me of Shawn.

133
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
You two were always so tight.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
And you were like our shadow...

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,900
"Where you going? Can I come too?"

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
I thought you guys were so cool.

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,800
I was 14. What did I know?

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Mom says you talked to him?

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,100
I don't think he heard me.

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
You know.

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,300
I used to blame Shawn for everything...

142
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Stealing Nikki.

143
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,100
Running out on us the way he did.

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Breaking mom's heart.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it wasn't his fault.

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,500
And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak.

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,300
They're the ones.

148
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,100
Guess they screwed us all up.

149
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,500
Well, I want to thank councilman Lowe
on behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor.

150
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
In funding this cleanup project.

151
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,700
I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past but to the promise of the future.

152
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,800
I believe that the actions we take.

153
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,000
The choices we make

154
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,000
will create the kind of future that
we and our children and their children will live in.

155
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,800
Thank you.

156
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,400
Hey.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,100
Hey!

158
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
What?

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Get your hands off of me.

160
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you want to do, break it?

161
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,604
Stop it!

162
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,600
Hey! What's the deal?

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,800
These people don't belong here.

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,700
No. You're the ones who don't belong here.

165
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,200
This used to be our home until you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out.

166
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,200
It's okay. You can let 'em go.

167
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,800
They were stealing food.

168
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
Well, last time I checked, the food was free.

169
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Don't make me pull rank.

170
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Come on.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Yes, Sir, Mr. Farrell.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,610
Thank you.

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Big shot, huh?

174
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm impressed.

175
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm really sorry that we trashed your home.

176
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,200
I am.

177
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,600
You should be.

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near l-90 bridge.

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Food's still free, right?

180
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes. Absolutely.

181
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,700
Please be my guest.

182
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah. We will.

183
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Protect the future, huh?

184
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Got to have one first.

185
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Even on the map, Fairview seems far away.

186
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,300
That's four hours tops.

187
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,500
This is my first time spending the night away from Maia.

188
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
Isn't your sister with her?

189
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,700
The one with all the tattoos?

190
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,300
Sorry.

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,300
Those beer kegs Kyle ordered should be showing up right about now.

192
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah. You read these charges?

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
"Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment.

194
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Placing her students' health,
welfare and safety at risk.

195
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,100
"Could that be any more vague?

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Well. That could be anything from grabbing them 
on the arms to touching them on the privates.

197
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,700
Or maybe she did nothing.

198
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Yeah. "Nothing" would be my vote.

199
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,800
A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.

200
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,600
But a 4400 child molester?

201
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
You're damn right we don't want her back!

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Not now. Not ever.

203
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Look.

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
I don't know what's going to happen with Ms. Tobey.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,800
She's out on bail, right?

206
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,200
That's right.

207
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,295
And her bond was paid by
parents from this school.

208
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah. And if they're not worried about their kids.

209
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Then we'll worry for them.

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Ask Sal, here. He'll tell you.

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
His kid was abused.

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,300
Same as Melinda and Teddy.

213
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,700
What about your child, Mr...

214
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
Venner. Frank Venner.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
It's not like she didn't try with my boy.

216
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones.

217
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,500
Tried what?

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,700
Now, who the hell are you two?

219
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm Agent Skouris. This is Agent Baldwin.

220
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
We're with NTAC.

221
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,600
Great.

222
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,600
You got here just in time.

223
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,900
Yeah. Cops let her go.

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,600
You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail.

225
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,500
She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet.

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
She's a 4400.isn't she?

227
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,400
She should never have been allowed
back in this school in the first place.

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
According to the preliminary exams.

229
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,700
None of the kids showed any signs of abuse.

230
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,500
No marks. No bruises?

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
No physical signs, at any rate.

232
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,400
So what are we talking about? Some kind of mental abuse?

233
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
Personally. I'm not convinced it's abuse at all.

234
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,600
But there's no denying that some of her students have been changed.

235
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,500
Changed?

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
In what way?

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,900
That was beautiful.

238
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,200
I guess.

239
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,100
You're telling me two weeks ago you'd never played a violin.

240
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Never even touched one.

241
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,900
Hey, I only took this class 'cause
art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed "A".

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,900
You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
It's so cool.

244
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,200
I look at a bunch of clay.

245
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,600
I see the figure I want to mold.

246
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,800
I just carve away the pieces
I don't need and there it is.

247
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
You should see the way she stares at you.

248
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
It's like she's drilling a hole.

249
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Trying to get in there and rearrange your brain.

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,300
One minute, she was touching my shoulder.

251
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,100
The next thing I remember, she was handing me a violin.

252
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,700
And I'm standing there wondering what the
hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand.

253
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,900
And then I see this block of clay.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
And it was like.

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
"Where have you been all my life?

256
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,000
"My dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship.

257
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
It used to be my dream, too.

258
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
But this painting stuff.

259
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm really into it now.

260
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
Ms. Tobey's the best teacher I ever had in my life.

261
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,600
My dad says these kids may seem normal now.

262
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,100
But in, like, two years...

263
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,300
... they might develop brain tumors,
go blind, crazy...

264
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,700
... who knows?

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
You guys should throw her back in jail.

266
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Your dad.

267
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,100
He wouldn't be Frank Venner,
by any chance, would he?

268
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
How'd you know?

269
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
Oh. Just...

270
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
... a wild guess.

271
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,900
Hurt my students?

272
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,400
That's so ridiculous.

273
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,900
Well, it's not ridiculous to these parents.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
People get scared when they don't recognize their kids.

275
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,900
But they're still the same kids.

276
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out.

277
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
How do you do that?

278
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,100
I study them.

279
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,341
Sometimes.

280
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,961
There's a light in their eyes.

281
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Like a tiny flame.

282
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,800
And while I'm watching.

283
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,800
It gets brighter.

284
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,000
That's when I know there's something in them.

285
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,700
Something beautiful.

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,912
So this light, have you seen it in anyone else?

287
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
It doesn't seem to work with grownups.

288
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,200
It doesn't work with every kid, either.

289
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,600
Like this one boy, Greg Venner.

290
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,800
I keep looking.

291
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
But so far...

292
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,600
I think his father's pretty adamant that you stop looking.

293
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,500
Frank?

294
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,900
I taught Frank.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He was one of my first students back in '72.

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
The fact is.

297
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,500
I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me.

298
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,700
This is crazy.

299
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,000
I... I haven't done anything wrong.

300
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
I need to get back to my kids.

301
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,400
The people who took me.

302
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,400
It can't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift.

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,700
That's why they sent me back.

304
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
To use it.

305
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,100
Tyler?

306
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,800
Richard Tyler?

307
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Richard Tyler.

308
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes. I'm Richard Tyler.

309
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,600
As wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours
what've we got show for it?

310
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,100
Less than 20 bucks...

311
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
What we ganna do?

312
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,600
Gotta make it lived.

313
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,000
Who's got this?

314
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
No one, friends treat...

315
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,900
Hey, Shawn.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,900
Look who showed.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,900
I was in the mood for pizza.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,300
I didn't feel like eating alone.

319
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,900
So...

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,300
My very own fairy godfather.

321
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,500
Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down-and-dirty for the night?

322
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
I'm not here for that.

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
What's the matter? Am I not good enough for you?

324
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Maybe I'm not good enough for you.

325
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I can get behind that.

326
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,000
Yo, Wayne, pepperoni.

327
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,600
You going to stand there and watch.

328
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,800
Or you going to sit down and eat?

329
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,700
Hello?

330
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Brian.

331
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
It's me, Lily.

332
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Lily, where are you?

333
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,800
You know, NTAC's been calling me
all summer trying to find you.

334
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Brian.
Look.

335
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,600
I need your help.

336
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Richard, he's been arrested.

337
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,900
You're a lawyer.

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,200
I need you to call the sheriff's office
in Weldon, Idaho.

339
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
See what you can find out.

340
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
Well, I don't know what I can do for the guy.

341
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm not a criminal lawyer.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,300
Brian, if you don't want to help...

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,700
I swear to god, Lily...

344
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,100
... you disappear for over a year...

345
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
... and then you call me up with these stories
about the police arresting your boyfriend...

346
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,500
Richard's my husband.

347
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,400
We have a child.

348
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,900
A six-month-old girl.

349
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
How's Heidi?

350
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
She's good.

351
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
Started seventh grade and

352
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
aced her first semester.

353
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
That's wonderful.

354
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Brian.

355
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm sorry to be bothering you with this.

356
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,900
But I have nowhere else to turn.

357
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

358
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,200
I got to admit.

359
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,600
The first time Mike came home with that violin and started playing.

360
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,900
His mom and me, we were both a little spooked.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,700
So why did you help pay Heather's bail?

362
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,300
I would've paid the whole thing if I could've afforded it.

363
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,100
My wife, she shot a video of Mike playing.

364
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Sent it over to the conservatory.

365
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,700
Next day, they called back.

366
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,100
Said our son was a prodigy.

367
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks?

368
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
Well, they thought I was putting them on.

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship.

370
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,400
You know, I thought this kid was going to wind up
working on the assembly line like his old man.

371
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,300
Now he's got a way out.

372
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Hmm.

373
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
Ms. Tobey's at NTAC today for a physical.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
We're asking the parents of the students she's "gifted" to come in to be interviewed.

375
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,800
No problem. I'll call his mom.

376
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,700
We'll do anything we need to to get
Heather back in that classroom.

377
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,900
Great.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Thanks.

379
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.

380
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,800
Just getting enough to eat.

381
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,200
You know it's such a struggle.

382
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,900
And you made that struggle a little easier.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm proud of you, Shawn.

384
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm thinking about going back down there.

385
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,700
There's so much they need...
jackets, sleeping bags...

386
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
... maybe a couple of first aid kits.

387
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,000
Basic stuff to survive, you know.

388
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
You give them all the supplies they need.

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
- All right.
- But look...

390
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,000
... whatever you do, Shawn...

391
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
... don't reveal your healing ability.

392
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,800
Why?

393
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,300
- 'Cause they can't pay?
- No.

394
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Because if you heal one of them...

395
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,300
... you'll have to heal them all.

396
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
I mean it.

397
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,700
Not even you can do that.

398
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah.

399
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm listening.

400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
When was this?

401
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Sweet.

402
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm a little rusty.

403
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,600
One of these days, I'm going to write a concept album

404
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,100
about my time on the street.

405
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Oh.

406
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm gonna win a Grammy.

407
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
Make the bling-bling.

408
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
You know, and get a private jet.

409
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,300
One of those big old gated houses with enough room
for Wayne, Kimmy and Shadow.

410
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
Sounds like a plan.

411
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, it matches your eyes, sweetie.

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Hey.

413
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,700
First time in months I haven't seen him shivering.

414
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,200
It's amazing what a warm coat'll do.

415
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,000
You got yourself that guitar, huh?

416
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,300
No, actually, you know what?

417
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,300
I got you a guitar.

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,500
What's the matter, baby girl?

419
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,200
You act like you never had a present before.

420
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,300
It's been a while.

421
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,000
You touch this, you die.

422
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,000
- "Touch it, you die"?
- I guess so.

423
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,900
What does that mean?

424
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,400
I hate lines. Hate waiting in 'em.

425
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Trust me, there'll be no waiting tonight.

426
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I been to this club plenty of times.

427
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,000
I know the bouncer. He'll let us walk right in.

428
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,500
I hope you're right.

429
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,000
I hate waiting in lines.

430
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Hey. That book you're reading is nothing but lies.

431
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Excuse me.

432
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm talking to you.

433
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,700
That trash is going to rot your mind.

434
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,700
Danny, what's going on?

435
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,300
She ought to be careful.

436
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,900
That book's a load of bull.

437
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,200
- I bought it for her.
- Yeah?

438
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
Big mistake.

439
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,300
Anyone ask your opinion?

440
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,700
Danny, come on, man.

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Just watch my back, okay?

442
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,500
Listen, pal.

443
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,300
Let me tell you a little something about cults.

444
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,000
What's going on?

445
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,000
You letting me go?

446
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,000
Hello, Richard.

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,300
What's with the dopey grin?

448
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,700
Nothing, just the way that you...

449
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
you bite on your tongue when you're trying to concentrate.

450
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,400
I've been doing that since I was a kid.

451
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,800
How long have you been in Seattle?

452
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,000
Two years.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Left my mom and her new boyfriend

454
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
and came out here for the music.

455
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Somehow, my life took a weird turn.

456
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,200
I've had a few of those myself.

457
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,700
What, you run away from home too?

458
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Um...

459
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,100
sort of.

460
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,600
Except I lucked out. I found a place to run to.

461
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,300
Otherwise...

462
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,500
you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects?

463
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,300
Something like that.

464
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,900
You're one of those 4400 guys, huh?

465
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,400
Can you make my eyes turn green?

466
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,900
What, you able to walk on water?

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I like your eyes the way that they are.

468
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,200
And I can barely swim.

469
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,200
Come on, now...

470
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,100
... what the hell is this?

471
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,100
Dewey...

472
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,600
I see you been keeping busy.

473
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,200
No, baby.

474
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,800
He's just some guy...

475
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
... bought us some food and blankets.

476
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,100
Liv, who is this guy?

477
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,300
Shawn, you got to go.

478
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'd listen to her.

479
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,100
What are you doing?

480
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,300
Well, see, she does whatever I tell her to do.

481
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Do you have a problem with that?

482
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,100
Yeah.

483
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,900
Yeah, I do.

484
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Shawn, please.

485
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
You've done your good deed, just...

486
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,700
... just go home, okay?
Please.

487
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
Come with me.

488
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
Come with me.

489
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
And then what?

490
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
What, you gonna rescue me?

491
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,100
I don't want to be saved.

492
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,300
Get the hell out of here.

493
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,200
Go, I mean it.

494
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,100
Go!

495
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,600
Hey.

496
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,400
You're not going back to that school.

497
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,000
Not till that woman is gone.

498
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,900
But what about my other classes?

499
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,300
I've got homework.

500
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Since when do you care about school?

501
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,300
You want me to wind up like you?

502
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,400
Hey, you watch your mouth.

503
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,100
I don't want to fall behind.

504
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,500
"Fall behind"?

505
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,300
With the grades you've been bringing home?

506
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,000
You been behind since your first report card.

507
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,600
What, you just going to sit there...

508
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
... or are you going to talk to me?

509
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,700
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.

510
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,300
You know, those guys wanted to kill me.

511
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,500
And I turn around.

512
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
And my cousin's nowhere in sight.

513
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
I don't know what happened.

514
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,300
Yeah, I know what happened... you ran out on me.

515
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,900
It's a good thing that security guard was there.

516
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,300
The other time, I could blame it on the beer.

517
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
You drink too much...

518
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,000
... you can black out, right?

519
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,600
But today, I didn't drink anything.

520
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
I'm blacking out...

521
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,100
... losing chunks of time.

522
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
It's like they did something to my wiring.

523
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,900
They?

524
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,400
Kyle, who are you talking about?

525
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,300
The same ones who took Shawn.

526
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Who put me in the coma.

527
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,900
They left me messed up inside.

528
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
Hey, man, you're scaring me.

529
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,900
How do you think I feel?

530
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,100
Brian.

531
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,900
Any news?

532
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Yeah, I got ahold of the Weldon authorities.

533
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
And Richard's been released from custody.

534
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh, thank god.

535
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
When?

536
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,500
About an hour ago.

537
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
Why hasn't he called?

538
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,700
You sure you don't want to call Lily.

539
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,000
Let her know you're all right?

540
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,100
Am I?

541
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
You're in no danger from me, Richard.

542
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
All I want is to make you an offer.

543
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,300
If it's not to your liking...

544
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
... you can walk out of here.

545
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,400
You'll never see me again.

546
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,600
How much did you pay those cops to call you
instead of NTAC to get my picture into their hands?

547
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,100
It's my money, Richard.

548
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,100
Look.

549
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,800
You said I was free to go after I heard your offer.

550
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
If you got one for me...

551
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,500
... make it.

552
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
I want you to come home.

553
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
You and your family.

554
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,700
To the 4400 center.

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,900
I don't think so.

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,800
You said you read my book...

557
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,100
... which means you know why
we were taken and what we're meant to do.

558
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
The future...

559
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,700
The future rests in our hands, Richard.

560
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
You, me, Lily... we are the chosen ones.

561
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,000
Come on, Jordan.

562
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,700
We both know this has nothing to do with me or Lily.

563
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,300
This is all about Isabelle.

564
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
Isabelle...

565
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Well, that's a lovely name.

566
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,300
For once.

567
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Why don't you say what you really want...

568
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,200
... to take her from us. Control her.

569
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Your daughter is the future.

570
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
I believed that then. I believe it now.

571
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Then what's changed?

572
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,300
I have.

573
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,900
I'll need more than your word.

574
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,500
Of course.

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Bring me to Isabelle.

576
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,500
Let her judge me.

577
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you.

578
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,300
What are you afraid of, Richard?

579
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,900
I'm the one at risk.

580
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter.

581
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Richard, it's simple.

582
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,700
If I'm lying.

583
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,600
If my motives are not pure.

584
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,200
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.

585
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,400
And you'll be free of me once and for all.

586
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,500
But if I'm sincere.

587
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,000
If Isabelle accepts me.

588
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,300
Well, then, I can offer you and Lily and the child a new life.

589
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,900
Stop running, Richard.

590
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Forget it.

591
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
It's not going to happen.

592
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,300
There's no way I'm going to allow Isabelle
anywhere near that man.

593
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,100
But think about it.

594
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
If Collier really has changed.

595
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,900
It means we can get off the road.
Stop running.

596
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,700
That's a big if.

597
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,300
He offered to act as a middleman between us and NTAC.

598
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Says he can get them to back off.

599
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,400
And you believe him?

600
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
He's got lawyers.

601
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
A whole organization behind him.

602
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,200
We can barely even pay for gas.

603
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,000
He's lied to us before.

604
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,500
The man tried to destroy our relationship.

605
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,800
Okay, let's say he is lying.

606
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
Maybe all of this is some kind of trap...

607
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,900
... to get his hands on our daughter.

608
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,300
He wants a face-to-face with Isabelle?

609
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
I say we give it to him.

610
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,500
You've seen what she's capable of...

611
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,500
... what she can do if she feels threatened.

612
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
It still feels like an awful big risk...

613
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,400
... for Collier.

614
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,300
Stand back, let her through.

615
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
Get out of here!

616
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,600
Welcome back, Heather.

617
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
I'm sorry about all of this.

618
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,000
Once the media loses interest.

619
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:12,200
Things will die down.

620
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,900
Until it does.

621
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,200
We need to discuss how you intend to handle security.

622
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Let me get Heather situated.

623
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,900
Then I'll meet you in my office.

624
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:21,400
- Come on.
- Don't get comfortable, freak! You're not staying!

625
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,300
I like this one with the smoke and the clouds...

626
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
Greg.

627
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Does your father know you're here?

628
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,400
It's all your fault.

629
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,400
Everything was okay till you showed up.

630
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,800
Greg.

631
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,300
Please put the gun down.

632
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,700
No.

633
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,100
You made me do this.

634
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,100
I have no choice.

635
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,500
Yes. You do.

636
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,700
But only if you put the gun away.

637
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,200
I can't be here anymore, my dad won't let me.

638
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,700
This is my last chance.

639
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:03,800
Greg, calm down...

640
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,200
No!

641
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Not until you change me like you did them.

642
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,000
You have to!

643
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
There's nothing to discuss.

644
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,900
I'll take anything...

645
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,900
Violin...

646
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,700
Painting...

647
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,100
Photography, I don't care!

648
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,100
Listen, Greg.

649
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
You're problem is with me.

650
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,000
Not your classmates.

651
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,200
Let them go.

652
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,400
And you and I will deal with this alone.

653
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,900
Yeah, sure.

654
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,100
That works for me.

655
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,900
Okay.

656
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,200
I'd like you all to leave now.

657
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
Quietly, don't run.

658
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,100
Ms. Tobey, will you be okay?

659
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,600
Move!

660
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
Go on.

661
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,300
For an entire week?

662
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,600
Is that really necessary?

663
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
To and from school. Strictly as a precaution.

664
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,830
- A continued police presence will send a
clear message to anyone who feels they can...
- Okay.

665
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,600
So now we're alone.

666
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,900
Now, do what you promised!

667
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Would you put the gun down.

668
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,800
- No!
- Greg?

669
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
Please, put the gun down.

670
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,500
It scares me.

671
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, good.

672
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,200
It's supposed to scare you!

673
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,000
Greg...

674
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
D.A. says we don't have a criminal case.

675
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,200
Fine. We'll take it to civil court.

676
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,900
- One way or another...
- Excuse us.

677
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,100
Hey, buddy, what's your problem?

678
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,000
You're needed inside.

679
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,600
I don't feel any different.

680
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Greg, I'm trying.

681
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,500
Well, try harder.

682
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,300
You found it in Mike, in Rita...

683
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,000
... you can find it in me!

684
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,900
I told you.

685
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,300
I told you she was dangerous.

686
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,100
None of you would listen.

687
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,500
She's not the one holding the gun.

688
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,300
Greg is a kid.

689
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,100
He doesn't know what he's doing.

690
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
She's got his mind all twisted.

691
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,400
I got news for you.

692
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,900
I knew everything I needed to know
the first time I talked to Greg.

693
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,900
You're the one who twisted his mind.

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
- You put that gun in his hand.
- That is not true.

695
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,200
We both know it's true...

696
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
and now you're the only one who's going
to get your son out of this alive.

697
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Good.

698
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,700
Whatever talents they have were there to begin with.

699
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,400
But we're only talking about a handful of students.

700
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,200
You found it in them.

701
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
You can find it in me.

702
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,100
You have to.

703
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,500
Before I wind up like him...

704
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
... you know, my dad.

705
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,900
Is that what you're afraid of?

706
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,500
- You were worried she was going to damage your son?
- You know what my dad's like.

707
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,900
He's nothing.

708
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,100
He's a big, angry nothing.

709
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,800
And that's exactly what he wants me to be.

710
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
And I can't let that happen.

711
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,300
Now, goddamn it, do something!

712
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,500
It's no good, is it?

713
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,300
There's nothing there.

714
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,700
I'm sorry, Greg.

715
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,100
Not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.

716
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
You'll find a place.

717
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,100
Sure I will.

718
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,900
I have a talent for failure. Just like him.

719
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,700
You don't have to become like your father.

720
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,300
Somewhere along the line, he made a choice.

721
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,000
You can make a different one.

722
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,000
A better one.

723
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,700
She's right, Greg.

724
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,500
Dad?

725
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,500
The mistakes I made...

726
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,000
they're mine.

727
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,000
They're not yours.

728
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,800
Just because I failed.

729
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,600
It doesn't mean that you have to.

730
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,200
Please put down the gun, Greg.

731
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,500
Don't... don't let my mistakes get you killed.

732
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Yo, Shawn!

733
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,200
You got to do something, man.

734
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,200
He's knocking the crap out of her.

735
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,200
What are you talking about?

736
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:13,600
Dewey sold that guitar you got Liv.

737
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,700
Now he's all cranked up, screaming and whatnot.

738
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
She needs you.

739
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,700
Come on, come on...

740
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,100
Liv?

741
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
I begged him.

742
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,800
Told him he was taking too much!

743
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,100
Dude's dying.

744
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,100
No!

745
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,000
No!

746
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,600
No!

747
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,000
Jesus...

748
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,300
... what did you do?

749
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,000
He brought him back.

750
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,900
What the hell happened?

751
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
What happened?

752
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,100
This guy just saved your life.

753
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,200
Thank you.

754
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
My leg...

755
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,000
... please fix it.

756
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that.

757
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,200
Why not? You helped him.

758
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,000
I...

759
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
Save us!

760
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,100
No, I can't.

761
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,100
I can't help everyone.
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,100
Have mercy on us.

763
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,100
I'm sorry.

764
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,100
I can't help everyone.

765
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,100
I can't help everyone.

766
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,200
I...

767
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,900
I can't help everyone!

768
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,700
No! They need you.

769
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,700
You sure about this?

770
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,500
Yeah, I'm sure.

771
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,800
Lily...

772
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,300
good to see you.

773
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And this is Isabelle.

774
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,100
Hi.

775
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Yes.

776
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes.

777
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,100
How's that?

778
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,300
Well, I guess that's it.

779
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,000
Good-bye fairview.

780
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,600
At least, this time, it's your call.

781
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,400
I'll find another town,

782
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,200
another school,

783
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,100
maybe work as a private tutor for a while.

784
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,100
I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain.

785
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,700
Well, the worid could always use a little more beauty.

786
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,700
I hope so.

787
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,200
Good luck.

788
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,100
Thanks.

789
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,300
You know, I was thinking of getting Maia piano lessons.

790
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,600
Oh yeah?

791
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,000
I bet she'd like that.

792
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,800
Or maybe even study painting,

793
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,200
'cause she's always coloring.

794
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,800
I guess you could call that a ripple effect.

795
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,700
A positive one.
