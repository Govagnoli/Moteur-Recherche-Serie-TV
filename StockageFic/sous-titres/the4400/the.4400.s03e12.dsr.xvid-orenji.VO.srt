1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,380
all at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,350
with no memory of
where they've been

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,970
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,650
and some have returned
with new abilities

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
all are trying to reconnect...

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,590
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,500
We're not a threat.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
We're salvation.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
The world will have to deal with us.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Previously on the 4400...

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,000
do you know who I am?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
As soon as I am free,

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,100
you and the world will know what I know.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,000
My son is in prison.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,600
You're the only one who can get him out.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,700
Did you...

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,900
kill me?

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
That's jordan collier!

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,000
Tell them I didn't kill you!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
You're going to get married.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,300
I saw it.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,000
Did you happen to see who the lucky guy was?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Someone just told me that I met
the woman that I'm supposed to be with,

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,100
and I can't ignore it.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
He broke up with me!

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,200
I've done bad things.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
You are the enemy.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,100
Tell me what to do.

30
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,200
I'll do anything.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,000
Leave the 4400 center and never come back.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
They won't be able to hide for long.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,900
Dr.Burkhoff's not exactly inconspicuous.

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,200
We are proud to announce the existence
of this enhanced soldier program.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,700
In time,

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
they'll become the first non-4400s

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,200
to develop extrahuman abilities
in the defense of the united states.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
You have a source of promicin
for your program.

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,100
Who is it?

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,100
That stuff happens way above
my security clearance.

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,400
The soldiers you're creating,

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,200
are you really going to use
them to defend the country,

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400
or are you just going to send
them after the 4400?

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,900
Is there a difference?

45
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr.Collier, you've been doing
quite a bit of press since your...

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
resurrection?

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,900
I suppose some people are calling it that.

48
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,200
And in every interview,

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,000
you've been making the same
statement over and over again--

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,700
"the war for the future will
be fought in the past."

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,500
Exactly...

52
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,600
and by "past,"

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,100
do you mean now?

54
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,200
Today?

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,100
It's our shared burden, yes.

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,900
And this war,

57
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,800
it's one between 4400s and the non-4400s?

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,700
No.

59
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,500
This is a war between good and evil,

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
and it has already started.

61
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,800
Good people,

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,700
4400s and non-4400s...

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,800
come on, kyle.Dinner's ready.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
-Have already ...
-I'll be right there.

65
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
made incredible sacrifices,

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,200
and they know they will be called
on to sacrifice even more.

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,800
They are among the first to
know the cost of this struggle,

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
because,

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
for better or worse,

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
all our lives are different now,

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,900
profoundly different.

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
That's what wars do.

73
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,500
They change us.

74
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,700
But the stakes...

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,900
the stakes are nothing
less than the fate of mankind.

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,900
But why does there need to be a war at all?

77
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
I've seen the future,

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
and it's a bleak one.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,700
The human race is old,

80
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,500
it's sick, it's dying.

81
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
What's left of civilization is controlled

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
by a brutal and powerful elite

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,900
who have effectively shut themselves
off in the world's last city

84
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,200
while the rest of humanity struggle for survival

85
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,500
in the surrounding wasteland.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Sounds pretty hopeless.

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Doesn't it?

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But there is hope,

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
there is always hope,

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,500
and it rests with us.

91
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,300
We can change the future,

92
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,900
but we must start now.Today.

93
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,900
Everything crucial to
the world's survival, its prosperity--

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,400
the resources of this planet,

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,900
food, water, energy,

96
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,600
the genetic materials of life itself--

97
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
already, even as I speak,

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,000
are being gathered up and controlled
by a powerful and isolated few.

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
This must stop.

100
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,500
We must stop it.

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
Our enemies are strong,

102
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,900
and they grow stronger daily,

103
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
and they will go to any lengths

104
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,800
to maintain their dominance,

105
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,900
to confine us to our current path,

106
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,800
a path leading only to disaster,

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,400
only to the catastrophic future that awaits us.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,200
We must band together to fight this...

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
this evil amongst us,

110
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,800
an evil that would destroy us all.

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,700
We won't have another chance.

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,900
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know what happened.

113
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going over the night
bulletins with havemeyer,

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,600
next thing you know,

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,500
I got drool all over my shirt
and havemeyer's snoring in my ear.

116
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,600
You're saying the entire night
shift just fell asleep?

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Fell asleep, passed out...

118
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I don't remember.

119
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,100
What the hell is going on?

120
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,000
Good question.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,400
I've got an entire building full of
agents who can't remember a damn thing.

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
While they were napping,

123
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,200
every member of the nova group in ntac
custody walked out the front door.

124
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Yeah, walked, ran, flew--

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,500
no way of knowing,since they erased
the security tapes on the way out.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,900
But every 4400 downstairs gets
injected with the promicin inhibitor,

127
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,100
so none of them could've used
their abilities to escape.

128
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,700
They must have had help.

129
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,400
Someone on the outside.

130
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,300
A 4400.

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
No, more than one.

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Someone to knock our people out,

133
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
another to disable the security system.

134
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,200
So are we talking sympathizers
or members we've never caught?

135
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,900
Either way, it looks like someone's
putting the nova group back together.

The.4400.
Season 03 Episode 12

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,800
Paul newbold has the ability to raise
or lower body temperature.

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,700
Tina richardson.

141
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
She wipes memories.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,700
She can make you forget what you had for breakfast

143
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,900
or she can erase your entire life.

144
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,800
Then there's my old friend, boyd gelder,

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
who can take over your entire life.

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
The ultimate impersonator.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Any one of these people is capable
of wreaking serious havoc.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
they've done it before.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
We have to assume someone broke them out

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,700
so they could do it again.

151
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,900
The nova group has a lot of scores to settle...

152
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,100
starting with your nephew.

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,900
I called shawn.

154
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,100
The 4400 center's already a fortress,

155
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,800
but he'll make sure to kick it up a level.

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,900
Dennis ryland's got to be high on their hit list.

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,800
and alana, and kyle.

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Boyd came after my family before.

159
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,100
Go.

160
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,900
I'll send some agents over to watch your house.

161
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,300
Agent baldwin,

162
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,000
why won't your son make a statement?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,900
Did someone pay him to shoot jordan collier?

164
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Did he always know collier was alive?

165
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
So how long are we going to be stuck in here?

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,500
A few days, a couple of months?

167
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Hopefully not too long.

168
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,900
We caught boyd gelder once.

169
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
We'll track him down again.

170
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,000
In the meantime, kyle,

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
you need to stay close to home.

172
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Don't go anywhere unless it's
absolutely necessary.

173
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Thhouldn't be too bad.

174
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,700
After all, you could still be in prison.

175
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
I could still be living on the run.

176
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,400
Compared to that,

177
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
staying close to home is kind of nice...

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
and before you know it,

179
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,100
you'll be heading back to school.

180
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
She has a point, kyle.

181
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
Did you see those registration
forms I left for you?

182
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
If you like, I could...

183
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
you know, I could run them over
to the admissions office.

184
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,900
I'm not sure I'm ready to go back to school.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,500
You want to wait a semester, that's up to you,

186
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,400
but I figured, you know,

187
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,300
going back to school would help things
get back to normal.

188
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,500
Dad, have you looked outside?

189
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,600
That's not going to happen.

190
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,900
Kyle, you just...

191
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
you just have to be patient.

192
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,800
Dad, I know you're trying to help,

193
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
but jordan collier came back from the dead.

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
No one's ever going to forget that.

195
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,300
And as long as they remember jordan collier,

196
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,500
they're going to remember the guy who shot him.

197
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,900
I warned nina jarvis.

198
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,700
I told her that ntac was totally unprepared
for the threat posed by these people.

199
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,400
Did she listen?

200
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,500
No...

201
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
and here's the result.

202
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Ntac is literally asleep at their desks

203
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,500
while the most dangerous 4400s stroll
out the door.

204
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
We're talking about the nova group.

205
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Violent terrorists.

206
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,300
This isn't about the 4400.

207
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,800
Tom,

208
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,900
I'm sure you'll agree that that
distinction's become meaningless.

209
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,600
Every one of the 4400 has developed an ability.

210
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,000
That means every 4400 is a potential enemy.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,800
My daughter's in the fifth grade.

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,100
She isn't anyone's enemy.

213
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,900
Children grow up, diana.

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,100
Dennis,

215
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,000
we don't know what the nova is planning.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But they have targeted you before.

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,400
Now, ntac is ready to offer you any protection
you might need.

218
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
that's very generous, tom,

219
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
but if my memory serves me,

220
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,400
the nova group made two attempts on my life
while I was under ntac protection.

221
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,300
Two unsuccessful attempts.

222
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,500
Don't sound so disappointed.

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Would you come in a moment, please?

224
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,300
This time, I'm arranging for my own security.

225
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Hello.

226
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,100
We were just discussing the newest
threat posed by the nova group.

227
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,300
there is no threat.

228
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,700
Not while I'm around, anyway.

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,700
Your uncle...

230
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,200
he actually saw them together?

231
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,900
My daughter and ryland?

232
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,000
At least nowe know where she's been
for the last week.

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Jordan should've talked to us before
he made her leave.

234
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
It's like he delivered her right to ryland.

235
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,900
I don't know about that.

236
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,700
If she's the source of ryland's promicin,

237
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,200
that means that she was working with
him long before she left the center.

238
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
****Talk to her.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,200
Make sure she knows who she's working with.

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,100
When my daughter's made up her mind,

241
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,300
there's no changing it.

242
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,700
You know that.

243
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm sorry, richard.

244
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
All her life,

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
I've been trying to see something good
in isabelle,

246
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
some kind of light,

247
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,900
something to nurture.

248
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
Maybe I've just been wasting my time...

249
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,900
because it's never been there.

250
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Hi.I'm home.

251
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,900
I didn't get a chance to get the store.

252
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
I thought we could...

253
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
order in a pizza.

254
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,500
Don't worry about me.

255
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
I already ate.

256
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,900
I can see that.

257
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,700
Why won't he call me back?

258
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,600
Who?

259
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,700
Ben?

260
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,900
I left him five messages.

261
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,700
I just want him to know that I forgive him,
you know?

262
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,100
It's probably my fault.

263
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,900
Probably pushed him away.

264
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,700
sitting here blaming yourself is not helping.

265
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Do you think he met someone else?

266
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You need to get up.

267
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Take a shower,

268
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
change your clothes,

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
and let's all go out to dinner.

270
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,900
What if he calls?

271
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Answer my cell, okay?

272
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,700
Sure.

273
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,300
And if he calls,

274
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,100
be nice to him,

275
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,300
because when we get back together,

276
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,900
I do not want there to be any weirdness
between the two of you.

277
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,700
Hi, honey.

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,200
We had a deal.

279
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,500
No video games before dinner.

280
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
Maia...

281
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,400
I needed a break.

282
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
From what?

283
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,700
Aunt april.

284
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm sorry, sweetie.

285
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,800
She hasn't stopped from the second
I came home from school.

286
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,700
She keeps asking me
if they're going to get back together.

287
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,900
you're going to have to go easy on your
aunt april.

288
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,500
She's going through a really rough time.

289
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,600
But you and ben,

290
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,500
you're supposed to be together.

291
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,300
Maybe if you told her about what I saw...

292
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,000
somehow I don't think that's going
to make her feel better.

293
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
she's going to know about you two sooner or later.

294
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,500
I mean...

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
you are going to invite her to your wedding.

296
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,700
What do you think?

297
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
You look remarkable.

298
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
I'm impressed.

299
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,900
Jordan.

300
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,900
Are we interrupting something?

301
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
No, not at all.

302
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,400
Is everything okay?

303
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Not really.

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
We just talked to my uncle tommy.

305
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
He told us that...

306
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
isabelle and dennis ryland are working together.

307
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
I see.

308
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
Jordan...

309
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,400
did you hear what I just told you?

310
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Kicking isabelle out of here may not
have been the best decision.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,300
While isabelle was here, she was a threat.

312
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,700
Her alliance with dennis ryland simply
makes it clear where her loyalty lies,

313
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
and clarity's a good thing, yes?

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,900
But we still have...

315
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,500
preparations to make around this place,
just to be safe.

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
It's not only isabelle and ryland out there.

317
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
We also have the nova group to worry about.

318
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,100
The nova group is no longer our enemy.

319
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Isn't that right?

320
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
We don't have a problem with you.

321
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
Not anymore.

322
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Shawn,

323
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,600
richard...

324
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,500
have you met boyd gelder?

325
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,600
As you can see,

326
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,100
he's quite an impersonator.

327
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,300
What's one of the nova doing here?

328
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,100
He is a 4400, shawn.

329
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,400
Where else should he be?

330
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Besides,

331
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,500
I went to a great deal of trouble
to get him and his friends out of ntac.

332
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,700
Jordan, this is crazy.

333
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,500
I put my life on the line trying to protect
this place from the nova group,

334
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,800
and now we're the ones that break
them out from ntac?

335
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,700
What were you thinking?

336
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
That we have a war to fight.

337
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,600
That nova is a powerful weapon,

338
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
which, until now, hs lacked proper guidance.

339
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,100
Jordan, they're terrorists.

340
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,900
They kill people.

341
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,600
They did what needed doing.

342
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,300
They chose action over accommodation.

343
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Not supporting that choice was a failure, shawn.

344
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh, so I made a mistake by not
backing the nova group?

345
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,300
I'm saying you should've been a leader.

346
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,000
These people are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the greater good.

347
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,300
They're the kind of soldiers we need
in this fight.

348
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,900
Jordan,

349
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
they're one of the biggest reasons
why people are scared of us,

350
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
so if we invite them in here,

351
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
then we become part of the nova group,

352
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,000
and everything that you've been
preachingince you've been back,

353
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,800
about cooperation and unity between
4400s and non-4400s,

354
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,600
it's never going to happen.

355
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Richard?

356
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,600
We're running a big risk here, jordan.

357
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
We're playing for big stakes.

358
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,900
If ntac finds out we were involved
in the breakout,

359
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,200
it'll be bad.

360
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,300
You sure you covered your tracks here?

361
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
They're someplace safe?

362
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Along with the 4400s who helped free them.

363
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,300
They won't be found.

364
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,700
No, no, no, no.

365
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,200
Just because we're not going to get
caught doesn't make this okay.

366
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,300
Richard,

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,900
no, tell me you're not buying into this.

368
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm just being realistic.

369
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,500
The fact is,

370
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
we're more vulnerable than ever.

371
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,100
Isabelle's with ryland now.

372
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
It's only a matter of time

373
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,700
before those soldiers of his are out
there developing abilities.

374
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Jordan is right.

375
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
We're playing for big stakes now.

376
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,700
Another month?

377
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,100
That's completely unacceptable.

378
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,000
The initial volunteers were showing
abilities within days.

379
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,900
That's correct,

380
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,500
but as you recall,

381
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,800
there were problems.

382
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Deaths.

383
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,500
Since the piersahl incident,

384
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,700
we've scaled back the pace of the
promicin injections.

385
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
I never authorized that.

386
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,300
I guaranteed this country the
protection of enhanced troops.

387
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,000
I won't be made a liar by you.

388
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Increase the dosage.

389
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll have another shipment of promicin
sent over from haspelcorp today.

390
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,900
I don't know why you're wasting time
building an army.

391
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
You won't need one.

392
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,700
You're a very powerful young woman, isabelle,

393
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,100
but you're still one person.

394
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,700
Think of it as backup.

395
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
if that makes you feel more secure...

396
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,100
but by now, collier knows we're working together.

397
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,900
He won't wait a month to come after us.

398
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
If we give those soldiers the
maximum dose of promicin,

399
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
how long before they develop abilities?

400
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,000
Anywhere from two to three days.

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,100
Make it two.

402
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,900
Why wait?

403
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,100
You heard the lady.

404
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
I'll be staying on base to monitor your progress.

405
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,900
Kyle.

406
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
There he is.

407
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,000
Look at you, man.

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,700
You look great.

409
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
I can't believe you're standing here.

410
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,400
We have to celebrate,

411
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,500
or we've got to do something.

412
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
Yeah, that sounds good.

413
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
first I need to ask a favor of you.

414
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,300
Name it.

415
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,600
It's good to see you, kyle.

416
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,500
I was hoping we could talk.

417
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,900
It's really you, isn't it?

418
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,900
You're alive.

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,900
It took a while to believe it myself.

420
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm sorry...

421
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,300
for what I did to you.

422
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,200
There's nothing to be sorry about.

423
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
My death had to happen.

424
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,900
I've seen you on tv.

425
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
You seem so sure that what we all
went through means something.

426
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,500
I wish I could understand it the way you do.

427
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,600
To me, it all seems like a waste.

428
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,900
My death was part of a bigger plan.

429
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,400
I know you've suffered for it,

430
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,900
and that was unfair,

431
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,500
but everything you did, kyle,

432
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,900
including my assassination,

433
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
was part of that plan.

434
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,500
You have no idea how important you are.

435
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,900
Tell me we can spend the whole night together.

436
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,800
You know, I think that maia should
be there when I tell her.

437
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,400
That way, at least she can explain the
whole prediction thing.

438
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,900
so much for afterglow.

439
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,700
Please tell me you weren't thinking
of april the whole time.

440
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
No.

441
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,500
I wasn'T.

442
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
You're right.

443
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
We should tell her.

444
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,200
I should do it.

445
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,900
She should hear it from me.

446
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
That'd be like hiding behind you, and

447
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
I admit, that sounds good right now, but...

448
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,000
I'd just only hate myself even more.

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,100
I just wish I knew what to say.

450
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,700
Tell her the truth.

451
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
You know?

452
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
We didn't plan this.

453
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
We didn't even want it...

454
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,900
but it happened.

455
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,700
We fell in love.

456
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,400
Isn't it a bit early to be using that word?

457
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,900
What would you call it?

458
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,500
god.

459
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
It's true.

460
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,700
Two weeks, and I'm in love.

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,300
It's a good thing.

462
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,800
I know it is.

463
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,500
I mean, it should be, buT...

464
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm in love, and I can't enjoy it.

465
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,900
How pathetic is that?

466
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,500
What's all this?

467
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,100
I had a lot of time on my hands.

468
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
I thought someone should benefit from it.

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Not you.

470
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,900
Kyle.

471
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,700
I'm making penne arrabiata.

472
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
I bet you he hasn't had it in a while.

473
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Where's kyle?

474
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
He'll be home any minute.

475
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
He went out?

476
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,700
After I told him not to?

477
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,800
He drove to northmount.

478
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,900
He wanted to register for some classes.

479
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
That's great.

480
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,900
How'd he get past the reporters?

481
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
They don't even know he's gone.

482
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,700
I made a pitcher of ice tea and some sandwiches,

483
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
and I brought it out to them,

484
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,000
and I distracted them while kyle
slipped out the back.

485
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
We planned the whole thing together.

486
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,800
It was fun.

487
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,900
I'm glad someone had a good day.

488
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,300
I take you didn't have a good day at work?

489
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,900
No.

490
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,200
We talked to the family of every prisoner we lost.

491
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
No one's heard or seen anything.

492
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,900
I mean, not that they'd give up
their loved ones so easily...

493
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
and then there's always the 4400
who broke them out.

494
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,500
Excuse me, honey.

495
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,500
We haven't made much headway on that front either.

496
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,300
Kyle's going to be a happy man.

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
You'd think we would've heard something
about a 4400

498
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,300
who can override a state-of-the-art
security system,

499
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,500
or cut off oxygen to a whole building
full of people.

500
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,000
I had a student at the center.

501
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,100
When he first came to school,

502
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,700
he had some problems.

503
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Teachers and the other children kept having
headaches and fainting when he was around.

504
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,400
It turns out that it was something
about his ability

505
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,600
to change the level of oxygen in the blood.

506
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,900
Alana, this student, what was his name?

507
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,300
Michael lawrence?

508
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,100
You think he had something to do
with the prison break?

509
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,200
He's 16, you guys.

510
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
his ability matches up to
what happened to our agents.

511
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
And boyd gelder isn't much older.

512
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,900
Now, we've spoken to michael's father.

513
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,800
He says he hasn't seen his son in a week.

514
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,300
Shawn,

515
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,100
is it possible there's a new
nova cell operating out of the center?

516
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,000
if there were,

517
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,300
don't you think they would've come
after me by now?

518
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
they still might.

519
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,700
We don't know what they're planning.

520
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Do you mind if we talk to some of the
other students,

521
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
see what they can tell us about michael?

522
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,200
Talk to whoever you like.

523
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,500
Listen, shawn...

524
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
look, I appreciate this.

525
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,500
You know, it really helps to have
someone here we can work with.

526
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,500
I hope that doesn't change now
that collier's back.

527
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,900
All right.

528
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,300
Michael lawrence's ability is unique, useful,

529
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
and he controls it with a great deal of accuracy.

530
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Why wouldn't i make use of him?

531
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,500
Because he's a 16-year-old kid you
just turned into a felon.

532
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,100
Shawn, that boy allowed us

533
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,800
to neutralize a building full of ntac
agents without hurting anyone.

534
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
I think I showed great restraint,

535
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,100
given the urgency of our needs.

536
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,200
What needs, jordan?

537
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
What is so important that we need to
get into bed with the nova group?

538
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,700
Come on.

539
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,100
I ran this place while you were gone.

540
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,900
I think I deserve to know what you're planning.

541
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,900
Ryland's enhanced soldier program.

542
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,400
We're going to destroy it.

543
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Destroy how?

544
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,600
With nova's help,

545
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,900
we'll attack the army base where
the experiment's conducted,

546
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,600
take out the lab, the training facility,

547
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,800
and when we find the soldiers getting promicin...

548
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,500
neutralize them.

549
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200
Attack a military installation?

550
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Jordan, are you insane?

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
That's how you sound right now.

552
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't care what you think
you saw while you were gone.

553
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,500
This is the real world.

554
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Jordan, listen to me.

555
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Do you know how many people would die?

556
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,900
On both sides.

557
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,500
We have no choice.

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,300
Once those soldiers develop 4400 abilities...

559
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,500
it'll be too late.

560
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,800
there's a gas station.

561
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,500
It's on a highway.

562
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,500
Next to it there's a road sign.

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Can you read the sign?

564
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm trying.

565
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Something about a petrified tree stump.

566
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
It's the biggest one in the state.

567
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Afraid that's all of it.

568
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,100
That's the thing with this remote viewing--

569
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,500
I never quite see everything.

570
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
That ought to be enough to find them.

571
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,300
The gas...

572
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,500
and a quart of oil comes to...

573
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,200
53 even.

574
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,300
Okay.

575
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,700
Hope you're going to take some time

576
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,800
and visit newfield's claim to fame.

577
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,700
There's not another stump like it
on the whole west coast.

578
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,300
We're just passing through.

579
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,400
If I...

580
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
if I go back the way I came,

581
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,900
will I find the highway?

582
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,500
Oh, she can help you with that.

583
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,900
He wants to get right back on the highway.

584
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,900
That's easy...

585
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,700
but first,

586
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,100
I think you should visit the newfield stump.

587
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,400
They have a really nice gift shop there.

588
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,700
The town could sure use your business.

589
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,900
I just follow the sign?

590
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,200
That's right,

591
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,500
and there's a nice diner along the way.

592
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,900
All the pies are baked fresh.

593
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Sounds good.

594
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,700
We'll check that out.

595
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,900
Thank you.

596
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,500
You won't be disappointed.

597
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,000
Those pies come in on a truck.

598
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,900
They need the business.

599
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Dr.Burkhoff.

600
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,900
Ms.Dorner.

601
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm jordan collier.

602
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,900
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.

603
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,000
How's your research coming?

604
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,900
It keeps my nights interesting.

605
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,400
Mr.Collier...

606
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
we've made a nice life for ourselves.

607
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,700
This is a good place for us,

608
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
and we like to think that we make
things a little better by being here.

609
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,900
Please don't ruin it.

610
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Were it up to me, you'd live here happily
many years,

611
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
but right now,

612
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,700
I need your ability and your intellect.

613
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
sweetie.

614
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,900
I think it's grilled cheese wednesday.

615
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,700
Where's your aunt april?

616
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,900
Please don't be mad.

617
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,500
Why would I be mad?

618
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,100
You didn'T.

619
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,800
I thought it'd make her feel better,

620
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
knowing about my vision,

621
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
that it's not her fault
that ben likes you more.

622
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,300
And did it make her feel better?

623
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,900
Not really.

624
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,300
She's in your room.

625
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
April?

626
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,900
In here.

627
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,900
You're out of tissues.

628
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,900
There's more under the bathroom sink.

629
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
You know...

630
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,700
one of the reasons that I liked
ben in the first place

631
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
was because I thought,

632
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,900
"here's a guy "

633
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
my sister would approve of...

634
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,500
finally.

635
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
you were right.

636
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,800
This was it.

637
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,900
My one chance to settle down
with the right guy...

638
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,900
except it turns out he's your right guy.

639
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
god, april...

640
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700
this whole thing with ben...

641
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,900
I mean, we never meant for it to happen.

642
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,500
I...

643
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,700
I know that doesn't help much.

644
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,100
I know I'll meet another guy.

645
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,500
I always do.

646
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,900
Meeting them,

647
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,800
sleeping with them,

648
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,500
going to the fetish ball with them...

649
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,700
that's not the problem.

650
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Finding one that wants to go to the
fetish ball with me year after year...

651
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,700
that's the problem.

652
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,900
Ben was willing to go to the fetish ball with you?

653
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,900
He was considering it.

654
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,900
Look, di...

655
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,900
I wish I could hate you,

656
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,500
I really do,

657
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,900
but I'm too busy hating me.

658
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,900
I'm such a loser.

659
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,300
No...

660
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,400
no, you're not.

661
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes, I am.

662
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm going to live alone

663
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
and I'm going to die alone,

664
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
and all I'm ever going to be to anyone is

665
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,900
"aunt april, the loser."

666
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,200
kyle, you got a second?

667
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,900
just getting rid of some old stuff.

668
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,800
Come on, dad.

669
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
I was nine when I got that.

670
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,900
Yeah, I remember the day.

671
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,500
Listen, kyle...

672
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
once you go back to school,

673
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I thought I'd float you some cash.

674
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
That way, you can get your own place,

675
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,800
so can have some privacy, some independence.

676
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,900
I saw jordan collier yesterday.

677
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,500
You went to the center?

678
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,600
Why?

679
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,100
I had to see him.

680
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,700
We talked.

681
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,400
He helped me realize some things.

682
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,700
What things?

683
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,500
I'm not going back to college, for one.

684
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,900
Dad, just listen to me.

685
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,300
Hear me out.

686
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,200
My life, my future,

687
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,600
it's tied up with the 4400.

688
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
That night on the beach when shawn was taken,

689
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,900
it should've been me.

690
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,000
If he hadn't have pushed me out of
that beam of light,

691
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,800
I would've been one of them.

692
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah, but you're not.

693
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
Kyle, your life can be whatever you want it to be.

694
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,700
You just have to be willing to move forward.

695
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
Ever since I woke up from that coma,

696
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,900
I thought I was moving forward,

697
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,000
but jordan helped me realize all
I was doing was running away.

698
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,600
He told you that?

699
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
He told you not to go to college?

700
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,700
No, dad, he just listened to me.

701
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,500
I figured it out on my own.

702
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,300
So, what do you do now, kyle?

703
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,000
You put on a blue blazer,

704
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,400
become one of his disciples?

705
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Give tours of the center, answer phones?

706
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,500
Maybe.

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,500
I'm going to do what you do, dad.

708
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm going to help the 4400 any way I can.

709
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,700
I'm sorry.

710
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,200
I agree with jordan on this one, shawn.

711
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,500
How can you say that?

712
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,700
If we attack that army base,

713
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,200
it's like declaring war on the united states
government.

714
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Maybe so,

715
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,300
but it seems to me we have been in an
undeclared war with the government

716
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
ever since we got back.

717
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Locking us in quarantine.

718
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,200
Shooting us up with the inhibitor.

719
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,000
Disappearing any of us they--
they-- they seem threatened by.

720
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,200
All jordan's doing is bringing the
conflict out into the open.

721
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Jordan's going to sacrifice thousands of lives.

722
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
It's going to be for nothing.

723
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,000
We're going to lose.

724
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,900
If you have another way,

725
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,500
something concrete that makes us safer...

726
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm willing to listen.

727
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
my god.

728
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,900
I didn't think so.

729
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay, can you give us a hint what this is about?

730
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,700
You said it was urgent.

731
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,900
The nova members that escaped...

732
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,900
I know what they're planning...

733
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,900
and who their leader is.

734
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,900
Okay.

735
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Shawn...

736
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,900
I'm going to need a name.

737
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Jordan collier.

738
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,900
you must think I'm insane.

739
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Only a psychopath would declare
war on the U.S.Army.

740
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,300
then we're all in agreement.

741
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,000
I assure you,

742
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,500
I am not crazy.

743
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,800
I'm not planning attack on any
government installation.

744
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,700
So you're saying shawn made all this up?

745
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,200
Why would I do that?

746
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Jordan, just...

747
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
tell the truth, okay?

748
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
You can't cover this up.

749
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,600
I told you a story, shawn,

750
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,700
to see if you would pass it along.

751
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
It was a test...

752
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,900
and I'm afraid you failed.

753
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
I've been away from this place for a long time.

754
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,700
In the days ahead,

755
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,900
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.

756
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,500
I needed to know who I could trust...

757
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
and who I couldn'T.

758
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm sorry to embarrass you like this.

759
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
It was the only way to be sure.

760
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,300
And what about the breakout at nta

761
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,000
you had nothing to do with that either?

762
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,600
I did not.

763
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,400
That is a lie.

764
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,900
That's a lie.

765
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,400
I saw boyd gelder standing in this
office with my own two eyes.

766
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,500
Richard was here with me.

767
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,200
He saw him, too.

768
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,500
Richard?

769
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
I don't know what you're talking about, shawn.

770
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,900
Richard...

771
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
As far as I know,

772
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,500
boyd gelder has never been here.

773
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,900
So you're saying,

774
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,200
in spite of all collier's denials,

775
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,700
this base is still the subject of
a possible nova attack?

776
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,600
It's possible, yes.

777
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,900
And you came all this way to warn me?

778
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,900
I'm touched, tom.

779
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,200
Just doing my job, dennis.

780
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
It's nothing personal.

781
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,700
Collier knows you're here,

782
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,400
so this place is no longer secure.

783
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Your little experiment needs a new home.

784
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,300
I say let them come.

785
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,200
If collier wants a fight,

786
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,100
we'll give him one.

787
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,700
She's right, you know.

788
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,200
Collier talks a good game--

789
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,700
unity, fighting together to save the future...

790
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,100
people actually believe he means it.

791
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,200
It's pathetic.

792
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,600
But an attack will expose the 4400 for
what they really are--

793
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,200
the enemy.

794
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,500
You see, tom?I was right all along.

795
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,700
It comes down to survival.

796
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,500
Us against them.

797
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,900
You sure you want to be at ground
zero for this one, dennis?

798
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Defending the human race?

799
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,500
Where else would I be?

800
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,900
We're staying right here.

801
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,300
How did it feel,

802
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,500
turning your back on me?

803
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
I was just trying to save lives.

804
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,500
Yours included.

805
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,800
You know, maybe if you'd told me everything,

806
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,900
treated me with a little respect,

807
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,200
we could've worked things out,but no,

808
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,500
you were too busy manipulating me, like always.

809
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
You know, jordan,while you were gone...

810
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,400
I ran this place,

811
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,300
and I did a pretty good job of it, too.

812
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,100
Now you're back.

813
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
You and I,

814
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,200
it's like nothing's changed.

815
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
You make all the decisions,

816
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,900
and I play catch-up.

817
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,200
Five steps behind.

818
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
Used to be 10.

819
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Shawn...

820
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,900
I need you to believe in me.

821
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
Do you know what I think, jordan?

822
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,400
I think that this whole messiah
thing has gone to your head.

823
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm no messiah.

824
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,200
More like...

825
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,300
john brown.

826
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,000
John brown?

827
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
The guy that tried to free all the slaves?

828
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,700
He surrounded himself with people
who believed as he did,

829
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,800
who were willing to do anything
for their cause,

830
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,500
and that kind of devotion can
change the world.

831
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,500
They killed john brown, jordan.

832
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,900
They killed me, too.

833
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,700
mr.Ryland.

834
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
I was told we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.

835
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
We have a security situation.

836
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,300
Ntac intelligence has gotten word that

837
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
jordan collier may be planning a move against us.

838
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,100
I want to transfer all the promicin
out of haspelcorp for safekeeping.

839
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,800
I want every vial packed and ready for
shipment as soon as possible.

840
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,900
Yes, sir.

841
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
Give us a hand here.

842
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,800
We've got a lot of crates to move.

843
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,500
I wanted them loaded up as soon as possible.

844
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,900
we'll take it from here.

845
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,500
The military base was never collier's target.

846
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,200
He wanted to divert us from his real goal.

847
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
The promicin.

848
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,600
You had enough stored here to create
a whole army of enhanced soldiers.

849
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,500
Before collier's done,

850
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,600
you'll wish you had that army for protection.

851
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,100
I wonder what he'll do with all of it.

852
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Destroy it.

853
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,300
He doesn't want anyone else to develop abilities.

854
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,600
He wants to keep us weak,

855
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,700
so no one can fight back.

856
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,500
Sounding a little paranoid, dennis.

857
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,800
Collier's a fanatic, tom.

858
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,900
He's capable of anything.

859
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
You'll see.

860
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,500
So you're saying you want to break up?

861
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,900
I don't want to.

862
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,500
then let's not.

863
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,700
Look, I know how bad you feel--

864
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,300
I feel bad, too--

865
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,900
but I also feel really,

866
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,700
really good.

867
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Isn't that worth holding on to?Trying, at least?

868
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm trying, believe me.

869
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,700
I...

870
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
but it's like we're never alone.

871
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
There's you, me, and april,

872
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,900
and she's the one crying.

873
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Yeah, I think I need to leave.

874
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,100
great.

875
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,600
Now april and i are both crying.

876
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,900
No, look, I didn't mean for good.

877
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,700
You can't get rid of me that easily...

878
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,900
but I do have a job to do in london.

879
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,700
It's five days.

880
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,600
It'll give us some time to think things over.

881
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,900
Five days?

882
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,500
Want to come?

883
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
No.

884
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Yes.

885
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
I...

886
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,100
just leave.

887
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,500
Please.

888
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,900
I'll call you as soon as I get back, okay?

889
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
just...

890
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
just so you know...

891
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,500
even if maia never made any prediction...

892
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,500
I'd still think we're meant for each other.

893
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
kyle.

894
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,900
Alana.

895
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,200
Thomas.

896
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,900
I've been trying to reach you.

897
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,200
What is it?What's wrong?

898
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Kyle's leaving.

899
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,100
What?

900
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
He's upstairs packing.

901
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,000
Kyle, what are you doing?

902
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm glad you're home.

903
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,800
I would've hated to leave without saying goodbye.

904
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,900
Where are you going?

905
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,700
Did collier send that limo?

906
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,700
I got a job.

907
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm going to travel around the
country for a little while,

908
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,900
hold these workshops at the 4400 centers,

909
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,100
talk about my life,

910
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,400
everything that's happened to me...

911
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,200
spread the word.

912
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,400
Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?

913
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,100
You know, think this obout this.

914
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,900
There's nothing to talk about.

915
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,700
I'm going to miss you, dad,

916
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
but I've got to do this.

917
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
I just got you home.

918
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,600
You said I should move forward.

919
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,900
That's what I'm doing.

920
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,900
Be happy for me.

921
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,900
I'm trying, kyle.

922
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,900
I'm really trying.

923
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
I got to get going.

924
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,700
I really got to get going.

925
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,900
Here...

926
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,100
let me help you.

927
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,900
Thanks, dad.

928
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,500
It's beautiful.

929
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,600
Isn't it.

930
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,300
They're going to be looking for it.

931
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,900
We've got to get rid of it, soon.

932
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,400
I don't understand.

933
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
Why take it at all?

934
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,900
Why not just destroy it there?

935
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,700
We're not going to destroy it.

936
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,900
All right, I'll ask the question.

937
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,700
What are we going to do with
17,432 units of promicin?

938
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,900
We're going to give it away.

939
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
To who?

940
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,500
To everyone.
