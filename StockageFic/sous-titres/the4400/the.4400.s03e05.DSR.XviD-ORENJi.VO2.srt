1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,360
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,260
All at once they were returned

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,200
With no memory of where they've been

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,900
they haven't aged a day

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,450
And some have returned with new abilities

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,770
All are trying to reconnect....

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,220
...with a life interrupted

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,170
We're not a threat.We're salvation.

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,500
The world will have to deal with us.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,220
Previously on the 4400...

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,300
I see you've been spending

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,950
people see her,they see a woman,
a beautiful woman,

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,810
and they might forget that inside,
she's just a little girl.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,230
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,310
You killed people.That's not what we
discussed when you approached me.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,610
We are in a war.

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,490
It's going to cost money.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,000
You sold us out.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm very disappointed in you,
shawn.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,390
Diana skouris,your adoption of maia
rutledge is hereby complete,legal,and binding.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,750
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.
I'm maia's sister.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,190
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking the inhibitor?

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,360
- Who are you?
- I'm lindsey.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,910
Tyler! Duncan!

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,250
You've been here ever since you walked
through the front door of my house.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,110
You're in the future.We had to bring you here,
maia,you and your friends.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,050
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother.

30
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,430
Please,don'T.

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,780
They'll forget you,too.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,420
Hey.

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,280
Oh,marco,they're beautiful.

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,760
How did you know i like anemones?

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,080
You remember that bad italian restaurant?

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,570
I asked you what your favorite flower was,
and you said...

37
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,220
anemones.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,500
Most guys don't even listen to table talk.
You not only heard me,you remembered.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,200
Do you know how lucky you're
going to get tonight?

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,620
Ah,then my plan is working.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,450
I thought it was just going to be the two of us.

42
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,080
It is.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,730
Then who's the other plate for?

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,510
Di?

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,130
I don't know
what I was thinking.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,770
- You having fun?
- Of course i'm having fun.

47
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,790
- You sure you don't want a turn at the wheel?
- It's your fantasy.

48
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,780
Okay,honey. Hold on.

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,320
Look out!

50
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,220
- You all right?
- I think so.

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,400
- You saw her,too,right?
- Of course I did.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,660
Why would a little girl be standing
in the middle of the road?

53
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,600
I have no idea.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,860
A joy ride in the country,that's
what we agreed on,right?

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,180
A great car,a deserted road.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,230
Hitting some kid at 80 miles plus...
where the hell does that come in?

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,990
What happened to her?

58
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,150
Thomas...

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,710
hey!

60
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,660
Hey! Hey...

61
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,840
hey...

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,040
are you okay?

63
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,520
Who was she?

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I have no idea.

67
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,030
So long ago,

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,800
another life

69
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,910
I can feel your heart beat

70
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,340
it's not a dream

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,390
remember us

72
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,600
I can see it in your eyes

73
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,000
we'll find our place in time

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,150
our place in time
beyond the sun

75
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,430
we'll find our place in time

76
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,380
our place in time
to call our own

78
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,100
How many times have we gone away together
in one of these fantasy worlds you create?

79
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,530
A dozen times,
two dozen?

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,070
- At least.
- And these worlds,they always feel real.

81
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,350
Except this time,a girl without a face
appears out of nowhere.

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,390
It felt more like a nightmare.

83
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,440
But something like that
was bound to happen sooner or later.

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,000
I build these worlds
out of our memories,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,780
I guess this time I dredged up
something incomplete.

86
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,030
A fragment of something,
a sort of mental hiccup.

87
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,370
Okay,but this girl,
is she part of my memory or yours?

88
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,140
Yours,mine,both...
there's no way to know,is there?

89
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,220
One of us might have seen
her picture in a book.Or seen her in the street.

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,990
We just don't remember her face.

91
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,030
It might have just been a glimpse.

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,390
A glimpse pretty much
ruined our night.

93
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,140
Well,tomorrow night
will be better,I promise.

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,930
Anywhere you want to go,anywhere we want to go,
and anything we want to do.

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,200
You know,for his 12th birthday,
I took kyle fishing up at the dosewallips river.

96
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,520
I thought maybe
the three of us could go there.

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,550
That sounds great.

98
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,590
And maybe this time,we could actually
catch some fish.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

100
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,760
I don't know what's wrong
with my bedroom...

101
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,500
or yours for that matter.

102
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,020
We've already done it there
a bunch of times.

103
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,090
Experts say you should do adventurous things
to keep relationships more interesting.

104
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,090
They say that,huh?

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,170
What could be more adventurous
than a quickie on the staircase?

106
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,040
Did you switch from encyclopedia britannica

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,830
to cosmo magazine or something?

108
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,830
Well,I read lots of stuff.

109
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,120
I'll take the elevator.

110
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,410
Devon...

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,580
how embarrassing for her.

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,460
Isabelle,just stop.Just...

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,780
What's the matter,shawn?
What's wrong?

114
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,920
She's not going to tell my father.

115
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,110
- She'd be too afraid of me.
- Isabelle,

116
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,580
she's going to tell someone,
and they'll tell someone else,

117
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,990
and then
everybody's going to know.

118
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,930
Where's your partner?

119
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,300
Late.

120
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,860
A 4400,christopher dubov,XXXXXXXXX

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,390
I want to know if we're looking
at a hate crime.

122
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,420
It says here he's a lawyer
at teller and dutch.

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,700
That's a major mergers
and acquisitions firm.

124
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,410
They've been all over
the financial pages this year.

125
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,860
Yeah,which makes him a high-profile 4400.
An easy target for somebody looking to make a point.

126
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,120
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,490
His 4400 status isn't the only motive
someone might have to attack him.

128
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,170
Just talk to him.See if he can
write you up a list.

129
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,350
alarm clock need new batteries?

130
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,460
No,it's a crappy morning.

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,280
You opening up a newsstand?

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,790
No,just A... project i'm working on.

133
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,430
So,what do we got?

134
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,420
Yeah,you could call it
a hate crime.

135
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,520
My son michael
certainly hates me.

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,420
Your son did this to you,
mr. Dubov?

137
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,110
His mom and i split up.
He blames me.

138
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,630
I'm the one who introduced her to bob,
her new husband.

139
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,140
I knew they belonged together.
I could smell it.

140
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,340
- I'm not sure I follow.
- It's my ability.

141
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,950
It showed up once I stopped
taking the promicin inhibitor.

142
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,020
I can smell pheromones.

143
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,560
You mean the stuff people put out
to attract other people?

144
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,580
Weird,huh?

145
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,060
Things between my wife and i
haven't been too good for a while.

146
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,850
Then I met bob.He's my new dentist.

147
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,870
Right away,there was something
familiar about him.

148
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,860
Then I realized what it was.
He smelled just like caroline.

149
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,250
So I made her an appointment.

150
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,990
I had to know whether or not
they belonged together.

151
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,900
Let me guess--
love at first sight.

152
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,760
Sight,smell,whatever.

153
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,670
You and your son
look very happy together.

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,060
Those were taken
when michael was 10.

155
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,230
10...

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,170
that's A...
that's a great age.

157
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,500
Mr. Dubov...

158
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,010
do you want us to talk to michael?
Assault is a serious crime?

159
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,080
Forget it.I'm sorry
my secretary called you.

160
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Besides,I think I know a way to get him to
forgive me.There's a new bar around the corner.

161
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,740
One of the waitresses,
she smells just like my kid.

162
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,300
- Let's hope she's not married.
- Amen to that.

163
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,910
You know,I bet if that guy quit his job
and opened up a dating service,he'd make a fortune.

164
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,810
Though I'm not sure how turning a corporate lawyer
into cupid is going to help save the future.

165
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,060
Hey...

166
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,820
honey,what's going on?

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,880
You all right?

168
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,930
Dubov was gone
for,like,five years,right?

169
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,890
I...

170
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,760
I bet his son really missed him.

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,470
Probably.

172
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,980
I mean,
every 4400 left someone behind.

173
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,330
Are you sure it's not
something else?

174
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,850
No...
it's fine,really.

175
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,370
It'll pass.

176
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,080
Okay...

177
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,270
physical...

178
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,260
you and isabelle.

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,410
You want to explain that?

180
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,860
I asked you a question! What exactly
is going on between you and my daughter?

181
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,610
We never planned
on going behind your back.

182
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,110
In fact,we never planned it at all.
It just kind of happened.

183
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,460
Friendship!
Remember,we talked about that.

184
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,230
That's as far as it was supposed to go.

185
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,910
I don't know what to say i'm sorry.

186
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm sorry,too.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,100
Isabelle is just a child--

188
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,430
no,richard,she isn'T.

189
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,610
She's emotionally immature,
and you took advantage of that!

190
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,300
That's what you think?
You know me better than that.That's not fair.

191
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,160
XXXXXXXXXXXXX

192
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,070
I'm not going to make
that promise to you.

193
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,240
I am not giving you a choice here,
you understand me?

194
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,500
This thing between the two of you,
it is over.

195
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,570
I don't recall
saying "come in."

196
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,400
I thought perhaps a referee
might be in order.

197
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,730
May I advise you gentlemen
to go to your neutral corners?

198
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,780
This is a private conversation,matthew.

199
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,810
It may have started out that way,
but I assure you,it's becoming very public.

200
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,660
I could hear you out in the hallway,
and for the record,I happen to agree with richard.

201
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,370
This relationship with isabelle
is ill-advised at best.

202
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,300
I thought referees
didn't take sides.

203
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,360
If I were you,shawn,I'd take this opportunity
to make a graceful exit.

204
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,500
Think about what I said,shawn.

205
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm expecting you to do the right thing.

206
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,280
What's for lunch?

207
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,330
Prosciutto with figs.

208
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,370
Rosemary chicken,couscous,
and raspberries.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,610
You know,when kyle and i used to go fishing,we'd take a half a dozen
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and think we were living like kings.

210
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,340
Well,I like to think the reality I create
is a little bit tastier than that.

211
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,760
Good.

212
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,050
Hey,we ought to get going.
Hey,kyle!

213
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,770
Come on,buddy!

214
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,940
Let's get moving!

215
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,150
Come on...

216
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,590
it's you.

217
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,530
The girl in the road.

218
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,490
That's right.
You remember.

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Maia.

220
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,350
Maia...

221
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,530
have we met before?

222
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,960
Don't be silly.

223
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,440
No,no,I'm sorry.I-I don't remember you.

224
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,550
Sure you do.Think harder.

225
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,250
Is that why you keep showing up?

226
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,070
Because you want me to remember?

227
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,810
I'm here because you brought me here.

228
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,330
There has to be a reason why this girl
keeps showing up.

229
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,040
There was nothing familiar about her?
Nothing at all?

230
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,510
No...

231
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,880
but she kept acting
like we knew each other,

232
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,320
XXXXXXXXXXif I did bring her there,
then I must know her from somewhere.

233
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,000
Tom...

234
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,080
shouldn't you be at work?

235
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,400
Jarvis said you called in sick.

236
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,220
Well,I'm allowed.

237
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,990
Thanks for checking in on me.

238
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,030
Come on,diana.Talk to me.
What are you...

239
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,600
what the hell's all this?

240
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,160
It's just a project i'm working on.
I mentioned it to you.

241
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,740
- Who's this supposed to be?
- I wish I knew.

242
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,270
I know this might sound creepy,
but I was up all night

243
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,050
last night cutting out pictures of little girls,
and none of them seemed to be the right one.

244
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,440
I mean,I think I'm going crazy.

245
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,910
Then we both are.

246
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,340
You know those little
dream vacations I take with alana?

247
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,080
This little girl keeps showing up in them.

248
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,960
This little blonde girl,
says her... her name is maia.

249
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,910
Maia...

250
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,220
- oh,tom...
- what?

251
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,650
You have to come with me.
I have to show you something.

252
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,610
Who is she,tom?

253
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,860
Who is maia?

254
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,970
I don't know.

255
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,210
There's no mention of someone named maia
in any of our case files.

256
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,080
Okay,well,maybe we met her together
someplace else.

257
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,610
Maybe at one of garrity's barbecues.

258
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,240
No,that does not feel right.I didn't just meet this
girl once at a barbecue.I know her better than that.

259
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,810
All right,just calm down.

260
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,330
Well,there's a reason
this girl is haunting us,tom.

261
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,810
Okay,she's out there somewhere,
and she wants us to find her.

262
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,700
Well,right now the only place i know she  exists is
in one of these dreamworlds that alana and I create.

263
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,930
Well,then I need for alana
to take me there.

264
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,870
I need to meet this girl,talk to her.

265
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,920
No,but you wouldn't really
be talking to her,diana.

266
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,020
You'd just be talking to whatever
your subconscious remembers of her.

267
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,490
Well,maybe that would be enough
for me to figure out who she is.

268
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,960
How do I sound?

269
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,320
Like you've been
playing for years.

270
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,430
But I haven'T.
It's my first time.

271
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,480
I kind of figured that.

272
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,770
Isabelle,you have a minute?

273
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,810
Have a seat.

274
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,260
isabelle,you know
i'm proud of you,don't you?

275
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,040
This is about shawn and i
having sex,isn't it?

276
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,860
That-- that's part of it,yeah,yeah,
but only part of it.

277
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,100
Right now,everything is new to you.

278
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,210
You're learning so much,so fast.
How to be A...

279
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,290
a daughter...

280
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,300
- a friend--
- a lover.

281
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,780
That part you might be learning
a little too fast--

282
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,800
XXXXXXXXXXXXX

283
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,190
I would just like it
if you and shawn slowed down--

284
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,390
- stopped sleeping together?
- For the time being.

285
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,580
There's no reason to stop.

286
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,080
Shawn cares about me.
I care about shawn.

287
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,230
The sex is wonderful.

288
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,900
It makes us both very happy.
It should make you happy,too.

289
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,150
Maybe it should,but it doesn'T.

290
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,590
I suppose that's normal.
But everything's going to be okay.

291
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,700
Shawn would never do anything to hurt me.
He's way too smart for that.

292
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,870
So you see?You have nothing
to worry about.

293
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,770
I wonder if anyone at the center
has a cello.

294
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,060
So,what do I have to do?

295
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,950
- Well,the main thing is to relax.
- Oh,my god.

296
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,760
I usually close my eyes
and count backwards from 10.

297
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,380
Before I reach zero,
we're somewhere else.

298
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,710
Do you have any idea
where you want alana to take you?

299
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,340
We usually have a destination
picked out.

300
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,600
Well,wherever maia is.

301
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,860
I mean,you can do that,can't you?
You can take me to her.

302
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,040
She seems to show up any place we go.
So it's really up to you.

303
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,670
All right,well,let's just keep it simple.
How about my apartment?

304
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,030
All right.

305
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,250
Now,let's begin.

306
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,800
Alana...

307
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,090
this is not my apartment.

308
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,150
I know.I'm not quite sure
what just happened.

309
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,840
You done talking to your friend?

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,340
- You're maia.
- Stop fooling around.

311
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,230
Come on. He's waiting for us.

312
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,360
There you are,
ms. Skouris.

313
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,700
The documents
are all ready.

314
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,910
If you'll just have a seat
and sign where indicated,we can finish up.

315
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,160
CONSENT TO ADOPTION BY GUARDIA

316
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,320
You still want to do this...

317
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,560
don't you?

318
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,250
Diana skouris,your adoption of maia rutledge
is hereby complete,legal,and binding.

319
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,640
So witnessed by me,henry biederman,
of the tenth circuit family court of seattle.

320
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,590
You know,some of us have to look far and
wide to find the people we'll call family.

321
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,230
You two had to look
clear across time.

322
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,190
Diana,let me introduce you
to your daughter maia.

323
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,420
Maia,say hello to mommy.

324
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,250
Oh,my god,maia...

325
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
oh,my god...

326
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,560
- my god...
- diana,what happened?

327
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,410
She was kidnapped,tom.

328
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,140
She was taken by a woman pretending
to be her sister.

329
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,890
She took maia,tyler downing,lindsey hammond,
and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.

330
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,820
Do you remember any of this?

331
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,130
No. No,I don'T.

332
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,140
So this woman took these children,and somehow
made everyone forget they ever existed?

333
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,960
Yes,but they existed.Maia rutledge disappeared
from crescent city,california march 3rd,1946.

334
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,730
Wait,you're saying she was abducted,
then returned with the other 4400,then taken again,

335
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,690
and none of us remember this
but you?

336
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,610
- It's like they've wiped all our memories.
- But why?

337
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,460
Because they didn't
want us looking for them.

338
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,470
The 4400 were taken and returned
to change the future in some way,

339
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,500
and maybe maia and the others were taken so that they
could change it again,but I don't know,and I don't care.

340
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,210
All I know is that four days ago,
she was here with me,

341
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,070
and I need you to believe
that I have a daughter named maia,

342
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,130
and that she's been taken from me.

343
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,920
I don't remember maia,
or the kidnapping,or any of it,

344
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,940
and the idea that my memory's
been messed with scares the hell out of me,

345
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,760
but after everything we've been through
with the 4400,

346
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,800
yes,diana...
I believe you.

347
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,270
- Hello.
- Richard tyler?

348
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,340
Yes. Who is this?

349
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,150
My name is daniel armand.
You know who I am?

350
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,200
Of the nova group?

351
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,520
I think it's time you and I met,richard.
We have a lot to discuss.

352
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,110
I have a lot i'd like to say to you,too,
but I don't think you're going to want to hear it.

353
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,310
Now,you see,that's the problem,right there.
We should be allies,not adversaries.

354
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,860
My group and your organization
have the same goal.

355
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,390
We're advocating
for the rights of the 4400.

356
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,060
Except that you advocate
through assassination and intimidation.

357
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,110
We lack the strength of numbers,richard,
so we use the tools at our disposal.

358
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,300
Is that what you called me for?
To have a debate?

359
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,580
I called to arrange a truce,
and to talk about shawn farrell.

360
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,410
You going to make
more threats against him?

361
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,910
No,we need to discuss
his future,richard.

362
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,100
Because unless you and i
can come to some kind of an agreement,

363
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,710
I'm not sure he's going to have one.

364
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,060
He says I should meet him
on the corner of pike and gorch thursday at 4:00.

365
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,330
And then?

366
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,030
A car will be there to pick me up and take
me someplace for a face-to-face with armand.

367
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,220
Sounds to me like the nova group's
been reading too much john lecarre.

368
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,750
- What did you say?
- I told him i'd think about it.

369
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,400
What is there to think about?
You're not going.

370
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,870
Whoa,let's not rush to judgment.

371
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,940
I've dealt with this guy before,
remember?

372
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,350
He wants one thing.
You know what it is.

373
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,860
Money,and probably the names and addresses
of every 4400 in our computer.

374
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,380
If they have an ability that he can use,
he will exploit it,and people will die.

375
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,530
People have already died.
Maybe I can stop it.

376
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,880
What,are you going to
make him see the light?

377
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,070
No,but maybe I could stop him
from killing you.

378
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,250
How?
How?

379
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,930
By putting this place and everything
that we've worked for in jeopardy?

380
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,070
I won't let you do that.

381
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,090
Noble words,shawn,but may I remind you
if the nova group wants to strike at you,

382
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,610
I don't think there's any way
we can prevent it.

383
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,670
Thank you for the pep talk,matthew.

384
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,600
Just being realistic.

385
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,160
So am I.If I don't show,it's like a declaration of war,
and we all know who the first casualty will be.

386
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,720
You and jordan collier built this place.
You're its heart and soul.

387
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,960
Then listen to me,richard.

388
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,720
I tried to deal with these people before.
It was a disaster.

389
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,350
I'm warning you...
I'm asking you...

390
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,700
please do not make
the same mistake.Please.

391
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,650
Skouris,I have a list right here of every 4400
who returned that night to highland beach.

392
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,840
There's no maia rutledge,there's no
tyler downing,there's no lindsey hammond.

393
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,580
I've explained that.
They've been erased.

394
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,660
From the records,
from our memories.

395
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,470
Someone has tried to wipe out
every trace of them.

396
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,160
We talked to the families.In the last week,all of them have been
haunted by phantom memories of children they supposedly lost years ago.

397
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
Okay,let's say for a minute
that I am buying any of this,

398
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,230
and I'm not,but if I did,
we don't even know where they were taken.

399
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,850
The future?

400
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,690
That's kind of out of our jurisdiction.

401
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,390
I've seen maia.I've spoken to her.

402
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,560
We both have.

403
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,610
Okay,look,you are asking me
to commit manpower and resource XXXXXXXXXXX

404
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,500
XXXXXXXyou guys play around in.
Look,I'm sorry,but I can't do it.

405
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,230
Uh,you guys
through?

406
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,330
Because I think I found
your kids.

407
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,610
Here we go.
Watch this.

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,790
That's him.
That's tyler.

409
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,330
It's dated september 19th,1893.

410
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,670
They sent him back
further into the past?Why?

411
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,530
Well,that,I can't tell you.

412
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,030
But tyler downing did graduate first in his class
from yale university in engineering.

413
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,720
I knew i'd heard the name before.

414
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,940
In 1915,he helped develop
synthetic petroleum.

415
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,560
You drove to work this morning
because of this guy.

416
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,240
Lindsey hammond.
June 11th,1918.

417
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,550
This is from the estate of robert goddard.
You know,the rocket guy?

418
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,130
He adopted an orphan named lindsey hammond.

419
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,130
XXXXXXXXEventually worked in his lab,

420
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,630
and she invented all the composite materials
used in the first lunar colonies.

421
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,340
Okay,so,what about maia?
Did you find any photos of her?

422
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,850
Uh,no,she...she was a little harder
to track down,

423
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,430
but,uh,
I finally found something.

424
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,450
That's maia's
handwriting.

425
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,530
It's a diary,
from maia rutledge.

426
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,050
Dated april 19th
through september 2nd,1847.

427
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,900
It was written while she was part of a wagon
train making its way along the oregon trail.

428
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm sorry,she crossed the rockies
in a covered wagon?

429
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,380
Uh...no.

430
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,940
She died of smallpox
in october of '47.

431
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,560
She was 25.

432
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,800
No,I'm sorry,shawn,

433
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,400
but it's not my father's decision,it's mine,
and I'm not breaking up with you.

434
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,640
It's got nothing to do with your dad.
Not really.

435
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,500
You and I made some decisions.
We did some things.

436
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,560
We did what we wanted to do,and there's
no reason we can't keep doing that.

437
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,880
We'll be more careful.
My father won't know.

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,330
That's not going to work,
not anymore.

439
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,610
Lying to him,going behind his back,
we've done enough of that.

440
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,040
The truth is,isabelle,
I kind of took advantage of you,

441
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,710
and I'm really sorry.

442
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,450
You are so sweet
the way you worry about me.

443
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,520
I don't want
this relationship to end.

444
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,000
So it's not going to.

445
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,660
I need to see her.

446
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,060
Please,can you take me
to see my daughter?

447
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,500
Diana,you know it's not really
maia you'd be seeing.

448
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,570
Oh,I don't care.

449
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,650
Today I found out
that my daughter,who I loved...

450
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,850
was sent back into the past,
and died 150 years ago,and I'm sorry,

451
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,710
but that's going to
take me awhile i just...

452
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,810
please,let me do this.
I need to say goodbye.

453
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,870
Give me your coat.
I'll put some coffee on.

454
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,870
Ready?

455
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,220
Mommy...

456
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,850
mommy,I'm starving.
Can we have pancakes?

457
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,670
I'll help
make them.

458
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,260
Okay.

459
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,250
Well,I'll need the eggs
from the fridge...

460
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
and bring me
the big plastic bowl.

461
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,150
Oh,my god.
Alana! Alana!

462
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,410
Alana,honey...
my god,you're bleeding.Are you okay?

463
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,050
I-I think so.

464
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,760
Diana...diana,can you
hear me?

465
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,100
Diana,look at me.
What the hell happened?

466
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,650
I thought I was bringing us out.

467
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,910
Well,why isn't she awake?

468
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,970
I couldn't hold on to her.
It's as if she pulled away.

469
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,780
Thomas...I think she's still
inside the dreamworld.

470
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,440
How can she be in there
without you?

471
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,850
I'm not sure.

472
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,780
When you and I separate,
we let go of the illusion,

473
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,300
- but she's not letting go.
- What,she's not coming out?

474
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,130
I think she's happy there
with her daughter,

475
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,370
and she has no intention
of ever leaving.

476
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Oh,come on.

477
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,550
At first I thought she'd suffered
some kind of intracerebral hemorrhage,

478
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,130
but the M.R.I. Didn't show
any bleeding in the brain.

479
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,380
So she hasn't
suffered any damage?

480
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,480
Not yet,but the E.E.G.
Was very troubling.

481
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,770
Her brain activity is far above normal
and continues to accelerate.

482
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,130
The same is true for her heart rate,
her breathing,her blood pressure.

483
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,410
They're all red-lining,
if you will.

484
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,770
Any idea what's causing it?

485
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,950
I really can't say at the moment,but her metabolic
rate can't stay at this level for very long.

486
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,500
Eventually,
her organs will fail.

487
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,840
What,she could die?

488
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,960
Unless we can slow down her rates,
we're looking at a very poor outcome.

489
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,620
Does she have any family?

490
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,310
Yeah.

491
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,580
You should call them.

492
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,350
I need to talk to her.
Can you do that?Take me to see diana.

493
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,940
- Push me a little,mommy.
- Hey,I am pushing you.

494
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,780
Then make it higher.

495
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,460
Look,not
too high.

496
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,120
But that's
the whole fun.

497
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,850
She has a point.

498
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,010
I thought I'd beseeing you two.

499
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,450
I didn't hurt you,did I?
It felt a little jarring when you left.

500
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,010
- I'm fine.
- You,on the other hand,are not.

501
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,270
Well,that's where you're wrong,
because I feel great.

502
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,940
You're in an I.C.U.,Diana.

503
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,390
I thought I might end up there.

504
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,110
What's my heart rate?
Is it 170? 175?

505
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,430
- Higher
- That still probably gives me,what,

506
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,100
anywhere from three weeks to two months?

507
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,440
- That could be forever in here.
- You're talking about suicide.

508
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,420
I appreciate your concern,tom,
I do,

509
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,950
but really,I'd like you to leave now,
both of you.

510
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,700
Listen,diana,believe me--
don't walk away.

511
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,710
The first time I came to one of these places,
I never wanted to leave,

512
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,260
but I came to realize
this is not the world.

513
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,540
None of this is real,
including...maia.

514
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,270
Mommy,push me a little harder.

515
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,730
She's real enough for me.

516
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh,she's not
coming back,is she?

517
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,490
She's going to
die in there.

518
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,440
That seems to be her plan.

519
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,570
I can't help but think this is my fault.
I took her there.

520
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,670
No,don't do that to yourself.

521
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,180
You didn't take maia away.
The people who did that, they're to blame.

522
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,690
Maybe...

523
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,540
but these people,
the future,

524
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,680
they don't seem to care
who they hurt,do they?

525
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,980
No,they don'T.

526
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,890
4:00 is fast approaching.
Have you come to a decision?

527
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,190
Do I want to get in bed
with a terrorist or go to war with one?

528
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,950
That does appear to be the question.
Whatever you decide,you can count on my support.

529
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,910
Isabelle?

530
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,350
Isabelle...

531
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,040
my relationship with shawn
has nothing to do with you.

532
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,010
That's not true.I just care about
what happens to you.

533
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,740
You can care about me all you want.

534
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,600
Just stay out of my business.

535
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,190
- I'm not going to do that.
- Yes,you are.

536
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,710
Isabelle...

537
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,530
Daddy...

538
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,970
Daddy...

539
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,710
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,180
Okay...

541
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,270
it's all right,baby.

542
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,900
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I've been thinking.

543
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,230
You know,ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice after another.

544
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,000
You,your daughter,my son....

545
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,000
it has to stop.

546
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,540
So I have a plan.

547
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,310
I'm not sure it's going to work.

548
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,930
It might be the stupidest thing
i've ever done.

549
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,440
I kind of wish you were here to stop me,

550
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,620
but you're not,and I have to
try something.

551
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,340
Maybe this is goodbye,
maybe it isn'T.

552
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,820
The job wouldn't have been
any fun without you.

553
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,090
Okay,okay.

554
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,660
Okay,this is going to work,
right?

555
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,150
It worked,right?
I'm-- I'm not dead.

556
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,430
Not this time,no.Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.

557
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,780
The children you took,
maia and the others,I want them back.

558
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,310
You were never meant
to remember them.

559
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,780
We went to great lengths to erase
them from your memory,to spare you any pain.

560
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,030
It didn't work.

561
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,920
It appears we underestimated
the bonds they had forged.

562
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,070
It's called family.
Are you familiar with the concept?

563
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,680
You had no right to take them,
treat people like that.

564
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,720
Maia was only 25 when she died.

565
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,830
Now,either return the children,or put that
rope back around my neck,because I'm done.

566
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,500
In that case,
I need to show you something.

567
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,300
They're alive.

568
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,150
You forced us to go back...

569
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,620
extract them from the timeline,
but returning them to you would be a mistake,

570
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,700
for our time,and for yours.

571
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,180
The 4400 were an experiment
we always knew might fail.

572
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,970
There were so many variables.
It was impossible to predict them all.

573
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,380
So you're telling me
everything you've done,

574
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,570
taking the 4400,sending them back,
it hasn't changed anything?

575
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,000
The catastrophe's still coming?

576
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,460
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.

577
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,200
Enemies?

578
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,160
There are those among us
who would prefer history to remain unchanged,

579
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,590
that the 4400 fail in their mission.

580
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,620
You mean,
they want humanity to die out?

581
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,390
They are convinced
that they will survive.

582
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,020
Not only survive,
but benefit from the chaos.

583
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,690
If you think we are heartless,I assure you
that the other side is unimaginably more brutal,

584
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,580
and they've let loose
a terrible evil into your time.

585
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:34,990
Sending these children further back into the
timeline was an attempt to combat that evil.

586
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,880
If we return them to you,all the good that
they've done in the past will be negated.

587
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,010
The 4400 and everything that they were
meant to achieve will be in jeopardy.

588
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,580
This evil,there has to be
some other way to deal with it.

589
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,660
There is.

590
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,660
You.

591
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,770
You are the other way.

592
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,810
It's a burden that we had hoped
not to place on you.

593
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,810
If you return maia and the others,
I'll do whatever you want.

594
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,980
What we want,
you may not be willing to give.

595
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,270
Do we have a deal or not?

596
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,150
We do,but it's a deal I'm afraid
you'll come to regret.

597
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,900
Hello!

598
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,530
Hello!

599
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,680
Is there anyone here?

600
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,380
Tom Baldwin

601
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,910
Maia?

602
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,550
- Tom!
- Maia...

603
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,570
maia...

604
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,160
it's okay.
He works with my mom.

605
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,500
- We were kidnapped.
- Where is sara?

606
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,220
- Can we go home?
- Did you catch her?

607
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,080
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
Yes. Shh... you're all going home.

608
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,380
It's over.
You're all safe now.

609
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,940
- Is my mom here?
- She's not here,

610
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,460
but I'll take you to her,okay?

611
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,380
Hello.

612
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,260
Has he arrived yet?

613
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,620
Then he's made my choice for me.

614
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,510
Where are you hiding?
Come on...

615
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,400
I know you're watching me.
I know you're listening.

616
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,410
I found you.

617
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,280
I found your bug.
I found your stupid little bug.

618
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,100
Okay,sweetie,
lights out.

619
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,500
It's still early.

620
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,080
It's 9:30,
and it's time for bed.

621
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay,but first I need you
to do something for me.

622
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,900
Maia,
no stalling.

623
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,680
Mommy,please.It won't take long.
All you have to do is shut your eyes.

624
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,340
All right.Okay,well,they're shut.
Now what?

625
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,270
Maia?

626
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:40,570
I'm here,mommy.
You can open your eyes now.

627
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,050
Mommy?

628
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,670
Wake up.

629
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,830
It's okay.
I'm back.

630
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,190
Everything's fine...

631
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,750
but you have to wake up.

632
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,390
Mommy,please,wake up.

633
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,870
Please...

634
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,840
maia?

635
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,190
Maia?
