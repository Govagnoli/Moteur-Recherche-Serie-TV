1
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,931
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,204
I'm blacking out.

3
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,292
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,445
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to NTAC medical?

5
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,319
Let me see if I've got this straight.

6
00:00:55,354 --> 00:01:00,662
You two met, fell in love, and spent eight years
together in some kind of alternative reality?

7
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:02,998
Liv, you were pretty far
gone last night.

8
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,675
When I O.D., it's not going
to be any big loss, right?

9
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,090
Maybe I can save you.

10
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:09,638
Whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.

11
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:12,151
That's easy to say.
You don't know what "it" is.

12
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:16,378
You told me everything
that happened that night, right?

13
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:17,458
Yeah.

14
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,274
If you need some time
to clear your head

15
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:22,857
and get away from everything
so you can figure stuff out,

16
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:24,501
I can make that happen.

17
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:25,273
Dad,

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,399
I had to leave. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:33,716
Look, I'm not interested in excuses.

20
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,343
I don't care how you do it,
who you have to lean on,

21
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,738
you just get him out of
lock-up and over to L.A.X.

22
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,300
I want him on
the next plane out.

23
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:47,808
Skouris, where's Baldwin?

24
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:50,356
He's not in yet, why?
What's going on?

25
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:54,395
L.A.P.D. is holding some piece of street garbage
who wants to see daylight again.

26
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,035
Says he can make the dealer
who sold the Collier murder weapon.

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,714
Who's handling
the L.A. interview?

28
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:01,461
Nobody. I'm having him shipped
up here for questioning.

29
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,690
This one feels good.

30
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,391
My partner's going to
like hearing that.

31
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,843
You can fill me in when
I get to the office.

32
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:13,205
Look, I know we're not ready
to pop any champagne yet, but

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,855
this witness has intel we kept out of the media,
specific details about the Collier murder weapon.

34
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,510
Sounds like we finally
caught a break.

35
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,201
Look, Diana, I really have to go.

36
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:23,805
Are you okay?
You sound a little distracted.

37
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,883
It's personal business.
Not your worry.

38
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,868
Well, any idea
what time you'll be in?

39
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,300
I can't really say just yet.

40
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:31,705
Look, I'll get in touch with you
as soon as I can, okay?

41
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,891
Okay, no problem.

42
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:33,631
Bye.

43
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,224
How long has this been going on?

44
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,940
Calm down.

45
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,086
No. I asked you a question.
How long?

46
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,190
Look, Kyle told me, like, a month ago.

47
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,354
Look, you remember that night?

48
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,035
Wha...

49
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:47,489
What night?

50
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:50,448
The night that he almost got arrested
for smashing that store window.

51
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:51,561
You mean when he got drunk?

52
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:54,426
He never said he was drunk.
You said he was drunk.

53
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,187
Kyle said he blacked out.

54
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,891
It happened a bunch of times
after that. One minute,

55
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:04,498
he'd be one place, the next thing
he knew, he was someplace else.

56
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,154
He never mentioned it to me.

57
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,103
He never said anything.

58
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,252
Well, he tried once,
but you wouldn't listen.

59
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,037
Look, you could have
come to me, Danny,

60
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,033
told me what was going on.
He's your cousin, your friend.

61
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:17,053
Which is why I promised him not to.

62
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,529
The last thing Kyle wanted was to
be thrown back into quarantine.

63
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:27,402
Danny, Kyle never came
home last night.

64
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,724
If you know where he is,
please, tell me.

65
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,812
He went to stay with Shawn
over at the 4400 center.

66
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:37,646
Great.

67
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,632
Uncle Tommy...

68
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,851
There's something else
you ought to know.

69
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,327
Kyle thinks he did something
during one of his blackouts.

70
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,197
He wouldn't tell us what it was,

71
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,263
but he really seemed
freaked out about it.

72
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,886
This is the committee
latest recommendation

73
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,859
37-year-old pipe fitter from Detroit.

74
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:02,170
He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
disease four months ago.

75
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,226
When do we fly him in?

76
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,072
Two days from now.

77
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:04,800
Shawn.

78
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,068
Where is he?

79
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,369
Who? Kyle? He's not here.

80
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,457
Don't play games with me, Shawn.

81
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,510
Can you excuse us, Lucy?

82
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:14,414
Thank you.

83
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,103
Danny said Kyle came here.

84
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,838
Yeah, well, Danny needs to check his text
messages, because Kyle never showed.

85
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,841
You're not listening to me, Shawn.
I want my son.

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,180
You're not hearing me.

87
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:26,785
He's not here. Where do you think
I have him stashed, in the basement?

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,886
I wouldn't put it past you.

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,047
Oh, my g...
uncle Tommy!

90
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:33,816
Just because Kyle is having a rough time
does not make it my fault!

91
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,131
Been known to happen, Shawn.

92
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,538
He's not here!

93
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:39,497
he's not here.

94
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:56,961
Kyle?

95
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:02,374
Thomas.

96
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:05,826
I picked this up
in a village outside Barcelona,

97
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,449
and they said it was very special.

98
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,570
What's wrong?

99
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,469
Kyle never told me any of this.

100
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,937
At least I'm not the only one
out of the loop.

101
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,330
I thought the doctors said he was
fine when he left quarantine.

102
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,364
They did...

103
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:26,176
But he spent three years with a separate
consciousness living inside of him.

104
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,342
I don't think the doctors
knew what to do with that.

105
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:29,898
Have you called the police?

106
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,858
I can't get them involved,
not until I know what Kyle did.

107
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,253
What about Linda?

108
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,445
Well, she says she hasn't heard from him.
Promises to call if she does.

109
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,013
I'm sorry about all of this.

110
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,688
I'm just glad I'm back.

111
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:53,327
Where are you going?

112
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:55,464
Well, I'm not going
to find him sitting here.

113
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:56,885
I'll come with you.

114
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,712
No. Look... I'd rather you
stay here by the phone.

115
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,344
This way, if he calls...

116
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,493
You'll be here.

117
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,455
Okay.

118
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:07,851
I'll stay in touch.

119
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,686
And this guy is some
big-deal media consultant?

120
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,029
Oh, he's more than that.

121
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:18,481
Keith Petrick has prepped prime
ministers, members of parliament.

122
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,440
I'd say an interview with Sky News
merits a few hours' homework.

123
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:25,169
So he's going to tell me what? Just new and
different ways to say "we're not a cult?"

124
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,026
No,

125
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,586
he's going to teach you
to stay on message.

126
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,110
The British press loves
to play "gotcha".

127
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,746
Keith.

128
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,200
Matthew Ross. Thank you for coming.

129
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:36,985
This is Shawn Farrell.

130
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,558
Hi. Nice to meet you.

131
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,261
Shawn.

132
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,927
Just one minute. Sorry.

133
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:49,335
Uncle Tommy came to see me.

134
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,155
Yeah. That's what I figured.
He came here, too.

135
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,060
What'd you tell him?

136
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,737
Well, the truth.
Kyle ditched us. He never showed.

137
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:56,791
Listen,

138
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,609
you know, he might still show up.

139
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:00,107
- You know?
- Yeah.

140
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:01,920
I'd give you the big tour, but...

141
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,459
Yeah. No. Things are crazy. I get it.

142
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:05,971
Wait, just wait, just wait.
Liv. Liv. Hey.

143
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,277
This is Danny, my brother.

144
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:09,192
- Hi.
- Hey.

145
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:10,942
This is Liv.
She's one of our first keys.

146
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,327
Actually, I'm second key now.

147
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,055
Really?

148
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,216
I'm impressed. Star pupil.

149
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:17,957
Hey, do you think
you could give him a tour?

150
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,273
You know, Shawn, you don't have to...

151
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:22,135
I want you to see the place.
Just hold on. Is that cool?

152
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:23,509
Sure. Yeah.

153
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,507
It's cool.

154
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,151
You two kids have fun.

155
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:28,138
I've got to... I have to
go back to work, so...

156
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,034
That's my brother,
off to heal the world.

157
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,854
Somebody has to.

158
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,343
You ready?

159
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:37,810
Yeah. I'm all yours.

160
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,552
I know who sold the rifle
that killed Collier.

161
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:44,912
That's a start.

162
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,568
Do we have a name?

163
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,750
Victor Rios.

164
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,410
R-I-O-S.

165
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,285
He lives at 43207

166
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,859
Sumac Drive.

167
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,594
S-U-M-A-C...

168
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,850
I've got it. Thank you.

169
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,631
I'm at Victor's place last month.

170
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,087
He gets all cranked up and starts
waving this cannon around

171
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,819
like he's the second coming
of Tony Montana.

172
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,512
He wants to swap it
for some of my product.

173
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,919
I told him I wasn't interested.

174
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,397
Can you describe
the weapon, Mr. Kovec?

175
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:21,487
I watched him put
that sucker together.

176
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:24,602
.50 caliber.
Never saw bullets so big.

177
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:27,925
And it had this humongous
scope on it,

178
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,130
like a huge neon sign
saying "can't miss".

179
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,668
What makes you so sure this was
the weapon that killed Collier?

180
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:35,359
Because...

181
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:39,985
... next time I saw Rios, he was bragging on
how much he scored for that piece.

182
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,500
This was, like...

183
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,967
Two days before Collier
got taken out.

184
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,797
I figure that's not a coincidence.

185
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:50,298
What do you think?

186
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,401
I ask you to give him a quick tour,
and two hours later...

187
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,596
She's a good guide.
Really sells this place.

188
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,780
Danny was expecting
shaved heads and robes.

189
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,142
Yeah. I didn't see
a single tambourine.

190
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,129
Are you disappointed?

191
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:05,064
Ah, you don't hear
me complaining.

192
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,600
So, hey, listen, big boss man,

193
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:09,796
you let your workers off
the farm at night?

194
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,896
So I invited Liv to a party,
but she's too shy to ask if it's okay.

195
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,102
Think of her like a missionary...

196
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,779
... a lot of potential recruits
out there at the Northmount campus.

197
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:20,667
Could be cool. I haven't left
the center in a while.

198
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,727
I don't think it's a good idea.

199
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,238
I'm sorry, man. You're going to have
to find yourself a different date.

200
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:29,576
Who are you, her warden?

201
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:30,197
Danny.

202
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:36,619
Listen, you guys can hang out here
as much as you want, no problem.

203
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:38,674
But a kegger,
that's an different story.

204
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,572
The wise and powerful
Shawn has spoken.

205
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,695
I hear and obey, your majesty.

206
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:47,724
I'm serious.

207
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,365
Since when did Shawn have
such a problem with keggers?

208
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,206
Since he developed
a messiah complex.

209
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,489
So what time's this party?

210
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:13,295
All right.

211
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:18,438
I woke up in the middle of the night and there
was Kyle, out here, crouching in the hallway.

212
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,471
With no idea how he got there.

213
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:21,458
That's right.

214
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,900
And I sent him away.

215
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,260
You were, uh..

216
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,017
you were scared.
It's understandable.

217
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,907
Not as scared as he was.

218
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,700
I told him he needed to get help, that
he should talk to you about these blackouts.

219
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,882
I wish he had.
We'd have worked it out.

220
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:38,538
Well, he wanted to.

221
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:40,804
Then what stopped him?

222
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,682
Look, Mr. Baldwin, your relationship
with your son is none of my business...

223
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:48,459
Agreed, but if you have
something to say, say it.

224
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,146
I'm sure Kyle loves you...

225
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,107
But I don't think he really trusts you.

226
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:57,863
What?

227
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,592
He told you that?

228
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,731
Pretty much.

229
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:06,201
Eggs, butter, walnuts,
cocoa powder.

230
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,666
Who said making
brownies was difficult?

231
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,919
Don't forget to preheat
the oven at 350 degrees.

232
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,811
Uh-oh.

233
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,406
Now things are getting
really complicated.

234
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,343
Relax.

235
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,339
I'm just kidding.

236
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,737
Yeah?

237
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:28,567
Now?

238
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:35,239
No. That shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to get a sitter first.

239
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,597
If there's a problem,
I'll call you back.

240
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,413
I'm sorry, sweetie, I've got to go
to work. I'll call Mrs. Skalka, see...

241
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,270
No, wait. Don't go.

242
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:47,178
Well, I have to. We can make
brownies another time.

243
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,503
That man...

244
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:51,817
You don't want to catch him.

245
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:53,954
What man?

246
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,946
The man you're chasing after.

247
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,118
Someone's going to get hurt.

248
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:01,583
Who?

249
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:04,683
Is it someone I work with?

250
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,114
I don't know.
Just don't go.

251
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,247
Are you worried about me?

252
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:12,705
Don't go.

253
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:23,066
Do you think I should get to
my car and head for the border?

254
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,295
Or ask to be assigned
to another case.

255
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,442
Hmm. Hand the risk
off to another agent?

256
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:29,968
It's not an option.

257
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,148
Have you told Tom?

258
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:36,932
No, not yet. He's been off
the case for a while.

259
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,349
Might be better for his health
if he stays that way.

260
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,153
She said someone was going to
get hurt, but she didn't say who.

261
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:45,771
I don't know.

262
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,223
Maia's visions
aren't usually so vague.

263
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:53,345
This time, she's had a vision
involving her mother.

264
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:57,210
Maybe she doesn't want
to see it too clearly.

265
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:02,130
You're not making me
feel any better.

266
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:04,972
Okay.

267
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:07,896
How about this?

268
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,557
Hmm?

269
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,555
Any better?

270
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:14,811
Sure.

271
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,439
You recognize that man,
Mrs. Rios?

272
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,257
He was a customer
of your husband's.

273
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:21,384
Husband?

274
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:25,493
He got me my green card
and more trouble than I need.

275
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,006
Why don't you ask Victor?
If you can find him.

276
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:31,652
Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.
Your husband has left the country.

277
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,378
Now, we know he's in Puerto Rico.

278
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:35,221
You see? You know more than me.

279
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,701
He didn't tell you he was leaving?

280
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,250
I haven't seen him in two weeks.

281
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,001
Look, I need to get back to work.

282
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:43,252
A month ago, your husband
sold this man a weapon.

283
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:45,802
Your husband is implicated
in a murder, Mrs. Rios.

284
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:47,904
This is not a very good
thing for you.

285
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,358
Particularly if you value
your green card.

286
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:52,519
Why don't you just take
another look at the sketch?

287
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,188
I remember the beanie.

288
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,518
Not a regular customer.
He only stopped by once.

289
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,665
He was the one
who bought the big rifle.

290
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:10,004
And the handgun.

291
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:11,929
What handgun?

292
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:15,745
Uh, you know.
What do you call it? A 9 mm.

293
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,201
Anything else?

294
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:21,675
He was young... in his twenties.
Very quiet.

295
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,819
He only stayed a few minutes,
then left in a taxi.

296
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,488
How do you know that?

297
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,390
I called it for him.

298
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,492
Oh, we're going to
need that number.

299
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:35,014
We were in the middle
of a bio-lab practical,

300
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,676
Kyle stood up, said he'd be
right back, and that was it...

301
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:38,850
Bye-bye.

302
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,022
Didn't see him again
till the next day.

303
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,018
About what time did he leave?

304
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,447
Had to be 7:00, 8:00, tops.

305
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,804
He's wrong, as usual.
It was closer to 6:00.

306
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,564
Don't you remember?
We broke up right after Kyle ditched.

307
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,679
Yeah, look.

308
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,992
Anybody remember the date?

309
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,338
End of last month, wasn't it?

310
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,028
It was the 25th.

311
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:01,141
You sure?

312
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,272
Yeah. I remember when I got back to
the dorm, it was all over the news.

313
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,276
Jordan Collier's murder.

314
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:32,912
Baldwin.

315
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,955
You going to grace us
with a visit tomorrow?

316
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,513
Yeah, I'm hoping, but right now
it's looking doubtful.

317
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,813
Doubtful doesn't cut it.

318
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:44,782
We're closing in on this guy. Look,
we've got real leads, and I need you in here.

319
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,191
What kind of leads?

320
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,329
You want to know?
You get your ass into work.

321
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:00,081
Thomas, it could be anyone.

322
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,911
Look closer.
Tell me there isn't a resemblance.

323
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,255
This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier?

324
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,108
If it happened during one of the blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

325
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:12,231
Not if the future wanted
their number one prophet dead.

326
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,924
So you think they were
controlling him again?

327
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,824
Yeah, directing his actions,
moving him around like a puppet.

328
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:21,339
Anything's possible.

329
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,546
Well, in that case,
he wasn't responsible.

330
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:28,069
The "body snatcher" defense? Alana,
I'm not sure the jury's going to buy it.

331
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:31,510
What the hell do
they want from Kyle?

332
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:34,081
They took four years of his life.
Isn't that enough?

333
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,277
They warned us
about this, remember?

334
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,687
They said you'd be
facing a crisis.

335
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,648
What, and that makes it all right?

336
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,386
They warned me?

337
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:46,859
I don't remember them telling me
they'd turn my son into a murderer.

338
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,232
There must be a reason.

339
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,344
Don't defend them, Alana.
Just don't! They used me...

340
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,195
All of us... Kyle, Shawn.

341
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,133
I'm fed up.

342
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,187
I love him too.

343
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:01,063
I know. I know you do,
Alana. Just...

344
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:09,387
I've got to find him
before NTAC does.

345
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:11,868
I've got to find him.

346
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,809
Stop it.
Serious business.

347
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,588
Your answers are going to determine
how far you would go in the center.

348
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:25,040
If that security guard comes by,
we'll both get kicked out.

349
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,261
Is that far enough?

350
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,889
Okay... question number one...

351
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,686
Did you have fun tonight?

352
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:34,988
Aren't you glad
we didn't listen to Shawn?

353
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:35,962
That's two questions.

354
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:36,913
- Shh.
- Oh!

355
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:40,512
You're supposed to think about your
answers, not say them out loud.

356
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,118
- Right.
- Rules are rules.

357
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:43,058
Okay.

358
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,919
What, are we done?

359
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,163
Question number two...

360
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,756
Are you ready for
the night to be over?

361
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,184
If your answer to question
number two is "no",

362
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,215
remove your goggles

363
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,411
and take your medicine.

364
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,384
Percocet.

365
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,050
Where'd you get these?

366
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,771
At the party. Your buddy had
them in the medicine cabinet.

367
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:26,413
So you stole them?

368
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:33,585
What's going on in here?
This area's closed.

369
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:45,298
Thanks so much, Mrs. Skalka.

370
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,072
I couldn't sleep.

371
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,993
Was that because of me?

372
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,375
Well, I'm home now, sweetie.

373
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,618
No worries.

374
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,447
You know this case
that I'm working on,

375
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:21,003
Can you tell me anything else
about what you saw?

376
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,375
Anything at all?

377
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,778
Because if you're keeping
something from me...

378
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,441
I told you everything.

379
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:34,858
Don't you believe me?

380
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,021
Of course I do.

381
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,624
Are you going to work tomorrow?

382
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,761
Well, honey, it's my job.

383
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,205
Can I go to sleep now?

384
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,492
Sure.

385
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:51,984
Here.

386
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,007
Linda.

387
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:08,815
Have you heard from Kyle?

388
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,573
No. I would've called you if I had.
I was hoping you'd heard something.

389
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,451
Linda, you two talk all the time.

390
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,782
Yeah, I don't remember any law
against it in the divorce settlement.

391
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:19,494
Listen, Linda, if you have
any idea where he is...

392
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,796
What, you think I'm holding
something back?

393
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:23,346
You're the one with all the secrets.

394
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,817
Look, you're his mother. It makes
sense you'd try to protect him.

395
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,367
In any way I could.

396
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,774
But I thought that's why he was
living with you, wasn't it?

397
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,477
Protecting him was
supposed to be your specialty.

398
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:34,525
You want to blame me? Fine.
Go ahead, but I've got to find Kyle now.

399
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,374
What if he doesn't want
you to find him?

400
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,467
I think he may be in trouble.

401
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,017
Serious trouble.

402
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,575
Tom, what is it?

403
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:48,688
What did he do?

404
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,380
At least give me a hint.

405
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,388
You don't want to know.

406
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,591
It's like I said...

407
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,685
You're the one
with all the secrets.

408
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:19,183
Hello?

409
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,978
Kyle, I just spoke to your father.

410
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,861
You didn't tell him where I was.

411
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,583
You came to me because you didn't want to
go back to NTAC. That's what you said.

412
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:29,990
Mom, I can't talk to you
about this, I told you.

413
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:31,892
Well, that's not the whole story, is it?

414
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,189
Mom, please.

415
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,667
Kyle, tell me what's going on.

416
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,327
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

417
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:53,631
- Sure.
- Thank you.

418
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,252
Just don't tell me
"I told you so".

419
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,741
Okay, I won't, but I did.

420
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,664
Don't go blaming Danny for any of this.
It was all me, okay?

421
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,480
The night just got away from me.
I had some beers, and I...

422
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:20,073
You shouldn't be having beers, Liv.
You shouldn't be having anything.

423
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:21,943
A month ago, you were an addict.

424
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:25,853
We can quit the lecture.
I've already packed my bags.

425
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:28,683
You know, you want to quit,
I can't stop you.

426
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,865
But if you want to stay...

427
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,832
and you can promise me that nothing like this
is ever going to happen again, then please,

428
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,593
enjoy life as a first key.

429
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:40,540
I'm a second key.

430
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:42,126
Not anymore.

431
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:47,046
Mr. Farrell? Are you going
to be much longer?

432
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,100
No.
Come in.

433
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:52,459
So I've...

434
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,309
I've got a bunch o
new songs I've written.

435
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:58,080
Maybe I can play them
for you sometime.

436
00:24:58,256 --> 00:24:59,301
Yeah. We'll see.

437
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,562
It's not like I know him better
than you, but we do talk.

438
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,969
And he told you where his
secret hiding place was?

439
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,710
No, but you looked
in all the obvious places,

440
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,906
and Kyle likes his privacy.

441
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:29,383
Maybe you do know him
better than I do.

442
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:00,633
No...

443
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,343
I didn't want to believe it, I kept...

444
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,862
I kept hoping I was wrong
about this.

445
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,405
Thomas, this is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold on to that.

446
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:11,685
okay...

447
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,532
Wait, don't turn around.

448
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,748
Alana,

449
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,838
take this, hide it in the house.

450
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,165
What are you going to do?

451
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:52,915
Go back to work.

452
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,779
All right, I want
this area secured.

453
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,891
Garrity, I want a warrant to have these
lockers opened and searched, ASAP.

454
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:09,697
Well...

455
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:12,268
Look who came out of retirement.

456
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,928
Good timing, Baldwin.
Your partner can bring you up to speed.

457
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,570
That is, assuming
you intend to stick around.

458
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,061
- I'm here.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,426
Well, we do know that two days
before the assassination,

460
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,362
our man arrived at this station
with a bag full of firearms.

461
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,970
Well, he could've gone
anywhere from here.

462
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,999
Yes, so we're canvassing
all the metro routes,

463
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:33,135
we're talking to the baggage handlers,
ticket agents, bus drivers...

464
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,016
That sounds right.

465
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,906
Meantime, we just had
a shoeshine guy

466
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:40,168
I.D. the sketch. He claims he helped
our man make change to buy a locker.

467
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:41,741
Does he recall which locker?

468
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,313
He thinks it's in that
group there.

469
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,436
But all the people who use
these lockers in a month...

470
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:49,953
The odds are, like, 1 in, what, 10,000
we'll turn up anything useful.

471
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:51,762
Yeah, so why are
we even bothering?

472
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:54,192
You never know.
All we need is one print.

473
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,047
Yeah. We can only hope.

474
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,057
I guess.

475
00:27:58,926 --> 00:27:59,900
You okay?

476
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,667
Maia had another vision.

477
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,861
Now, she says if
we catch this guy,

478
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,627
someone's going to get hurt.

479
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,126
Did she say who?

480
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:18,642
Welcome back.

481
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,731
Is Tom here?

482
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,339
Uh, no, he isn't.

483
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:34,744
You must be Alana.

484
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,081
I'm Linda.

485
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,074
I know.

486
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:47,387
That my interview?

487
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,825
I don't want to see it.
I know I sucked.

488
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,338
I wouldn't go
so far as "sucked".

489
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:56,027
But you could do
with more eye contact,

490
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:57,545
better enunciation.

491
00:28:57,674 --> 00:29:00,809
But they didn't drag any unnecessary
dirt out of you, and that's something.

492
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:04,719
I was all distracted. Liv was here right
before, and we got into this thing...

493
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,232
Because you told that junkie
not to go out with your brother.

494
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,416
Ex-junkie.

495
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,493
I'm just trying to protect
her, that's all.

496
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,442
I'm sure that was part of it.

497
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,823
What do you think, I'm jealous of Danny?

498
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:20,993
You do realize that a relationship
with this girl is out of the question.

499
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:21,967
Matthew,

500
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,363
advise me all you want
about the center...

501
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:27,862
But that's where it stops.

502
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,198
You don't understand, Shawn.

503
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,311
You are the center.

504
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:35,082
Everything about you,
everything you do.

505
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,548
You cannot afford to have
an inappropriate relationship.

506
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:40,849
Jordan Collier was all about
inappropriate relationships.

507
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,795
I mean, every girl in this place
was fair game to him.

508
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:47,579
All the more reason
not to repeat his mistakes.

509
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:53,226
So what girl is worthy
of the great Shawn Farrell?

510
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,022
I will let you know
when you meet her.

511
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,640
On to more important things...

512
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:02,550
I wish I had time
to wipe that locker clean.

513
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:04,945
Kyle's prints could be all over it.

514
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,672
We've got to find him,
get him out of town.

515
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,034
Out of the country.

516
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,028
You didn't get anything else out of Linda?
Something she wouldn't tell me?

517
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:15,024
No, she's as scared as we are.

518
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,407
I felt guilty lying to her.

519
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:20,084
The less people who know
the truth, the better.

520
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:24,053
Still, I know how hopeless she feels.
Her son is missing. She needs answers,

521
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:27,880
and all she has to go on
is a three-line goodbye note.

522
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,805
Did you tell her about the note?

523
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,012
No.

524
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,795
She brought it up herself.

525
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,362
I never mentioned it to her.

526
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:40,931
Kyle...

527
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:48,409
Dad.

528
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:01,995
No, Kyle, wait!
Wait!

529
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:03,534
Goddammit!

530
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,241
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!

531
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,807
Enough!

532
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:08,874
Enough, Kyle.

533
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:28,621
Then I have been up on that roof, watching
Collier through the scope, the way the

534
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,744
trigger felt
when I pulled it,

535
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,588
and how his body

536
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:36,252
twisted before it hit the ground...
I mean, I remember all of it,

537
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,729
but it just feels like
somebody else's memories.

538
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,689
They are.

539
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:43,056
You weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

540
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:46,361
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

541
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:50,576
I haven't had another blackout since.
You think it's over?

542
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:53,159
Let's hope so.

543
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,430
How long do you think
I'll be put away for?

544
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:02,242
Kyle, I am not going to let them put you
in prison for something you did not do.

545
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:04,928
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

546
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,874
I just only wish
you would have

547
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,326
told me about these blackouts
when they first started.

548
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,591
You tried.
I didn't listen.

549
00:34:23,285 --> 00:34:24,142
You know...

550
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:27,544
It's not a new thing, dad.

551
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,537
I... I know I haven't always
been there for you, Kyle, but I...

552
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:40,036
... I thought we had
a pretty good relationship.

553
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:41,399
We do. It's just,

554
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:47,098
you know, growing up with a dad who works for
the FBI, NTAC... it can be pretty intense, you know?

555
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,959
You mean I can be
pretty intense.

556
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:53,991
You can be scary at times.

557
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,193
If you don't believe me, ask mom.

558
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,908
I don't have to.
I believe you.

559
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,225
I'm sorry, dad.

560
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,090
Me too.

561
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,191
Hey, baby.

562
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,197
- Kyle.
- Hi.

563
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,134
I packed a few things for you.
Anything else you need, we'll get in Brussels.

564
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,319
What time is the flight?

565
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,094
Noon.

566
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:47,300
All right, we'd better check in at
the airport. We'll be safer there.

567
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:50,565
Okay, I emailed my friend,
and they'll meet us when we land.

568
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:52,725
They promised
to take good care of Kyle.

569
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:54,686
Say goodbye to mom for me, okay?

570
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:55,649
- Sure.
- Yeah

571
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,998
I promise to break
the news to her gently.

572
00:35:58,326 --> 00:36:01,870
- I'll come and visit you as soon as I can, Kyle.
- That'd be good.

573
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:02,633
Okay.

574
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,134
- I love you.
- I love you.

575
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:12,914
All right.

576
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:14,535
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.

577
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:17,552
Alana...

578
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:21,318
Keep a close eye on him, okay?

579
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:24,218
I will, Thomas.
I will.

580
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:16,369
So far, we've found two ounces of hash,
some bootleg DVDs,

581
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:20,150
and three dop kits that belong to people
who shower in the terminal bathrooms.

582
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:26,070
I'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat "X"
marked through it, all covered in usable prints.

583
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,091
Yeah.

584
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,263
Is everything okay at home?

585
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:39,081
Because if you need to take care
of business, now is a good time.

586
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:41,676
I can hang with forensics
in case something turns up.

587
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:43,047
Thanks. I'll, uh...

588
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,231
I'll stick around here.

589
00:37:48,554 --> 00:37:49,411
Skouris.

590
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:52,568
When did that happen?

591
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:55,233
No. We'll be right there.

592
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,769
That was Jarvis.
She just got a call from Metro West.

593
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,066
They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago,
claim he's our guy.

594
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,418
Roy Keith Marsden.

595
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,836
25, unemployed.

596
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:47,934
Made threats against Collier
after his uncle joined the 4400 center.

597
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:49,285
Oh, and get this...

598
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:51,891
He owned a .50-caliber JHLP-6.

599
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:33,478
Alana?

600
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:35,679
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

601
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:38,208
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.

602
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:56,158
You know, if you're here to give me
grief about Liv, you can forget it.

603
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:59,058
What happened was
your screw-up, not mine.

604
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:00,808
You know,

605
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:02,580
you could've pulled me aside,

606
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:05,756
told me she had this drug problem.
I would've backed off.

607
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,247
So

608
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:11,298
if you're expecting me to apologize
and kiss your robe, you're wasting your time.

609
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:13,141
I didn't come here for that.

610
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,059
Look, I just don't want
this to become a big thing.

611
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:22,159
Ok, when we were kids
we used to fight like crazy.

612
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,174
Yeah. All the time.

613
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:30,047
Yeah, and then the next day, we'd blow it off.
Everything would go back to normal.

614
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,959
Yeah.
Simple as that.

615
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,754
Nothing wrong with simple.

616
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:44,138
Are you, uh, planning on standing there,
or are you going to help me out here?

617
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:45,603
With the car?

618
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:49,607
I don't wash cars anymore.
I've got people that do that for me.

619
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:50,523
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

620
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:52,692
Yeah, well, I don't, so...
grab a sponge.

621
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:54,043
Oh, see, now...

622
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:57,917
I should've known
I was going to get wet.

623
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:00,207
Yeah, attaboy.
Get your hands dirty.

624
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:01,914
It's been a while, huh?

625
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:46,242
Come on.

626
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:55,142
Hey, sweetie.

627
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:55,997
Hi.

628
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:58,212
Look, I know you've
already had dinner,

629
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:00,741
but what do you say we take
another crack at those brownies?

630
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:01,645
Okay.

631
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:02,883
Great.

632
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:04,680
So how was your day?

633
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:05,769
Pretty good.

634
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,002
Good.

635
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:09,809
Aren't you going
to ask me about mine?

636
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:13,343
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for, and guess what.

637
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:15,210
Nobody was hurt.

638
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:17,754
So there's nothing to worry about.

639
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:20,267
It's all over.

640
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:24,599
Not yet.
