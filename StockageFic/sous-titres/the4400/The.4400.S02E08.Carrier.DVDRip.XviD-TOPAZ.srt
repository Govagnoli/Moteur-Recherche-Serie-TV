1
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:40,767
We're not a threat.

2
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,201
We're salvation.

3
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,234
The world
will have to deal with us.

4
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,667
Previously on the 4400...

5
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,001
As far as
this department knew,

6
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,800
Maia wasn't having
visions anymore.

7
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:50,433
She was keeping them
secret from me

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,800
and writing everything
down in a diary.

9
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:52,901
It's a subpoena.

10
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,967
What do they want?

11
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,167
Your diary.

12
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,400
Don't reveal
your healing ability,

13
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,400
because if you heal
one of them,

14
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,667
you're going
to have to heal them all.

15
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:00,667
One day,

16
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,201
all of this will be yours.

17
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:05,134
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.

18
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,334
Everything's in place.

19
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,934
He had a vision
to save the future,

20
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,067
and now he won't be here

21
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:14,767
to see us achieve it.

22
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,134
But we will achieve.

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,901
None of this
is real to me either.

24
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,500
This is where they altered us,

25
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,867
gave me the ability

26
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,600
to create the world
we've been living in

27
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,101
for the last eight years.

28
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,334
I love you, Thomas.

29
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,700
So, let me see
if I've got this, um, straight.

30
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,901
You two met,

31
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,301
fell in love,

32
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:40,268
and spent eight years
together

33
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,700
in some kind of...

34
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,001
alternate reality,

35
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,734
and now you're here,

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
with eight years of love
and marriage under your belts,

37
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,700
in what to us was...

38
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,067
no time at all.

39
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:52,867
Yeah, that...
that about sums it up.

40
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:54,368
Yeah.

41
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,034
I'll play along.

42
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,467
But if you two start
calling each other "honeybunny",

43
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm so out of here.

44
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,268
I told you
he'd try, Thomas.

45
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,034
How'd you know that?

46
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,667
Well, you might be meeting me
for the first time,

47
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,967
but I know all about you.

48
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,034
You're smart,

49
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:09,134
your favorite writer
is Alan Moore,

50
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,301
and your favorite meal

51
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,301
is meatloaf.

52
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:13,467
But I can't be
exactly the same.

53
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,867
You said there was no 4400,

54
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:19,567
so that means
no coma, no time lost...

55
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:20,834
no major problems.
That's right.

56
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:21,934
You were happy.

57
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,934
Successful.

58
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,101
Meaning what?

59
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,667
Nothing.

60
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:28,934
We used to talk about
medical school, remember?

61
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,400
Over there,
you went to Stanford.

62
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,334
How'd I do?

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,767
You graduated
with honors.

64
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,268
You became
a neurologist.

65
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:36,467
Must have made you proud.

66
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,767
I'm always proud of you.

67
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,067
Right, but "Dr. Kyle Baldwin"

68
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:43,101
and that world
you were vacationing in,

69
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,334
it came from your mind,
right?

70
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,134
Actually, it was my mind.

71
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,167
Right,
but you created it

72
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,400
using his memories.

73
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,667
Kyle, I'm just as proud

74
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,001
of what
you've accomplished here.

75
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,134
Prouder.

76
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,634
Hey.

77
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,034
You want to know why
all lawyers are jerks?

78
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,800
Because they spend
a lifetime

79
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,734
reading this crap.

80
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,167
What kind of crap,
specifically?

81
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,533
I'm a pretty good
interpreter.

82
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,201
I have 24 hours

83
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:18,301
to turn Maia's diary over
to NTAC,

84
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,500
and not one legal option
to get out of it.

85
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,867
What are you going to do?

86
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,368
Well, what NTAC wants,
NTAC gets,

87
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,101
but I have a 9-year-old
daughter at home

88
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,800
who's counting on me
to protect her.

89
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,034
Any way I can help?

90
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:30,001
Yeah, you can slap me
upside the head

91
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,834
for ever mentioning the diary
in the first place.

92
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,834
It didn't save Collier's life,
and now it's making mine hell.

93
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:38,034
How about I just make
some fresh coffee instead?

94
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,867
Oh... thanks.

95
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,634
Yeah.

96
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,301
Do you think
they'll find

97
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,901
the man
who did it?

98
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,268
If, by "they",
you mean "Thomas",

99
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,934
then yeah, probably.

100
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,433
My dad always gets
his man.

101
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,533
You heading out?

102
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,001
Yes, I have to keep
reminding myself

103
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,268
I don't live here
anymore.

104
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,500
Look, Kyle,

105
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,368
your father and I
love each other.

106
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,567
That's great.

107
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,034
There's not enough love
in the world.

108
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,101
But I just met you.

109
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,700
Give me a few days

110
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,167
before I start
calling you "mom", okay?

111
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,167
You've got
one of those already.

112
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,034
I'll settle for being
a good friend...

113
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,034
and I'll keep bribing you
with meatloaf

114
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,134
until you give in.

115
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,334
Oh...

116
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,834
Hello, Mr. Ross.

117
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:44,534
Did you have
a good flight?

118
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,734
Yes. Thanks.

119
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,367
Now, would you like me
to show you around,

120
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,233
or do you want
to get some rest?

121
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,400
Neither.
Take me to Mr. Farrell.

122
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,834
Yes, sir.
Right this way.

123
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,267
They've
been waiting.

124
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,467
Three days.

125
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:57,034
Tell publicity
I'm not sure yet.

126
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,701
They're saying
we're past our deadline.

127
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,133
We have to release
this press statement.

128
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,801
This is supposed to be coming
from me?

129
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,601
I don't even understand
half of what it says.

130
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,367
It doesn't sound
like me, Lucy.

131
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,034
So change it.

132
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,233
You're the boss.

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,601
Oh, and legal
needs signatures now,

134
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,867
or no one gets paid,
including legal.

135
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,667
I can only do one thing
at a time.

136
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,001
So let's start

137
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,400
with the statement.

138
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,801
Why don't you dictate
something to me?

139
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,467
No press statement.

140
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:25,834
If the press wants to know

141
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:26,834
what Mr. Farrell
is thinking,

142
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,734
they can watch
60 minutes

143
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,100
along with the rest of America.

144
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,601
I've already booked
an exclusive interview

145
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,300
with our new face
of the 4400.

146
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,867
That's all for now.

147
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,634
Thanks.

148
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,034
I'm sorry to just jump in
like that.

149
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,167
I thought you could use a hand.

150
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,233
Matthew Ross.

151
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,434
Yes.

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,367
Yeah.

153
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,300
What are you doing
in Seattle?

154
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,068
I go
where I'm needed.

155
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,233
You've come
to the right place.

156
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,701
It's no coincidence, Shawn.

157
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,167
Jordan made it clear
that, in the event of his death,

158
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,667
I was to step up,
front and center,

159
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,634
to help you out.

160
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,068
Well, another in a long line
of plans

161
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,068
that Jordan neglected
to share with me.

162
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,500
Huh.

163
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,934
But I'm glad
you're here.

164
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,367
Jordan talked about you a lot...

165
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:14,901
You're going to need
to hire yourself a new lobbyist.

166
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,834
I'm moving to the home office
for the time being.

167
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,901
Pick any office you want.

168
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,267
You start right away.

169
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,267
Uh, these letters?

170
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,434
Everyone knows I can heal now.

171
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,001
Jordan had every intention

172
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:25,233
of revealing
your healing ability

173
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,567
to the public,

174
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,834
but he was planning on doing it
in stages.

175
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,667
We don't have
that luxury anymore.

176
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:30,801
We'll deal with it.

177
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,334
I can't go outside anymore.

178
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,867
There's sick people.

179
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,834
The press,
they follow me everywhere.

180
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,567
And they will
for the rest of your life.

181
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,267
The ground just shifted
under your feet.

182
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:43,001
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

183
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:46,100
This center
is the new Lourdes.

184
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,500
Nobody's going to be calling us
a "cult" anymore.

185
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:51,601
We're turning away people
faster than we can sign them up.

186
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,968
In 10 years,
this movement's going to be

187
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,167
one of the dominant faiths
on the planet.

188
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,167
Stop.

189
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,968
I'm glad things are going
so well, I am,

190
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,634
but a week ago,

191
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,034
I was just some guy trying
to beat the last level of Doom.

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,334
I wasn't the pope then,
and I'm not the pope now.

193
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,734
Yes, you are,

194
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,867
and you need to start
getting used to it.

195
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,567
The FBI is spearheading
the hunt for the man

196
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,133
who killed Jordan Collier.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,901
Oh, but we're still in the game,
and NTAC is making this collar.

198
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:24,934
I'm not having someone else
clean up our mess for us.

199
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,701
Then we'd better get moving.

200
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,233
We all know
there's an expiration date

201
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,634
on these manhunts.

202
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,001
Trail starts getting cold
after 48 hours.

203
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,901
I want another look at employee
sign-in sheets

204
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,601
for every office building
and parking garage

205
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,334
within a 10-block radius
of the center.

206
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,634
We've already cross-examined
everyone on those books.

207
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,367
Then we have to look
off the books.

208
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,001
This guy shot a public figure
in broad daylight.

209
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,934
There has to be an eyewitness.

210
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,601
And so far, Tom, the only one
who has seen this killer

211
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,867
is you.

212
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,901
Loser.

213
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,100
Pathetic loser.

214
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,901
Sweetie, whatever you do,
never, ever gamble.

215
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,667
It's wrong
and it's stupid.

216
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,767
Then why do you do it?

217
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,233
Because,
unlike your mommy,

218
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,601
your aunt April doesn't
have a steady income.

219
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,300
She's an artist,

220
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,534
and artists
always need cash,

221
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,034
which is where the "stupid" part
comes in,

222
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,400
because I always lose.

223
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,334
So this whole
"see the future" thing,

224
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,367
it doesn't just apply
to earth-shattering events, huh?

225
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,068
Not always.

226
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,167
So, if I were to ask you
which card...

227
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,534
that one.

228
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,367
I'll take this one right here.

229
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,367
Thanks.

230
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,367
Baby girl...

231
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,034
you are my new lucky charm.

232
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,567
I'm pulling you off
the Collier case.

233
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,634
What are you
talking about?

234
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,068
We still have half
that neighborhood to canvass.

235
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,500
It's going to have to wait.

236
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,634
At 10:37 a.m.,
pacific standard,

237
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,968
the federal emergency
management agency

238
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,767
sent in a task force

239
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,434
to Granite Pass, Oregon,
population 273,

240
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,968
where there's been
an outbreak

241
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:20,001
of a lethal, highly contagious,
and as yet unidentified virus.

242
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,434
Airborne?

243
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,567
Mm-hmm. Yeah, likely.

244
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:23,567
Man-made?

245
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:24,567
Unknown.

246
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,068
What we do know is,

247
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,667
if you went to sleep
in Granite Pass last night,

248
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:28,901
chances are you're filling out
a body bag this morning.

249
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,968
There's only
one resident

250
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,801
that FEMA hasn't
accounted for yet.

251
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,367
Jean Delynn Baker,
age 30.

252
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,434
Returnee 0188.

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,934
Disappeared in '99.

254
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,034
Divorced. No kids.

255
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,834
Psych profile says
she's a loner.

256
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,001
Things have been
pretty grim for her

257
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,267
since she got back.

258
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,534
Hasn't been able
to hold down a job.

259
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:45,601
She was unemployed
four times

260
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,034
in the last year.

261
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
And now she's the only resident
of Granite Pass, Oregon

262
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,701
who can't be
accounted for.

263
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:51,901
So we've got two possibilities.

264
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,167
Either she's immune
to this virus,

265
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,834
in which case we could
study her,

266
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,100
look for a cure.

267
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,334
Or else...
she's the carrier.

268
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,034
Either way,
your job is the same.

269
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,300
Use whatever resources you need
and find her.

270
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,867
So, are you
going to tell me

271
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:09,934
where you're headed?

272
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,734
I never could
stand the sight

273
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,601
of a woman in tears.

274
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,367
I guess that's why
I never got married.

275
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,934
You in some kind
of trouble?

276
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,367
Run off
on your family?

277
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:30,068
Law on your tail?

278
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,267
Seattle.

279
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,334
I'm going to Seattle.

280
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,334
That's a big city.

281
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
You want me to just drop you
on the edge of town?

282
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm going to the 4400 center.

283
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,500
I've got to get there.

284
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,068
What the hell for?

285
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,534
Are you joining up?

286
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,734
Just get me as close
as you can.

287
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,200
Please.

288
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,734
If you're looking
for salvation,

289
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,300
you're not going
to find it there.

290
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,300
What you want to do

291
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,500
is to give yourself
over...

292
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,867
to your true lord
and savior.

293
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:57,801
Purification day
is coming.

294
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,267
Signs are everywhere...

295
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:02,167
pestilence, plagues.

296
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,767
Tell me about it.

297
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,701
I woke up in a town
full of dead people

298
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:06,734
this morning...

299
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,867
my mother,
my father.

300
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,001
Every...
everyone.

301
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,901
Yeah?

302
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,667
How come you survived?

303
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,100
I think maybe I caused it.

304
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,100
You?

305
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:19,567
Now I know you're
messing with me.

306
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:22,601
Okay, go ahead,
laugh at the Jesus freak,

307
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,601
but I'm telling you,

308
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,601
the whole world'll be
wiped clean soon enough.

309
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,300
Look, I don't think
you're a freak at all, mister.

310
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,767
Matter of fact,

311
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:35,119
I believe... everything you are saying.

312
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:49,267
The eyes and fingernails show
only slight discoloration.

313
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,634
Rigor mortis
has barely set in.

314
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,000
What did the autopsies show?

315
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,700
Nothing we have a name for.

316
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,301
Their internal
organisms

317
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,367
are pretty much liquefied.

318
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,833
This thing works fast.

319
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
So you just took
your helmet off...

320
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,067
you got a death wish?

321
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,301
This virus gets released,
goes airborne,

322
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,134
then dissipates
within a half-hour.

323
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,934
Seen enough?

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,601
Plenty.

325
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,800
So everyone
we're looking at

326
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:12,800
died this morning

327
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:13,767
because
they were within

328
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,134
the virus's
original radius?

329
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,267
Yeah, and if they
drove through town

330
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,401
an hour later,
they'd be fine.

331
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,501
That's something,
anyway,

332
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:19,668
but Orson Bailey,
Trent Appelbaum...

333
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,467
when a 4400
manifests an ability,

334
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:23,000
it can get more intense,
quickly.

335
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,767
Which means that
if Jean Delynn Baker

336
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,401
is transmitting
the virus...

337
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,167
Yeah, she might be
just warming up.

338
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,134
The doctors say

339
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,467
they cannot stop
my cancer from spreading.

340
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,700
... and I've worked
hard all my life,

341
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,434
but tuberculosis has
eaten up our life's savings,

342
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,700
and my beloved wife
of four years can barely...

343
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,000
Grandma
told me to pray,

344
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,434
so when I saw you
on tv,

345
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,334
I knew
that you would...

346
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,767
Help me.
Please.

347
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,301
Shawn?

348
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,434
It's Lucy.

349
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,467
You're scheduled

350
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:54,601
for the new keys
address.

351
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:55,467
Everybody's waiting.

352
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,668
Shawn?

353
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,733
Yeah, I'm flattered.

354
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,867
I'm just not sure

355
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,700
I can take a job
right now.

356
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,234
Richard's going to be
travelling quite a bit.

357
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:11,434
The daycare here is first-rate
and completely free.

358
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,568
Well, for one thing,
I'm not sure I'm qualified.

359
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:16,234
I mean, assistant director
of human resources?

360
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:19,334
I had my first daughter
right out of college.

361
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,900
You could fit my entire resume
on half a page.

362
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,334
You're a 4400.

363
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,100
That's like an advanced
graduate degree around here.

364
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,601
Besides,
Jordan talked about you.

365
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:28,934
Oh, I'm sure he did.

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,833
He said you had
the gift of empathy,

367
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,301
that you were
a natural born organizer,

368
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:33,467
and that you had a knack

369
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,401
for bringing out
the best in people.

370
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,467
Jordan said that about me?

371
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:38,967
You're a returnee.

372
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,301
You're smart.

373
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,201
We empower people like you
around here.

374
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,900
Wipe your feet.

375
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,467
A killer airborne virus
has been released,

376
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,900
and you're worried
about muddy footprints?

377
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,767
It's still
somebody's home.

378
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,800
So this is where
Jean Delynn Baker lived.

379
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,234
Until she hit
the road, yeah.

380
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,401
Does she keep a schedule?

381
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,867
Any kind of daily planner?

382
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,634
Yeah, but I think
it went out the window

383
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,000
when she realized

384
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,000
her entire hometown
had been wiped out.

385
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,668
Anyone get in touch
with the parents?

386
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,867
This
is their house.

387
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:14,967
They were sleeping
upstairs

388
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,568
when the virus hit.

389
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:17,967
Okay, you guys
aren't leaving this house

390
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,334
until you've been through
everything...

391
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:20,800
letters, phone bills,
grocery lists.

392
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:21,934
Marco, listen to me.

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,668
Find me a pattern,
the way she thinks.

394
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,934
She's on the run.

395
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,334
I want to beat her
to wherever she's headed.

396
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,000
Flirt.

397
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,367
You heard the man.

398
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,967
4400 center.
How may I direct your call?

399
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,301
I didn't mean
to do it.

400
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,501
I didn't mean to kill them.

401
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,234
I...

402
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,501
these... these blisters,
they itch so bad.

403
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,733
Killed who?

404
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,967
I need you
to help me, please.

405
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,267
Who is this?

406
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm a 4400,

407
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,134
and there's something wrong
with me.

408
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,700
Everybody
that I'm around dies,

409
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:53,800
and I don't know
how to stop it.

410
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,267
I don't know
how to stop it.

411
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,534
Tell me your name
and where you are.

412
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,501
How many
people dead?

413
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,668
She said hundreds,

414
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,534
but there's nothing about it
on the news.

415
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,201
Could be
they're trying to keep it quiet,

416
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,234
and there is a 4400
named Jean Baker?

417
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:05,867
She said
she's staying

418
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,067
at a motel near
the Squirrel Hill exit

419
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:08,167
on the 65.

420
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,534
Get me NTAC on the phone.

421
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,833
Yes!

422
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,634
You were right.

423
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,601
Philadelphia creamed 'em.

424
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:22,967
How much
did you win?

425
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,467
$200 for aunt April.

426
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:29,301
All because of you,
my little genius.

427
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,767
Now, I'm looking
at Chicago versus New York,

428
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,401
even up.

429
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,867
Chicago's the home team,
which gives them some advantage,

430
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,000
but New York
is coming off

431
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,700
a three-game
winning streak.

432
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,534
So, who's your pick?

433
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,301
How much are you betting?

434
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:44,967
The whole
200 bucks,

435
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,401
which won't win me
enough to retire on,

436
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,000
but a girl's got
to start somewhere.

437
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,000
So, you getting
anything?

438
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,267
Do you like me?

439
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:58,700
What kind of question is that?

440
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,967
I mean,

441
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,867
like me for myself...

442
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,401
or because I tell you stuff
that's going to happen?

443
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:09,167
Honey, listen.

444
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,434
I love you
for who you are,

445
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,934
not what you can do.

446
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,401
Always.

447
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,501
Okay?

448
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,900
I'd go with Chicago.

449
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,000
Chicago it is.

450
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:26,601
Now, come on.

451
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:29,000
Aunt April is going
to take you out for pizza.

452
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,367
Go wash up,

453
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,733
and take your mom's stuff off.

454
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,467
You know she gets
kind of uptight about...

455
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,934
Maia.

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,501
This is my mother's
engagement ring.

457
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:39,668
Where did you get this?

458
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,568
I always play with it.

459
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,601
This is a very valuable ring,

460
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:46,634
which means

461
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,367
it is not
for little girls

462
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,634
to play with.

463
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,434
Now wash good,
or I'll order anchovies.

464
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,967
Go!

465
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,334
Hey.

466
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,900
Hey.

467
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,967
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how'd you get in here?

468
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,967
Your dad gave me a key.

469
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:14,800
A little early
for dinner, isn't it?

470
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:18,234
Early for eating.
Not for preparing.

471
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,601
Can you cook?

472
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,634
Sorry, I'm a world-class
brain surgeon,

473
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,034
not a chef.

474
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,301
But I can empty
a grocery bag

475
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,167
with the best
of them, though.

476
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,800
But I have
to warn you,

477
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,934
you're ignoring

478
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,934
the number-one
"rule of dad".

479
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,534
Which is?

480
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,434
The longer and more carefully
you prepare for a family event...

481
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,000
the more likely it is
he won't show.

482
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,568
I guess you do know the man.

483
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,568
Which means I guess
you also know me,

484
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:46,201
which, I'm sorry,
is really weird.

485
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,401
You have to admit

486
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,934
it's a little strange
for me, too.

487
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,334
We have an eight-year
relationship,

488
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,800
and I have to
keep reminding myself

489
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,967
that it doesn't really exist.

490
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:57,668
So tell me,

491
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,800
was I, like, number one
in my class in medical school?

492
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,467
What does it matter, Kyle?

493
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,267
You're not in competition
with yourself.

494
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,467
I'm just curious.

495
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:06,700
Well, you keep bringing it up.

496
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,201
It's more than curiosity.

497
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,501
So what if it is?

498
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,167
If you knew there was
some parallel universe

499
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,334
where a better, smarter version
of you was walking around,

500
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:15,733
how would you feel?

501
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,601
He wasn't better,
and he wasn't smarter.

502
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:19,067
He was you.

503
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,568
He just had options
I'll never have.

504
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,867
No 4400,
no coma.

505
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,501
He got to go to medical school.

506
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,568
Who says
you don't have that option?

507
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,767
I'm 21.
I'm a freshman in college.

508
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,267
So you started a little late.

509
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,867
You keep thinking
I know two Kyles.

510
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,201
I don't. I just know you.

511
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,767
You want
to be a doctor?

512
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,668
I know for a fact
that you can pass your MCATs.

513
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,067
Jean Baker's in a motel

514
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,833
about 10 miles ahead.

515
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,800
Right now, half of NTAC
is headed for that place.

516
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,201
Mortimer and Falcone
should be there already.

517
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,367
It's weird, huh?

518
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:51,501
Responding to a tip

519
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:53,668
that came from inside
the 4400 center?

520
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,100
Shawn did tell me

521
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,568
he wanted
to cooperate with us.

522
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:58,000
I guess he meant it.

523
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,800
Excuse me. We're NTAC.

524
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,000
We need to get through here.

525
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,833
I'll open it for you.

526
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,134
So what's going on
down there?

527
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,367
Dead trucker.

528
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,668
Looks like
it came on sudden.

529
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,067
Jean Delynn Baker?

530
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,301
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

531
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,401
I called you for help.

532
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,334
We know.
Come with us.

533
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,634
No, you're scaring me.

534
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,000
Please, stop.

535
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,167
They start to itch
when I get scared.

536
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,267
Please, get away from me!

537
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,833
Oh, god.

538
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,700
That trucker died

539
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,333
not more than
three hours ago.

540
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Yeah, and he couldn't
have picked up Jean

541
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,634
more than two hours
before that.

542
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,967
Which means
he was exposed, infected,

543
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,300
and killed within,
what, 120 minutes.

544
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,534
That's faster

545
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
than any virus
I've ever seen.

546
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:56,634
Mortimer and Falcone.

547
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,867
Looks like
we're playing backup.

548
00:22:57,934 --> 00:22:58,934
Baldwin.

549
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,101
It's not my fault.

550
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,101
Who is this?

551
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,367
I called you for help.

552
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,367
You tossed tear gas
into my room!

553
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,700
Jean Baker?

554
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,400
How did you get
Mortimer's phone?

555
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,700
How do you think I got it?

556
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,867
They scared me.

557
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,634
They... they came barging in
to my room.

558
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,268
What did you do
to them?

559
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,567
I guess you thought
those suits they had on

560
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,700
would keep them safe, huh?

561
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,734
Well, you were wrong, okay?

562
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:24,934
Nobody's safe.

563
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,333
That's why I'm warning you.

564
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,168
You stay away from me, okay.

565
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:31,234
Just keep everyone away.

566
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,034
Where are you?
I'm driving.

567
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,300
I think
she took their car.

568
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,834
Call Jarvis.
Get a bead on it.

569
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:37,067
Jean, tell me
where you are,

570
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:38,067
where you're going.

571
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,333
We want to help you.

572
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,367
No. I tried that.

573
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:41,567
No one can help me.

574
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:42,967
No one ever could.

575
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,500
Why should it be
any different now?

576
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,567
I know you don't want
to kill anyone,

577
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,834
but listen to me,

578
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,400
this virus that's
growing inside you,

579
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,834
it's incredibly lethal.

580
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,234
I've always been toxic.

581
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,201
I poisoned every relationship
I ever had.

582
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,101
This is different.

583
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,067
Yes, they made it real.

584
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,901
My parents always said
I was a walking disaster.

585
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,034
They never got to see
how right they were.

586
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:06,234
Jean, it doesn't have
to be like that.

587
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,367
If you want this
to be over,

588
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,600
it can be.

589
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,067
Just find a deserted
spot, pull over,

590
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,367
and wait for us
to come to you.

591
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,433
I don't need you.

592
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,634
I'm taking care of it myself.

593
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,134
What are you
going to do?

594
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,101
I'm going to end this
before I kill anyone else.

595
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,500
End what?

596
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,967
This phone call, this day,
everything.

597
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,867
No, Jean, just wait.
Hold on. Listen to me.

598
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,600
Goodbye, Baldwin.

599
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,767
She says she's going
to kill herself.

600
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,333
Well, I'm not sure
that's a solution.

601
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,700
It could trigger
another release of the virus.

602
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,101
Do we have a fix on her?

603
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:37,634
Yeah, she's driving west
on the 99.

604
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,168
Jarvis has got three
helicopters in the air.

605
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,567
If she doesn't pull over,

606
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,034
there's orders
to incinerate.

607
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,433
Vacation?

608
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,801
For how long?

609
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,333
A month, maybe two.

610
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,634
I don't know.

611
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,268
You think that's what
the center, the movement,

612
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,367
needs right now?

613
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,433
I don't know, Matthew,

614
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,433
but I'm damn sure

615
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,934
it's what I need
right now.

616
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,467
I think you're going
to have to settle

617
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:58,934
for a long weekend.

618
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,433
I hear puget sound
is nice.

619
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,634
Okay, you're not hearing me.

620
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,834
I'm ignoring you.

621
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,001
There's a difference.

622
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,600
Listen.

623
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,433
I'm not saying
I can't do this.

624
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,101
I will lead this movement.

625
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:14,867
But Jordan just died,

626
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:17,634
and I need some time
to get my head around that.

627
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,134
You're going to have to grieve
on the run

628
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,333
like the rest of us.

629
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,001
It's called being a grownup.

630
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:24,467
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.

631
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,367
You just got here,

632
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,001
and if this place needs me

633
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:32,600
the way that you keep
saying that it does,

634
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,967
then it's going to have
to work around me sometimes.

635
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,234
Work around you?

636
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,433
We can do that.

637
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,834
Mary O'Connell.

638
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,367
Taken 1972.

639
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,834
Very promising empath.

640
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,234
Robert Fields, 1987.

641
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,567
Genius with numbers
and pattern recognition.

642
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:47,734
John Gersten...

643
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,001
Who are these people?

644
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,567
Replacements, potentially.

645
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,567
None of them make
the slam dunk you would,

646
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,300
but I'm ready
to move this center forward,

647
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,433
with you or otherwise.

648
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,333
Jordan used to talk to me
that way sometimes.

649
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,967
He was great at getting me
to see things his way.

650
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,134
You?

651
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:14,067
You're not quite there yet.

652
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,934
Your healing power
makes you unique.

653
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,801
Jordan knew it.

654
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,268
I believed it.

655
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,201
I came here to work with you,

656
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:26,867
but you're asking me
to work around you,

657
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,600
and that I can't do.

658
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:29,867
Then you are going
to have to spend

659
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,667
some quality time
with that list,

660
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,234
because I'm leaving.

661
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm sure you won't
miss a beat, though.

662
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:41,300
I know there's a huge demand
for pattern recognition.

663
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,168
Th-th-that's impossible.

664
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,734
Mortimer and Falcone
were wearing

665
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:52,667
state-of-the-art
biohazard gear.

666
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,268
That stuff's engineered
to withstand an anthrax attack.

667
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,967
They're dead, Marco.

668
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,500
Obviously, whatever
she's releasing

669
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,700
is a little craftier
than the anthrax virus.

670
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,333
If it got through those suits,

671
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,234
that means the antigen's
operating on a subatomic level.

672
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,234
Which basically
makes it unstoppable.

673
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,534
Yeah, pretty much.

674
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,034
Jean told me Mortimer
and Falcone scared her

675
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,201
when they came
into her room.

676
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:12,101
Is it possible
the release of this virus

677
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:13,600
is connected
to her emotional state?

678
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,067
Yeah, more than possible,
it's likely.

679
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,300
Her medicine cabinet
is basically a neon sign

680
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,400
flashing "borderline
personality disorder".

681
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:25,234
She's got cortisone creams
for stress rashes,

682
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,433
an assortment

683
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,367
of your finer
psychopharmaceuticals...

684
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,967
Xanax, Prozac...

685
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:31,201
Yeah, we get it, Marco.

686
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:32,634
She's a wreck.

687
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,534
A wreck whose body acts
as a delivery system

688
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,067
for the virus she's producing...

689
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:39,333
the same way
flowers release pollen.

690
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,001
What, she's emitting
spores?

691
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:42,901
Something like that.

692
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,400
Look, spores are just

693
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,767
reproductive bodies
released by a vascular system.

694
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,333
The human body
is one big vascular system.

695
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,001
It runs on blood flow.

696
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,400
Yeah, which can
speed up or slow down,

697
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,734
depending on moods,
feelings.

698
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:56,433
Right, so when Jean's blood
gets going...

699
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,967
when she's angry,
confused, upset, whatever...

700
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:02,667
a killer virus goes airborne.

701
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:08,634
We're not far
from her car now, Marco.

702
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,500
Any advice on how
to deal with her?

703
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,333
Uh... don't piss her off?

704
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Hey.

705
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,367
Hi.
How are you, Lily?

706
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,467
Good.

707
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,268
I heard, um,
you're leaving for a while.

708
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:36,234
That was fast.

709
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,734
Anyway, yeah, I don't know
how long I'm going to be gone.

710
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,134
What are you going to do?

711
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:46,134
For starters, I'm going to
disappear for a while,

712
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:49,300
and then, um, I don't know,
who knows?

713
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,934
I mean, I don't have
to work here

714
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,467
to make people healthy,

715
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,600
so I guess I could go anywhere.

716
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,067
So you're just
going to kind of roam the earth...

717
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,534
... "Kung Fu" style?

718
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,467
I'm not going to shave my head
and wear a robe,

719
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:02,634
but... something like that,
I guess.

720
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,801
Well, you could take these
with you,

721
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,134
check out
the return address...

722
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:07,500
stop off

723
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,234
in Gloucester, Massachusetts,

724
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,268
do a quick healing,

725
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,500
and then go on your way.

726
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,433
You know about the letters?

727
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,567
Oh, Shawn,
they're everywhere.

728
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,734
Yeah, each one sadder
than the next.

729
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:19,934
It's too much to take, almost.

730
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:24,201
It did give me
an idea, though,

731
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:25,967
but, you know, you're leaving,

732
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:28,268
so we'll talk it over
when you get back.

733
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,867
No, Lily, I mean...

734
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,767
... like I said, I don't know when
that's going to be, so, please,

735
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,700
I would love to hear
what you have to say.

736
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,433
All right, well,

737
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,867
I was thinking...

738
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:42,333
I mean, we're not
a hospital,

739
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,467
and we're not
a charity,

740
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,600
and still, thousands
of these requests

741
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,734
keep pouring in
every day.

742
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,367
I mean, no wonder
you feel overwhelmed.

743
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,767
We're not set up
to handle it.

744
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,101
Yes, exactly.

745
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,801
That's why
I've got to get out of here.

746
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,901
What if we set up a foundation?

747
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,600
Part of this place,
but separate.

748
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,433
Hire a staff
whose only job

749
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,067
is to open
these letters

750
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,300
and find the neediest cases,

751
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,134
people that we can help
that no one else can.

752
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:11,567
But that is still saying no
to thousands of people.

753
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:13,400
Well, that's right, Shawn,

754
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:16,867
but what if we can say yes
to one?

755
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,667
I mean, you heal
one person a day,

756
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,067
every day.

757
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,767
That's a big job, though...

758
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,467
deciding who deserves it most.

759
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:35,300
Well, so you form a committee,

760
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:39,333
and you load it up
with doctors and social workers.

761
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
And you.

762
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,700
Oh. Well...

763
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,333
come on, I mean,
it's your idea.

764
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,101
You should at least be there
to help make it happen.

765
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:47,634
Yeah, I just took a job
at human resources.

766
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,134
I think I could probably
get you transferred.

767
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,101
Did you find a body
in there?

768
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:06,534
Can't get
close enough yet.

769
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,234
As soon as you can,
we need to retrieve it.

770
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,333
Well, she said
she wanted to end it.

771
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,067
I guess we could send
Marco and his boys

772
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,201
back down
to the basement,

773
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:16,567
let 'em find
a ripple effect

774
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:17,567
on this one.

775
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:19,767
Excuse me.

776
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,600
Baldwin.

777
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,934
I came close,
but I don't know...

778
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,034
Jean?

779
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,901
I couldn't go through with it.

780
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,567
That's good.
Nobody wants you dead.

781
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,168
Just tell me where you are.

782
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,534
No. You can't
help me.

783
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,801
The 4400 center can't help me,
but it doesn't matter.

784
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,867
I finally know
where I'm supposed to go.

785
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:38,101
Tell me where.

786
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,467
I'll meet you
there.

787
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,967
You ever read
the Bible, Baldwin?

788
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,767
I went to sunday school.

789
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,801
I spent some time
with it earlier today,

790
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:46,367
back at that motel.

791
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:47,867
"The time is at hand".

792
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,034
That's "Revelations", right?

793
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:50,234
But do you know
what it means?

794
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,333
I bet you don't.

795
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,168
See, these blisters...

796
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:58,934
they form on my hands.

797
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,534
Do you get it?

798
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,967
I'm not sure I do, Jean.

799
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,467
They're talking
about me in that book.

800
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,700
You got family?

801
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,134
Jean, what are you
talking about?

802
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,234
Go to them.

803
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,934
Hug them real tight.

804
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,400
I've finally
figured it out,

805
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,734
why they
sent me back.

806
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:21,001
I'm part of their plan.

807
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,700
They want me to do this.

808
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,934
Do what?

809
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,834
Purify humanity.

810
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,300
She was quoting "Revelations?"

811
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,067
Never a good sign, Tom.

812
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,634
She's gone
from wanting to help,

813
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:42,801
wanting to stop
all of this,

814
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,467
to believing she's
the end of the world,

815
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:45,734
so what does she do?

816
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,401
She said they want her
to do this, right?

817
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,801
Well, that implies
it's out of her hands.

818
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,000
Destiny.

819
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,067
She's giving up
responsibility.

820
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:56,434
Yeah, that's one way

821
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:57,868
to deal with being
a walking plague...

822
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,000
pretend the decision's
out of your hands.

823
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,134
I don't think
she wants to even

824
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,167
think about it
anymore.

825
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:02,567
I think she just
wants it over.

826
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:03,768
Well,
that's her mindset.

827
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,234
It still doesn't tell us
where she's going.

828
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,601
She's on autopilot, Tom.

829
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,367
My best guess?

830
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,634
She does whatever
she planned on doing

831
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,501
before the bodies
started rolling.

832
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,267
Right.

833
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,634
Marco.

834
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:16,967
Today's tuesday, right?

835
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,967
It's wednesday, Marco.

836
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,701
My bad.

837
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,534
She's only got one thing
written down for the day.

838
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,300
She's filing
her unemployment claim

839
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,567
in downtown Portland.

840
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:29,834
Son of a bitch!

841
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,434
I don't believe it.

842
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:32,768
Am I dreaming,

843
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:36,200
or did you not tell me
that Chicago would win?

844
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,768
Do you know
what I bet?

845
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,768
$200.

846
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,734
Try my mother's
diamond engagement ring,

847
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:47,434
and now it's gone,

848
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:51,167
all because I believed in you,
trusted you,

849
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,501
and you let me down.

850
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,734
You lied to me.

851
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,667
You said winning
didn't matter.

852
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,567
You said you liked me anyway.

853
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,467
Oh, so you knew Chicago
would lose, didn't you?

854
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,667
Right from the jump,

855
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:08,300
this was all just a test.

856
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:19,868
A foundation?

857
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,234
Don't you think

858
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,734
we have our hands
full already?

859
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:23,768
It's one person a day.

860
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,401
Once it's up
and running,

861
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,534
it's not really going
to eat into my time.

862
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,401
I thought you were
looking for privacy.

863
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,601
You do this,

864
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,334
you're stepping into
a white-hot spotlight.

865
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:32,701
Yes, but it's
on my terms.

866
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:34,967
Be good publicity.

867
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,868
Not too hard
to get off the ground.

868
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,367
We could get
some huge names

869
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:39,967
for that
filtering committee.

870
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:41,933
I think
it's a good idea.

871
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,900
Well, I'm glad
that you approve,

872
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,768
but I wasn't really asking
for your permission.

873
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:51,434
I would hope not.

874
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,667
Jean.

875
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,834
Baldwin?

876
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,234
That's right.

877
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,367
You should've stayed away.

878
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,100
Look around you.

879
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,267
All these people, they haven't
done anything to hurt you.

880
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,701
They haven't done anything
to help me, either.

881
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,567
Besides,
it doesn't matter.

882
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:46,768
I don't have a choice.

883
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,334
I am doing
what they wanted me to do.

884
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:49,401
You don't have
to accept that.

885
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:50,933
You have a choice.

886
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,134
Yeah, like I had a choice
when I was abducted.

887
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,801
I never had a choice.

888
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,000
Ever.

889
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,300
They have

890
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,601
the right girl
for the job.

891
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:03,501
What are you doing
here, anyway?

892
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:04,667
You should have gone

893
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:06,100
back to your family,
like I said.

894
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:08,634
No. I'm right where
I want to be.

895
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,434
Then you must have
some kind of death wish.

896
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:13,601
You think you're here
to kill people.

897
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,300
I think I'm here to stop you.

898
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:17,200
They infected you, Jean,
and that was wrong,

899
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,801
but you don't have to let them
make you into a mass murderer.

900
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,033
I'm already a killer.

901
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,467
No. No.

902
00:36:23,534 --> 00:36:24,868
You haven't decided
to kill anyone.

903
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:25,834
That's what you're doing
right now.

904
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,100
Whatever
you're thinking

905
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,967
about destiny or fate,
whatever...

906
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,501
you're wrong.

907
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:35,434
You don't have to do this.

908
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,601
You don't.

909
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:41,100
Want to hear
something funny?

910
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,234
I... I believe you.

911
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:49,567
But it's too late.

912
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:52,467
Oh...
they're so ripe.

913
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:55,000
I can't stop it now.

914
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:58,567
They itch so bad.

915
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,134
They do.

916
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:40,868
Hell of a day.

917
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,501
How are you holding up?

918
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:43,768
Well...

919
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,300
I'm scheduled

920
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,033
for psychiatric
counseling on monday.

921
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,267
Saved thousands
of innocent people,

922
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,434
had to shoot a woman
to do it...

923
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,267
you did what you had to do.

924
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,501
Anyway, uh,

925
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,200
not sure if this
is a good time,

926
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:02,300
but I made you
a little something.

927
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,567
It's kind of a...

928
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,200
well, a fake version
of Maia's diary.

929
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,634
Should fool
just about anybody.

930
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,434
You forged this
to get NTAC off my back?

931
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,933
I know
it's a big thing,

932
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,701
but you were kind of
over a barrel, so...

933
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:18,000
this could get me
into a lot of trouble.

934
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:21,067
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.

935
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,234
Yeah, uh...

936
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,501
you don't
have to use it

937
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,734
if you don't want to.

938
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,033
Just giving you
an option.

939
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,634
This is insane.

940
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,667
It's also maybe one
of the nicest things

941
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:35,834
anybody's ever done
for me.

942
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:40,933
I want to thank you
for a job well done.

943
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,734
You must have been
very persuasive.

944
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,300
I just said what I thought.

945
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:47,100
Your idea for a foundation
was terrific.

946
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:49,000
You mean your idea, don't you?

947
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,033
Do we have to be

948
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,367
all cloak-and-dagger
about it?

949
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:52,434
You and Shawn

950
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:53,900
both got what you wanted,

951
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,434
and a lot of sick people
are going to get help.

952
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,768
Well, you did a lot of good
for the center today,

953
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,000
and I'm not going to forget it.

954
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,100
Hey, Matthew,

955
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,868
you know what the center
means to me?

956
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:06,267
What?

957
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,868
Free rent and daycare
for my daughter.

958
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,801
I'm not
an 18-year-old kid.

959
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,100
I don't need to discover
the magic power inside of me.

960
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,634
So, in other words...

961
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,900
you're not a true believer?

962
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,234
Is that a problem?

963
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,033
Not at all.

964
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,234
Neither am I.

965
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,300
You look wiped.

966
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,567
Yeah. Don't ask.

967
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:49,234
You didn't
have to do this.

968
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,634
Well, I didn't.

969
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,000
Your son's the cook.

970
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,467
Kyle?

971
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,167
I bet he had
a little help.

972
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,200
Well, you know,
we got to talking.

973
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:59,300
It was nice.

974
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:02,768
How was your day, Alana?

975
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,401
Well, I bought
these pieces

976
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:08,501
from this young artist,
this girl from Bed-stuy,

977
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:09,667
self-taught,

978
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:10,768
and she painted

979
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,267
this little
scrap of garden

980
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:13,768
in her backyard,

981
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,234
and it's night,

982
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,801
and the sky
is so rich and deep...

983
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,200
You okay?

984
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,768
More or less.

985
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,300
Bet you almost forgot.

986
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,300
No, I didn't,

987
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:40,834
but I thought,
in light of today's events,

988
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,401
I would give you
a little extension.

989
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,267
Well, it's not necessary.

990
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:45,834
It's a hot read.

991
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,367
Lots of good stuff
about Spongebob.

992
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:51,200
Thank you.

993
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,634
the national
threat assessment command

994
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,167
has been working closely

995
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,601
with state
and local law enforcement

996
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,267
in the Jordan Collier
murder investigation...

997
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:08,567
Though there have been
no arrests made

998
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:09,967
as of yet,

999
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,801
NTAC claims
that progress is being made...

1000
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:17,768
Federal officials did say
that the investigation

1001
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:19,667
is headed
in a positive direction

1002
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,734
and are confident
that it will lead to an arr...
