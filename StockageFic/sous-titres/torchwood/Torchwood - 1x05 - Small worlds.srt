Tracking down alien life on Earth,

The 21st century is when
everything changes

00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,120
and you've got to be ready.

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,239
WOMAN'S VOICE: I'm returning
to the same spot.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,320
I do hope they're here.

7
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,039
I have to move carefully.

8
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,599
Don't want to frighten them.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,439

You shouldn't be here.

20
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,440
Neither should you.

21
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,919
What have you got?

22
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,439
Funny sort of weather patterns.

23
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,800
Didn't you see what the time was?

24
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,879
I was on the phone, wasn't I?
Well, shall I call the school?

25
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,319
Don't be stupid.
She'll be all right.

26
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,480
Ow!

EERIE, 'LIQUID' VOICE:
Come away, oh, human child!

35
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,559
Oh!

36
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:38,000
Come away... Come away....

37
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,120
What exactly are we doing here?

38
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,440
I've had an invitation
from an old friend.

39
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,960
Here we go.

FLUTTERING OF WINGS

41
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
Fairies? Are you kidding me?

42
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:17,519
I suppose I'm one of the
fortunate few who's been allowed
to see our little friends.

43
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,199
And it's been no easy task.

44
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,279
One needs to have the
patience of a saint

45
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,600
and the blind faith of a prophet.

46
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,360
But for me the long
wait has been worthwhile.

47
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,000
This is my first picture.

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,879
Not that clear, I know, but
the ring of stones can be seen
quite distinctly.

49
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,640
I don't believe this. Shh!

50
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
Well, of course, I'm not the
world's best photographer.

51
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,520
But this little person
is just about visible.

52
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,280
I was so lucky to have seen them,
so privileged to witness
such a magical moment.

53
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,480
Because fairies are shy, you see.

54
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,040
But I know in my heart that they're
friendly, loving creatures.

55
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
Thank you.

57
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,679
Wrong. She always gets it wrong.

58
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,720
Estelle, when did you take these?

59
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,199
A couple of nights ago. Where?

60
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,520
In Roundstone Wood.
Not far from here.

61
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
So good to see you again, Jack.

62
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh, look, there's the wood.

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
HE SIGHS

64
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,280
What's wrong? Oh, Jack and I have
always disagreed about fairies.

65
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,160
I only see the good ones.

66
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,119
He only ever sees the bad.
They're all bad.

67
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:00,680
No. I refuse to believe that.
I suppose one person's good
could be somebody else's evil.

68
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,719
That's what his father used to say.

69
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, Jack, if only you had
seen them there in the wood.

70
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,280
They were happy. They were dancing.
The fairy lights were shining.

71
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,879
Do you have any more photos?

72
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,599
Yes, at home. Right.

73
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
I need to see them all.

Yeah, well, look where
you're bloody going.

79
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720

Oh, God, help me! Help me, please!

All right, mate. Just calm down.

84
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
Hey, hold on, will you?

85
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,640
I said, just bloody help me!

86
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,280
Right, that's it...you crazy bastard!

87
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,880
No! No, please...

88
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,840
Where was she?
Walking home on her own.

89
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,200
Jas, come here.
Do what your mum says.

90
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,679
You're not my dad.

91
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,360
Just bloody well do what she says.

92
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,000
You must never walk home on your
own, you understand? It's not safe.

93
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,719
It's all right, Mum.
No-one can hurt me.

94
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh, thank you, Jack.

95
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,679
This is Moses.

96
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:45,359
Hello, Moses. They're mostly
just pictures of the area.

97
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,320
Come on, my darling, it's quite
time you went outside, isn't it?

98
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,000
This is you.

99
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Sorry. No, that's my dad.

100
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,919
He and Estelle were
quite an item once upon a time.

101
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,279
They were inseparable.

102
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:26,680
Then why did they part?
It was wartime, he was posted abroad,
she volunteered to work on the land.

103
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,720
It just happened that way.

104
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,480
WIND CHIMES RING

105
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,480
If you don't mind me asking, did you
know Jack's father after the war?

106
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,199
No. We lost touch. Why?
Did all three of you ever meet?

107
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,960
You, Jack and his father?
No. Never.

108
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,480
Jack contacted me a few years ago.

109
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,279
I was so surprised.

110
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,479
He's so like his dad.

111
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,560
Same walk, same smile.

112
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,360
I hope he's still alive.

113
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,200
He'll be in his early nineties now.

114
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,480
You could always ask Jack about him.

115
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
I have, but he doesn't seem to
want to talk about his father.

116
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,400
Estelle, when you next see these
creatures you call us immediately,
understand? Mm-hm.

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,279
Night or day,
it doesn't matter, just call us.
And be careful, it's important to me.

118
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,359
But, Jack,
I've nothing to worry about.

119
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,480
Just be careful. Please.

120
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,079
Estelle shouldn't be living in town.

121
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,280
She belongs in the countryside.

122
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,439
How often do you get to see her?

123
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,039
We meet up now and again.

124
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,240
Whenever she's seen her fairies?
She calls them fairies. I don't.

125
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,159
What do you call them?

126
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,320
They've never really
had a proper name.

127
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,920
Why not?

128
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Something from the dawn of time -

129
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,279
how could you
possibly put a name to that?

130
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,040
Are we talking alien? Worse.
How come?

131
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,560
Because they're part of us,
part of our world, yet
we know nothing about them.

132
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,079
So we pretend to know what they
look like. We see them as happy.

133
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,559
We imagine they have tiny little
wings and are bathed in moonlight.
But they're not? No.

134
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,360
Think dangerous, think something
you can only half see like a glimpse,

135
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,239
like something out of the corner
of your eye with a touch of myth,

136
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,679
a touch of the spirit world, a touch
of reality, all jumbled together.

137
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,839
Old moments and memories
that are frozen in amongst it.

138
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
Like debris spinning around a ringed
planet - tossing, turning, whirling.

139
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,760
Then backwards and
forwards through time.

140
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:46,600
If that's them we have to find
them...before all hell breaks loose.

141
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,480
Why won't she play anywhere else?

142
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,880
She likes it down there.
Other kids have friends.

143
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,520
Where's her friends?
Must be something wrong with her.

144
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,480
There's nothing wrong with her.

145
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,439
Well, when's the last time
you saw her watching TV?

146
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:13,479
Or reading a book?
Or playing with a doll?

147
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,960
Or sitting down to
have a chat with us?

148
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,279
When's the last time
you heard her laugh?

149

LAUGHTER, BEATING OF WINGS

152
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,440
This is the youngest girl.

153
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:53,839
And the girl's cousin.
I blame it on magic mushrooms.

154
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,800
What you do in private
is none of our business.

155
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
But these photographs were fake.

156
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
Conan Doyle believed in them.
He was gaga at the time.

157
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,520
And Houdini. Self-publicist.
How do you know so much about it?

158
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
I wrote an essay on the Cottingley
glass-plate photos

159
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
when I was at school.
HE SNIGGERS

160
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:11,320
And when the girls were old ladies
they admitted they were fakes.

161
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,480
So where was THIS sighting then?
In a place called Roundstone Wood.

162
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,520
I know it. Has an odd history.

163
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
How d'you mean odd?
It's always stayed wild.

164
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,840
In ancient times it was considered
bad luck to walk in there
or even to collect timber.

165
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Even the Romans stayed clear of it.
I've had no report of any sighting.

166
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,360
You won't. These things come in
under the radar,

167
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,840
but they play tricks with the
weather, so set up a programme for
unnatural weather patterns.

168
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Right. Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?

169
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Nothing can.

170
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,080
What is it? Is it-is it God?

171
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,759
Some-somewhere safe, that's all I
want, just put me somewhere safe.

172
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,040
Got a right one here.
They tried to kill me!

173
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,680
Said there were flowers in his mouth.
Flowers? They're trying to choke me.

174
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,319
We checked. There was nothing.
They didn't want to hurt
that little girl. It's just me.

175
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,319
They just want to hurt me,
to kill me.

176
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,120
Who wants to hurt you? They won't
leave me alone. I've done wrong.
What d'you mean you've done wrong?

177
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,320
If it's God, I'm sorry,
I can't help it!

178
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,719
Name?

179
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,800
It's little girls...

180
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,079
It's their little bodies,
it's their little smiles.

181
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,239
They're bright as buttons.

182
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,040
Look, um, I've been in trouble
before...

183
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,840
So just help me!

184
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,399
JUST LOCK ME UP!

185
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,840
Please.

186
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,280
I asked Estelle about your dad.

187
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,799
She said she'd never seen
the pair of you together.

188
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,640
Why would she? She lost
touch with him after the war.

189
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,799
I just happened to catch
up with her later.

190
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,239

You know, this whole area was
forest in primeval times.

194
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
Most of the development areas
have been built on ley lines.

195
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
Anyone could have made this circle.

196
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,440
Why do you keep doubting me?
I spell out the dangers,
you keep looking for explanations.

197
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,559
That's what police work's about.
This isn't police work. All right,
science. It's not science.

198
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,360
I know. You told me.
It's that corner-of-the-eye stuff.

I heard you laughing, Jas.

210
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,880
It seemed like you
were talking to someone.

211
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,160
Just talking to yourself, were you?

212
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,759
It's lovely to hear you laugh.

213
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,360
I thought I'd seen everything
until now.

214
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,800
We had him locked up,
for Christ's sake, on his own.

215
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,319
He was shouting the odds.
Said things were following him.
What kind of things?

216
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,000
Shadows, he said. He was
going on about being choked.

217
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,280
There were four other prisoners.
They saw nothing.
Where are they now?

218
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,399
I've had them transferred. CCTV?
I'm dealing with that.

219
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,159
At first I thought he was a
drunk or a nutcase, or both.

220
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,920
Right, I want this place locked off.

221
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,359
Name? Mark Goodson. Worked in town.

222
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,599
Business consultant. Cause of death?

223
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,360
Well, going by the pinpoint
haemorrhages on the eye-lids and
around the hairline,

224
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,960
I'd say oxygen deficiency.

225
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,520
But it's odd.

226
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,279
There's no fingertip bruising
on the face, no areas of pallor.

227
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,760
Nothing to suggest that
pressure was applied? No.

228
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Yet he suffocated
alone in a locked cell?

229
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,800
Looks like it.

230
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120

used to hang around schools.

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,280
Why the petals in his mouth?
Just a bit of fun on their part.

244
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,359
You call that fun?

245
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,640
That's the way these
creatures like to do things.

246
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,039
They play games,
they torment and they kill. Why?

247
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,680
As a punishment
or a warning to others.

248
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,639
They protect their own.

249
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,040
The chosen ones.

250
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,520
Somehow children and the
spirit world, they go together.

251
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,759
So how do we stop them?

252
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,000
First we have to find out who
they want.

253
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,720
And we can't trap them.

254
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,359
They have control of the elements -
fire, water, the air that we breathe.

255
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,320
They can drag that air
right out of our bodies.

256
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,400
Sometimes I think they're part Mara.
Mara?

257
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,959

301
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,519
In London at the Astoria ballroom
a few weeks before Christmas.

302
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,160
She was 17 years old
and she was beautiful.

303
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,960
I loved her at first sight.

304
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,440
But nothing lasted back then.

305
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840

307
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,680

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,840
The petals in Goodson's mouth,

309
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,280
where had you seen that before?

310
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,959
Was that during the war?

311
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,840
No.

312
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,400

320
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,480

00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,079
And when we came out of the tunnel,

325
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,399
all 15 men were dead.

326
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,080
They'd been suffocated.

328
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,800
But why were the men killed?

329
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,079
About a week earlier some
of them had got drunk.

330
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,119
Drove a truck through a village,
ran over a child, killed her.

331
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,760

00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:57,520
just sat glowering because she
thought I'd nicked her special

You don't want to
miss our party, do you?

343
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,239
I'd rather play down the garden.

344
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,920
You're right. She's spending too
much time down there. Don't worry.

when they start building at

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,679
It'll happen one day.

348
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,840
HE SIGHS

349
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,399
Don't you ever want to
have a conversation with me?

BEATING OF WINGS

351
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,080
No wonder your dad left when you
were a baby. He must have seen
what was coming.

FLAPPING OF WINGS

353
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,199
Who are you waving at? Just friends.

354
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,240
You don't have friends.

355
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,760
CHILDREN CHANT: Cross eyes,
mince pies, catch the buggers
by surprise.

356
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,960
Jasmine?

357
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,159
Did someone push you, Jasmine?

358
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,719
Yes, Miss. Who?

359
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,639
Don't know, Miss.

360
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,600
Come here.

361
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,800
In the whole of my working
life I have never had to bring
the bad times home with me.

362
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,600
I have never had to feel
threatened in my own home.

363
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,880
But not any more, because this means
these creatures can invade my life

364
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,360
whenever they feel like it
and I am scared, Jack.

365
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,960
What chance did Estelle have?

366
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,120
What chance do any of us have?

367
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,640
You said these creatures
protect their own. Yeah.

368
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,239
You mentioned the chosen ones.

369
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:18,120
What are they? How many are there?

370
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,399
Tell me, Jack!

371
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,320
All these so-called fairies were
children once from different moments
in time, going back millennia.

372
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,920
Part of the lost lands.

373
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,399
Lost lands? What?

374
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,519
The lands that belong to them.

375
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,920
What exactly do they want?

376
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,639
Why are they here?
They want what's theirs -

377
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,960
the next chosen one.

378
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:59,959
CHILDREN CAN BE HEARD SINGING
'LORD OF THE DANCE' IN BACKGROUND

379
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
Hey, you, did you tell on us?

380
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,080
No. Yes, you did. Yeah,
well maybe you need a good kicking.
Get those teeth of yours kicked in.

381
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,960

00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:24,079
I want a check on all
unexplained deaths in the area.

384
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,199
What's the weather forecast
for today? Long, sunny spells.

385
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,200
It's happening again.

386
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,519
CHILDREN SING 'LORD OF

387
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,120
CHILDREN SCREAM

388
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,720
I can't understand it,
it's going crazy.

389
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,879
Just leave it, let's go.

390
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,399
CHILDREN SCREAM

391
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:24,239

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,560
I've never seen anything like it.

396
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,600
It was so sudden. Then it...

397
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,520
then it just ended. Kate, is it?

398
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,679
Was anyone hurt? No.

399
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,199
Two children were almost scared to
death, but they're OK. What is it?

400
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,600
I saw them. And there was
little Jasmine in amongst it all.

401
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,520
She hadn't been touched.

402
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,359
The sun was shining down on her.

403
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,560
It was...it was like an aura,
like something protecting her.

404
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,879
Who is Jasmine? Jasmine Pearce. She's
a pupil of mine. Where is she now?

405
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:04,960
We're sending all the children home.
We have to. Yeah, thanks.

406
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,400
The chosen one? Yeah.

407
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,079
MUSIC PLAYS, PEOPLE CHATTER

408
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,440
Must have been
scary at school today.

409
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,439
It was fun.

410
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,680
Roy said you saw some of
your friends this morning.

411
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,560
He said you waved at them.

412
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,879
Only Roy said when he
looked he couldn't see anyone.

413
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:31,040
That's because they
were in the trees.

414
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,159
Trees? What trees?

415
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,960
The trees along the road.
Is this one of your games, Jas?

416
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,880
No.

417
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,440
Ah, boy, not got a beer?

418
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:01,399
So who are they?

419
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:04,640
Just friends. You should have
invited them to the party.

420
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,679
They don't like parties.

421
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,280
I'm not surprised if
they live in trees.

422
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,719
Oh, they don't always live in trees.
They can be anywhere and everywhere.

423
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,319
They can even be in this room.

424
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:18,280
In this room? When?
Now. Don't be silly, Jas.

425
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,080
So where did you meet these friends?
You must have met them somewhere.

426
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,880
They said they'll always look
after me, even through time.

427
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,040
When did they say that? I forget.

428
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:45,240
Oh, yeah, I've got big plans for
this place, going to extend the
patio and landscape this garden.

429
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,879
Come on, Jas, hurry up with
that food. People are hungry.

430
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:52,800
So when are you going to name
the day, Roy? Shoo, never.

431
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,239
I can't afford to keep her.

432
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,080
No! No! Please, no! No...

433
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,720
Jas, get away. You can't do this!
That's my own place! It's mine!

434
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,480
I said, get away! Oh, Jas!

435
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,679
Ow!

436
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,239
Ah! You little bitch!

That's all we need.

440
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,759
Just a bit of bad weather.
It'll pass.

441
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,600
Where's Jas? Oh, she's around.

442
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,439
Ladies and gentlemen...

443
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,399
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention, please?

444
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:06,799
As you all know, today
is a very special day -

445
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:11,720
Lynn and me have been together
now for the past five years,
and not only is she my partner,

446
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,880
but she's also been my rock
and my best friend.

447
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,960
WOMAN: Aw...

448
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,319
Now we're looking forward
to having children of our own.

449
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:21,480
WIND PICKS UP

450
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,199

00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:45,600
No! No! No! Get out!

454
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,399
No!

455
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,239

00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,880

457
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,480
No! Roy!

458
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,640
No!

Oh, Roy...

463
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,680
No!

464
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,559
Do you know you're
walking in a forest?

465
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,520
Well, you are.
It looks like a very old forest, and
it's magical. I want to stay in it.

466
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,280
You can see this forest?

467
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,800
Yes. But it's not here.

468
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,000
It's just an illusion, Jasmine.

469
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,359
It is.

The real forest can never come back.

472
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,679
Oh, it can.

473
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,840
When they take me to it.

474
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,600
They told you this?

475
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,719
But what about your mother?
Don't you want to stay with her?

I am sure.

00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,679
Please, wait.

488
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,240
You can't go down there. No! Jas!

489
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,559
No, no! Let go! My daughter!

490
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,959
Suppose we make her stay with us?

491
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:32,999
Then lots more people will die.
Did they tell you that?
They promised.

492
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:37,279
Come away, oh, human child!
Next time they'll kill
everyone at my school

493
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:40,360

How do you know these things?

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,280
If they want to they can make
great storms, wild seas,

turn the world to ice.

497
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,840
Kill every living thing.

498
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,200
Let me go.

00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,760
The child won't be harmed?

500

Jack, you can't...

501
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,920
Answer me! She won't be harmed?

502
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,319
We told you. She lives forever.

503
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,360
A dead world.
Is that what you want?

504
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,159
What good is that to you?

505
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,760
There will be no more chosen ones.

Jack, NO!

509
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,480
You asked me what chance we had
against them. For the sake of the

To the waters and the wild

523
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:34,720
with a fairy hand in hand,

524
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,599
for the world's more full of weeping
than you can understand.

525
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,959
TWITTERING LAUGHTER

526
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:49,600
17 disappearances within
the last five months.

527
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,959
SCREAMING

528
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,200
The rift is spreading

529
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,720
and it's dumping aliens and psychos
wherever it fancies.

530
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,719
Where is everybody?

531
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,280
Tosh!

532
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:02,479
SCREAMING

533
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,520
Oh, my God.

534
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,360
You can't fight them,
they're too strong.

535
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,559
Help me! Stop them! Oh, my God.

536
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,119
How many people have been down
here?

537
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,240
What did this, Jack?
It can't be human.

538
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,000
How far is this going to spread?
