00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,160
Torchwood -

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,610
outside the
Government, beyond the Police.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,120
Fighting for the future
on behalf ofthe human race.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,010
The 21st century is
when everything changes

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,040
and Torchwood is ready.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,230
My name is Dr Owen Harper

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,560
and this is my life.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,380
A life that is full of action

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,840
and violence and work, wonder.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,850
Secrets, sex and love

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,760
and heartbreak...

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,780
..and death...

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,520
..my death.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
The death I survived, 

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,710
the death I am now living through.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Except. . .

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,410
this isn't living.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,230
Every day it's the same.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,350
I get up, 

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,160
get ready for work the
same as everyone else.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,330
The thing is, I'm not the same.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,400
I get to work and everyone's
doing the same old thing.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,340
Babbling away about aliens and weddings.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm not real.

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,880
Three days ago, I died.

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,310
And they think I'm
fine, but they're wrong.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,800
So, are you ready to jump?

Would you just piss off.Get off my roof.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,020
Your roof?

33
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,950
I'm going tojump, so just leave me alone.

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,160
Look, darlin', you know, I'm
not here to stop you.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,750
Seriously.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,060
You think you've got problems?

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,330
What, did your man dump you?

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,890
Sorry, love, were you talking to me?

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,800
It'sjust I'm a bit busy right now.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,020
I'm not really interested in lis. . .

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,880
What is that?

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,050
I got shot.

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,170
Yeah, right

44
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,000
0h, my God, what the hell are you?

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,180
I'm dead.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,060
That's not...

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,400
Look, you can't be dead.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,360
You're standing here. You're
talking. You're moving.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
You're not dead.

50
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,130
You're. ..

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,450
You're dead?

52
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah, I was brought back...

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,540
like jesus really, but
without the beard, you know.

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,700
Shit, I'm never gonna have a beard.

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,320
Not that I wanted one you
understand, you know, one day I...

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,510
OK. OK. You're dead and that's. ..

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,430
that's clearly a bit shit and
I'm sorry and everything but, 

58
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,820
if you are dead, then why are you here?

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,890
You can't be wanting to
jump. You can't die twice.

60
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,380
Sorry, are you an expert?

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,430
Sorry, are you an idiot

62
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,840
Yeah. I'm a dead idiot.

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,720
So, come on then, 

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,400
what's it like?

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,220
What?

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,580
Well, being dead.

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,040
What delights have I
got to look forward to?

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,350
Darkness.

69
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,870
Nothing.

70
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,190
Cheery, thanks

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,150
Look, 

72
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,840
why are you here?

73
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,900
'Dr Owen Harper, Torchwood Officer
565, I'm relieving you of your position.'

74
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,250
Bollocks. I'm
sorry, jack, this is bollocks.

75
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,960
Hand in your weapon
and your security pass.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,130
But why? I'm fine.

77
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,240
Three days ago, you died.

78
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,680
We need to examine you.

79
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,350
We need to find out what you are.

80
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,190
We need to be certain you're OK.

81
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,470
Yeah, well it almost sounds
as if you care, well done.

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,920
Until I'm confident you're fit for duty, 

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,120
Martha jones will replace you as
Torchwood's new medical officer.

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,100
She's doing all right
out of this, isn't she?

85
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,320
She's worked out a series
of tests and examinations.

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,250
And what if I refuse?

87
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,540
You'll be confined to the cells, 

88
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,960
tested and if the results show
that you're a danger to the team, 

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,100
appropriate steps will be taken.

90
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm asking you, Owen.

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,740
Please, let us help you.

92
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,040
Let us make sure you're safe.

93
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm gonna need your gun.

94
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,290
And your security pass.

95
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,770
Please. . .

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,800
And how long are Dr
j0nes's tests going to take?

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,120
As long as they need to.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,270
And what the hell am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

99
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,720
We always need someone to make coffee.

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,760
Oh, no.

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,430
Voila.

102
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,970
Fresh and strong.

103
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,330
And, we couldn't `ust have a `ar

104
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,560
of mstanwi your coffee?

105
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,420
Have you seen what happens
when I drink, these days?-

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,240
0wen. Want a go?

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,020
Ooh, please

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,780
What's wrong with this?

109
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,210
You OK?

110
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,160
What do you think?

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,170
I bet you're loving this, aren't you?

112
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,150
It's like y0u've finally won.

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,830
I didn't realise we were in competition.

114
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,230
Oh, come on!

115
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,580
Even Tosh had more of
a life than you used to.

116
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,010
And now you're always out on
missions, you're shagging jack

117
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,170
and I'm stuck here making the coffee.

118
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,430
It's not like that, me and jack.

119
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,610
You and jack.

120
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,520
Gwen's getting married.

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,980
Martha's got her bloke.
God, even Tosh had Tommy.

122
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,840
This is really shit!

123
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,350
We've all gone through shit, 

124
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,480
I've seen you dissect alien corpses, 

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,800
I've SEEI1 yOU SBVC S0 many lives, 

126
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,350
are you really going
to let this beat you?

127
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,610
So, you're choosing
me over the boyfriend?

128
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah, that's it.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,610
You really don't need to worry, you
know, I don't want yourjob.

130
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,970
Yes, I know.

131
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,840
You just find me irresistible.

132
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,780
0h, yeah, that's it

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,180
Every morning I wake up and think
of ways to get you alone like this.

134
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,280
There is no sign of any muscle
decay. You're in great shape, as ever.

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,850
Hmm, no use coming onto me, jones.

136
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm a changed man.

137
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,860
And. . .erm, no stiffening anywhere?

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,160
Well. ..

139
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,850
just answer the question.

140
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,730
No, no signs of rigor mortis.

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,360
So, if I keep up the
exercise, I won't atrophy?

142
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,700
Yep. And bonus, definitely looks
like you're not going to age either.

143
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,700
There's no further
sign of cell mutation.

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,170
You're 100% human.

145
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,170
BLEEPS 100% Owen.

146
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,510
Hi, Martha. Meeting in the
boardroom. Can you come down?'

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,760
You'd better go. ..

148
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,770
What about you?

149
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,060
Cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles.

150
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,480
What?

151
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,790
That's what you drink, isn't it?

152
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,200
Henry john Parker, used to be a looker, 

153
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,480
now he's 80-odd and
even I have my limits.

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,660
Your basic millionaire
collector of alien hoo-hah.-

155
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,730
in the 'mostly harmless' category?

156
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,880
So, what's the problem?

157
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,960
I detected this at 0517 this morning.

158
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,020
Parker's house. There's an
energy spike coming from it.

159
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,090
I've never seen anything like it before.

160
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,530
OK So, the big question is, what's our
Mr Parker gone and found this time?

161
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,190
Why? Do you think he's a threat?

162
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,740
Well, he hasn't been up until now.

163
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,830
He's a bit Howard Hughes.

164
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,590
We know he's there, we
know he's not a threat.

165
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,090
But as the story goes, he hasn't
left the house since his wife died.

166
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,370
Nobody's seen him since 1986.

167
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,800
We've been monitoring Parker for ages.
There's nothing to be scared of is there?

168
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,200
Unlike, say, Tintin?

169
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,510
OK! I never liked Tintin.

170
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,280
What, he's weird. Funny face
and his hair isjust, is horrible.

171
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,100
- I always loved Tintin.
- Yeah, well you would.

172
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,090
And he never had a girlfriend
did he, just the dog, 

173
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,210
so I reckon he was
actually shagging the dog.

174
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,000
OK, meanwhile, back at Torchwood.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,820
Alien energy pulse!

176
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,610
We've got to check this Parker out, OK?

177
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,310
Tosh, can you get me a complete
schematic of the house.

178
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,970
Ianto, find out exactly what he's got.

179
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,130
Get me an inventory of
everything that he's bought.

180
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,180
Martha, can you get a hold
of his medical history?

181
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,530
- Sure.
- OK, let's get to it, guys.

182
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,150
Hey, Gwen, any news on Banana Boat?

183
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,620
Can you believe it?

184
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,120
Best Man, arrested in Lanzarote.

185
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,190
- What for? Ah, 
- dodgy CDs.

186
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,560
'worldwide, nearly a million
people kill themselves each year.'

187
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,780
That's almost three times
the population of Cardiff.

188
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,720
- Makes you think.
- What are you?

189
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,910
Some sort of suicide geek?

190
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,810
No, just a doctor.

191
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,660
Infact, I'm notjust a doctor.

192
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm a bloody brilliant doctor.

193
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,630
'I know you are.'

194
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,990
So why are you doing my job?

195
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,870
Because Gwen asked me to.

196
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,670
That's not what I mean.

197
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,520
Because you died, and
because you need help.

198
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,720
That's not a bad thing.

199
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,010
It is a bad thing that
you died obviously, 

200
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,300
but it's not bad that you need
help, if you know what I mean?

201
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,120
You're kinda cute when you babble.

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,600
And you're kinda cute when you're
not chucking a scalpel about.

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,210
But I'm making the sodding coffee!

204
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,460
I mean, come on, won't
your bloke be missing you?

205
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,280
Has he seen jack? They always
get jealous when they meet jack.

206
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,410
Owen, I don't want yourjob.

207
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,930
Ijust want to do mine.

208
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,930
OK, I'm dead, but I am 100% human.

209
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm fine.

210
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,150
You've sliced your hand open.

211
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,610
The wound's not going to heal, 

212
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,600
so, you're going to have to
re-stitch it every week or so.

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,990
At least you don't need anaesthetic.

214
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,820
Yeah, can't feel anything.

215
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,100
I can't feel the needle or thread.

216
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,690
I can't feel your hands on mine.

217
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,240
Yet, I can touch things, 

218
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,590
I can hold 'em, 

219
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,920
I know they're there.

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,740
But I just can't feel anything.

221
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,260
I'm numb.

222
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,910
Do you see why jack's worried?

223
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,970
Bruises won't heal.

224
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,920
Bones won't mend. You're. .. fragile.

225
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,480
Yeah, well, I'd better get
used to doing things myself.

226
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,810
'So she offers to help
you and you push her away?

227
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,050
Charming.'

228
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,660
Yeah, hole in the chest.

229
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,810
Sorry if I don't follow
social niceties any more.

230
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,300
You mean you did before?

231
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,250
God, you're a pain in
the arse, aren't you?

232
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,040
Is that why your man dumped you?

233
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,870
Ooh, I hit a nerve?

234
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,490
What, did you get your heart broken?

235
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,230
No, actually. He died.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,810
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,430
No you're not.

238
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,880
You couldn't care less about
me and I don't care about you.

239
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,670
just because we're both
planning on jumping, 

240
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,650
it doesn't mean we have some
sort of special connection.

241
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,580
You don't know the half of it.

242
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,460
Give me something to do.

243
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,500
You knowl can't. Rules and regulations.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
Fine.

245
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,790
I might as well go home then.

246
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,330
OK.

247
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,590
What exactly do I do when I get there?

248
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,390
Watch TV...

249
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,980
..chill.

250
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,840
jack, I'm dead.

251
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,630
I'm permanently chilled.

252
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,900
You know, you get to live forever.

253
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,580
I get to die forever.

254
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,430
It's funny that.

255
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,470
Oh, hello! Welcome to To Buy Or
Not To Buy, the property show...

256
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,770
Do you mind ifl eat, I'm starving?

257
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,480
No, help yourself.

258
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,010
So, jack asked you to come round did he?

259
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,250
'Talk to Owen. 'Get him
to open up, godammit!'

260
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,550
You haven't changed.

261
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,160
It's all about Owen.

262
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,940
I've had a hell of a morning, you
know. Do you have a...?

263
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,670
Top drawer.

264
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,920
So, jack calls me in
at 5.00 this morning.

265
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
He could have waited
until I got in, but no, 

266
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,410
strange energy spike and
it's 'Let's get Tosh in.'

267
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,450
0h, and when Gwen got
in, first thing she did?

268
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,100
Say sorry for not asking
me to be bridesmaid.

269
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,030
I mean, me, a bridesmaid?

270
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,460
You sound like an old married couple.'

271
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,940
Brian used to say I talked too much.

272
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,490
Tell me about him.

273
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,450
Today's my wedding anniversary.

274
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,410
My perfect day...

275
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,970
It was an accident.

276
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,830
We'd been married less than an hour.

277
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,890
I was picking confetti out
of my hair when it happens.

278
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,770
- Shit. I'm...
- Sorry, yeah.

279
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,940
I know.

280
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,510
You waited until your wedding
anniversary to kill yourself?

281
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,630
- Why?
- Does it matter?

282
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,420
Why have you waited?

283
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,950
Because I believe people.

284
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,050
I believe them when they
said it would get better.

285
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,680
So, what do you think, Doctor?

286
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,020
Do you really think it's
going to get any better?

287
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,130
I ran it through the language
translator and it's flipping Croatian.

288
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,250
Why are you here, Tosh?

289
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,350
I want to help you.

290
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,300
And how are you going to do that?

291
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,810
How are you going to help me?

292
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,200
I mean, am I going to be
a new 'special project'?

293
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
Come on, Owen, Ijust...

294
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,980
That's not why you're here is it?

295
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,890
For some reason you want
me, you know I don't know why, 

296
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,270
but you always have, you're always looking
at me, watching me screw other women, 

297
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,410
your heart breaking
and now it's different, 

298
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,580
because I'm safe now, aren't I?

299
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,670
And it's all cosy and it's
romantic and isn't it beautiful?

300
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,720
You can say what you
like. I'm not leaving you.

301
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,280
0f course, not. This is it, isn't it?

302
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,400
This is the date that
we were talking about.

303
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,520
You've got your beer, you've
got pizza, you and me, 

304
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,380
it'sjust how you wanted it.

305
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,130
All we need now is a sodding pool table.

306
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,710
Stop it! What's wrong with you?

307
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,380
I'm broken, Tosh!

308
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,480
I don't work, I've got no
heartbeat, no feelings, no tears, 

309
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,540
I have got nothing to give you!

310
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,730
- I. ..
- Do you understand that?

311
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,640
Maybe that's what you want, maybe you
want somebody who's as screwed up as you!

312
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,980
Who's twisted and screwed up like
you are. You want to see broken, 

313
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,390
do you want to see broken, Tosh?

314
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,810
Owen! Stop it! What are you doing?!

315
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,920
36 minutes. Not bad.

316
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,260
You were watching?

317
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,150
Skinny guy in tight
jeans runs into water?

318
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,080
I was taking pictures!

319
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,430
How long's this going to go on for, Owen?

320
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,640
Ianto, what have you
found out about Parker?

321
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,770
I've identified some ofthe things
he's purchased over the past year.

322
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,060
We've got a Dogon eye.

323
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,070
A pair of Myakian wings, meteorites.

324
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,220
An Arcateenian translation
of james Herbert's 'The Fog'.

325
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,380
But there are a few things
we've never seen before.

326
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,370
So one of these is
causing the energy spikes?

327
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,640
And they're getting dangerously bigger.

328
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,040
Right, OK we need to get in there.

329
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,110
Parker employs a Mr Philip
Farrington to run security.

330
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,440
There's at least six
guards, CCI¡¯V everywhere, 

331
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,370
all of which we can bring down
by taking out the generator, 

332
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,590
but then there's these...

333
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,780
Heat sensors.

334
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,320
- As in body heat?
- Yep.

335
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,700
Solar-powered.

336
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,420
There's one on every
doorway, every window.

337
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,780
So, how do we get past them?

338
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,200
Sounds like you need a dead man.

339
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,190
Someone with no body heat.

340
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,350
What have you got to lose?

341
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,020
Tosh?

342
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,460
I turned your telly off.

343
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,570
You screamed at her, you said
all those things, and that's it?

344
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,170
That's Tosh.Always the professional.

345
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,120
I don't care. I'm not interested
in you, in old men or alien meteors.

346
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,370
I came here because my husband died.

347
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,750
Ijust want to jump.

348
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,570
- Let's get on with it.
- Get off me!

349
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,000
You, you're too scared.

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,090
Aren't you?

351
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,690
How did you get from that to here?

352
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,920
What happened?

353
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,720
If you hurt yourself, you
will not recover.

354
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,220
Like I said, any bruises you
get, they're not gonna heal.

355
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,860
Do not engage in physical combat.

356
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,940
One punch you're gone.

357
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,140
Be careful.

358
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,180
I understand, I'm made of glass.

359
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,580
Owen?

360
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,980
just take care.

361
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,200
0h, and you'll need this.

362
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,980
'0wen?'

363
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,620
Yeah... Hi, Tosh.

364
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,620
'OK, the power in the house is supplied
from one private electrical generator.

365
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,300
'There's a backup unit
but take the main one down

366
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,820
and you've got one
minute, twenty of blackout time.

367
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,500
You can only get rid
of one of the blokes?

368
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,340
Look suspicious with two phone calls.

369
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,600
Try and make it the big one, OK?

370
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,520
ares

371
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,270
- Hello?
- Mr Taylor?

372
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,410
Yeah, that's right, who's this?

373
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,900
I'm calling from St Helen's Hospital.

374
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,110
'Mrs Christine Taylor was brought in an
hour ago. 'She's been in a car accident.'

375
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,190
Is she hurt?

376
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,070
'She's going to be fine but
she's asking to see y0u.'

377
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm on my way.

378
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,330
- You all right?
- It's Chrissie, she's been in an accident. Look, I've got to go.

379
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,010
Yeah, of course.

380
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,060
Mr Farringdon?

381
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,700
Ben's had to go. His
wife's been in an accident.

382
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,630
OK, guys, I'm here.

383
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,790
Move away from there.

384
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,790
I said!

385
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,230
Yeah, OK, guys. Very funny !

386
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,700
No, no, no.

387
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,930
- Do you want to see what I can do?
- What?

388
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,730
I'm dead already, mate.

389
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,520
'Webb? Dave, are you there?'

390
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,790
Oh! One minute, twenty untilthe
backup generator comes online.

391
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,360
'This is Farrington to all units. 'The backup
generator will be running in 45 seconds.

392
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,780
Stay at your posts, please.

393
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,270
'Mr Parker's personal
generator is unaffected.'

394
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,740
'Sorry, Owen, they've
obviously had some work done.'

395
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,090
Heat sensors.

396
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,090
I am literally too cool for school.

397
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,970
Right, I'm in.

398
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,470
'OK, the energy reading seems to
be coming from the first floor.

399
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,630
'A room at the back ofthe house.'

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,600
Can you give me anything else?

401
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,810
'No, the energy source is playing
havoc with the system, sorry.'

402
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,670
No worries. I'm getting
used to being in the dark.

403
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,130
Hold it there.

404
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,950
Evenin'.

405
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,080
Nice place y0u've got here.

406
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,720
Love what you've done with the pictures.

407
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,520
Who are you?

408
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,850
Why aren't the sensors picking you up?

409
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,380
OK, stop!

410
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,390
Stop or I'll shoot.

411
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,800
No, you won't.

412
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,940
You're a security guard.

413
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,980
That gunsjust for show, innit?

414
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,150
Do you know what a bullet
does to a living person?

415
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,500
It's not like a knife
through butter, no, no, no, no.

416
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,490
It rotates, tears into the flesh
and the gooey stuff behind.

417
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,460
Rips into the
organs, and, ooh, it's not nice.

418
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,540
But anyway, I haven't got any body heat, 

419
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,050
you must know what that means?

420
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,130
You can't kill a dead man.

421
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,220
What are you?

422
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,320
- I'm wrong.
- What are you?!

423
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,640
I'm broken.

424
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm Dr Owen Harper.

425
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,460
And I'm having one hell of a day.

426
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,500
Yes?

427
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,430
It's OK, mate. I'm not going
to hurt you. I'm a doctor.

428
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,050
You're a very violent doctor.

429
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,550
I've been watching you.

430
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,460
Henry Parker, yeah?

431
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,000
You're Torchwood, yes?

432
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,810
Did the Americans send you?

433
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,250
Yeah, they sent me.

434
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,100
How do you know so much about us?

435
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,100
They could've sent that
japanese girl, I liked her.

436
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
Yeah, well, I'm sorry you got me.

437
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,870
Is she on your phone thing?

438
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,760
- The earpiece?
- Yeah.

439
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,480
Hello! just to say y0u've
got very lovely legs.

440
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,010
You should show them off more.

441
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,630
What's wrong with you?

442
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,090
Three heart attacks and a failed bypass.

443
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:15,360
But I'm fine, because I have this.

444
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,330
It's called the Pulse.

445
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,630
You know what it is?

446
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,890
I named it.

447
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,310
It's keeping me alive.

448
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,050
No! You're not taking it.

449
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,250
It could be dangerous, 

450
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,670
we've been detecting
massive energy readings.

451
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,730
I don't care.

452
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,260
All I know is, it works.

453
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,550
Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't.

454
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,370
What?

455
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,460
The energy isn't going into you.

456
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,510
The p0wer'sjust building
up inside that thing, 

457
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:50,000
that's what we've been detecting but it
isn't actually doing anything for you.

458
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,580
You're wrong.

459
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,080
I can feel it.

460
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,590
- No, no. I'm not going to die.
- Listen to me.

461
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,680
There are loads of peoples' lives at risk. If
that explodes we can't predict the fall-out.

462
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,880
You're young, you don't
understand wat dying feels like.

463
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,470
Believe me, I do. I really do.

464
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,120
- There's nothing there!
- Where?

465
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,220
0n the other side, nothing, I'm dying.

466
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,360
Take away my Pulse and I'm gone.

467
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,210
My body decomposing.

468
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,020
You can't stop it, Mr Parker.

469
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,970
I'm sorry, but it's
going to happen one day.

470
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,060
Itll be dark and I'll be alone.

471
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,030
Where are you now?

472
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,290
It's dark and you're all alone, 

473
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,440
so what's the difference?

474
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,490
I don't understand
what's keeping me here.

475
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,630
It's hope.

476
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,480
That thing, it'sjust hope.

477
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,460
Do you really think all
this is better than death?

478
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,000
It's got to be.

479
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
It is better!

480
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,360
You're just scared ofthe darkness.

481
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,210
join the club.

482
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,480
Trust me, I know how
shit everything can be.

483
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,950
Don't you sit there
pontificating, you're just a boy, 

484
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,900
what do you know about anything?

485
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,540
I've travelled the world.

486
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,180
I fought in the war.

487
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,400
Started my own business.

488
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,120
I made a fortune!

489
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,570
Married.

490
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,530
Widowed.

491
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,780
My collection, all of it.

492
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,300
I've done so much and
this is where I ended up.

493
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,250
Alone. Lying in my own piss

494
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,190
and do you know what I want?

495
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,020
- Clean sheets?
- I want a steak.

496
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,830
Medium rare.

497
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,310
Black pepper sauce.

498
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,780
Look at me. Fed through a tube.

499
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,760
I might as well be dead already.

500
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,110
I might as well be dead.

501
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,750
Why don't you take it?

502
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,580
Well?

503
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,840
0h, Christ, it's dark, I'm
alone, I'm so alone.

504
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,730
It's all right, 

505
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,690
I'm here with you.

506
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,820
I'm still stuck here, though.

507
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,910
In this bed, in the dark.

508
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,060
You know what?

509
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,120
I'm going to come back.

510
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,860
You and me.

511
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,900
We're going to face
all of this together, 

512
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,150
I'm going to help you.

513
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,090
Torchwood, 

514
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:16,720
if you come back, you can tell me
all about it. Tell me what it's like.

515
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,140
I want to hear about the
aliens and everything!

516
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,660
I need to know that
there's more out there.

517
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,000
That this isn't all there is.

518
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,080
Oh, come on, I'm dying, 

519
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,910
who am I going to
tell, the Angel Gabriel?

520
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,000
If you come back, 

521
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,220
I won't tell the japanese girl
that you're still holding my hand.

522
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,660
Well, maybe.

523
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,510
Mr Parker?

524
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm so sorry!

525
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,680
'I couldn't save him.'

526
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,950
I needed to give him air but I couldn't.

527
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,410
I've got no breath.

528
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,060
Everything I've seen, 

529
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,930
everything that's out there

530
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,440
and it was an old man
dying of a heart attack.

531
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,540
just another person dying because of me.

532
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,550
Everything that's happened
and that was the final straw.

533
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:19,630
Because at that moment I
just wanted it all to end.

534
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,720
'0wen.'

535
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,800
Owen, can you hear me?

536
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,000
Owen, come in!

537
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,260
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

538
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,330
The device?

539
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,510
'Is it doing anything because the
energy levels 'coming from it are...

540
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,810
Owen?'

541
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,480
Owen! It's going off the screen.

542
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,700
It's going to explode!

543
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,870
Tosh? What can we do?

544
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,020
Nothing! There's nothing!

545
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,530
It's OK.

546
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm going to hold it.

547
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,170
Owen, what are you doing?

548
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,360
'See if I can absorb it.'

549
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,590
Owen, the energy reading's off
the scale. You won't survive.

550
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,950
It's OK, these things happen.

551
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,540
There must be something we can do.

552
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,650
- Martha, Martha.
- Owen?

553
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,870
If it destroys me, 

554
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,380
they're going to need a new
doctor, y0u've got all the credentials.

555
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,140
Medical skills, a cracking arse.

556
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,630
j6Ck?¡¤

557
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,960
If you even attempt
to bring me back again.

558
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,470
'Gwen, Ioto, it was fun.

559
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,950
'Honestly, thank y0u.'

560
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,480
Tosh?

561
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:36,380
Tosh? Come on, answer me.

562
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,680
'0wen.'

563
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,990
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,540
I love you.

565
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,900
What happened?

566
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,200
We all assume life's
going to be shit, don't we?

567
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,560
That it's alljust darkness.

568
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,870
But you know what?

569
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,970
Sometimes, it's not.

570
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,050
What is it?

571
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,160
Do you remember in the '70s, 

572
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,720
NASA sent messages into space?

573
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,050
A map of our solar system, pictures
of what we look like.

574
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,260
It had images and voices, music.

575
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,730
Even a bit of Chuck Berry.

576
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,080
This is a reply, 

577
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,980
not that we know who from.

578
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,820
What does it do?

579
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,590
It sang to me.

580
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,650
It's a glimmer of light in the darkness.

581
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,320
See?

582
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,200
Sometimes it does get better.

583
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,770
I'm sorry, Drjones.

584
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,830
No vacancies in Cardiffjust yet.

585
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,120
That's OK.

586
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,160
I reckon you're. ..

587
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,460
I was going to say 'fine'

588
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,580
but you're a hell of
a lot more than that.

589
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,120
Thank you.

590
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,110
For everything.

591
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,600
It's what I'm here for.

592
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,040
You take care.

593
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,480
Well, it's been...

594
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,900
interesting.

595
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,240
Oh, it's been fun. You know it has.

596
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,410
Well, everyone else has had a go.

597
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,090
Oh, you can S0 come back any time!

598
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,660
Well, maybe I will. One day.

599
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,940
'Promise me something.'

600
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,040
What's that?

601
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,180
No more locking it all away.

602
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,440
You tell me when it's bad.

603
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,720
Share it with me.

604
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,220
OK?

605
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,630
Tosh, I'm scared.

606
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,830
I'm scared that if I close
my eyes I'll get trapped, 

607
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,720
in the darkness.

608
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm here.

609
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,940
'And that's when I saw y0u.'

610
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,770
I thought you came here to jump?

611
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,060
No, 

612
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,490
I came hereto help.

613
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,810
What do I do now?

614
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,760
You've got a choice.

615
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,930
If you think that the darkness
is too much then go for it.

616
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:08,710
But if there is a chance, just some hope.

617
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,180
It could be having a cigarette, 

618
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,680
or that first sip of hot
tea on a cold morning, 

619
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,840
or it could be your mates, 

620
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,470
if there's even a tiny glimmer of light

621
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,930
then don't you think that's
worth taking a chance?

622
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,010
What's your name?

623
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,050
Maggie.

624
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,950
Maggie Hopley.

625
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,480
Well, Maggie, it's upto you.

626
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,180
Your choice.

627
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:01,400
Do you still want to jump?

628
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,630
'My name is Owen Harper
'and this is my life.'

629
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,200
Careful, Gwen.

630
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,980
This thing eats people.

631
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,130
And what is that exactly?

632
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:19,900
It's a shapeshifter.

633
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,680
With a taste for human flesh.

634
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,140
You're going to have
to postpone the wedding.

635
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,680
You're pregnant!

636
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,510
An alien egg in your belly and
it's mother coming to rip you open.

637
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,570
That is all we need.

638
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,730
In five hours, I'm
walking down the aisle.

639
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,030
You are not thinking straight.

640
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,980
All I want to do today is marry you.

641
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,840
That's the problem with shapeshifters.

642
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,870
I'm not an alien!

643
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,950
You never know what you're looking at.
