1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,570
Torchwood.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,180
Outside the
government,beyond the police.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,650
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,690
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,940
Gwen,weve texted you the location,

6
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,180
were querying four or five signs
of life,definitely non-human.

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,250
Get here as soon as you can.

8
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,720
So,sure theyre not Weevils?

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,550
Dont think so,different energy
patterns,cant make sense of it.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,930
Not a species weve encountered before.

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,150
Lets hope theyre friendly.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,700
Owen,Ianto,take the other side of
the building,check the upper floors.

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,750
Toshiko with me.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,390
OK? Go!

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,400
Im getting mirror
readings on both floors.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,750
One creature at either
end of the building.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,660
Toshiko,split up.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,870
Yknow,these creatures are very quiet.

19
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,850
Maybe theyre sleeping.

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,570
Or hatching.

21
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,950
Or maybe they arent creatures at all.

22
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,270
Just explosive devices.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,850
Snap.

Shit.

28
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,810
You have one message.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,110
Gwen,weve texted you the location,

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,040
- were querying four or five signs of life.
- Shit.

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,470
1,392 deaths earlier

32
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,490
Oh,not again.

33
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,480
Ladies.

34
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,650
Torso of steel,shilling a feel.

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,550
Any takers?

36
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,890
Bar fight,got a little out of control.

37
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,580
Flesh wound.

38
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,560
Still not used to...

39
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,570
these hangovers.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,830
Captain Jack Harkness.

41
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,450
How long have you been there?

42
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,580
Silent types. Thats OK.

43
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,290
I used to date a guy with no mouth.

44
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,430
Surprisingly creative.

45
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,430
Listen,you only had to ask.

46
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,860
Can we get a room though?

47
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,640
When I said about getting a
room,I meant somewhere with linen.

48
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,450
Time was,electrodes to the nipples
meant the start of a good night.

49
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,240
Full power charge and still breathing.

50
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,460
Pretty advanced piece of
equipment you got there.

51
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,340
You ladies are ahead of yourselves.

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,730
Now where the hell am I?

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,760
Put that down before somebody gets...

54
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,040
Why arent you dead yet?

55
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,550
Been trying to figure that out myself.

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,070
Weve been monitoring you.

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,410
Youve been killed 14 times
in the last six months.

58
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,370
Feels like more than that.

59
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,670
Whos the Doctor?

60
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,180
No idea.

61
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,820
"The Doctor,hell be able to fix me"

62
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,130
"When the Doctor turns
up,itll all be put right"

63
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,330
"You wait till I see the Doctor.

64
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,010
"First Im going to kiss
him,then Im going to kill him."

65
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,450
Transcripts of your conversations with
strangers,in various drinking dens,

66
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,120
since you first came to our attention.

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,320
Yknow,no-one
likes a smart-ass.

68
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,850
Tell us where he is
and well release you.

69
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,460
Why do you wanna know?

70
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,110
Youre in Torchwood,Cardiff.

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,300
The Torchwood Institute was created to
combat the threat posed by the Doctor

72
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,410
and other phantasmagoria.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
Hes not a threat.

74
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,970
The Doctors the one wholl save
you from your phantasmahoojits.

75
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,210
Just tell us his location.

76
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,560
I dont know!

77
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,940
He left me behind.

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,660
I came here to find him.

79
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,290
He refuels from that rift you have.

80
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,430
Hoping if I stayed here long
enough,wed find each other.

81
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,670
Now,can I go?

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,430
No.

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,300
You cant keep me here!

84
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,730
Oh,we can.

85
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,170
- Unless...
- Yes.

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,450
Unless.

87
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,360
Unless what?

88
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,010
There are opportunities here.

89
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,430
With the Institute.

90
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,400
Im not for hire.

91
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,320
Youre going to need currency.

92
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,390
Whats the assignment?

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,530
Missing person.

94
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,300
Well,when we say person...

95
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,150
I havent done anything!

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,090
Burglaries,joyriding a horse
and carriage,pick-pocketing,

97
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,860
24 instances of consuming
food without paying for it.

98
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,910
********

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,340
Ill make it up,I promise!

100
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,590
Ah,too late.

101
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,230
Its just a bit of fun.

102
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,130
This planets a century away from
official first contact with alien life.

103
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,940
Youre upsetting the schedule.

104
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,240
Who are you?

105
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,900
Im Torchwood.

106
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,330
I said sorry!

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,730
You cant lock me up!

108
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,820
Hes just a kid. Send him
back to where he came from.

109
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,990
If only we could.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,210
The rift only goes one way.

111
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,720
What do you do?

112
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,380
Observe and profile the species and
then transfer them to long term storage?

113
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,240
Why?

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,470
It was a threat to the Empire.

115
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,330
Like me?

116
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,690
Youre our ally now.

117
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,640
If you dont want it...

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,890
Your next assignment.

119
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,090
No.

120
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,030
Im through with you people.

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Your liberty is at our discretion.

122
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,950
Work for us,you assist the Empire.

123
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,890
Sever that tie,you become a threat.

124
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,820
And youve seen how we deal with threats.

125
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,770
Its good money,Captain.

126
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,860
How else are you going to earn?

127
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,900
See what you think in the morning.

128
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,190
Hes pretty.

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,420
But youre prettier.

130
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,630
Can I read your cards?

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,340
No,thank you.

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,320
No,really.

133
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,060
Hes coming.

134
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,710
The one youre looking for.

135
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,910
But the century will turn twice
before you find each other again.

136
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,230
Are you for real?

137
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,260
You mean I have to wait
100 years to find him?

138
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,730
Whatll I do in the meantime?

139
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,450
{\a6}New Year's Eve 1999

140
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,360
Some parts of the world have
already welcomed in the New Year.

141
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,600
Our cameras,of course,have been
out in force across the UK tonight.

142
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,260
Lets take you first to Cardiff.

143
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,830
Hey,when you joked
about the Millennium Bug,

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,590
I didnt realise it was gonna
have 18 legs stacked with poison.

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,410
Anyone home?

146
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,350
You know youre supposed
to party like its...

147
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,090
Alex?

148
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,710
Jack!

149
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,850
Just in time.

150
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,020
Alex what happened? Who did this?

151
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,170
Me.

152
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,500
What?

153
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,270
Why?

154
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,570
We got it wrong,Jack.

155
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,070
We thought we could
control the stuff we found.

156
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
And whats it brought us?

157
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,620
So much death.

158
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,720
What happened to them?

159
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,060
Its good youre here.

160
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,050
Always did have great timing.

161
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,750
This place,its yours.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,880
Torchwood Three,my gift to you,Jack,for
a century of service as field operative.

163
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,290
Give this place a purpose.

164
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,080
Before its too late. Please.

165
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,230
Alex,listen,its gonna be OK.

166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,980
No. Its not.

167
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,270
Its really not.

168
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,920
I looked inside.

169
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,690
It showed me whats coming.

170
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,290
They were mercy killings.

171
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,060
It was the kindest thing I could do.

172
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,260
So none of us see the storm.

173
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,100
Im sorry I cant do the same for you.

174
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,150
21st century,Jack.
Everythings gonna change.

175
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,790
- And were not ready.
- Alex!

176
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,520
He was dead.

177
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,400
- I checked his pulse!He was dead!
- All right!

178
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,150
Jack,what has happened?
Where are the others?

179
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,930
What is he doing here?

180
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,040
Look,I was late,OK. He
gave me a lift.You OK?

181
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,920
Toshiko.

182
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,960
She went the other way.

183
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,350
5 years earlier

184
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Never thought Id say this to
anyone here,but you work too hard.

185
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,230
Another hour and Im done.

186
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,150
Wish the rest of them thought like you.

187
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,110
Half past five,theyre out
of here like a pack of dogs.

188
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
You have a good evening,sir.

189
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,070
I doubt it.

190
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,110
Another late one,Miss Sato.

191
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
You know me,George.

192
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,710
Married to the job.

193
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,880
When you gonna let me whisk
you away from all this?

194
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,440
As soon as you clear it with
your wife and grandchildren.

195
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,260
Always an excuse.

196
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,850
Take care.

197
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,780
Goodnight,George.

198
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,370
LODMOOR RESEARCH FACILITY

199
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,350
- Ive got it.
- Get in.

200
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,490
I want to see my mother.

201
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,580
I want to know shes safe. Now.

202
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,380
Show me the piece.

203
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,280
Oh,its beautiful.

204
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,240
Perfect sonic modulator.

205
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,900
Toshiko,youve done so well.

206
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,420
Toshiko!

207
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,540
Youve got what you want.

208
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,740
Now let her go.

209
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,670
Except now youre the
victim of your own success.

210
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,580
Perfectly situated,proven ability.

211
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,770
You can give us so much more.

212
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,900
And what if I refuse?

213
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,740
Then your mother stays with us.

214
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,640
And your brilliance is used against her.

215
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,260
- Like this.
- No,dont!

216
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,050
Turn it off! Turn it off!

217
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,400
My mother!

218
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,850
Is she all right? Is she all right?

219
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,540
This is a UNIT facility.

Is my mother safe?

229
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,670
We cannot supply you
with that information.

230
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,060
Prisoner Sato. Inspection.

231
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,410
What for?

232
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,370
Prepare for inspection.

233
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,060
Caterings as lousy as they say,huh?

234
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,370
- Wheres my mother?
- Shes safe.

235
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,540
She wont remember being kidnapped.

236
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,690
I wiped it from her memory.

237
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,230
I hope you dont mind.

238
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,420
You did what?

239
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,630
Really,just a little pill.

240
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,340
Shell never have known.

241
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,530
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

242
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,360
I dont exist.

243
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,170
And for a man with my charisma,that
is quite an achievement.

244
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,430
Are you a lawyer?

245
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,300
Do I look like a lawyer?

246
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,800
Theyre gonna make an example of you.

247
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,480
Stealing official
secrets,in todays climate...

248
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,570
Theyre going to keep
you here without charge.

249
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,830
Forever.

250
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,310
- They cant do that.
- Theyre never going to release you.

251
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,910
Im sorry.

252
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,990
You made this,right?

253
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,010
I just followed the plans.

254
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,500
Yeah,kinda.

255
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,270
But first you had to grasp the
concept of what a sonic modulator does.

256
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,570
Most people would struggle with that.

257
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,440
And another thing...

258
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,610
the plans dont work.

259
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,030
What?

260
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,420
The technical plans you
followed,they were wrong.

261
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,530
They had mistakes in them.

262
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,980
Thats why the plans were shelved.

263
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,920
But you,Toshiko Sato,you
automatically fixed things as you went.

264
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,160
What Im trying to say is...

265
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,490
oh baby,youre good.

266
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,280
I mean,youre good now.

267
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,260
Imagine what youd be like
with a little training.

268
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,740
Shame youre gonna be
locked up for so long.

269
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,500
- Youve got to get me out of here.
- If...

270
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,840
you come work for me.

271
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,530
Really?

272
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,340
Give me five years,Ill get
them to wipe your record clean.

273
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,830
They owe me a few favours.

274
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,900
What do you do?

275
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,080
Protect people.

276
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,770
Least,thats what Im aiming for.

277
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,010
Its kind of a work in progress.

278
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,040
- What about my mother?
- Limited contact only.

279
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,730
You can send her postcards.

280
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,610
So what dyou say?

281
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,010
Why would you trust me?

282
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,300
Instinct.

283
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,130
Its going to be dangerous.

284
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,710
Think you can bear a little danger?

285
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,950
Stop! Stop!Stop!

286
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,250
Tosh,are you OK?

287
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,770
Youre making it worse.

288
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,110
Its pushing down even more now.

289
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,230
I think Ive broken my arm.

290
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,120
- Gwen.
- Yeah?

291
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,960
If this pillar shifts down
even more,itll crush me.

292
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,190
*******

293
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,150
Were gonna need more strength.

294
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,610
Look,Jack has gone to
find Owen and Ianto.

295
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,230
Youre gonna be fine,all right.

296
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
Youve gotta hurry,please.

297
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,490
Go help Jack. Ill stay here.

298
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,260
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

299
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,160
Im going to come back
for you darling,all right?

300
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,120
Youre going to be OK.

301
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,330
Gwen,this couldve been you,couldnt
it? If you hadnt been late.

302
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,490
I havent got time for this
now. Ive got to find the others.

303
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,730
Ianto!

304
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,450
Ianto!

305
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,650
21 months earlier

306
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,960
Thanks.

307
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,510
No,thank you.

308
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,400
And you are?

309
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,480
Jones,Ianto Jones.

310
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,300
Nice to meet you,Jones,Ianto Jones.

311
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,730
Capn Jack Harkness.

312
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,860
Lucky escape.

313
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,650
I had it under control.

314
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,890
You think so?

315
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,170
It looked pretty vicious.

316
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,720
Youre,um...

317
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,070
You were bleeding.

318
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,790
Had worse from shaving.

319
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,660
Looked like a Weevil to me.

320
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,910
Ive no idea what youre talking about.

321
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,030
Ill take him from here.

322
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,210
Thanks for the assistance.

323
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,260
Anytime.

324
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,240
By the way,love the coat.

325
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,840
Morning.

326
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,620
Coffee?

327
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,170
I want to work for
you. Sorry.No vacancies.

328
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,340
Look,let me tell you about myself.

329
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,590
Ianto Jones,born August 19th 1983.

330
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,670
Able student but not exceptional,one minor
conviction for shoplifting in your teens.

331
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,200
Number of temporary
jobs,mainly a drifter,

332
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,380
until two years ago you join the
Torchwood Institute in London.

333
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,480
Junior researcher.

334
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,150
- Girlfriend,Lisa Hallett.
- Deceased.

335
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,060
Im sorry.

336
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,180
Look,you checked me out.

337
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,050
You knew what a Weevil was.

338
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,950
Thought I was gonna have
to come deal with you.

339
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,060
I have the right
qualifications for the job.

340
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,410
There is no job.

341
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,830
Were nothing to do
with Torchwood London.

342
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,750
I severed all links.

343
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,680
Yet when it burned,two members
of your team scavenged the ruins.

344
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,180
Dont want the equipment
getting into the wrong hands.

345
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,270
And youre the right hands,are you?

346
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,590
Trial period,three months.

347
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,320
No.

348
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,930
Three weeks. Three days.

349
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,880
Let me prove myself to you.

350
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,680
- Ill work for nothing.
- No.

351
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,290
I saw what they did at Canary Wharf.

352
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,570
What am I supposed to
do with those memories?

353
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,340
You are not my responsibility.

354
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,130
And were not hiring.

355
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,890
Same time tomorrow then.

356
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,450
There is no job for you
here and there never will be.

357
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,400
I really like that coat.

358
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,850
Toshiko,see if you can
decode those hieroglyphics.

359
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,560
Already on it.

360
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,110
Owen,take a cross section
of the paramedics brain,

361
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,820
check it against the
list of chemical agents.

362
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,420
Will do.

363
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,670
Susie,were going to need
to dredge the reservoir.

364
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,260
See if you can find the other half.

365
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,880
OK,this has to stop.

366
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,740
No,listen to me.

367
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,620
I dont have time for this.

368
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,810
I dont care what your problem is,I
want you out of this city by sunrise.

369
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,280
There is no place for you here.

370
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,500
Go back to London,find
yourself another life.

371
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,240
Keep stalking me,Ill wipe your memory.

372
00:29:59,250 --> 00:29:59,970
No,but the thing is...

373
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,950
Any conversation between us,no
matter what the subject,is over!******

374
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,120
Im getting back behind the wheel of
that car and if youre still in the road,

375
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,200
Im going to drive through you.

376
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,680
Youre not gonna help me
catch this pterodactyl then?

377
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,020
OK,that is the only
special equipment youve got?

378
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,080
Yeah,cos I keep dinosaur
nets in the back of the SUV.

379
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,270
Torchwood London wouldve.

380
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,660
How did you find it?

381
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,190
Rift activity locator.

382
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,970
Torchwood London.

383
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,320
See,quality kit.

384
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,330
Yeah,its quite excitable.

385
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,810
Must be your aftershave.

386
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,970
Never wear any.

387
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,060
You smell like that naturally?

388
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,270
51st century pheromones.

389
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,040
You people have no idea.

390
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,220
Ready for another go?

391
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,030
Im game if you are.

392
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,120
Three,two,one...

393
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,670
Split up!

394
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,680
Were not gonna harm you.

395
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,680
You cant stay here.

396
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,710
Come back with me.

397
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,800
Ive got somewhere nice and
big where you can fly around.

398
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,010
OK,so youll let the
pterodactyl in and not me.

399
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,370
We need a guard dog.

400
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,880
I can be that.

401
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,080
Like a receptionist.

402
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,970
Building maintenance,food
and drink,dry cleaning even.

403
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,260
That coat of yours
must take a battering.

404
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,670
Like a butler,I could be a butler.

405
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,770
We dont need a butler.

406
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,610
Excuse me,dried egg on your collar.

407
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,910
It was a busy week.

408
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,870
What exactly is your plan?

409
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,920
Im going to be the decoy.

410
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,990
And it will rip you to shreds.

411
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,290
Dinosaurs?

412
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,680
Had em for breakfast.

413
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,100
Had to,only source of pre-killed food
protein after the asteroid crashed.

414
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,410
Long story. Here you go.

415
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,470
One injection to the
central nervous cortex.

416
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,660
Ill keep it occupied. Move.

417
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,170
- No.
- What?

418
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,770
It knows me. Ill be a better decoy.

419
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,670
No,way too dangerous.

420
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,290
No,Ive got a secret weapon. Chocolate.

421
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,180
Preferably dark.

422
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,180
I got your favourite,yeah.

423
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,060
Its good for your serotonin levels.

424
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,770
If youve got serotonin levels.

425
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,950
Ianto!

426
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,230
Sorry!

427
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,440
I should go.

428
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,310
Report for work... first thing tomorrow.

429
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,690
Like the suit,by the way.

430
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,930
Ready? One,two three...Come on.

431
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,570
- You OK?
- My shoulder.

432
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,160
I think its dislocated.

433
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,950
- Can you take this?
- Yeah.

434
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Take a deep breath.

435
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,630
Where are the others?

436
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,300
We need your help to get Toshiko out.

437
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,010
- Owen?
- No sign yet.

438
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,820
If anything happens
he cant repair himself.

439
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,320
Of course,he cant heal,can he?

440
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,190
OK,well help Rhys with Toshiko.

441
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,410
Let us know when you find Owen.

442
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,540
- And be careful.
- OK.

443
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,980
OK? All right?

444
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,030
4 years earlier

445
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,210
Oh,go
on,please,please,please,please,please!

446
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,980
No,you dont even like her,ever since she didnt
pay for her share of the Chinese in Leicester.

447
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,790
Yeah,but we want Julia to come and itll
look odd if we invite one without the other.

448
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,920
Oh,please,help me God!

449
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,840
Three tables done. Nine more to go.

450
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,150
You wanna back out?

451
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,880
Its still not too late.

452
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:17,190
Listen,Im marrying you
even if it kills me. OK?

453
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,940
Good.

454
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,590
Do you want a cup of tea?

455
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,620
Yeah,Ill make one.

456
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,880
I think I can manage.

457
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,760
- Katie.
- Yeah?

458
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,320
- Um,water.
- Yeah.

459
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,120
From the kettle.

460
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,300
Milk.

461
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,050
Stop nagging me! I
dont want to have milk.

462
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,170
Ive never liked milk. I want to have...

463
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,340
Tea.

464
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,250
I wanna have tea without...

465
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,630
Milk.

466
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,240
Tea without milk.

467
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,170
Darling,its all right. Its all right.

468
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,440
I got your invitation.

469
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,990
Still going ahead?

470
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,790
I promised her a summer wedding.

471
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,910
Before all this.

472
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,240
This changes nothing.

473
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,070
Owen,it will change everything.

474
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,780
You dont know for certain.

475
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,690
Weve been through Kates test results more
times than any patient in my whole career.

476
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,920
*****

477
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,570
All the evidence suggests she
has early onset Alzheimers.

478
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,490
The youngest case in medical history.

479
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,270
It doesnt mean were wrong.

480
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,680
Please... run more tests.

481
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,930
Lets just try one more MRI scan.

482
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,660
An MRI isnt going to
make any difference.

483
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,600
You dont know that.

484
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,830
You have said yourself that this
is unlike any case that youve seen,

485
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,550
- and maybe youve missed something.
- Owen...

486
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,360
You dont understand,Jim,OK.

487
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,990
One day shes fine,shes perfect memory,the old
Katie,and the next theres nothing,shes blank.

488
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,480
Now,I am losing her and I dont
know what to do about that,OK?

489
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,890
So please.

490
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,570
Whats the point of me doing this
job if I cant help my own fiancee?

491
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,470
Ill see what I can do.

492
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,390
Thank you,Jim.

493
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,630
Its like being lost,in a place you know
really well,but you cant get your bearings.

494
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,410
Sometimes it comes back
to you. And sometimes...

495
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,920
Im sorry,Owen.

496
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,630
Whatve you got to be sorry for?

497
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,350
I dont want to put you through this.

498
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,850
Last night,I dreamt that you left me.

499
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,170
Oh,come on.

500
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,600
Nobodys leaving anyone.

501
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,240
How is that possible?

502
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,300
We dont know.

503
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,270
Ive never seen anything like it.

504
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,860
Its not the brain deteriorating.

505
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,780
Its a clear physical tumour.

506
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,040
That wasnt there last week?

507
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,370
Not that we saw.

508
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,420
You were right to ask for another scan.

509
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,210
So what do we do now?

510
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,330
We have to view this as good news.

511
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,040
Katie,we need to take you into surgery,soon
as possible,and remove the tumour.

512
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,370
Dyou understand?

513
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,470
Katie.

514
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,730
I cant remember your name.

515
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,170
Are you sure shes up to this?

516
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Were going to do
everything we can for her.

517
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,340
Im sorry.

518
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,470
Who the hell are you?

519
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,370
You should prepare for the worst.

520
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,940
No,you cant go in there.

521
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,550
Oh,my God!

522
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,460
Katie.

523
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,060
What is it?

524
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,080
Im sorry. I tried to stop them.

525
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,130
Shes dead.

526
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,820
That thing in her head
is an alien life form.

527
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,950
It incubates in the brain,disrupting
the shape and functions.

528
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,350
When its attacked or threatened,it
emits a toxic gas thats fatal to humans.

529
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,110
It clears pretty quickly.

530
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,570
She cant be dead. She cant be dead.

531
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,110
Im calling,calling the police.

532
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,810
Tell them that Torchwood is
already here and dealing with it.

533
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,100
Thatll save them a call-out.

534
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,580
I need to take her brain back with me.

535
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,360
Dont touch her!

536
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,840
- How are you feeling?
- Where is she?

537
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,300
- Wheres who?
- Katie.

538
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,290
Katie Russell,shes a junior doctor,she
works here,were about to get married.

539
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,160
- Lets get you back into bed.
- Get off me.

540
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,570
Where is she?

541
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,920
Where is she?

542
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,950
Where is she?

543
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,280
He was wearing a military uniform.

544
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,450
He had an American accent.

545
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,430
We have checked all
the security footage.

546
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,640
There was no such man.

547
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:05,100
Jim Garrett was poisoned by
some alien toxin,by some...

548
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,120
Jim Garrett was in a car accident.

549
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,470
The American said that he wanted
her brain,that there was...

550
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,340
alien creature,or...

551
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,700
This happened,OK?

552
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,310
This is not some trauma or delayed
grief or whatever youre scribbling down.

553
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,930
Katies tumour was inoperable.

554
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,140
There was nothing
anyone could have done.

555
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,000
This is just wrong.

556
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,430
Im giving you three
months prescribed rest.

557
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,870
Dont come into work.

558
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,940
Yeah!

559
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,650
This isnt right.

560
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,600
He was there.

561
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,530
It wasnt just me.

562
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,080
He was there too.

563
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,570
That is not what happened!

564
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,620
That is... not what happened.

565
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,590
You!

566
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,230
You couldve saved her!

567
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,800
You couldve saved her!

568
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,450
You couldve... saved her!

569
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,390
I couldnt.

570
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,220
I really couldnt.

571
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,970
If youre not a figment of my imagination,then
I dont know whats happening any more.

572
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,700
Maybe this is...

573
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,420
what a mental breakdown feels like.

574
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,730
Youre fine.

575
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,100
Its the rest of the
world thats delusional.

576
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,270
Why her?

577
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,540
Theres no reason.

578
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,440
Your life doesnt end with her.

579
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,180
What are you gonna do now?

580
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,660
Go back to work? See echoes
of her in every corridor?

581
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,280
You need a purpose.

582
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,190
Im building something.

583
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,730
I need a medic.

584
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,660
And you want me?

585
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,990
You made them take more scans.

586
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,330
You kept trying to track me down.

587
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,980
You dont give up easily.

588
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,950
I need someone like that
to work with me in Cardiff.

589
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,890
To fight aliens.

590
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,720
Exactly.

591
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,850
Look...

592
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,740
I dunno what happened to Katie
and I dunno who you really are,

593
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,490
but there is no such thing as aliens.

594
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,360
You think?

595
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,790
Im having a breakdown.

596
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,540
Mental collapse.

597
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,810
Owen,why did you become a doctor?

598
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,680
I thought if I could save one
life,mine would be worthwhile.

599
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,460
But you save one... and
theres another.And another.

600
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,140
All clawing at
you,demanding to be saved.

601
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,150
And even if you do succeed,you
can never save enough.

602
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,590
Maybe here you can.

603
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,220
- How are the others?
- All right.

604
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,650
Careful!

605
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,590
If that falls...

606
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,170
OK,its not going to fall...

607
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,180
- OK.
- Just be very careful.

608
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,450
OK,all right,all right.
Were gonna get you out.

609
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,040
OK,this one?

610
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,630
- Look,if you do it very,very gently...
- OK.

611
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,090
It isnt going to drop on you.

612
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,720
- Quiet.
- OK,sorry.

613
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,200
Im going to do this
as quickly as possible.

614
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,630
Listen to me. Im going
to get you out of this.

615
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,500
Look at me,trust me.

616
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,340
- OK,hold my hands.
- Sorry.

617
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,240
Hold my hands!

618
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,440
You OK?

619
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,770
You all right?

620
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,580
Tosh,what happened?

621
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:48,460
Broken arm,bruised ribs,about an inch
away from being crushed by a girder.

622
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,520
- You were lucky.
- We all were.

623
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,300
Jack,whos done this?

624
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,750
And wheres the SUV?

625
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh,no.

626
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,890
Jack,what does he want?

627
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,260
Oh,deja vu!

628
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,740
Or did I say that already?

629
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,980
Hey,team.

630
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,510
Course,there might be a
few less of you by now.

631
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,900
Dont know if you liked my little gift.

632
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,130
Course,you cant die.

633
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:18,350
And with all that life,all that
time,you cant spare any for me.

634
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,920
Say hi to the family.

635
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,020
No... it cant be.

636
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,320
Been a while since youve
seen your brother,eh,Jack.

637
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,770
Gray?

638
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,430
OK,heres whats going to happen.

639
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,550
Everything you love,everything
you treasure will die.

640
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,780
Im going to tear your world apart,

641
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,820
Captain Jack Harkness,piece by piece.

642
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,800
Starting now.

643
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,210
Maybe now youll wanna
spend some time with me.

644
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,850
This was a targeted attack.

645
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,700
The beast killed the
four most senior officers.

646
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,510
If it gets out what happened
therell be city-wide panic.

647
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,430
Lets get ourselves a good view.

648
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,520
What have you done?

649
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,320
Were going to put the city
back together,find Jack...

650
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,270
and punish John.

651
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,330
Its completely crippled us.

652
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,970
Youre no fun.

653
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,610
Owen,get out of there.

654
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,110
What have you done with my brother?

655
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,010
This is going to get nasty.

656
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,710
What if this is how it ends?
