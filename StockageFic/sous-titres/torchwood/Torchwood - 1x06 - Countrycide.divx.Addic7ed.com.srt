1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,079
This programme contains some
strong language.

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:06,039
Torchwood. Outside the
government, beyond the police.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:11,439
Tracking down alien life on earth,
arming the human
race against the future.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,280
The 21st century is when
everything changes

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
and you've got to be ready.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,599
MOBILE RINGS

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,040
Dad? I dunno, hour and half, tops.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,959
I'll be there soon as I can.
I can't hear you.

9
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,320
The signal's going.

10
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,800
Hello?

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
Are you all right?

12
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,239
Come on!

13
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,239
CLATTERING

14
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,399
METAL SCRAPES

15
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,360
Leave me alone!

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,319
BANG

17
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,319
SHE SCREAMS

18
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,560
SCREAMING CONTINUES

19
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,760
I hate the countryside.

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,679
It's dirty, it's unhygienic.

21
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,879
And what is that smell?
That would be grass.

22
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,400
It's disgusting.

23
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,920
Seventeen disappearances
within the last five months.

24
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,479
Police are clueless.
Now there's a surprise.

25
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,880
No offence, PC Cooper.

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,000
The last known whereabouts of
each one is somewhere around here.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,520
All within a 20-mile radius.

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Anything else linking them? None
of the bodies have ever been found.

29
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,159
These people just fell off
the radar. No patterns in age,
sex, race.

30
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,999
One minute they're here, the next...
boof. Gone.

31
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,320
The rift doesn't spread
out this far. Does it?

32
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,999
We don't know that much
about it to be certain.

33
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,200
And it's increasing in
activity all the time.

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,159
Come on, aliens aren't gonna
bother hanging around out here.

35
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,439
Probably some sort of
weird suicide club with people
choosing the same spot to end it all.

36
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,439
God knows, if I had to spend too
long up here, I'd want to top myself.

37
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,759
Here you go.

38
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,360
Careful, they're hot.
Sure you don't want anything, Tosh?

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,440
Really sure.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,560
A friend of mine caught
hepatitis off a burger
from one of these places.

41
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:07,039
We'll start with the most
recent victim, Ellie Johnson.

42
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,760
We last have record of
her making a phone call.

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,360
She dropped out of signal mid-call.

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,879
The coverage map has her placed...

45
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,360
somewhere about here.

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,079
Looks as good a place
as any to set up camp.

47
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,759
Sorry, did you say camp?

48
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,560
What's the matter with a hotel?
People are going missing round here.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
D'you really wanna stay in
a place run by strangers?

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,279
Cos sleeping outside
is a lot safer(!)

51
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,360
No other race
in the universe goes camping.

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,640
Celebrate your own uniqueness.

53
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,319
What am I supposed to do with this?
Need a hand getting it up, Owen?

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,479
If I did, I wouldn't ask you.

55
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,159
Some pieces are missing!

56
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,719
No. I checked.

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,680
HEAVY BREATHING

58
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,360
Oh, come on! It's just a bit of fun!
Who was the last person you snogged?

59
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,320
See! You even sound
like an eight-year-old!
Who the hell says "snog"?

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,000
Mine was... Rhys!
Yeah, well, there's a surprise.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,160
Tosh, your go. It's easy for you!

62
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Oh, come on! Spill the beans!

63
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,639
Owen. What?

64
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,359
Really? Tosh, in your dreams.

65
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:31,999
3am, Christmas Eve,
in front of the Millennium Centre.

66
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,240
Waiting for a cab. I had mistletoe.

67
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,759
Christmas?! You've not had
a snog since. No.

68
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,959
Well.

69
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,440
Lucky me, eh?

70
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
So who was yours?

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,479
Gwen, actually.

72
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,000
When was this?

73
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:05,199
It was complicated.

74
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
Didn't take you long to get
your feet under the table.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,840
What?

76
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,760
So was it just a kiss, or...

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,480
Tosh, leave it.

78
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,719
Jack?

79
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,360
Are we including non-human
lifeforms? Oh, you haven't!
You're a sick man, Harkness!

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,000
That is disgusting!
I never know when he's joking.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,319
It's my turn, is it?

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,639
It was Lisa.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,920
Ianto, I'm sorry...

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,119
Sorry she's dead?
Or sorry you mentioned it?

85
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,400
I just didn't think.

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,280
You forgot.

87
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,479
We should get some firewood.
I'll give you a hand.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Couldn't you have kept
that to yourself?
What's the matter, you embarrassed?

89
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,520
You're such an arrogant
shit sometimes, Owen!

90
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,639
That was a good kiss. It was
borderline great. So good, you've
been avoiding me ever since.

91
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,919
Country air's making you delusional.
How long did it last? Ten seconds?

92
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
But the things I can tell
from that kiss. Oh, like?

93
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,559
Like your sex life ain't up to much.
You what?!

94
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:31,719
Y'see old Rhys makes the
earth rumble, but he don't
make it move, does he?

95
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,600
You might want to shut
up before I lamp you one.

96
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
When was the last time
you screwed all night?

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,519
When was the last time you
came so hard, and so long,
you forgot where you are?

98
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,160
Doesn't happen with him,
does it? You're too familiar.

99
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,839
Whereas, you and me,

100
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,519
we're not cosy at all.

101
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,320
We'd be amazing!

102
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,880
And that scares the shit out of you.

103
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:06,679
Someone's watching us.
Through the trees.

104
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,679
50 yards north.

105
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,159
I just saw them move.

106
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,920
You got your gun? Yes.

107
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,879
You go to your left.
I'll go right.

108
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,879
Three...two...one.

109
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,199
BIRD FLIES OFF

110
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,080
Bollocks! How did we lose them? Owen.

111
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Well, it's not Ellie Johnson,
that's for sure.

112
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,080
This is a male, late 40s, 50s.

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,479
Wasn't killed here. No blood
spatter or signs of a struggle.

114
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:35,320
Must have been brought here after he
died. Why do that? It's not like
they've tried to bury him here.

115
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,599
Maybe you disturbed them and they
ran away. Maybe it's a warning.

116
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,720
Whoever's responsible
marking out their territory.

117
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,240
Cause of death? Impossible to say.

118
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,720
The body's been stripped of
the flesh and bodily organs.

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,079
Could the Weevils
have come out this far?

120
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,280
No, Weevils don't finish
off their victims like this.

121
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,359
CAR ENGINE STARTS
Is that ours? Yeah.

122
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,160
All right! I've said I'm sorry!
Basic security protocols, Owen!

123
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,120
Oh, get off your high horse, Tosh!
I was carrying that stupid gear.

124
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,439
What, the whole time? and then I was
trying to put that bloody tent up.

125
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,999
And then... Yes, I sort of forgot
that I'd left them in there.
But I'm sorry.

126
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:42,199
I'm human. I ballsed up. Looks
like that body wasn't a warning.

127
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,039
More of a decoy.
That would mean we've been
watched since we've arrived.

128
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,280
Tosh, can you get a tracking signal?

129
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,040
Already done. I took the liberty.

130
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,319
It's currently 3.4 miles
west from here.

131
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,359
Gunning at ninety, no doubt. You
steal a piece of equipment like that,
you drive straight on till morning.

132
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:02,280
Actually, no. It's been stationary
for the past four minutes.

133
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,360
I'd go so far as to say it was
parked. There's a small
village in that area.

134
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,440
Other than that, nothing for 30
miles. Call me suspicious, but this
has all the hallmarks of a trap.

135
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,879
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

136
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,160
Anyone fancy a walk?

137
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,919
Why would anyone want to live
out here? Has the SUV moved?

138
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,320
Not for an hour now.

139
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,400
HEAVY BREATHING

140
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Tosh, Ianto - follow
the signal, find the SUV.

141
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,879
Owen, Gwen...

142
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,400
Let's see
if there's any room at the inn.

143
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,519
Pint of best please, love.
And em, yeah, get one for yourself.

144
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,519
Where is everybody?

145
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,159
SHE RETCHES

146
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,480
You OK? In there.

147
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,040
That burger coming back to haunt
you?

148
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,160
Oh, my God...

149
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
Gwen!

150
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:48,559
Jack please...
something's going on here.

151
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,760
Let's take a look in here?
Come on.

152
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,680
One, two, three...

153
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,079
What is it?

154
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
There's another body in there.

155
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,200
Same as the other?

156
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,440
What did this, Jack? Cos whatever
it is, it can't be human.
How far is this going to spread?

157
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Stay focused. I should be
having dinner with Rhys.
What am I doing here with you?!

158
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,159
Don't you ever get scared, Jack?
Huh?

159
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,960
There's another two houses.

160
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
We'd better take a look.

161
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Whatever they were,

162
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,760
I hope you put up a good fight.

163
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,080
It's just half a mile up here.

164
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
Least we've still got this.

165
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,360
Rest of my stuff was in the vehicle.

166
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,159
DISTANT YELP

167
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,559
What was that?

168
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,959
Just a...fox

169
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,640
or something.

170
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Check round the back. Yeah.

171
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,319
ANIMAL YELP

172
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,160
We should carry on straight up there.

173
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,320
Tosh!

174
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,920
Tosh!

175
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,120
Tosh!

176
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,680
Locked? Locked.

177
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,279
Gwen! Gwen!

178
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,719
Gwen! Gwen.

179
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,959
Put the gun on the floor!

180
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,680
PUT THE GUN DOWN ON THE FLOOR!

181
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,320
I thought you were them!

182
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,559
I thought they'd come back for me!
Thought who had come back for you?
WHO?!

183
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,199
Gwen...Gwen!

184
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,799
Gwen, what's happened?

185
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,480
A kid hit her with a shotgun.

186
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,960
I got you, I got you.

187
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,360
Move, move!

188
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,560
Get in.

189
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,279
OK, I'll check upstairs.

190
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,599
Owen! Owen! Bet you thought
you'd never be glad to see me!

191
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,280
Right... Help me!

192
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,400
Listen, listen, I'm going to
have a look at your wound now, OK?

193
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Just keep calm.
Hands off, hands off. OK.

194
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,440
No, don't please!

195
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,519
Right, it could've been much worse.

196
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,399
Hold this apply pressure.

197
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:51,760
Oh, Jesus! The bullets are lodged
near the surface.
You've been bloody lucky, girl.

198
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,759
Another inch to the left

199
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,120
and any one of your vital
organs might've been... Anyway.

200
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,879
D'you want a quip about
feeling a small prick?

201
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,919
No, but thanks for offering.
Here we go.

202
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:17,719
All done. GOD!
Let's get these pellets out, eh?

203
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,920
Right, there's gonna be
a certain amount of residue.

204
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,360
So just lie back
and think of Torchwood.

205
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,439
D'you miss being a doctor?
Excuse me,

206
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,080
I still am a doctor.

207
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,560
I just don't deal with
patients any more, that's all.

208
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,359
It's ideal.

209
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,240
That was the bit I always hated.

210
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,519
You beauty.

211
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,160
Come on. I'm good.

212
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,239
Not bad.

213
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,439
What's taking Tosh and Ianto so
long? Jack, the SUV might be locked
up. Or they could be dead!

214
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,800
Well, everyone else is. Sit down!

215
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,640
Tell us what happened here.

216
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,399
It's not human. Look,
my mum won't know what's happened.

217
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:48,439
They're expecting me
back for the weekend.
Look, we'll get you home OK.

218
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,080
What are you going to do?
You can't fight them.

219
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,840
They're too strong. The only thing
we can do is barricade the door.

220
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
No! We'll make base at the pub.

221
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,479
Should we go after Tosh and Ianto?
Not till we know what we're dealing
with. But what if it's too late?

222
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:05,239
They're not children.
They know what to do.

223
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:08,040
Let's go.
It's all right. I've got her.

224
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
Owen, I want to do it on my own.

225
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Look, I'm sorry about your friends.

226
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,160
You know, I never liked camping.

227
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,959
Don't bother. They took the guns.

228
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,200
Charming place they've got.
Judging by
the sound reverberations...

229
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,880
and the air quality,
pretty deep underground.

230
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,759
Chances of rescue? We won't need
rescuing. I haven't met a cell yet
I couldn't get out of.

231
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,880
What were they? I don't know.

232
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,639
It happened too quickly.

233
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,999
Are you worried?

234
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,599
A little. Only...

235
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,279
that body we saw, in the forest.

236
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't think about it.

237
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,159
See if you can get
that light to work, huh?

238
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,879
You're used to this, aren't you?

239
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,039
That facial expression you all share.

240
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,279
When things get a bit...
out of control.

241
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,399
Like you enjoy it.
Like you get a high from the danger.
You want me to apologise for that?

242
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:50,280
Don't you ever wonder how long you
can survive before you go mad,
or get killed, or lose a loved one?

243
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,359
It's worth the risk.

244
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,880
To protect people.
And who protects us?!

245
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,919
God, I'm hungry. You should
have had that cheeseburger.

246
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,239
Not THAT hungry.

247
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,120
What's that?

248
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,799
You've found something?

249
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,520
It's just a shoe.

250
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,319
Wait, there's another.

251
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,519
There's dozens of them.

252
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,759
Oh, my God...
How many people have been down here?

253
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,599
And what happened to them?

254
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,719
Is that a fridge?

255
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,439
Tosh, what is it, what's in there?

256
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,119
Tell me!

257
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,479
Ianto, don't. I want to know!

258
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,920
That's why there was
nothing left on the body.

259
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,240
They need to eat.

260
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,880
We're food.

261
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,919
So, if we barricade ourselves in,
what happens to Tosh and Ianto?

262
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,839
Why are we still talking about this?
Tosh and Ianto can look after
themselves.

263
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,719
The kid is our first responsibility
and they've already been for him
once. They're not going to give up.

264
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:21,519
So have we ever heard of a species
who strip human bodies of flesh
and organs? You need to rest.

265
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm compiling what we've got.
Seeing if it helps.

266
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:31,719
We have to assume the others who
disappeared have been killed.
17 deaths? At least.

267
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,840
These aren't casual killers.

268
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,559
OK. So all this means
is the rift is spreading.

269
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,960
Dumping aliens and psychos
wherever it fancies. Looks like that.

270
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,200
Great. This conversation's
cheered me up no end.

271
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,560
Did you see that? Something outside?

272
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,559
Was that the same one or different?

273
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,599
He said they'd come back.

274
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,840
Let's not jump to conclusions.

275
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,439
We don't know who they are
or what their intentions are.

276
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:05,440
I'm thinking that's not a good sign.

277
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,199
They've come back.
Kieran, listen to my voice, OK.

278
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:18,840
Just come back. Kieran!

279
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,759
OK, so we didn't check the cellar.

280
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,960
You can't let them in! Come back
from the door. Don't let them in!

281
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,439
Sit down! We've got this under
control! You don't understand, you
don't know what they're like.

282
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,880
No, please...please, no, not me...!

283
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,160
Kieran! HELP ME!

284
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,880
It's pitch black. You don't have any
tracking devices! Wanna get yourself
killed? Get out of my way!

285
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,080
Look whatever's in that cellar
took three bullets. I heard it fall.

286
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,240
Once we know what it is, we'll know
how to deal with it. You do that.

287
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,440
We'll go after Kieran
and the others. You are wounded!
Do you think that's gonna stop me?!

288
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,159
Be careful.

289
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,599
Go.

290
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,680
Got to be three steel bolts -
top, middle and bottom.

291
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,999
How are you at calculating
target stress points?

292
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:45,760
Find the weakest point,
bit of brute force...

293
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Nice thought. But it's reinforced.

294
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,240
Get off! Look at me, you idiot!
I'm not gonna hurt you!

295
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,760
You've got a gun.
I promise, I promise.

296
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,600
OK, OK...give her some space.

297
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,080
Thank you.

298
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,720
Were you injured? When they took you?

299
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,519
Can I see? I'm a nurse.

300
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,320
OK, OK, OK.

301
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,039
Does anyone else know you're here?
Have you managed to call for help?

302
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,559
We don't need any help.

303
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,799
There's three more
of us in the village.

304
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,039
I can't help you.

305
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,079
I'm sorry.

306
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,879
What d'you mean?
I've been sent to collect you.

307
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,519
I've got to take you to them.

308
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,320
Tell us what's going on.

309
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,519
We can help.

310
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,760
No-one's safe.

311
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
Every ten years...

312
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,680
..it takes us again.

313
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,839
What takes you? What is it?

314
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,119
The Harvest.

315
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,520
No, please, you have to
come with me.

316
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,000
Help me.

317
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,560
Please...help. Did you attack us?

318
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,119
I'm dying, help me...

319
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,080
I'll tell you everything...

320
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,520
This'll help you for a short amount
of time. Now start talking.

321
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,360
You've got to get help.
I know where you can get some.
We had a deal.

322
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,440
I help you, you tell me where
they've taken the boy and what
the hell is going on around here.

323
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,439
HE LAUGHS MIRTHLESSLY

324
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,560
You don't know?

325
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,159
What are you doing?!

326
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,359
Put it back!

327
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:08,079
You need to know something.

328
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,200
A long time ago,
I was pretty good at torture.

329
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Y'see, I had quite a
reputation as the go-to guy.

330
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,319
My job demanded
it at the time, you see.

331
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,360
So I know

332
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,160
where to apply the tiniest amount
of pressure to a wound like yours.

333
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,519
You've gotta stop,
you're gonna kill me. PLEASE STOP!!

334
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,439
It's in your power to get
me to stop.

335
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,920
Just tell me what I need to know.

336
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,560
Because in ten seconds,
I'm gonna find a sharp object.

337
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,399
Right.. All right.

338
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:41,880
I'll tell you everything,

339
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,480
just stop.

340
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,999
Now talk.

341
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,160
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, fine,

342
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm fine.

343
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:02,160
That's all we bloody need.
Let me do the talking,
I'll get rid of him.

344
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:08,520
Who are you, please?
Special Ops. From Torchwood,
have you heard of Torchwood?

345
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,480
What's that then, a band is it?
What's wrong with her?
Mate, you wouldn't understand.

346
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,599
What's that light over there?

347
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,200
The Big House?
Sort of unofficial village hall.

348
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,080
Village meeting tonight, that's
why I'm here. Constabulary report.

349
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,279
Come on.
Where do you think you're going?

350
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,719
In there, please.

351
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:35,400
If you help us,
we can stop all this. Please.

352
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,519
I'm sorry. Get back.

353
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,879
Oh, God, that stench...

354
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,840
Tell us what these creatures are.

355
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Do they look like us?

356
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,839
How else are we gonna look?

357
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:29,679
There are three more out there.
Not a problem. How are they?

358
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,840
They're in a good state.

359
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,080
I think they're the best
we've ever had. Yeah?

360
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,919
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we caught the boy.

361
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,559
Finally.

362
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,240
Come on.

363
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:54,240
I won't tell anyone!

364
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,639
Who is he?

365
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,919
He's meat.

366
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,279
I'm afraid we're all just meat.

367
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,119
Get ready to run.

368
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,839
What're you going to do,
put us on meat hooks?

369
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,799
No, not yet.

370
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,680
You see...meat...

371
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,279
has to be tenderised first.

372
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,920
Go! Get the others!

373
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,040
I know you're here.

374
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,399
No-one's coming for you.

375
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,479
SHE SCREAMS

376
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,840
No more games.

377
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,239
Hush now.

378
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,080
SHE CHOKES

379
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,960
Get off her or I'll shoot!
GET OFF HER OR I'LL SHOOT!

380
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,280
We saw the torchlight.

381
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,360
They've murdered all the villagers.

382
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,159
They're cannibalising the bodies!

383
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:00,880
Put the gun down. You're in no
position to negotiate, mate.

384
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,000
S'all right, it's all right.
You're safe.

385
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,840
You can arrest him now.
I said you can arrest him!

386
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,760
You gonna arrest me, Huw?

387
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,079
That'd be a laugh, wouldn't it?

388
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,759
My own uncle.

389
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,960
Put the gun down,
don't you hurt him.

390
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,040
Shoot the bastard.

391
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,999
Split his skull.

392
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,079
Put the fucking gun down! Shoot.

393
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
I will shoot you! Put it down.
Pull the trigger, kill.

394
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,240
Why don't you give me the gun? Mate.

395
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,439
Who are these people?

396
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:09,559
This is our village.
But the villagers are dead.

397
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,000
They're all involved.

398
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,080
They've all been doing it.

399
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,120
This is our Harvest.
Only in the bloody countryside!

400
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,359
You sick fuckers.

401
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,400
Are you OK? Where's Ianto?
What have you done with him?

402
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,399
Wake up, man.

403
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,999
Time to be bled.

404
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,959
Like veal, it takes a long time.

405
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:54,360
But it definitely makes
the meat taste better.

406
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,319
What the fuck...?

407
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,319
Oh, really?

408
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
No, Jack! Don't do it. These people
don't deserve warnings.

409
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,920
Let me question him.
I have to understand.

410
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,879
I want to know why. Otherwise this,

411
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,680
this is too much.

412
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,359
They're injured,
they need to get to the hospital.

413
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:08,320
Owen you control the bleeding
and then phone the police. Jack,
please give me an hour with him.

414
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,279
Don't tell me you
don't want to know too.

415
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,160
The whole village was involved.

416
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,319
Every generation.

417
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,799
Our tradition.

418
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,320
Once a decade.

419
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,519
Target those travelling through,
those most likely to disappear.

420
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,320
And butcher them.

421
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,759
What sort of people are you
that you wake up in the morning and
think, this is what I'm going to do?

422
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,960
Why'd you do it?

423
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:07,039
Come on!

424
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,199
Make me understand.

425
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,360
Why do you care?

426
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,759
I have seen things you
would never believe.

427
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,120
And this is the only
thing I can't understand.

428
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,119
So, keep on wondering. Tell me!

429
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,160
I need to know why! That's enough.

430
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,879
Time to go.

431
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,920
I'll tell you something...

432
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,679
if you let me whisper.

433
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,119
OK.

434
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,560
(Cos it made me happy.)

435
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,999
Come on, out..

436
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,720
'I had a good job before this,

437
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
'I thought in a year
or two, perhaps a baby,

438
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,719
'I know Rhys would be a good dad and
I could try for Desk Sergeant and...

439
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,999
'Well, it was all
slotting into place...'

440
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:49,080
'And then I met you lot.

441
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,719
'All these things...

442
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,760
'..all these things,
they're changing me.

443
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,319
'Changing how I see the world.'

444
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,080
And I can't share them
with anyone.

445
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,800
You can now.

446
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,280
What is this thing? With this you
can read peoples minds, it levels
the pitch between man and God.

447
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,399
We'll find you.

448
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:52,960
My guess is you're not
from around these parts.

449
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,040
Shagging a woman on the rebound.
Wouldn't be the first time
I'd been a rebound shag.

450
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,279
You need to see this,
this is completely impossible.

451
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:06,159
Tell me what to do.
Get me into Torchwood.
