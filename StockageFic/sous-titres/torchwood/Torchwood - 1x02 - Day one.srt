1
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,035
Yes!

2
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,475
That is the last
time you choose a film.

3
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,676
I was told it was good.
I feel asleep, Rhys.

4
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:36,195
What does it mean, "Special Ops"?

5
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:39,075
It's no big deal. Mostly filing.

6
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:40,795
Special admin, really.

7
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,675
Can we talk about something else?
Oh, come on,

8
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:47,315
it's your first day tomorrow,
I'm excited for you! Big promotion.

9
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,836
Secondment. You'll be brilliant.

10
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:58,076
Let's have an early night.
Check, please!

11
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:03,716
Bloody hell! Is that plane on fire?

12
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,795
It's not a plane.

13
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,475
We haven't paid. Come on.

14
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:38,795
What was that?

15
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,636
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS

16
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,435
I've got to go to work.

17
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:15,436
Simple locating clean up operation.
Find that meteorite before
anyone else gets their hands on it.

18
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,116
Good to see you, by the way.

19
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,836
Tosh, you found it yet?
You got enough kit?

20
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,876
Basic tracking and surveillance.

21
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,595
The crash site.

22
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,276
With this we can tap into CCTV
networks, national databases.

23
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,636
This is the police computer system.
You shouldn't have this!

24
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:39,476
Might wanna stop saying "you"
and start saying "we".

25
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,476
Crash site is 100 metres ahead.

26
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:00,195
Shit.

27
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,956
The amateurs got here first.

28
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:20,435
All right. Usual formation.

29
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,235
What's the usual formation?

30
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,835
Varies.
How can a usual formation vary?

31
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,155
Who the hell are you?!

32
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,956
Sorry! This area's restricted.
No, it's all right, I'm with...

33
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,876
Special Ops. I'm Special Ops.

34
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:52,636
Torchwood. I'm with Torchwood.
Don't mess with me, little girl.

35
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:55,396
You're not with Torchwood.
And even if you were...

36
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:58,196
You'd have put out
the welcome banners!

37
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,035
First of all, she's no little girl.

38
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,395
All the right curves
in all the right places.

39
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,195
But she is Torchwood. We both are.
We'd appreciate it

40
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,756
if you'd leave us
to do the real work.

41
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,955
Shall we?

42
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:18,476
So let's see what we came for.

43
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:40,315
What do we know?
Bog standard space debris.

44
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:43,316
That's a technical term.
Yeah, thanks.

45
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,716
So take all the readings
and let's get out of here.

46
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,596
Make yourself useful, sweetheart!

47
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,755
Pass us the big chisel from the
toolbox. Not sweetheart - Gwen.

48
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:14,915
One syllable, sure you can manage it.
Not sweetcheeks? Freckles? New Girl?

49
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:20,195
It's a shame your tool's not
big enough for the job, darlin'.

50
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,715
Catch! Don't! Shit!

51
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:34,715
Put this on!

52
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:18,395
Is this all I get now,
your voicemail?

53
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,236
You're out with her, aren't you?

54
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:22,996
You bastard, you could've
had the decency to text.

55
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,435
I've been standin' in
there all on my own.

56
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:30,676
I'm sick of this hanging around
all of the time waiting for you to
show up. I wish I'd never met you.

57
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,756
I wish I was dead, no,
I wish you were dead.

58
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:35,875
Call me back.

59
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:06,356
Hiya. Evening, ladies.
Hiya, handsome.

60
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,795
Very nice.

61
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,316
Where do you think you're going?

62
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,515
I've been in once,
I came out to make a call.

63
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,275
There's no readmission.

64
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:29,116
Um, OK, then, on you go.

65
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,195
Watch and learn, boys.

66
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:22,196
I don't even know your name.

67
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,155
Overrated, names.

68
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:46,676
I don't think...I can...hold on.

69
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,915
Well, go on, then.

70
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:55,355
Go on...you're...this
is...the best... Oh!

71
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,996
HE MOANS

72
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,476
I'm so sorry.
Seriously, stop saying that.

73
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:26,435
But I am! I mean, really,
I mean really, really sorry.

74
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:31,436
God, I can't believe it.
Didn't they teach you
Health and Safety in the police?

75
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,556
You chucked tools
at each other, so...

76
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,515
We didn't miss. I'll sort it.

77
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:40,235
Whatever's happened, I'll deal with
it. What d'you think has happened?

78
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:42,235
I mean, it was just gas, wasn't it?

79
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:45,236
That can't be too bad, can it?

80
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:48,636
Right, because gas never
did anyone any harm(!)

81
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:52,155
On the plus side, we've got good
evidence, relatively undamaged.

82
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:55,115
On the downside,
there's an alien on the loose,

83
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:58,115
we don't know where it is, why
it's here or what it's going to do.

84
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,475
Give her a break! God, this has
been the worst first day ever.

85
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:07,036
We all make mistakes.
Now we find and recover
whatever came out of there.

86
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:11,075
This might help. Nightclub death
been phoned into 999.

87
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:16,035
Circumstances sound...
a little unusual.

88
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:18,235
Might be connected.

89
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,795
Torchwood.

90
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:43,036
Gwen? Hi!

91
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:47,156
Bloody hell! Look at you, all posh.

92
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:50,315
Special ops! We were wondering.

93
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,676
I meant to call.

94
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:55,316
It's been a bit of a whirlwind.
Go on, then, tell us all. Coming?

95
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,916
Yeah, sorry.

96
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:02,076
You can get away now. No point you
freezing your arse off out here.

97
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:03,836
Boss of me now, are you?

98
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:11,075
Say hi to everyone for me.

99
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,715
This is all that's left?

100
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:21,436
How's that possible?
The question is how did you
know this used to be a body?

101
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:27,075
Go on, son! With you all the way!

102
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,436
Bit of a shock, I tell you.

103
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:42,275
We need to see that CCTV.

104
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:53,475
Wow. Oh, my God!
He just... Came and went.

105
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,195
That's the way I'd like to go.

106
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,755
I'm sure we could arrange it.
How can that be?

107
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,235
It doesn't make any sense.

108
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:05,195
It's not possible.
Do you know the girl's name?

109
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:07,715
Did they arrive together
or meet in the club?

110
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:11,636
Is she a regular? Would any of the
other staff know her? I dunno!

111
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:14,195
We get hundreds of people
here every weekend.

112
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:17,516
I don't keep tabs.
Thanks for your help.

113
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,796
We've got all we need.

114
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:25,835
What are you talking about?
We haven't got a clue.
We don't even know her name!

115
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:29,755
We need a body from the
cryo-chamber, close match
for the dead guy.

116
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:34,196
Disfigure the face,
dump it someplace remote, make
it look like a suicide attempt.

117
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:35,596
You have a stash of bodies?

118
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:42,836
What about his family?

119
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,915
You can't just fake his death.
You want to tell his family

120
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,755
he died screwing an alien?
We don't know for sure.

121
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,075
Same elements recorded
at the crash site.

122
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:54,116
Traces all over the club
but strongest in this area.

123
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,516
Something happened here.

124
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:15,036
It's my fault.

125
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,436
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

126
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,796
That'll get you nowhere,
that thinking.

127
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:21,836
At least now we know a little more.

128
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:23,915
The alien's taken on a host body.

129
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,836
We can't let her kill again.

130
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:41,916
I said to them, you're putting
yourselves out of work,
behaving like this.

131
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,035
I can get five Polish lads
who don't take any breaks,

132
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,596
happy as sand boys,
all for 56 quid above board.

133
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:53,195
I told Niall, I said, "Why should
I bother with your moaning mates
when I can get this?"

134
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:57,196
Carys? Dad?

135
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,915
Hangover from hell, is it?

136
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,195
What did you get up to last night?

137
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:04,476
I can't really remember.

138
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,035
Mullered, I was.

139
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,876
Gotta go.

140
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:10,996
Tony needs the van by nine.

141
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,275
You in tonight?

142
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:31,395
What's this supposed to do?
I'm using satellite-tracking data

143
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:34,275
to determine the inward trajectory
of the meteorite.

144
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:37,595
He means he's trying to find
out where it's came from.

145
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:41,155
Sometimes techno babble
is good for the soul.
So this is a route planner.

146
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,796
Not far off.

147
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:46,516
Rhys, my boyfriend, is a transport
manager. He does this sort of stuff.

148
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,955
On a slightly smaller scale, though.
You have a boyfriend?

149
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,516
Yeah. Have you?
Don't have time with this job.

150
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,595
What about you? You seeing anyone?
You've gotta be joking.

151
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,196
I can get all the grief I need here.

152
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,596
None of you have partners?

153
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:04,476
Just you, newbie.

154
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:11,395
I'm not being rude or anything...
Well, maybe I am, but...

155
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,156
how do you
switch off from all this stuff?

156
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:16,276
What do you do to relax?

157
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,596
I torture people
in happy relationships.

158
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:32,756
SHE SOBS

159
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,875
Gas traces confirmed
as Vorax and Suranium.

160
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,076
My two favourite gases.
Can we do a check, and find
out what we know about them?

161
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,275
I'm all over it. What's this doing?

162
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:54,995
I've taken an image of the girl
from the CCTV. This cross-checks
her face with the UK population.

163
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,355
You can't have every
face in the UK on there.

164
00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:00,556
That would be against
civil liberties, data protection...

165
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,996
Still doing that "you"
instead of "we" thing.

166
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,676
119 suspects.

167
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:09,035
It's supposed
to give us a single match.

168
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:13,635
The CCTV was too low res.
I've tried magnifying and
augmenting but it just breaks up.

169
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:17,475
The software can't function
properly. It's narrowed
the numbers down.

170
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:22,036
I could check through the rest. The
old fashioned way - with my eyes.

171
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,996
What about the fingerprints
I took off the alley wall?

172
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:32,236
It was a long-shot, anyway.
Just a bit.

173
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:35,156
Least I'm trying to do something.
You're trying anything.

174
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:38,315
The CCTV must have picked up
her arrival at the club.

175
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:41,636
Tosh, can you reformat the
image recognition software

176
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,596
to trace her journey backwards
via street cameras?

177
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,316
It'll take a while to process.

178
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:50,036
Every possible turn means
thousands of probabilities.

179
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,995
Have a go. At least we'll
know where she started.

180
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,756
We could cross reference that
with the remaining face matches.

181
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:59,276
Good one, newbie!
That's a bit more like it!

182
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:06,715
Ah!

183
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:21,635
Ah!

184
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,435
No!

185
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,316
DOORBELL RINGS

186
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,596
You're keeping our website
in business.

187
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:50,836
Well, your, er, dad's not in, then?

188
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,435
Get your clothes off!
Steady, Carys!

189
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,916
All right, that's enough.

190
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,916
Joke over. Barry's
put you up to this, has he? Shut up!

191
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:11,756
What's going on?! Put your
trousers on and get out. NOW!

192
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:18,556
It always breaks my heart to
say those words. Air quality's OK.

193
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:23,315
Gwen, look out!

194
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,156
What's that?
It's a sort of inflatable cell.

195
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:35,235
Power runs down after an hour.
The battery life's bollocks.

196
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,795
Who said you could use that? Um,
I just stopped a prisoner escaping.

197
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:43,195
You know the rules. None of
that stuff leaves the building
without my permission.

198
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,355
Fine. Don't thank me.

199
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,916
Come with us.

200
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:15,875
See what you can find out from her.
But aren't you going to help me?

201
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,675
I don't know what I'm doing.

202
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:21,076
Usually better if you don't say
that in front of the prisoner.

203
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,475
Are you MI5?

204
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,156
Where am I? What do you want?

205
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,436
I think you know, Carys.

206
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:50,275
How d'you know my name?
I've never been in trouble.

207
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:52,276
What do you want from me?

208
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,635
I know there's something
living inside you

209
00:19:56,635 --> 00:20:03,516
and I know what it made
you do. His name was Matt Stevens.

210
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,196
His parents lost their only
child at 3:07 this morning.

211
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:10,475
Ah! Ah!

212
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,396
You broke my ship.

213
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:34,475
Come on then. Where are you from

214
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:38,196
and why are you trying to invade
earth? You can forget
about enslaving us.

215
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,556
Who said anything about enslaving?

216
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:47,276
Well, that's what you
lot do. Aliens. Isn't it?

217
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:52,396
No, I just want the energy.

218
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:53,955
The climax.

219
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:57,475
I live off that energy.

220
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,835
Right, sorry, just to recap.

221
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,556
You've travelled here
to feed off orgasmic energy?

222
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,116
There's nothing else
out there like it.

223
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,115
You taste so good.

224
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:16,355
You're the best hit there is.
Ah! Ah! No!

225
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,755
Help me

226
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:30,715
Please, get it out of me.

227
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,236
Carys?

228
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,395
Hel-lo.

229
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,036
Happy birthday, me.

230
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:56,956
OK, first contact with an alien.

231
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,915
Not quite what I expected.

232
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,396
Oi, you lot...treat!

233
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,675
Whoa. Wow.

234
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,316
She said she had a boyfriend.

235
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:18,916
You people and your
quaint little categories.

236
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,356
We should really
get her out of there.

237
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:25,436
Yeah. I mean, yeah! Come on!

238
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:31,436
Just...record a bit first.

239
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,996
No! It's no good.

240
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:42,155
It's got to be a man.

241
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,436
Ah! Oh!

242
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,556
I'm losing.

243
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,835
Promise me you'll help me.

244
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:02,915
Promise me.

245
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,076
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

246
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,275
I promise.

247
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,556
Hi.

248
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:25,676
You're not still at work? 'Fraid so.

249
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:29,156
'What time will you be done?'
Not sure when I'll be finished.

250
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:33,196
Is it exciting, though, have you
had loads of excitement? Erm, some.

251
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:35,276
Er sorry, yeah, is now a good time?

252
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,076
Em, maybe not the best.

253
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:39,916
Oh, pity me,
I'm a Special Ops widow.

254
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,155
I'll call you later.

255
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,316
'Bye.'

256
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:19,436
Way to go, newbie! That is what
I call a methodical investigation.

257
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:22,115
I can't wait to see
you take down her particulars.

258
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:25,315
What are you doing?! Get off me!

259
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:29,475
That girl's body is being
overrun by I don't know what.
And you think it's a joke?

260
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:32,435
All right! Jesus! I'm sorry.
We should be helping her.

261
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:34,835
She's not some lab rat.
No, she's a murderer.

262
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:36,875
You were the one
who wanted her caught.

263
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,715
How come suddenly
she's your best friend?

264
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:43,916
You know, strictly speaking,
throttling the staff is my job.

265
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:50,076
So who's for Chinese?

266
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,916
And she said...

267
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:54,996
"If I'd known that's what he was,
I never would have married him!"

268
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:59,396
She knew all along!
She didn't care.

269
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:05,396
Until he started leaving black piles
of mucus in the bathtub.

270
00:25:05,396 --> 00:25:10,875
Always the big giveaway. Aliens
have no sense of household hygiene.

271
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:16,235
Which reminds me, gotta pee.

272
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:21,676
So what's he told you? What about?

273
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:25,915
Himself! You've been here longer
than I have. We were banking on you!

274
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:30,036
You're a copper, trained to ask
questions. You don't know anything?

275
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:33,436
Not who he is, not where he's from.
Nothing, except him being gay.

276
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:36,116
No, he's not. Really, do you think?

277
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,516
Owen does. I don't.

278
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:39,916
And I don't care.

279
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:43,436
Period military is not the
dress code of a straight man.

280
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:46,036
I think it suits him.
Sort of classic.

281
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:51,116
Exactly! I've watched him
in action. He'll shag
anything if it's gorgeous enough.

282
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,436
We know he's from America, right?
We don't know that for sure.

283
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,595
No US citizen by the name of Jack
Harkness born in the last 50 years.

284
00:25:57,595 --> 00:26:00,635
Maybe his identity's classified.

285
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:04,916
Used to be something big in the CIA.
That's what I reckon.

286
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,635
He must have his reasons for
wanting to keep things secret.

287
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,676
Sure he has. Doesn't stop me
wanting to know what they are.

288
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:14,156
WOMAN SOBS

289
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,116
What's that sound?

290
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:23,076
WOMAN SOBS

291
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:37,396
What are we doing having Chinese
while a girl fights for her life?

292
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:42,235
Actually, while we've been eating,
the computers have been running
a full bio-scan on Carys,

293
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:46,275
profiling her blood, metabolism,
organs, skin, the works.

294
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:49,795
So we can see what effect
the alien's having on her.
They've also been

295
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:54,275
taking samples of the air in the
cell so we can analyse changes
in the environment around her.

296
00:26:54,275 --> 00:27:00,836
Now, is that enough,
do you want more?

297
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,236
Cos it gets kinda boring.

298
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:05,995
You've been hidden down here
too long.

299
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:10,475
Spending so much time
with the alien stuff, you've
lost what it means to be human.

300
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,876
So remind us.

301
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:19,555
Tell me what it means to be
human in the 21st century.

302
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,395
All right.

303
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:59,435
Carys Fletcher,
born 13th November, 1987.

304
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:02,396
School reports, personnel files
from her temping agency,

305
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:08,116
swimming badges, reports of
her mother's death in a car crash.

306
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:12,076
And emails discussing the merits
of Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger.

307
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:18,595
Why have you done this?
This isn't about meteorites or gases.
We have a trapped girl

308
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:23,395
and we have to save her.
When I was with her in the cell,
Carys told me she was losing.

309
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:26,755
We have to find a way
to keep her fighting,

310
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:29,516
remind her to hold on to who she is.

311
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:34,036
Have I got something on my face?

312
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,836
No.

313
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:41,596
Just, it's...brilliant.

314
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:45,276
You are brilliant.

315
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:47,996
Thank you.

316
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,755
So we should bring in her dad.

317
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:55,316
You're kidding. We've got to find
something to connect with her.

318
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,955
Make her fight back. Our priority
is to contain the alien threat.

319
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:02,556
Not put civilians in a cell with it.
We should be helping her.

320
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:06,676
If we don't, who will, Jack?
Are you always this awkward?

321
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,716
'You should take a look at this.'

322
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:15,395
This is the normal chemical
composition of the air in that cell.

323
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:17,955
And these are the readings
from the last hour.

324
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:22,115
The alien's secreting
an ultra-powerful blend
of airborne pheromones.

325
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:26,956
Sex pheromones.
1,000 times more potent than
anything we'd normally experience.

326
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:28,995
She's a walking aphrodisiac!

327
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:32,636
I did wonder why I...
Actually, I sort of snogged her.

328
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:34,755
BOTH: We know.

329
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:39,515
Now, still wanna
put her father in the cell?

330
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:42,476
God, no! We can't let any man near...
Owen!

331
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,475
Jack, Carys is out of her cell.

332
00:29:48,475 --> 00:29:51,516
Cheeky bitch took my swipe card!

333
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:55,636
'I'll deal with it. And tell
Owen he needs to work on those
abs a bit harder.'

334
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:04,076
I was taking some readings, you
know, keeping an eye on her, and
bang. You got away lightly.

335
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:08,316
Be thankful she was only
interested in your swipe card.
Are you all right now?

336
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:10,316
Or are you still feeling
a bit of a cock?

337
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,796
No exit, sorry.

338
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:34,715
Yeah?
You want a little rough and tumble?

339
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:37,316
Well, let's make it a fair fight.

340
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:56,075
You won't stop me.

341
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,795
Put it down! That's worthless
to anyone but me.

342
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,356
Down now! Or I'll shoot.

343
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:23,876
Says he will but the eyes say he
won't. I'm going. Don't stop me.

344
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,556
Please help me.

345
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:56,075
Need me to do any attacking, sir?
Appreciate the offer.
Just open the door.

346
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,676
Now give me the jar.

347
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:05,036
NO!

348
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:01,475
After all I said,
a severed hand is more important
to you than Carys' life.

349
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:03,675
You want to prove yourself?

350
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:09,276
Find her.
Get your old pals in the police to
do something useful for once.

351
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:11,676
All right, I'll give them a call.

352
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:13,876
Put out an APB -

353
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,396
woman possessed by gas
knobbing fellas to death.

354
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:19,516
Oi! You'd better get in here!

355
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,475
So I'm trying to interpret
the results of the bio-scan.

356
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:26,275
Yeah, but it's just a mess, like
there's no definitive readings.

357
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:28,956
Because everything in
her body keeps changing,

358
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:31,036
nothing stays constant.
As soon as you think

359
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:36,116
you've got something clear, the
metabolic rate, the blood pressure
all goes wild again.

360
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:39,036
She's fighting the alien
for control of her body.

361
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:42,035
So anyway, I decided to
do a comparative diagnostic.

362
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:44,155
Recreate the circumstances,

363
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:48,355
accelerate the process a little,
see what's gonna happen to Carys.
Yeah, thanks.

364
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:51,355
I infected the rat with
a combination of the Vorax and

365
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:54,836
Suranium gas traces we found at
the crash site and the nightclub.

366
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,195
Looks fine so far.

367
00:33:56,195 --> 00:34:00,675
Once the gases start to flow round
the body, the party really starts.

368
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:08,436
The heart rate triples. The brain
swells, pressing against the skull.

369
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:11,915
Then the lungs began to shrink,
making it impossible to breathe.

370
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:15,755
The pressure increases
on all the internal organs until...

371
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:20,756
Rat jam!
That's what's gonna happen to Carys?

372
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:24,636
"I'm losing", that's what she said
to me. Right now, it's a struggle

373
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:28,515
between where Carys ends
and the alien begins.

374
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:05,075
We have to think like her.

375
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:08,355
Put ourselves in her place.
It's the only way to find her.

376
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:11,676
Except we don't know what
her controlling impulse is by now -

377
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:17,156
Carys or the alien inside. The last
thing I saw was a fight for control.

378
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:21,076
The overriding factor for the
parasite is to have sex.

379
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,596
It's a survival instinct - that's
bound to be the strongest drive.

380
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:30,275
All right, so you're Carys.
You're desperate for sex cos that's
what the thing inside you needs,

381
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,956
but you know it will kill.
Where would you go?

382
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,796
I'd come round and shag you.

383
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:41,036
What?! It's a joke! Can't I have
a joke with my team-mates?
Right now? No.

384
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:45,795
So what are we talking about?
Brothels? Lap dance clubs?

385
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,435
Anywhere there's eager men?

386
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:48,596
I know what I'd do.

387
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:53,635
What the hell are you doing here?
You look a bit wired.

388
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:57,196
I had to see you. You should've
called. Bethan might've been in.

389
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,555
I could kill you.
I could bloody kill you!

390
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:05,236
What the hell was that message
you left on my mobile last night?
Sounded like you were off your face.

391
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:10,595
If I wanted to,
I could kill you...now.

392
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:14,875
Look, I've told you.

393
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:19,916
I'm not leaving Bethan.
You're a lovely girl, but
it's just not gonna happen.

394
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,636
You were my first, see.

395
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:27,155
I never told you
cos I thought you'd laugh.

396
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:29,036
And you're crap.

397
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:33,196
All you want is to come and
you don't care what's underneath.

398
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,596
Go on, have a go.
Get it out of your system. Ah!

399
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:48,395
Do you love me, Eddie?

400
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:53,836
Did you ever love me? No.

401
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,315
You could've saved yourself.

402
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,715
What?

403
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,635
We're too late.

404
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,435
Tosh was right, though.
She went for the ex-boyfriend.

405
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:12,716
Lucky she's young.

406
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:16,515
Work your way through
my back catalogue, we'll be
here till the sun explodes.

407
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:20,716
Where next? And how long before
that thing destroys her body?

408
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:24,716
So what's our next move.
Stop the entire city of Cardiff
from shagging?

409
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:28,795
Put bromide in the water supply.
No, too hit and miss.

410
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:31,555
The water company got pissed off
last time we did that.

411
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:35,476
It could have used any body
in Cardiff. Why her?
I just assumed it was random.

412
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:39,635
It's mining Carys' life to get
what it needs. What else
do we know about her?

413
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:43,316
Anything you can think of?
What are you all looking at me for?

414
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:47,596
You did all the profiling!
I don't know. Sorry.

415
00:37:47,596 --> 00:37:48,716
She's great under pressure.

416
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,715
There's gotta be something.
What did you say Carys' job was?

417
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:54,035
She's just a temp. Receptionist.

418
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:57,995
Where's she working at the moment?
I can pull her employment files up.

419
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:02,516
Conway Clinic. You're joking.
What's the problem?

420
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:05,516
It's a bloody fertility clinic.
Sperm donors.

421
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:10,276
An unlimited supply of orgasmic
energy without all the build-up.
Perfect hit.

422
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,436
Ah!
Carys. You're not on today, are you?

423
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:31,436
It needs more.
The energy - it's not lasting.

424
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,395
Sorry?

425
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,235
'Mr Tunstall,
room number one's ready now.'

426
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:49,596
MAN SCREAMS

427
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:58,796
What's this for? Need a diagram?
I've never used a gun.

428
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,596
You were in the police!

429
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:03,596
I was on the beat! I'll
make sure you don't need to use it.

430
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:08,555
I'm asking for you to get out!
Relax, I can help.
I don't think so, love, I'm gay.

431
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:11,675
What do we do if we find her?

432
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:14,716
How are we going to get it out of
her? Judging by the test results,

433
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:18,755
the gas needed a host because
prolonged exposure to our
atmosphere is poisonous to it.

434
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,915
But our bodies are
the perfect environment.

435
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:22,915
If we isolate it
from Carys' body...

436
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:25,835
It won't survive for long.
Sounds like we have a plan.

437
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:26,956
Force it to die.

438
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:28,795
Just like it did those poor blokes.

439
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:31,435
What about Carys?
Better start praying

440
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,075
we get to her in time.

441
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:42,196
Come on!

442
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:50,195
Out! Now!
Get as far away as you can!

443
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,675
God, how many more?

444
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:13,755
In here!

445
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:21,116
Nowhere to run.

446
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:29,236
All this sex.
All we see, all we think.

447
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:33,356
So much beauty...and so much fear.

448
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:36,475
We want it but we're
so afraid of it... Ah!

449
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,875
The strain on her body's too much.

450
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:44,195
Any second now, she's rat jam.
One more and I'll be strong.

451
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:46,115
Each time, it works less.

452
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:48,596
Each time, the feeling's weaker.

453
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:53,155
One more. Make me feel alive.

454
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:55,996
Make me feel human.

455
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,516
I can't.

456
00:40:58,516 --> 00:40:59,956
I can.

457
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:02,716
Jack! I've got a surplus of alive.

458
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:04,036
I'm giving it away.

459
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:06,715
You really want to feel something?

460
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,956
What's he doing?

461
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:26,836
That was just the kiss. Imagine
the buzz you get from the rest.

462
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:33,595
Wasn't exactly the reaction
I anticipated. Her body
won't last much longer.

463
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:35,555
Use me.

464
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:40,196
Leave Carys. Take my body as host.
Just let her live.

465
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:45,115
Gwen... I'm stronger than she is.

466
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:48,796
I'll last longer. You might be
able to save me, I don't know.

467
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:51,956
OK. Jack!

468
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:57,595
You can't let her! Like she
said...she's responsible for this.

469
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:10,755
Come on, then. Do it. Leave her.

470
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:56,356
How long can it survive in there?

471
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,316
It was pretty weak. Why?

472
00:42:58,316 --> 00:43:01,596
Bit worried how long that
battery'll last for.

473
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:08,956
Look... It's dying.

474
00:43:28,276 --> 00:43:32,515
You travel halfway across the
universe for the greatest sex.

475
00:43:32,515 --> 00:43:35,276
You still end up dying alone.

476
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:41,795
Thank you.

477
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,755
Still here?

478
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:43,556
Everybody else is
off doing...whatever it is
they do when they're not here.

479
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,396
How long have you been there?

480
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:52,436
I wanted to finish off.

481
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:55,115
Do one thing for me.

482
00:44:55,115 --> 00:45:01,355
Don't let the job consume you.
You have a life. Perspective.
We need that.

483
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:04,315
Who are you, Jack?

484
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:09,515
I'm sorry? You can't die.
You tell me the 21st century
is when it all changes,

485
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:11,356
that we have to be prepared.
You do.

486
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:15,675
But how can you know?
You think knowing the answers
would make you feel better?

487
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:20,195
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

488
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:25,155
Go home, Gwen Cooper. Eat lasagne.

489
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,716
Kiss your boyfriend.

490
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:29,036
Be normal.

491
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:31,356
For me.

492
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:36,155
So I said, those bloody website...

493
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:41,716
I've had years of experience.

494
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:45,276
I know the journeys, I've driven
most of them, I know the best way.

495
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:49,236
Am I boring you?

496
00:45:53,236 --> 00:45:54,876
Sorry.

497
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:58,435
Too grand to care
about transport routes now, are we?

498
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,556
