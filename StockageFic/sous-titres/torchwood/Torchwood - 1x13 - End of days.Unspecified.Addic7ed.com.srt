1
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,319
You know it's rude to stare.

2
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,119
I thought telepathy would get you
to make me a cuppa.

3
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,639
What's it worth? What do you want?

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,879
I'll draw you a diagram, shall I?

5
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,160
Nice arse!

6
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,280
MOBILE RINGS

7
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,439
Don't answer it!

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,519
Yep.
JACK: 'You watching the news?'

9
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,160
TV: 'There's speculation that the
incidents overnight may be linked.

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,160
'Initial reports
suggested terrorist involvement'.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,520
'But some intelligence experts have
claimed the incidents may be stunts.

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,079
'The first sightings were of UFOs
over the Taj Mahal in India.

13
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,199
'They came in just after midnight.

14
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:57,719
'In London this morning, men in
historic dress fired upon police.

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,920
'Some religious groups
are claiming events overnight

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
'are a vindication
of their teachings.'

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,880
Do you think it is terrorists?

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,160
Terrorists bomb things.
This is different.

19
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,600
People didn't believe us.
Now they should.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,679
Judgment day is finally here.

21
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,119
This is the End of Days.

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,999
"And I heard but did not understand
and I said, 'Master, what is the End
of all these things?' And he said,

23
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:45,199
" 'Go, Daniel, for the things are
closed up and sealed until the end
of time.' " Daniel 12, verse 10.

24
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,560
Sounds a bit close for comfort.

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,080
This machine's on the blink.

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,240
Keeps losing power.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,799
Sorry, don't let me stop
your portents of doom.

28
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,119
Or have you finished? No.
More where that came from.

29
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,679
Abaddon, the Great Devourer,
who'll lead the world into shadow.

30
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,480
Thanks, Ianto, no superstition.

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,080
You people love any story that
denies the randomness of existence.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,479
Thanks. That makes me feel better.
OK, I've been fielding calls.

33
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,280
The government, UNIT, the CIA...

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Half the world
are asking one question.

35
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,239
Is this anything to do with us?
And is it?

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,040
I've run a profile on every reported
temporal anomaly and tracked
any physical or temporal pattern.

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,119
Shit! The cracks in time
trace back here to the rift.

38
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,680
This city, this Hub, is the centre.

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,319
What you're seeing around the world
are ripples and aftershocks.

40
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,239
The rift is splintering
because of you. What? You opened it
without knowing what you were doing.

41
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,320
You've caused the temporal cracks
to widen. Time is seeping through.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,439
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be in the 1940s.

43
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:03,440
So are we going to sit around
crying into our lattes,
or shall we do something about it?

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,559
Bring those who've fallen through
time back here, into the vaults.

45
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:13,439
And do what with them? We'll deal
with phase one, then phase two.

46
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,839
You can't control time. What are you
gonna do? We'll think of something!

47
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,319
Hey, this is not
the end of the world.

48
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm certain of that.

49
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,879
COMPUTER BEEPS

50
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,719
Priority one attendance - hospital.
Mortality rate's through the roof.

51
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,440
They're designating a hot zone.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,680
I'll go. Tosh, go with him.
No, thanks, I'm fine on my own.

53
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,040
And you'll be even better
with me alongside.
Shut up and come on.

54
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,719
Did you have to pick on him
in public like that?
All our actions have consequences.

55
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,879
And all your staff have feelings,
Jack, even Owen. Well, you'd know.

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,040
He brought you back.

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,759
Would you rather be stuck
in World War II?

58
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,319
Hello.

59
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,840
'Gwen, it's Andy'.

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,199
Listen,
I didn't know who else to call.

61
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,439
MAN SHOUTS IN LATIN

62
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,840
Double murder.

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,039
Stabbed two blokes in Penarth.
Brutal, it was. No mercy.

64
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,440
What are we supposed to do?
He doesn't speak a word of English,
and he's dressed as a Roman soldier!

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,600
He's not, he IS a Roman soldier
and he's shouting in Latin.

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,399
Only word I could pick out
was Gelligaer.

67
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,319
Gelligaer.

68
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,200
There's a Roman fort out at
Gelligaer. Built around 75AD.

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
He was on his way, time splintered,
he ends up here. Excuse me?

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,240
Hi. Any time you feel
like talking sense...

71
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,199
That soldier came through
a crack in time.

72
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,040
He's not serious, is he?

73
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,999
This sort of thing just
doesn't happen. Not in Cardiff.

74
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:08,279
Just cos you can't understand,
doesn't mean it isn't true.
I know it sounds mad, Andy...

75
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,160
All right, Mulder and Scully.
Say I do believe you, which I don't,
cos it's bollocks.

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,000
How exactly are we meant to handle
a prisoner from 2,000 years ago?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,479
Has he got the same rights as anyone?
How's this gonna work with the CPS?

78
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,399
We'll take him off your hands.

79
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,919
HE SHOUTS IN LATIN

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,640
Under any other circumstances,
an exuberant Roman soldier would
be my idea of a perfect morning.

81
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
Careful, Jack.

82
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,040
PRISONER STOPS SHOUTING
Everyone's saying it, you know.

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,959
In work, on the streets.

84
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,719
Do you think
this is the end of the world?

85
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,720
Oh, Andy, don't be silly.

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,559
Do you think the world's gonna end
on your shift?

87
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,439
I've seen you use that smile
on a lot of people. What smile?

88
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,639
The smile you use to reassure people
when everything's gone to shit.

89
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,400
This was the first one to die.
NO ID on her. She just
appeared in the middle of A&E.

90
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,520
Nobody saw her come in,
she didn't register at the desk.

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,199
So what happened?
She started coughing up blood.

92
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,159
We moved her into isolation.

93
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,359
An hour later, the staff presented
similar symptoms.

94
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,640
Which were? Bite-like bumps,
chills, fever, headaches, along
with black patches on the skin.

95
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,120
Indicating bleeding into the skin
and possibly other organs.

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,879
From the staff, it spread to
patients who'd been in reception.

97
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,760
These aren't contemporary clothes.
Her teeth aren't modern, either.

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Shit.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,479
As soon as we realised the rate
of infection, we closed down.

100
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,439
How many others are infected?

101
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,639
30, maybe 40.

102
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,560
All quarantined off?

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
We think so. Have their clothes
and sheets destroyed.

104
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:21,640
What is it?
That woman isn't from this century.

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,400
More like the 14th.

106
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,799
It's the...it's the fucking...
Black Death, Tosh.

107
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,519
She's infected Cardiff A&E
with the plague...

108
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,240
and it's my fault.

109
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,879
The team
are instigating procedures.

110
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,440
The infected will need 30 milligrams
of Streptomycin and Chloramphenicol
plus two of Tetracycline.

111
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,479
That's plague medicine.
Standard issue for bubonic.

112
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:51,479
Well done, House.
That's what you're up against.

113
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,399
So what are you gonna do now?

114
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,479
Well, you've got procedures,
haven't you?

115
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,799
Yes, but everybody said Torchwood
would sort it out.

116
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,839
What if we get more carriers
appearing? We're working
to stop that. We waited for you!

117
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
You've got to stop this!
You've gotta do something!
No, you've gotta do something.

118
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,440
People are dropping through time
and they'll bring every disease
in history through your doors.

119
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,520
So you'd better be ready. Owen...

120
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,039
You scared enough yet?

121
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,680
Cos fuck knows I am!

122
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,559
Come on, Tosh!

123
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,000
Make sure they get the medicine.
Call us if things get worse.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,520
How much worse can they get?

125
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,600
Owen?

126
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
Owen!

127
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,079
Okasan?

128
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,479
SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

129
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,440
TOSH REPLIES IN JAPANESE

130
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,640
Tosh! Come on, stop pissing about.

131
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,640
If Owen managed to open the rift
to get you and Tosh back, can't we
do the same thing for these people?

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,279
We've got the rift manipulator.
There's a world of difference.

133
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
We're talking about
taking control of time,

134
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
not bringing two people back
from the past.

135
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,679
Besides,
look at the damage Owen caused.

136
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,800
We mess with it further,
we'll put the planet in danger.

137
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
Have I ever let you down?

138
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
Gwen?

139
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Gwen?

140
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,759
'I'm sorry.'

141
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,400
'I'm so sorry.'

142
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,800
Gwen?

143
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,679
Gwen! Come on.

144
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,520
Hustle!

145
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,399
Are you sure it was the same guy?

146
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,999
It was definitely him. Bilis,
the caretaker of the dancehall.

147
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,639
That's all he said, sorry?
What's he got to be sorry for?

148
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,439
Coming through!
WEEVIL GROWLS

149
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,039
13 more reports of Weevils.
We can't keep up at this rate.

150
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,760
Everything's on the increase.
Can you stop them making that noise?
If you've got any ideas how.

151
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,320
Maybe they're time sensitive.
It's too much.

152
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,279
We're now full in all vaults
across all nine levels.

153
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,319
Do you want me to activate
the vaults below? We've never
used them since I've been here.

154
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,520
Do it.

155
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,360
Gwen, maybe you're right. Let's run
a search on your dancehall buddy.

156
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,719
We need to find him. OK.
WEEVIL MOANS

157
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,600
Hello, Ianto.

158
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:33,920
What do you want? Why are you here?

159
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,040
This isn't happening.

160
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,240
There's only one way to stop this,
before things get worse.

161
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,720
People will die, Ianto.

162
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Thousands of people.

163
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,920
Unless you open the rift.

164
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
Owen. How was the hospital?

165
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
Laugh a bloody minute. They've
got an outbreak of the Black Death.

166
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,600
What? Oh, my God!
Have they got it under control?

167
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,239
Tosh! How are they coping?

168
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:23,159
Um, Owen got the place quarantined
and organised treatments for
those who've been infected.

169
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,640
Only consolation is,
it's treatable.

170
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,600
But what happens when
the next carrier comes through, Jack?

171
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,999
Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola,
or something from the future?

172
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,760
What do we do then? Well, it's not
doing us any good speculating.

173
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,519
We need to be prepared.
We're helpless. We're putting
sticking plasters on gaping wounds!

174
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,360
What do you suggest?

175
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,279
I suggest you lead us and you
tell us what the instructions are.

176
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,000
Owen... No, come on.
You're all thinking it too.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,959
You're the big man here.
You keep all the secrets.

178
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,599
Well, now's the time to tell us
how the hell we'll get out of this!

179
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,200
You want to know a secret?
There is no solution.

180
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,079
I can't fix this.

181
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,159
Because this was never
meant to happen.

182
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,799
The first thing you learned
was don't mess with the rift.

183
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,160
But you disobeyed those orders.

184
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,919
And now everything that's happening
is down to you.

185
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,160
I only disobeyed to get you back.
And now people are dying.
So I shouldn't have bothered?

186
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,920
Who the fuck are you, anyway?

187
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Jack Harkness?

188
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
You don't even exist.

189
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,720
We've looked.

190
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,560
So if you're not even a real person,
then why should I follow your orders?

191
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,999
Get out. What?

192
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,560
Get out!
I'm relieving you of your duty.

193
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,360
No. You can't do that!
Bollocks, you are! Jack, wait.

194
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,120
You're done here.

195
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,520
What, so that's it?

196
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,959
The whole world is going to shit
and you're going to fire me?

197
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,160
For God's sake! Both of you!
We need to stick together on this.

198
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,760
If I can't rely on you,
if I don't have your complete trust,
you don't belong here.

199
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,519
That goes for the rest of you.

200
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,160
Anyone who agrees with Owen,
leave now.

201
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,960
So now we know how it is.

202
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,480
So that leaves me 24 hours
to savour the good times.

203
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,039
What are you talking about?

204
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,520
Think about it, Gwen.

205
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,719
Nobody leaves this place intact.

206
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:48,200
Sometime in the next 24 hours...
I get Retconned.

207
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,799
All my memories erased.

208
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,600
I don't know where or when,
but he'll get me.

209
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Jack, this has gone far enough.

210
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,640
So I guess this is goodbye.

211
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,639
Good luck with the end of the world.

212
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,120
I would say thanks for the
memories... Jack, for God's sake!

213
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,919
'OK, guys, Bilis's shop is
coming up 20 metres on your left'.

214
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,399
Wow.

215
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:21,280
Some of this stuff
must go back centuries.

216
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,399
He scavenges antique pieces
from the past, brings them here,
sells them for a profit.

217
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,280
Not a bad business plan.

218
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,759
We all have to earn a living.

219
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,079
You're from 1941.

220
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,439
As you were. Hello, again.

221
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,559
How can you be
in two time zones at once?

222
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,320
I can step across eras,
like you'd walk into another room.

223
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,559
At first, it was the most incredible
gift. Now I know the reality...

224
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,840
it's a curse.

225
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,480
Why?

226
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,519
I can see the whole of history,

227
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,320
but I don't belong anywhere
within it.

228
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,720
So, your return to this time
had a price.

229
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,440
Time's splintering.

230
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,640
This city exists on a rift in time.

231
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
The only way to make it right
is to fully open that rift -

232
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
let it suck back what fell through.

233
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,399
No way. It's too dangerous.
Can we even do that?

234
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,159
Of course you can.

235
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,880
Isn't that right, Captain?

236
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,239
Jack? You've seen what happened.

237
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:42,519
If we open that rift fully,
millions of lives will be at risk.

238
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,679
And yet, if you don't,
more will fall through.

239
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,240
Lives will be lost.

240
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,639
You know so much, you're coming
back with us. I'm sorry.

241
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,039
Damn it! Trace the temporal
activity around this location.

242
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,000
We need to find out where he is.
Come on.

243
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,200
CLOCKS CHIME

244
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,879
Gwen.

245
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,439
I am not your enemy.

246
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:28,280
In the cells,
why did you say you were sorry?

247
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,760
Sometimes it's better
to live in ignorance...unless...

248
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,360
Do you really want to know?
Know what?

249
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,240
Hold my hands. I'll show you.

250
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,440
OK.

251
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,599
Only if you're sure.

252
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,279
I'm sure.

253
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm sorry!

254
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,600
What did you just show me?

255
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
The future.

256
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,519
What took you so long? Gwen?

257
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,200
Gwen!

258
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,800
Is that you?

259
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,759
Yeah... It's me.

260
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,160
Ah! You're cleaning the oven!

261
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,040
Aye, somebody got to, love.
Listen, we gotta go.

262
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,279
Why, what's happened? We've gotta go.

263
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,919
Let me finish here first...
Rhys, we've gotta go. Now!

264
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,000
Aw, here we go again, always a hurry
since you started that bloody job...

265
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
(Owen.)

267
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,759
Owen.

268
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,559
Oh...Jesus.

269
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,320
Diane...

270
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh, Jesus.

271
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,799
I'm lost, Owen.

272
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,799
I can touch you. I don't understand.

273
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,400
Where did you end up? Please.

274
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,399
Bring me back, Owen. You can
do that, can't you? I don't know.

275
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,919
Everything's out of sync. Please.

276
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,199
Please bring me back.

277
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,239
Open the rift.

278
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,440
Do you want another drink there,
mate?

279
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,960
# Can it call you or maul you

280
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,600
# And drive you insane

281
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
# Can it make you remember

282
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,519
# Time is in place

283
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,519
# Now I'm begging you

284
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,359
# I'm begging you... #

285
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:33,000
Take it easy. What's going on?
Am I dreaming?

286
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,999
This is where I work.

287
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:39,760
You work in a prison?
These are just the cells.

288
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,200
You locked me in a cell?
What the hell are you playing at?
I was just trying to keep you safe.

289
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,479
I was safe at home! No, you weren't.
You really weren't. Listen, Gwen,

290
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:54,359
you'd better tell me
exactly what's going on

291
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,559
cos I've taken some shit
over the past few months.

292
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,439
What's all this? Rhys, listen to me,
I need you to trust me.

293
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:06,359
OK, it may not seem like it
at the moment,

294
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,320
but I'm just trying
to take care of you.

295
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,599
I love you, sweetheart.

296
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,280
LOUD MOAN FROM ABOVE
What the hell was that?

297
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,759
Just try and relax
and I'll come back for you.

298
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:27,839
What do you mean? You're not
going to leave me down here!
I'm sorry. Gwen! Gwen! I'm sorry.

299
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,759
Shit!

300
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,559
Did he wake up? Yeah. Yeah, he did.

301
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,919
Tosh, can you bring up the CCTV
of the vaults?

302
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,200
Er, just leave it on the screen,
I know it sounds crazy, but...

303
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,280
Sure, no problem. Thank you...
for helping me bring him here.

304
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:58,199
I can't understand how Bilis
was able to show you that vision.

305
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,560
It was so real, Tosh.

306
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,600
I was in my flat.

307
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,840
It smelt like my flat,
it had all the sounds of my flat.

308
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,440
I touched the blood. I can still
feel it on my hands. Rhys's blood.

309
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,000
Not gonna happen.

310
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,760
Come on,
there's still work to be done.

311
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,239
What's going on?
We've got a security breach.

312
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,599
All right, nobody panic.

313
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,559
RHYS!

314
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,999
KLAXON SOUNDS

315
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,919
Oh, do you work here?

316
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,759
I'm Rhys...

317
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
..Gwen's boyfriend.

318
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,759
RHYS GROANS

319
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,000
NO!

320
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,320
No!

321
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,560
He's gone! He's gone! Please...

322
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,039
No! Please!

323
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,719
No!

324
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,079
We can...we can bring him back!

325
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,999
There's nothing we can do.
Yes, there is! My boy.

326
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,519
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

327
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,120
SHE SCREAMS
No!

328
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
No!

329
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
GWEN'S SCREAMS ECHO

330
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,239
I'll have to tell his family.

331
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:20,240
We'll deal with it.
The way you dealt with that porter
the first time I met you?

332
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,920
No, you won't deal with him, Ianto.

333
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,199
Gwen, I'm so sorry.

334
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,560
You never even met him.

335
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
This is what happens here.

336
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,520
We all end up alone.

337
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,959
Not me.

338
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,119
No way.

339
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,279
You bring him back. No.
The resurrection gauntlet...

340
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,519
Was destroyed. Something else.
I said no.

341
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,599
No, there's something wrong
with time, so we, we can go back
to the moment, to the very moment...

342
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:22,520
Gwen... There's something
you can do, otherwise
WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF YOU?!

343
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,079
You, you bring him back!

344
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,399
Bring him back!

345
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,960
You bring him back!

346
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,200
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
JACK FUCKING HARKNESS?

347
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,159
I'm sorry. Do you? I'm so sorry.

348
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,719
Oh, shit.

350
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,719
What happened?

351
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,559
You came back! Are you all right?
You OK? You all right?

352
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,120
Don't touch me!

353
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,760
How many other people
have got to suffer?

354
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,400
I'm gonna fix this.

355
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm opening the rift.

356
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,919
Make sure you stop him.

357
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
No.

358
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,000
We're gonna help him.

359
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,439
Bilis was right,
he said open the rift
and everything goes back to normal.

360
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,040
Owen's right.

361
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm going to get Rhys back.

362
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,400
Gwen. No! Gwen!

363
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,520
Enter Emergency Protocol One.

364
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,480
Out the way, I'll do this.
ALARM SOUNDS

365
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,639
Get away from the computer,
Gwen. Jack... This is a trap.

366
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:14,600
All the cracks, they're diversions.
This is what Bilis wants.

367
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,119
What are you afraid of, Jack?

368
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,560
Rhea Silva.

369
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,239
I said, "Move."

370
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,639
What the hell are you doing?!
Final warning.

371
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,320
Come on, Jack.
You're a united front now?

372
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,040
Toshiko, the poor girl
who'll screw any passing alien
that gives her a pendant?

373
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,359
Owen, so strong,
he gets in a cage with a Weevil,
desperate to be mauled.

374
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,719
Or Ianto, hiding his
cyber-girlfriend in the basement.

375
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,240
Your three comrades here
pumped bullets into her, remember?

376
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,239
I've got to get Rhys back.

377
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,840
Yeah, cos you're so in love
with Rhys that you spend
half your time in Owen's bed.

378
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
Fuck you! We're relieving you
of your command, "Captain".

379
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,160
We're getting back what we lost!

380
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,639
Shit!

381
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:21,920
Stay down!

382
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,880
You're in charge, Owen? You've gotta
have significantly bigger balls.

383
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm sick of people doubting me.

384
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,760
What have you done?

385
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
We've still got to do Jack's.

386
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,959

00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,999
Oh, my God!

390
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,959
What have you done?

391
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,280
Help me move him!

392
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,559
Keep moving!
It's going to be all right, Jack.

393
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,760
Everything is going to go
back to normal.

394
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,200
From out of the darkness,
he is come.

395
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
What is he talking about?

396
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,440
Son of the Great Beast,
cast out before time,

397
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,440
chained in rock
and imprisoned beneath the rift.

398
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,199
What?!

399
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,679
All hail Abaddon,

400
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,519
the Great Devourer.

401
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,560
Come to feast on life.

PEOPLE SCREAM

405
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,719
I look upon you, my God,
and know my work is done.

406
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,159
How do we stop it?
Tell me what to do, Jack.

407
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,760
Just you...
Get me to an open space.

408
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:13,799
What are you gonna do?

409
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,639
If Abaddon is the bringer of death,
let's see how he does with me.

410
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,840
If he feeds on life,
then I'm an all-you-can-eat buffet.
No, wait! Wait, you're too weak!

411
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,199
Get out of here!

412
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,279
GO!

413
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:35,240
Drive as fast as you can. Jack!

414
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,999
Bring it on!

GWEN SOBS

418
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:23,999
You're here! Weren't you just
here a minute ago? You're here!

419
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,599
Go to bed. Get some sleep...
and I'll be back for you.

420
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
You're certain?

421
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,840
He's ice cold.

422
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
No vital signs.

423
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,040
He survived when you shot him.

424
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,679
When I first joined,
he said he couldn't die.

425
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,760
He was wrong.

426
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,400
I want to sit with him.

427
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,920
Gwen...

428
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,960
I want to sit with him.

429
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:53,800
(Wake up.)

430
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,080
(Jack.)

431
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,520
How long's she gonna do this?

432
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:06,480
It's been days.

433
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,559
We have to face up to it.

434
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,239
He's not coming back.

435
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,119
I believe in him.

436
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,680
Let him go, Gwen.

437
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,000
JACK: Thank you.

438
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,879
I... I forgive you.

OWEN SOBS

440
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,440
What's happened to the rift?

441
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,440
It closed up
when Abaddon was destroyed.

442
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,680
But it's gonna be
more volatile than ever.

443
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,800
The visions we had.

444
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,560
We all saw people we loved.

445
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,320
What did you see?

446
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,799
Nothing.

447
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,399
There was nothing.

448
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:15,239
Jack...

449
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,919
what would have tempted you?

450
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:20,600
What visions would have
convinced you to open the rift?

451
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,760
The right kind of Doctor.

452
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,880
Jack...?

453
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,840
Where are they with those coffees?

454
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,240
MACHINE BEEPS

455
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:04,760

457
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760

DOOR OPENS

459
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:20,320
Did you see Jack
on your way in? No.

460
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,559
I thought we'd tidied up in here!

461
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,240
What's the matter?

462
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,320
Um...he was just here.

463
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,000
Something's taken him. Jack's gone.
