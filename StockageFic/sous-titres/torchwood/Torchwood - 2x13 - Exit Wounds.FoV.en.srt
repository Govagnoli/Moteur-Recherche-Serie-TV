1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,560
Torchwood.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,200
Outside the
Government, beyond the Police.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,730
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,580
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,870
The explosive devices...

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,360
Snap!

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,000
Jack, who's done this?

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,930
Captain John Hart.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,890
Jack, what does he want?

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,210
Say hi to the family.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,910
No, it can't be.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Been a while since you've
seen your brother, eh, Jack?

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,330
Gray?

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,140
Bastard John's taken our SUV.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,610
He's driven it back to Torchwood.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm getting readings of rift
activity all over the city.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,120
Major rift flares at St Helen's
Hospital, the Police Headquarters

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,500
and the Central IT Server Station.

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,230
Hey, Andy?

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,330
Gwen, you've gotta get here right now!

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,620
I'm serious, we need you.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,230
OK, I'm on my way, all right?

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,030
This is him, isn't it? This
Captain John, or whatever.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,510
Rhys, drop Owen at the hospital.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,140
Tosh, Ianto cover the
central server building.

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,620
Gwen, the police station.

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,790
Then take me to Torchwood.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,870
- Will we all fit?
- Yeah, we have to.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,230
These are traps.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,850
So be careful.

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,260
You know what he's capable of.

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,370
What about you?

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,500
I'm gonna go reason with him!

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,870
He just tried to kill us.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,250
I was the only one who
could ever control him.

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,910
That's why the Time Agency partnered us.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,830
Did you just say Time Agency?

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,550
Don't tell me that's
based in Cardiff too?

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,260
Why's he doing this? What does he want?

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,650
That's what I'm going to go ask.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,750
<font color=#H6e4bc4>"I Lost My Heart To A
Starship Trooper" by Sarah Brightman</font>

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,350
Come on! Sing along!

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,290
It's our song!

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,710
We don't have a song.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
And if we did have a song, it
wouldn't be THIS song.

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,180
You're no fun!

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,430
Thank you.

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,280
I've been here quite
a while, what kept you?

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,390
We all survived.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,770
You know, if you're gonna set an
explosion, you need to be more efficient.

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh, them, they were just
prototypes, had to test out a theory.

52
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,070
How are they all, the little team?

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,010
What do you want?

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,990
I want you to know that I love you.

55
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,220
Funny way of showing it.

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,450
No, seriously.

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,120
You have to understand.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,550
I really do love you.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,690
Because this...

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
is gonna get nasty.

Cardiff City Police HQ 5:27PM

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,500
Andy!

66
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,450
They just appeared out of
nowhere, across the whole building.

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,480
They weren't human, least not
like any human I've ever seen.

68
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,970
The station's in shock.

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,800
Four most senior officers, murdered.

70
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,400
Everyone's running round
like headless chickens.

71
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,260
Rhys, what you doing here?

72
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,420
This is a confidential crime scene.

73
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,930
If what happened here gets
out, there'll be a citywide panic.

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,760
Rhys won't go blabbing.

75
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,590
I'm keeping more secrets
than you'd believe.

76
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,280
Like what?

77
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,990
Like a Time Agency. Based in Cardiff!

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,770
Oh, it's not based in Cardiff.

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,730
Brilliant secret
- I ask, you tell, well done

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,890
Bloody hell. What are they?

81
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,220
Weevils
- they live in the sewers.

82
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,340
Tell me you're joking.

83
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,870
- Don't mind if I subdue them, do you?
- Be my guest.

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,690
They killed the four
most senior officers.

85
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,240
Almost like it was targeted.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,020
Tosh, report where you are.

87
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,590
Just entering the Central Server.

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,610
{a6}Central Server Building 5:36pm

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,870
No sign of rift activity yet.

90
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,860
This building houses servers
for the military, police, NHS, 

91
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,600
even looks after the server systems
for the nuclear station at Turnmill.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,340
What problem did they report?

93
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,240
Ghosts in these server stacks.

94
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,130
How's the arm?

95
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,610
Owen gave me industrial strength
painkillers, seems to be doing the trick.

96
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,220
Ianto.

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,200
Devils! Blasphemers!

98
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,010
Pray to your heathen God.

99
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,760
While in the Lord's
name, we cast you out!

100
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,030
- There we are then.
- Sorted.

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,410
Owen, do you have anything to report?

102
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,910
{a6}St.Helen's Hospital 5:39pm

103
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,660
We've got some activity in the basement.

104
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,560
Coming back from a fag break, saw
the door open and there it is!

105
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,140
Chewing through the cables.

106
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,060
So I locked it in.

107
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,200
What the hell is it?

108
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,180
Short answer? It's an alien.

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,630
- Alien?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,670
It's called a Hoix.

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,170
The only profile we have
is that it lives to eat.

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,430
Caught one in Barry last
year in a kebab shop, 

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,890
it went through seven
doner sticks in 20 minutes.

114
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,580
Now, have you got the keys?

115
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,710
- What's that?
- All species sedative.

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,630
Now, food. You got anything it can eat?

117
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,620
Only these.

118
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,190
Right, perfect! Wish me luck.

119
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,280
Hoixie, where are you?

120
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,810
Come on, porkie. Come
out, come out, wherever you are.

121
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,520
There you are. Look what I've got.

122
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,020
They're actually very tasty.

123
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,780
Get a load of one of these.

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,150
That's it, good boy, come to me.

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,640
Come on, that's it, try one of these.

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,190
You really are quite stupid, aren't you?

127
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,410

128
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,690

**********

131
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,160
Why are you here?

132
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,330
Well, see...

133
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,820
NOW you're interested in me.

134
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,120
It's always the same, nobody
cares until you tie them up.

135
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,840
Number of reasons, actually.

136
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,270
First of all, you were very rude to me.

137
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,690
- What?
- Very rude indeed.

138
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,460
In front of people who barely knew me.

139
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,340
You belittled me.

140
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,750
Can't let that go.

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,850
You're serious?

142
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,440
Second
- you have all of time.

143
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,820
Eternity, essentially.

144
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,280
And you still refused
to spend time with me.

145
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,160
After all we've been through
together, after all I've done for you.

146
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,290
Where's Gray?

147
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,430
What've you done with my brother?

148
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,370
You don't realise.

149
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,090
Actions, ramifications, ripples
in the pond.

150
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,890
It's beyond my control.

151
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,510
Beyond your control? Please!

152
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,230
It is.

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,390
You need to understand that, 

154
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,650
so, localise the rift storms, 

155
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,230
a few short sharp shocks...

156
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't touch those controls!

157
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,240
Oi, I'm working here!

158
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,020
If you don't want that again, keep quiet.

159
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,960
So, I think we're ready
to find a vantage point.

160
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,230
Whatever you're
planning, we're gonna stop you.

161
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,220
OK.

162
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,720
Go on, then. Stop me.

163
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,170
I hope you can, really.

164
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,250
No?

165
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,640
All right, let's go get
ourselves a good view.

166
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,580
City Centre 6:28pm

167
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,200
What the hell are we doing here?

168
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,700
This is a good view.

169
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,420
I told you, no struggling.

170
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,180
I can make things right with you.

171
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,540
You don't understand.

172
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,950
You can't ever make this right.

173
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,790
Attention... Torchwood employees!

174
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,190
Evening all!

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,900
- Now, stop what you're doing.
- Jack, are you OK?

176
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,440
Jack can't come to the comms right now.

177
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,940
But if you leave a message, I'll
be sure and pass it along.

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,280
What've you done to him?

179
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,280
No, no, wrong question.

180
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,260
You should be asking, what
am I about to do to you?

181
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,870
- Put Jack on right now!
- Eye Candy!

182
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,730
That was so masterful, so
bossy, so basically powerless.

183
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,260
Get up to the roofs of your
buildings. Quickly now, spit spot.

184
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,720
- Why?
- Owen!

185
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,660
Cos if you don't, '
you'll miss all the fun.

186
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,520
Hold on a minute, do I mean
fun or do I mean carnage?

187
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,810
I get them confused.

188
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,340
Are you running yet?

189
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,330
No dawdling now!

190
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,370
Gwen! Where's she going?

191
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
What're you doing?

192
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,950
I'm sorry. Now...Cardiff!

193
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,730
Isn't it pretty? Doesn't it twinkle so?

194
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,530
Take a good look.

195
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,800
Remember this... because
it all goes so quick.

196
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,560
Oh, my God...

197
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,220
Gwen?

198
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,960
Oh, God...

199
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,380
You've destroyed the city.

200
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,260
Jack, hold me.

201
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,180
Oh, my God What do we do, what do we do?

202
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,680
OK, keep everyone calm, tell them
to get every officer in. RUN!

203
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,740
What've you done?

204
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,950
It's OK. It's all gonna be OK.

205
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,330
Stop! Get off me!

206
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,930
Jack? Jack?Jack, can you hear me?

207
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,920
Are you there? Jack!

208
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,900
I'm detecting a huge rift
flare over at the castle.

209
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,080
It's been generated by the
rift manipulator at Torchwood.

210
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,450
Tosh, Ianto, Owen... are you OK?

211
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,570
Yeah, we're fine.

212
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,960
- Still here.
- Me too.

213
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,770
Good, OK, good.

214
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,980
Tosh, do we have the scale
of the damage on the city?

215
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,260
Fifteen major explosions, at
strategic points across the city.

216
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,750
There's currently a surge in
traffic trying to leave the city

217
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,610
but the explosions have cut
off all major routes in and out.

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,900
Landlines, mobile phones and IT
networks all down, TV and radio off air.

219
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,920
- He's completely crippled us.
- Shit.

220
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,040
Not wanting to be the harbinger
of doom but the systems

221
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,610
which serve the nuclear
plant have all gone off-line.

222
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,210
Tosh, Ianto, you have to stabilise the
nuclear power station, make that a priority.

223
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,430
Owen, what's it like at the hospital?

224
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,430
Lost all power.

225
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,410
The backup generators
gave out in the blast.

226
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,840
Every single machine in
this hospital is down.

227
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,110
It's a disaster.

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,500
OK, all of you, listen to me.

229
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,640
We're gonna put this city back together, 

230
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,150
we're gonna find Jack and
we're gonna punish John.

231
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,750
Now, I need you to be careful. OK?

232
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,830
Where are you, Jack?

233
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,890
Where are you?

234
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,090
Cardiff 27AD

235
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,090
We're safe.

236
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,370
Now, before you do anything
rash, you have to hear...

237
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,800
Take us back now!

238
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,040
No way.

239
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,040
We have to be this far to
escape the trigger signal!

240
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,700
What?

241
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,190
Look at it! Go on.

242
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,530
It's bonded to my skin. I
can't get it off.Open it.

243
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,390
Ninth generation detonator.

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,870
You're a walking bomb!

245
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,320
Add to that a surveillance circuit, to
monitor my every word and action, 

246
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,890
and he has me doing anything I'm told.

247
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,390
Cos if I don't... boom!

248
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,650
I'm not my own man.

249
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,710
I thought you'd see that.

250
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,830
No, you're so self-obsessed you thought
I'd want to blow up the stupid city!

251
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,900
When I could be experiencing 17
simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula!

252
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,140
just run.

253
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,250
Oh, please, that is the
oldest trick in the book.

254
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,210
Jack?

255
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,400
Gray?

256
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,010
I never stopped believing.

257
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,650
I always knew we'd
find each other again.

258
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,770
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Sorry's not good enough.

260
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,580
Get a shovel.

261
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,490
{a6}Cardiff City Police HQ 7:39pm

262
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,590
This was a targeted attack, designed
to cause maximum panic.

263
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,410
Usual emergency procedures
won't cover what's happened here.

264
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,040
This is where we find out
how good we really are.

265
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,790
Cover the whole city, knock
on doors, check on people, 

266
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,590
tell people that they are safe
and that it is being dealt with.

267
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
Get out there and do your jobs.

268
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
Bloody impressive, man.

269
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,150
She is that, yeah.

270
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,170
Lucky sod.

271
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,990
{a6}Central Server Building 8:01pm

272
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,920
Go!

273
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,160
It won't work!

274
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,550
Nothing, sorry.

275
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,390
We need to re-start
the Turnmill servers.

276
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,950
What if you can't?

277
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,550
- Then the reactor goes into meltdown.
- Then I'm going up there.

278
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,950
What? Ianto!

279
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,700
Look, if we can't fix the remote servers, 

280
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,520
there must be something I can
do on-site to prevent a meltdown.

281
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,640
That could be suicide.

282
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,290
Are we gonna discuss
it, or are we gonna do it?

283
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,440
OK, but we both go.

284
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,460
I looked for you.

285
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,200
I searched for you for years.

286
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,160
You were my first thought, every day.

287
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,320
What are you expecting, mm?

288
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,870
A loving reunion? Absolution?

289
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,650
Me to say, "It's
OK, brother, "I forgive you."

290
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,480
Take Gray and keep him safe.

291
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,520
I got to go get your mother. RUN!

292
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,110
Those creatures, they lived to torture.

293
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,780
They kept us just on the verge of life.

294
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,510
I'd lie there, hemmed in by
corpses, praying to become one.

295
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,720
Because you...

296
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,550
let go... of my hand, remember?

297
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,970
If I could swap with you, I would.

298
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,520
Gray. Gray!

299
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,000
Where's Gray?

300
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,940
Where is he, son? Where is he?

301
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,070
Gray!

302
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,890
- Remember it again.
- Gray, where are you?

303
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,300
I believed you'd come, but you never did.

304
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,850
How long before you gave up, hm?

305
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,910
Months? Years?Decades?

306
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,630
What do you want from me?

307
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
I want you to suffer.

308
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,050
I want your life.

309
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,450
This is Cardiff.

310
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,870
27AD.

311
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,060
The city will be built
here, over the next 2, 000 years.

312
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,280
Your grave will be
the city's foundations.

313
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,140
Your blessing of life becomes a curse.

314
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,440
Each time you revive, with
a throatful of earth, 

315
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,460
each time it chokes you afresh, 

316
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,950
and you thrash on the edge
of death, you think of me.

317
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,800
All right, calling a halt
now I can't let you do this.

318
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,370
- Fill the grave.
- No way.

319
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,550
Then the detonator on
your arm gets activated.

320
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,760
What's that?

321
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,720
It's, er, sentimental value.

322
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,170
Torchwood Vaults 9:07pm

323
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,230
Skulking, is it?

324
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,560
Still no word from Jack.

325
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,250
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

326
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,380
What if it's not?

327
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,560
What if this is how it all ends?

328
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,900
I can't do this, Rhys. I'm not up to it.

329
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,590
Rubbish.

330
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,380
Those coppers are out
there now, because of you.

331
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,540
Even if you don't believe
in yourself, they did.

332
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,520
And I do.

333
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,220
You're a bloody hero, Gwen.

334
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,190
So you keep going, cos we need you.

335
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,250
Will you marry me again?

336
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,230
Gwen, I've got a rift
alert from inside the Hub, 

337
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,520
mirroring the pattern from
earlier when Jack disappeared.

338
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,920
D'you think it could be him?

339
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,450
I can't check it out, I've got to
get the Turnmill servers back online.

340
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,280
Tosh, I can't leave the police station.

341
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,740
Yes, you can.

342
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,600
If they need you.

343
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,960
We'll be fine.

344
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,900
Are you sure?

345
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,870
I'll see you when it's all over.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,310
Go!

347
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
You took your time.

348
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,880
On your knees!

349
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,870
Honestly, it's just
sex, sex, sex with you people!

350
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,740
Now!

351
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,520
Hands behind your head!

352
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,980
I'm gonna need a really good reason not
to shoot you within the next 20 seconds.

353
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,940
I know where Jack is.

354
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,800
You're lying.

355
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,050
He's buried alive, somewhere
beneath this city.

356
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,150
I came back to help you.

357
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,180
You bombed this city!

358
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,980
Listen to me!

359
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,290
You have to believe me.

360
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,240
It's Gray, Jack's brother, that's
been doing all this.

361
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,600
Don't talk rubbish.

362
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,670
He placed a bomb on me, molecularly
bonded the detonator to my skin, 

363
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,470
I had to do what he wanted. Look!

364
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,140
He forced me to bury
Jack and then he freed me, 

365
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,010
he told me I could go anywhere I wanted.

366
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,520
I could've run, but I
chose to come back here.

367
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,270
Why should I trust you?

368
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,180
They were separated as children.

369
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,610
Gray was abducted.

370
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,700
When I found him he was chained to the
ruins of a city on the Bedlam Outlands...

371
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,380
surrounded by corpses.

372
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,840
He was the only one left.

373
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,650
The creatures had long since gone.

374
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,210
Dunno how long he'd been there.

375
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,090
He thought I was the rescuing hero.

376
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,200
So, it took me too long to realise

377
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,190
he'd learned terrible things
watching those creatures.

378
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,240
He let me trust him...

379
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,300
The molecules are unbonding.

380
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,090
Just like he promised.

381
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,490
Oh, God.

382
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,200
See? Free man.Apparently.

383
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,730
I didn't have to come back here.

384
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,210
I could've run.

385
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,470
You find Jack, I'll let you live.

386
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
- But you'd better be quick.
- Fine.

387
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,370
Toshiko.

388
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,900
I need you to run a trace for an etheric particle
signal NME transmitting at 200 betacycles.

389
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,600
Gwen, where are you?

390
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,750
What's he doing? Where's Jack?

391
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,230
Trace that signal, we'll find him.

392
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,470
It's OK, Tosh.

393
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
I've got him covered.
Just do as he says.

394
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,610
No signals even vaguely resembling that.

395
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,330
There must be.

396
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,210
That transmitter's guaranteed for five
millennia through three permalayers -

397
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,590
it has to still be transmitting.

398
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,560
If not, we'll never find him.

399
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,820
He'll be buried... forever.

400
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,460
What the hell is that?

401
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,390
Oh, there's weevils loose
in the lower corridors.

402
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,110
Stay there, stay there.

403
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,390
Oh, my God, what's going
on, how did they get out?

404
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,470
It's Gray.

405
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
He must be here in the city, he
said he was gonna take Jack's life, 

406
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,520
destroy it from the inside out.

407
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,380
A weevil wake-up call
could be just the beginning.

408
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,310
Owen, Gwen, can you hear me?

409
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,500
The streets are flooded with
weevils, they came out of nowhere.

410
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,710
There's no chance we'll get to
the nuclear power station in time.

411
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,070
Manual life support, get
them round the hospital.

412
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,650
Ianto, leave it to me.

413
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,090
- I can get there.
- How?

414
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,090
King of the Weevils, remember?

415
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Push, will you! Have none
of you ever been in a scrum!

416
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,700
Bloody hell, how many were there?

417
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,550
It's like Fort Apache the Bronx.

418
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,200
Apart from the fact that there are
savage aliens and we could all die, 

419
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,610
it's almost exactly the same, yeah.

420
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,460
Thanks for that

421
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,080
I am telling you I have
run every scan possible, 

422
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,390
there is no signal traceable.

423
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,030
Then try it again, it's got to be there.

424
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,550
Oi, I'm talking to you.

425
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,200
You know you've got a real
pest problem around here.

426
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,560
Oh, God, I'm so pleased to see you!

427
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,290
Don't start, I'll make
things right, Eye Candy.

428
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,540
Then start by getting those Weevils
down the vaults before they recover.

429
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,100
It takes more than a
bullet to stop them.

430
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,580
- You did what?
- Ianto!

431
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,770
- I didn't have a choice!
- There's always a choice.

432
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,880
Can we just get these
Weevils into the cells!

433
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,970
If we don't find him, I'll kill you.

434
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,730
Very slowly.

435
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,830
What's happening? Tosh?

436
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,850
Tosh! Ianto, my comms are dead.

437
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,190
Gwen?

438
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,580
I let you go.

439
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,020
I gave you one trip, you
could have gone anywhere.

440
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,080
Question of honour.

441
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,290
Gray?

442
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,800
You're Gray, right?

443
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,050
There's no need for
this, we can help you.

444
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,940
Just tell us where Jack is.

445
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,230
His life's mine now.

446
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,370
Where's Jack?

447
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,440
What've you done with him?

448
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,130
WHAT'VE YOU DONE WITH HIM?

449
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,630
Turnmill Nuclear Power Station 9:42pm

450
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,640
Get the hell out of here!

451
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,990
What the hell are you
doing here, more like!

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,390
The systems going into meltdown.

453
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,760
A soldier never leaves her post.

454
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,120
Well you can now, OK?

455
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,630
I'm with Torchwood and
we're dealing with this.

456
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,410
What d'you know about
nuclear containment structure?

457
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,600
Well, I'm presuming if
you've run out of power, 

458
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,850
then the containment
structure's over pressurised.

459
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,450
The containment spray and cooling systems
aren't working so the fuel can't be cooled down, 

460
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,570
it's overheating.

461
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,850
So there'll be a meltdown and radioactive material
will be released into the atmosphere. Yeah?

462
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,980
- Roughly?
- Roughly.

463
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,250
And I'm at the eye of the storm.

464
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,120
We found you in a 20-foot grave!

465
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,900
Freeze me, set the alarm to
defrost in 107 years time.

466
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,350
I begrudge you everything.

467
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,480
Recall signal.

468
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,230
Get me out of here, Tosh!

469
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,180
Get me out of here!

470
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,500
I've died once, I'm not doing it again!

471
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,860
Where's Jack?

472
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,540
Where's Gwen, Ianto, John?

473
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,770
You want to watch the
dead man die again?

474
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,550
Owen, just stay calm.

475
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,930
Why should I do that?

476
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,350
Where's the fun in that?

477
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm gonna rage my way to oblivion.

478
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,740
- Please stop.
- Why?

479
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,090
Give me one good bloody reason why -

480
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,770
one good reason why I
shouldn't keep screaming.

481
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,070
Because you're breaking my heart.

482
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,240
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,360
It's my fault.

484
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,300
No, no, no, it isn't. No, it isn't.

485
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,300
Don't you dare go there, Tosh.

486
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,870
I'm really sorry.

487
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,800
What's gonna happen to me, Tosh?

488
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,270
I can't.

489
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,970
Please. OK, I need to know.

490
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,650
The containment chamber will be
flooded with the irradiated coolant.

491
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,850
Ah, my body will slowly
decompose, as I watch.

492
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,710
I should've been able to stop it.

493
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,060
Oh, come on, Tosh.

494
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,090
There's no way you could've
anticipated that power spike, come on.

495
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,760
Besides, you've saved my back
so many times in the past.

496
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,510
Right from the moment I joined.

497
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:06,010
Your second week I had to cover for you, 

498
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:13,190
pretend I was a medic, cos you
were hung over and unreachable.

499
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,050
What was it, Space Pig?

500
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,770
- Space Pig.
- Yeah.

501
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,000
We never did get that
date, did we, you and me?

502
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,590
We sort of, er, missed each other.

503
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,010
It was my fault. I didn't...

504
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,490
notice until it was too late.

505
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm sorry.

506
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,270
Me too.

507
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,090
COOLANT VENTING IN PROGRESS

508
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,010
It's starting.

509
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,550
Owen...

510
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,810
It's all right.

511
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,110
Really, Tosh.

512
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,650
It's all right.

513
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,250
'Oh, God.

514
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,620
Owen...

515
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,840
Owen...

516
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,280
Toshiko? Toshiko?

517
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,170
Gwen, I need help down here!

518
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,840
The nuclear plant at
Turnmill. Owen's there.

519
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,360
Sealed in.

520
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,650
Re-routed the blast.

521
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,520
I couldn't save him.

522
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,910
Tosh? There you go, darling.

523
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,580
Talk to me now, come on. Tosh!

524
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:25,320
And Cardiff city centre is today recovering
from a series of devastating explosions.

525
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:29,290
City leaders say it's too early to
account for the full scale of the damage

526
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,110
that also saw sightings of vicious
animals on the streets of the city.

527
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,800
My whole life I was looking for him.

528
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,940
Now I have to lose him all over again.

529
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,510
You cryo-freeze him and then what?

530
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,170
Wake him up in a 100 years
and he's miraculously better?

531
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,400
Cos that's not gonna happen.

532
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,410
Maybe killing him would
be the release he needs.

533
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,670
There has been enough death.

534
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,460
You didn't struggle...

535
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,330
when I buried you.

536
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,920
Like... you were allowing it.

537
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,690
It was my penance.

538
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,830
It's not your fault.

539
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,150
Need help with those rift predictions?

540
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,200
Lot of this planet I haven't seen.

541
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,430
You like it so much, thought
I might take a look.

542
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,690
Maybe see you around.

543
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,140
I'm sorry for your losses.

544
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,930
Final logout procedure DR OWEN HAPPER

545
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,000
Final logout procedure TOSHIKO SATO

546
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,890
OK. So...

547
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:55,110
if you're seeing this, I guess
it means, I'm... well, dead.

548
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,640
Hope it was impressive!

549
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,920
Not crossing the road or
an incident with a toaster.

550
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,680
I just wanted to say...

551
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,790
it's OK.

552
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,360
It really is.

553
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,410
Jack, you saved me.

554
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,620
You showed me all the
wonders of the universe and...

555
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,320
all those possibilities.

556
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,120
And I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

557
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,680
Thank you.

558
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,190
And Owen, you never knew.

559
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,360
I love you. All of you.

560
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,230
And...

561
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,470
I hope I did good.

562
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,510
Now we carry on.

563
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,560
I don't think I can, not after this.

564
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,120
You can.

565
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,400
We all can.

566
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,140
The end is where we start from.
