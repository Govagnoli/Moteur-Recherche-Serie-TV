1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,300
Torchwood. ..

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,080
..outside the
Government, beyond the police.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,160
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,400
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,020
The time is 2130.

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,330
This is Doctor Martha Jones.

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,130
Autopsy on Owen Harper, Caucasian, age 27.

8
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,840
Torchwood Officer 565.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,350
Time of death witnessed at approximately 2030.

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,400
Autopsy begins.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,420
STOP! Nobody touches him
til I get back, is that clear?

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,160
It's all right.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,400
I've been looking forward
to seeing the Captain again.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,470
Can you see where it is?

15
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,820
You'll owe me a favour.

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,780
Well?

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,820
- They hid it in a church?
- No.

18
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,530
When the people found out what it could
do, they built the church on top of it.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,570
If I told you not to
use it, would you listen?

20
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,820
Shouldn't you know the answer to that?

21
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,730
I do. That's the problem.

22
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,310
Jack. . . ?

23
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,910
Jack, what have you got?

24
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,940
Oh, my God.

25
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,400
You can't use it. Not after Suzie.

26
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm using the glove.

27
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,690
I'm bringing Owen back.

28
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,870
Are you really going to use that
after what happened last time?

29
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,280

Jack, the gloves are dangerous.

30
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,690

At best it'll give us two minutes.

31
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,870

At worst. . .who knows what will happen?

32
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,110

It's not up for discussion.

33
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,790

I thought the glove didn't work for you.

34
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,540

Different glove, different circumstances.

35
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,010

This time, it has to work for me.

36
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,830

I'm not going to give it any choice.

37
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,320
OK, if you've got anything you need
to say to Owen, now's your chance.

38
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,210
Owen...

39
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,120
it's Jack, can you hear me?

40
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,140
Owen, hear my voice, get a hold of it,

41
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,600
let it draw you out, pull you out.

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,770
I'm not getting any vital signs.

43
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,760
Owen, it's me, Jack.

44
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,750
He's coming, he's coming!

45
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,690
Oh, my God!

46
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,300
What happened? Where am I?

47
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,790
Oh, God I'm shot, he shot me!

48
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,550
Owen, you need to listen to me, 
we don't have long.

49
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,570
Where am I? This isn't the
hospital, this is the autopsy room.

50
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,720
What am I doing here? Jack, oh, no!

51
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,810
What's that? What's that?

52
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,330
The resurrection glove.

53
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,380
We lost you, but I brought you back.

54
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,830
How long have I got?

55
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,290
We're at thirty seconds and counting.

56
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,970
Oh, no. Jesus. Really?

57
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,440
OK, team, say your goodbyes. Gwen.

58
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,120
No offence, but I've only
got two minutes to live.

59
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Tosh!

60
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,630
I'm gonna miss you.

61
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,330
And I love you.

62
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,810
I always have.

63
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,870
Owen, I need the code
for the alien morgue.

64
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,530
You're the only one who knows it.

65
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,270
You brought me back for that? For that?!

66
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,460
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,810
Jack, it's 231165. OK?

68
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,750
Sorry, and to help you prepare.

69
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,530
I know what death is.

70
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,880
I want you to be ready.

71
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,550
There's nothing. Just darkness.

72
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,850
Two minutes.

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,020
- Jack, Jack..
- Be brave.

74
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,910
Owen! Owen!

75
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm really gonna need that hand back.

76
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,870
Owen?

77
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,180
Two minutes, twenty?

78
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,130
Look, I'm not using the glove.

79
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,440
But I'm still here.

80
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,580
Oh, here we go again.

81
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,760
Maybe I cheated it somehow.

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,390
Maybe I wasn't meant to
die so I'm being kept alive.

83
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,020
Ah, somebody pass me my pants, please.

84
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,020
It's OK. I hate to say
it, but you'll get used to it.

85
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
No heartbeat, there's no pulse.

86
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,040
Owen, you can't lead the investigation.

87
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,770
Why not?

88
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,650
Because you're the subject
of it, and because you're dead.

89
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,650
Are you sure about that?

90
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,780
Yes, I'm sure.

91
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,860
Well, I'm OK. Look, there's
electrical activity in my brain.

92
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,790
That shouldn't be possible.

93
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,140
Well, I'm still here
and I feel amazing!

94
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,450
So where's the power coming from?

95
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,420
Suzie survived because she
was draining energy from me.

96
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,750
Owen could be doing the same to Jack.

97
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,710
I feel fine.

98
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,120
The Philemon filter
detects biochemical energy.

99
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,430
It's how we knew Suzie
was draining Gwen.

100
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,860
And?

101
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,400
Nothing.

102
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,560
There's no connection between them.

103
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,700
It's not Jack.

104
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,690
I told you, I feel fine.

105
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,950
So what's keeping me ticking?

106
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,260
I mean, the energy in my brain must
be coming from somewhere.

107
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,040
This glove is different
to the other one.

108
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,230
Maybe different gloves
do different things?

109
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,100
- How many are there?
- Two.

110
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,580
Well, they tend to come in pairs.

111
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,380
We fished the first one out
of the harbour last year.

112
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,350
But where does it come from, originally?

113
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,790
Good question.

114
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,780
No idea. Tosh, do an analysis of the
glove, see you if you can find out.

115
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,460
Owen, I don't need to tell you
that you're under quarantine.

116
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,870
You don't, and yet you still do.

117
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,330
Oh, I woke you up, I'm sorry.

118
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,160
No, no, you didn't.

119
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,980
So, what's up?

120
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,420
You coming home soon, you know, tonight, next
week, in time for our wedding?

121
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,110
I was only teasing!

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,210
No, it's not that, it's not that.

123
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,010
What's happened? What's wrong?

124
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,160
Are you all right? Gwen?

125
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,950
A tough day, a tough day.

126
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,340
You're kinda cute when you frown.

127
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,860
The energy from the glove is spreading out
through your body, changing its composition.

128
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,200
If you keep this on we should be able
 to monitor changes as they happen.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
You've stopped flirting with me.

130
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,310
I mean, it's all right.

131
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,080
I wouldn't flirt with me in
my condition either, but...

132
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,010
er, is it still necrophilia
if I'm conscious?

133
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,170
What was it like? To die?

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,540
- I don't think I should say.
- Why not?

135
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,030
I'm not sure the living should know... 
The living....

136
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,380
It might change the
way you live your life.

137
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,640
You tell me right now, Owen.

138
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,500
It's hard to describe, there
aren't the words for it.

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,640
- It's like, er...
- What?

140
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,510
There was a light, a tiny speck of light.

141
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,720
And I was rushing towards it, like down a
corridor, then it glowed brighter and brighter...

142
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,220
..then suddenly there
were these gates...

143
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,400
These big pearly gates and there was this old
geezer and he said you've been a very naughty boy.

144
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,030
Idiot!

145
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,920
There was nothing, well, not
that I can remember.

146
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,010
Suzie said it was different.

147
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,990
What did she see?

148
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,720
She said there was
something beyond life,

149
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,390
something in the
darkness, something moving.

150
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,720
Martha!

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,260
Martha! Martha!

152
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,600
Martha!

153
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,540
Jack! Help! I need help! Now!

154
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,500
What's happening?

155
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
He just collapsed. Owen!
Owen, can you hear me?

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,510
- Calm down.
- What happened?

157
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,130
I was in the darkness, there was
something, something there...

158
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,770
What did you see?

159
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,720
I don't know.

160
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,920
It was waiting for me.

161
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
This way.

162
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,380
Owen's body's undergoing
some kind of transformation.

163
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,330
His cells aren't
decaying, they're changing.

164
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,810
Into what?

165
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,250
An energy I can't identify.

166
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,330
But it's growing, all the time.

167
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,820
He's about 40% something else.

168
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,220
I don't feel any different.

169
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,150
We need to find out where
this energy's coming from.

170
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,340
Presumably it's the same
place as the glove, which,

171
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,170
judging from its atomic
makeup, isn't anywhere local.

172
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,470
Owen said he went
somewhere when he collapsed.

173
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,910
Could the energy and the glove
come from the same dark place?

174
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,490
Are we talking about another
dimension? Parallel universe?

175
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,880
Yes, guys, I'm still here.

176
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,510
Sorry.

177
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,160
OK, you said there was something
in the darkness, waiting for you.

178
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
I felt it, I didn't see it.

179
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,710
Where do you think you went?

180
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,360
Don't know.

181
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,730
So, what now?

182
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,510
Ianto, check our internal system readings for any
dimensional anomalies in the last twelve. 

183
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,860
Owen, what I said before, 
when I thought you were dying...

184
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,570
I'm not dying. I'm dead.

185
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm a headless chicken. I just
haven't stopped running about yet.

186
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Well, when I told you I...

187
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,630
Yeah, you didn't mean it. I know.

188
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,190
You do?

189
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes, I mean, you didn't say anything before and
then suddenly I'm dying and it's like, "I love you."

190
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,290
That's not love, Tosh. That's grief.

191
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,960
You're losing something, so suddenly you
desperately desire it, textbook response.

192
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,110
Yeah, but Owen I... Don't go!

193
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,370
I'm just going to the toilet, all
right. For crying out loud!

194
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,460
'Melenkurion.

195
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,250
'Abatha.

196
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,300
'Duroc.

197
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
'Minas.

198
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,190
'Mill khabaal.'

199
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,210
Melenkurion abatha. ..

200
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,440
duroc minas mill khabaal!

201
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,470
Have you seen Owen?

202
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,660
He was with Toshiko.

203
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,060
The energy in him just
went off the scale.

204
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,040
Owen! Owen?

205
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,370
He said he needed the loo.

206
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,770
Owen's digestive system's shut down.

207
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,240
He can't eat or drink, so
he doesn't need to pee.

208
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
He's not answering.

209
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
Well, he's not in the hub.

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,350
You mean he's out there?

211
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,170
It's Owen, it's not like he's dangerous.

212
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,090
You sure about that?

213
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,700
Meaning?

214
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,500
You had the power to bring people back
to life and you never told UNIT. Why?

215
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,390
They would've wanted to use it.

216
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,430
I'm on your side, Jack, but Owen's just had a
surge of energy that we can't begin to understand.

217
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,210
The cells in his body are being
transformed into something else.

218
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,490
He's about 50% human.

219
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,860
And that 50% is dead.

220
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,500
We need to stop thinking
about him as Owen.

221
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,370
I'll find him.

222
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,120
Smile, it won't kill you.

223
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,380
You're gorgeous, you are.

224
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,380
- Don't you like me?
- Get off me.

225
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,880
No blood, brilliant.

226
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,900
What? Oi!

227
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,290
How did you find me?

228
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,420
Do you know what you've done?

229
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,950
You don't care about me.

230
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,400
You brought me back for an alarm code!

231
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,060
That is not why I brought you back.

232
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,300
Have you any idea what it means
to know that your life is over?

233
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,530
That that was it?!

234
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,830
That is Owen Harper's
contribution to the world.

235
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,930
You idiot!

236
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,890
GET OFF ME,

237
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,270
- GET OFF ME!
- Be careful with him!

238
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,750
Get off me you meat head, get off!

239
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,000
- That's enough.
- Let go of me!

240
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,220
Let's calm down, shall we?

241
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,950
Look, mate. I'm Torchwood.

242
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah, course you are, and I'm MI5.

243
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,360
I'm Owen Harper. I work for
Torchwood on special ops.

244
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,950
<Cockney accent>
Special ops? What's he on about?

245
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,870
Special needs more like it!

246
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,120
I warned that's enough!

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,040
You call that number, you
speak to Police Constable Gwen Cooper.

248
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,340
I want to make a complaint.

249
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,640
Enough. You're dead.

250
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,950
You break your ankle, what are the
chances it'll knit back together?

251
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,810
You want to add a wheelchair
to your prob. ..problems?

252
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,970
I forgot, my digestive system's shut down,

253
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,020
that alcohol I drank is just going to
sit in my stomach, it won't go anywhere.

254
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,000
Can you just stick your
fingers down your throat?

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,660
I'm dead, it's just another one of those
things, the gag reflex, I lost in the process.

256
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,720
Hang on, hang on, if I can just
line up my oesophagus. ..

257
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,230
That is the single most disgusting thing
I have ever seen, and I know disgusting.

258
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,600
Sorry, Jack, I forgot,
that goes on for a while after death.

259
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,810
For God's sake, let me out!

260
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,880
But eventually that will stop too.

261
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,170
I will fart my last fart.

262
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,260
God, I'm going to miss farting, and sex.

263
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,890
Sex more than farting, I hope.

264
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,680
Oh, you take these things for granted.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,850
It's only when they're slipping away
that you realise how amazing they are.

266
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,390
This could be the last time I see these flecks
or you know, feel these bricks underneath my hands.

267
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,540
"Only in suffering do
we recognize beauty."

268
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,990
Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Who said that?

269
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,860
Proust.

270
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,040
You've read Proust?! Yeah!

271
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
Well, no.

272
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,610
We dated for a while.

273
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,330
He was really immature.

274
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,130
You know, none of us know whether to take
you seriously when you say those things.

275
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,380
When you've lived as long as I
have, you don't make any more up.

276
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,270
You've got forever, I could have seconds.

277
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,220
Hardly seems fair.

278
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,930
It isn't.

279
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,470
But then forever's overrated.

280
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,640
Not from where I'm sitting.

281
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,840
If you've got forever, you don't
notice the flecks on the concrete

282
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,750
or bother to touch the bricks.

283
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,630
And you send your friends into danger,

284
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,180
knowing the stakes
aren't the same for you,

285
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,040
that you might get them killed
while you walk away unscathed.

286
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,020
Then why did you bring me back? Guilt?

287
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,480
No, that's not why.

288
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,900
Then why did you, really?

289
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,590
Because I wasn't ready
to give up on you.

290
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,870
I guess I was hoping for a miracle.

291
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,150
And I still am.

292
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's go home.

293
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,990
Torchwood. Authorization, Harkness, Jack.
474317.

294
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,520
Jack called in, he's found Owen.

295
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,390
They're OK, they're coming back.

296
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,880
Is he himself?

297
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
What do you mean, himself?

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,730
I wanted to know why Owen left.

299
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,310
Actually, more if he talked to anyone
about what I said, so I checked the CCTV.

300
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,250
That's a bit like stalking, Tosh!

301
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,870
I know!

302
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,150
Only now I wish I hadn't. Look.

303
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:53,660
Melekurion abatha, duroc minas mill khabaal.

304
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, my God.

305
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,240
What is that?

306
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,060
There's too many of them. They're after
me, I stole the glove from them. GO! GO!

307
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,170
Whoa! They must be really
pissed off with you.

308
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,700
Owen!

309
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,180
Stay here.

310
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,540
Owen!

311
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,610
- Owen, get behind me.
- Yeah, right.

312
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,060
Come on.

313
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,360
Owen, what the hell is going on?

314
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,050
Melekurion abatha!

315
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,290
Duroc minas mill khabaal!

316
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,990
I need to know what Owen was saying.

317
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,650
We all do.

318
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,020
This has never let us down before.

319
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,040
We should be able to play the translation
through the computer's speakers.

320
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,400
[BLEEPING]
It's never done that before.

321
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:06,670
I shall walk the earth and
my hunger will know no bounds.

322
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,860
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

323
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,260
You don't know the half of it.

324
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,850
So I'm King of the Weevils, 
maybe even Weevil Messiah,

325
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,690
but whichever way you
look at it, it ain't good.

326
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,430
No, it isn't, and I think
it's happened before.

327
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,880
Where did you get this?

328
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,370
I found it in an
article about Black Death

329
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,790
and what you're looking at there are the
first images of the Grim Reaper.

330
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,110
I shall walk the Earth and
my hunger will know no bounds.

331
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,280
In legend, the person who said
those words was Death himself.

332
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,080
[LOW HOWLING]
But there's no such thing.

333
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,100
Yeah, I'm dead. I'm not Death.

334
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,430
There is a difference.

335
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,710
Does he know that?

336
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,310
Right, that wood-carving dates back to the
15th century, to a small parish called St. James.

337
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,840
When they heard about the plague, they
built a wall around the town.

338
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,320
Unfortunately, that didn't
prevent a little girl from dying.

339
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,030
S0 the legend goes, the
priest performs a miracle,

340
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,750
brings her back to life, but
she doesn't come back alone,

341
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,780
she brought Death with
her, and he walked amongst them.

342
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,310
Are we seriously gonna act
on something she's Googled?

343
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,630
What was the name of the priest's church?

344
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,560
Yep, St Mary's.

345
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,170
That's where I found the glove, which
makes the parish of St. James. ..

346
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,640
...the town that 500 years later
would turn into a city called Cardiff.

347
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,080
What happened to the town
when Death walked amongst them?

348
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,670
People died.

349
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,120
12 people.

350
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,680
Death needed 13 souls before it
had a permanent hold on the Earth.

351
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,180
How did they stop it at 12?

352
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,850
It just says faith.

353
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,660
Owen is changing.

354
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,400
Who knows what that energy is?

355
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
What if it's making
him a host, a gateway?

356
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,740
I've been thinking there's something in the
darkness, waiting for me to finally pass over,

357
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,280
but I've got it wrong, OK, it's
the other way around.

358
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,190
It's trying to get here through me.

359
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,270
[BLEEPING]
What's this reading now?

360
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,560
80%.

361
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,600
What happens when it completes?

362
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,070
We fight monsters, what happens when we
turn out to be the monsters, when I do?

363
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,490
Even if we have to fight
you, you're already dead.

364
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,660
What do we do with the dead?

365
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,780
Come on, what do we do?

366
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,920
You embalm them.

367
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,120
If we inject a formaldehyde
solution into my veins,

368
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,590
it'll petrify my neural
pathways and freeze dry my brain.

369
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,660
It's the only way to be sure.

370
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,420
Are you sure about this?

371
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,310
The formaldehyde might irritate, but the
ethanol should prevent me feeling its effect.

372
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,100
It's a raging carcinogen, but I don't
think I need to worry about that.

373
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,810
You know what I mean.

374
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,610
Yeah.

375
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,390
I can't sleep, I can't
drink and I can't shag,

376
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,790
and they are three of
my favourite things.

377
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,290
Owen!

378
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm not the same, Gwen.

379
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,020
I came back different, hollow...

380
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,060
..like I'm missing something...

381
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,520
..and I do not want to be like this, OK?

382
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,030
I'm ready.

383
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,230
Owen's at 95%.

384
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,020
Then let's not waste any more time.

385
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,100
No goodbyes.

386
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,890
Are you ready for the first injection?

387
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,500
Someone really doesn't like needles.

388
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,530
Lockdown!

389
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,230
Martha just. ..

390
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,240
Owen, Owen, don't move.

391
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,640
Everyone spread out.

392
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,620
Where'd it go?

393
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,820
I think it went under the cabinet.

394
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,930
Are you all right?

395
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,800
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.

396
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,500
It's there.

397
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,910
Gun!

398
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,710
If you destroy it, the
connection can be lost.

399
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,490
Now!

400
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,710
Oh, my God.

401
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,400
Martha?

402
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,960
Martha?

403
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,950
What's happened to her?

404
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,870
It's the Glove.

405
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,560
It did this to her.

406
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,220
Owen, help me with her.

407
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,690
[BLEEPING]
Owen!

408
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,380
I will walk the Earth

409
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:09,050
and my hunger will know no bounds.

410
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,450
Police Officer, I need a medic now!

411
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,200
Where did it go? Owen!

412
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,560
So what happened to that thing?

413
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,840
- It's gone.
- So it's out there?

414
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,310
How do you know her?

415
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,120
I take it you're not family.

416
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,170
She's a neighbour, we look in, do her
shopping, collect her pension, that sort of thing.

417
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,530
Her red blood cell count is through the
floor and she's massively dehydrated.

418
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,440
All of which has placed a
considerable strain on her heart.

419
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,330
- You've got to help her.
- We are,

420
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,820
but you have to accept she's, what, 80?

421
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,470
just do what you can, please.

422
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:36,540
It must be Death, because
it's stolen my life.

423
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,720
We'll find a way to reverse this.

424
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,650
Last time, back when Cardiff
was a town, it killed 12 people.

425
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,400
So?

426
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,410
Why didn't it get to 13? And where
does this faith bit come into it?

427
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,990
- Ianto, we need answers.
- I'm on it.

428
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,290
Owen, I want you back at
the hub. You're not safe.

429
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,700
Jack, I'm free of it, I promise
you, and I'm useful , I'm useful here.

430
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
When it came though me, I felt it.

431
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,970
I know what it is, I know
what it wants, it's Duroc.

432
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,460
- And what is that?
- Hunger.

433
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,280
Where do we look for it it? Where
do we even start to look for it?

434
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,750
We won't have to go far. It's here.

435
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,820
Why would it follow us here?

436
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,290
I'm not sure it did.

437
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,730
Maybe it senses the near-dead.

438
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,860
If you were death, wouldn't
you target a hospital?

439
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
This is Captain Jack Harkness, Torchwood.

440
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,370
You need to evacuate St.
Helen's Hospital Cardiff immediately.

441
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:21,480
Ladies and Gentlemen, if you can move as quickly 
as possible to your nearest exit, thank you.

442
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,370
Can I have a hand in
here, please? All right, wake up!

443
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,290
Dressing gowns on!

444
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,900
It's not a drill. Can you
listen to me carefully, please?

445
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is not a drill.

446
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,330
Please make your way to the
assembly point in car park one.

447
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,700
Ianto, I need you to crack into
the hospital communication system.

448
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,440
Already done it. They've got multiple
code fours in intensive care.

449
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,350
- Which floor is that?
- Sixth.

450
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,990
- What's a Code Four?
- Heart attack.

451
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,510
We need to do a body count, let
me know if we get to 12.

452
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
- Have you seen Jamie?
- No.

453
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,290
I'll catch you up.

454
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,590
Jamie?

455
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,460
Jamie, is that you under there?

456
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,280
Owen, Tosh, we're on the sixth floor.

457
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,180
There's fatalities. Seven of them.

458
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,450
I'm hearing of a fatality
during a routine operation.

459
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,200
Let's count that as eight.

460
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,750
That leaves five to go. Oh.

461
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,240
- What?
- There's five of us.

462
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,890
If it was last seen on the sixth, did
it go up or down from there?

463
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,360
Most of the top floors are evacuated, so
if it's still hungry, I'd guess...

464
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,320
We'll make our way down.

465
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,700
Jack, we still have no idea
what to do if we find it.

466
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,860
Ianto?

467
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,010
I have searched for the phrase "I shall walk
the Earth and my hunger will know bounds",

468
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,540
but I keep getting
redirected to Weight Watchers!

469
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,150
It was a medical journal,
History Of Medicine.

470
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,000
Try under Tavistock or Wellcome.

471
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,490
We're on the seventh floor.

472
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,330
It's here, I can feel it.

473
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,730
Owen, you're scaring me.

474
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm not exactly reassuring myself.
Come on.

475
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,880
Take my hand. Come on!

476
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,620
- I'm getting reports of 12 people dead.
- So?

477
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,490
The legend says, when Death took 13
souls, its power would be unstoppable.

478
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,370
It'd roam the earth forever, Jack. 
It only needs to kill once more.

479
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,600
That's 12. We're running out of time.

480
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,660
I think we lost it.

481
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,630
Maybe not.

482
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,820
If I can access the correct frequency...

483
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,350
- What's your name?
- Jamie Burton.

484
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,750
All right, Jamie. I'm Owen, this is Toshiko, 
we're going to get you out of here.

485
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,250
- What are you in here for?
- Leukaemia.

486
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,500
Jamie, you're going to be fine.
I'll have this door open in a second.

487
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,750
Jamie, they got you in for
a round of chemo, have they?

488
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,010
Had that. It didn't work.

489
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,430
So why are you here?

490
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,390
They're trying to make me have it again.

491
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,160
It didn't work though.

492
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,980
The cancer just comes back,
just makes my hair fall out.

493
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,740
I'm gonna die. I might as
well do it with eyebrows.

494
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,090
Ianto, what have we got?

495
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:20,640
Back in 1479, the priest discovered that Death
needed 13 souls to walk the earth for eternity.

496
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,620
He stopped Death at 12...

497
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,010
- It was Faith.
- I know!

498
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,510
No, the little girl that died and was brought
back to life. Her name was Faith.

499
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,840
- She stopped it.
- Well, how?

500
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,060
It doesn't say.

501
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,430
Faith didn't have anything to lose.

502
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,600
She was already dead.

503
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,230
Jamie.

504
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,520
Jamie, you're scared - of course you are.

505
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,330
The last lot of chemo didn't work and you can't bear
 the thought of going through all that pain again,

506
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,030
and I understand that, mate, I really do,

507
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,420
but let me tell you that not
everyone dies of this disease

508
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,770
and the ones with the best chance of making it
are the ones who believe that they can beat Death.

509
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,530
And sometimes, just sometimes, you can.

510
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,330
So watch and learn, Jamie Burton.

511
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,310
Watch what?

512
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,290
Watch me beat Death.

513
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,090
- Come on!
- OK, go!

514
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,300
Come on, Jamie. Take him. OK.

515
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:24,040
Owen, I am not leaving you to
face that thing on your own.

516
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,280
I know what to do.

517
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,480
You don't know what we're dealing with.

518
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,660
You're so gonna hate me for this.

519
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,480
Owen! Owen, no! Open the door!

520
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,100
What the hell are you doing?!

521
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,890
Owen, Owen!

522
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,560
How long?!

523
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,210
How long can you last
here with only 12 victims?

524
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,740
There's nothing here for you!

525
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,550
Owen Harper's soul
has left the building!

526
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,800
There's nobody here but us dead men.

527
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,810
- No!! Owen!
- Owen!

528
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,480
What else have you got?

529
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,080
What else can you do to the dead?!

530
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:43,010
Jack! Jack! Jack!

531
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,600
Owen! Owen!

532
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,140
Owen!

533
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,110
Is that all you've got?!

534
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,290
- Finish!
- Owen!

535
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,610
No, no, no.

536
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,680
Jack?

537
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,850
Jack?

538
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,320
Gwen?

539
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,310
Anyone?

540
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,800
So tell me, Doctor, is it
worth starting War And Peace?

541
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,750
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

542
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,170
That I got you hurt.

543
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,410
It's not me that I'm worried about.

544
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:16,810
You soaked up a colossal amount
of energy, but it's dissipating now.

545
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,120
It doesn't sound good.

546
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,950
I don't know anything about
its properties. None of us do.

547
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,630
It could take 30 years for
it to die out completely.

548
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,680
Or 30 minutes.

549
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,070
Jack.

550
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,430
People died because you brought me back.

551
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,760
We owe them, you and me.

552
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,870
I'm still a doctor.

553
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,610
Let's put me to work.

554
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,670
See if we can't even that score.

555
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,840
We'll see.

556
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,220
Did he really beat death?

557
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,580
You can never really beat
death, never escape it.

558
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,660
It's always in the shadows, waiting.

559
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,940
So what do we do now?

560
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,890

'My name is Doctor Owen Harper.'

561
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,960
Torchwood Officer 565, I'm
relieving you of your position.

562
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,200
What's wrong with you?!

563
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,270
'Three days ago, I died.'
- I'm broken, Tosh!

564
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,520
'And they think I'm fine.'

565
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,910
What the hell are you?

566
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:25,980
'But they're wrong.'

567
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,370
Parker's house. There's an
energy spike coming from there.

568
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,320
And they're getting bigger.

569
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,640
We need to get in there.

570
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,680
But then there's these.

571
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,570
Heat sensors.

572
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,900
How do we get past them?

573
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,480
I'm literally too cool for school.

574
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,960
You're Torchwood, yeah?

575
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,520
And I'm having one hell of a day.
