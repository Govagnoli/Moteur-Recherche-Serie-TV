1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:05,799
Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,520
Tracking down alien life
on Earth and arming
the human race against the future.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,919
The 21st century is when
everything changes.

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,680
And you've got to be ready.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,079
This programme
contains some strong language.

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,920
SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER
OK!

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,599
Come on, Gwen!

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,439
LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING CONTINUES

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,160
Gwen, this is for you, baby!
Come on!

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,239
Just get it off him!
Take if out of his hands! Oi!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,479
Oh, come to Daddy!

12
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,520
YES! First round's on you, boss.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,879
Girls, get your handbags!

14
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,600
Of course, that was an illegal move.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,560
Totally illegal! Yeah, keep telling
yourself that, yeah. Losers. Bye.

16
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
He's never seen a live rugby match!

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,559
I have other things
to do with my time!

18
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,520
Rhys knows a bloke whose cousin
works at the Millennium Stadium.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,359
We should all go to the
next home international.

20
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,839
Can you make it
two Pepperoni Feasts tonight?

21
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,119
And a tub of coleslaw.

22
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,879
My boss says I'm not
eating enough vegetables.

23
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,799
Yeah, usual time. See you then.

24
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,200
Good to see you again, sir. Are
they looking after you at the hotel?

25
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,719
Konnichiwa, Tanizaki-san.
Konnichiwa.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,479
I did all I could.

27
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,840
I really did.

28
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,119
My God!

29
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:35,039
It's not possible!
One of them survived!

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,240
This is Lisa.

31
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,240
Is she awake? It's just
a reaction to the medication.

32
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,000
She's the only one left.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
Across the whole world.

34
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,759
Thank you, thank you so much.

35
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,839
Bringing me here. I never thought...

36
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,320
to get my chance...

37
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,640
..to study...

38
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,279
to work with...

39
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,919
anything like this. Anyone!

40
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,320
Tell me, what happened?

41
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,479
She worked for Torchwood London.

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,720
It was
the end of the Canary Wharf battle.

43
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,880
The Cybermen needed soldiers fast.

44
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,640
They started upgrading whole bodies
instead of transplanting brains
using Earth technology.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,040
Lisa was halfway through the process
when the machinery shut down.
You found her?

46
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
Help!

47
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,799
Help me, please!

48
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,079
Somebody!

49
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,199
I pulled her out.
Do you know the percentages?

50
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,800
The what?

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,159
Some elements have been augmented.

52
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,919
Some are still human.
Sensory capacity, for instance.

53
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,999
Her breathing and hearing
appears completely cybernetic.

54
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:33,680
And yet...there's also bare flesh.

55
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,919
Amazing. Perhaps 55% augmentation

56
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,599
with 45% awaiting completion.
Do you think?

57
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,879
Or perhaps, maybe 60/40.

58
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,240
It's fascinating.

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Can you make her human again?

60
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,600
You took parts from a Cyber
conversion unit and modified them
into a life support for her?

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
How did you know what to do?

62
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,680
I told him.
I thought you were resting.

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,599
You should be resting.

64
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,200
How's the pain?
Are the new doses working?

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,680
A little.

66
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,319
Oh... Is this him?

67
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
I promised, didn't I?

68
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
And you always keep your promises.

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I would like to ask her
some questions.

70
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,320
My name is Dr Tanizaki.

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,680
I specialise in Cybernetics.

72
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,119
Your friend, Mr Jones, asked me...

73
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,640
My boyfriend.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,479
Yes. He asked me to come.

75
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,720
We agreed, together.

76
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Few simple questions.

77
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,079
What is your name? Lisa Hallett.

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,519
How old are you? 26.

79
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,080
What is the last thing you remember
before coming here?

80
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:08,079
Somebody! Anybody!

81
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,839
Pain.

82
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,719
I remember my body burning with pain.

83
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,400
You said...

84
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,680
there was somewhere I
could work upstairs?

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,079
This first stage should enable her
to breathe without the respirator.

86
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,159
Once her body functions
without support,

87
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,839
I can judge what work is needed.

88
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,199
What if she's not ready
to breathe on her own?

89
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
You must be prepared for her
not to survive.

90
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,199
Sometimes...

91
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,680
in order to save what we love,

92
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,959
we have to risk losing it.

93
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,480
MACHINES BEEP,
HEART MONITOR FLATLINES
She's not strong enough!

94
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,079
Let me do my work!

95
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,800
And she said,
"D'you know how difficult it is to
find a man in this city?

96
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,839
"He had a nice flat,
all his own hair, so frankly,
a couple of tusks, I can live with!"

97
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,799
PAGER BEEPS
UFO sighting over Cardigan Bay.

98
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,879
Seven calls to the
emergency services.

99
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,080
Oh... Can we at least finish
our drinks, please? Sure.

100
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,839
Take ten seconds.

101
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,600
HEART MONITOR FLATLINES, LISA GASPS
If she dies because of you...

102
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,999
SHE GASPS, HEART MONITOR BEEPS

103
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Ianto?

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
Yes, I'm here!

105
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,360
She's breathing! It worked!

106
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,999
Why aren't I connected?

107
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,559
You're alive!

108
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,319
He kept you alive!

109
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:17,279
Thank you. This is only the start.

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,799
COMPUTER BEEPS
We've gotta move.

111
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,439
Quickly!

112
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll walk!

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,759
You've only just woken up. You
can't. I want to walk! Please.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Help her downstairs.
I'll clear up here.

115
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,559
I'm alive.

116
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,879
All I'm saying is, once in a while,
I'd like to drive!

117
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,359
And all I'm saying is no! Why not?!

118
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,879
Look, I've shared cars with women
before. I know what'll happen.

119
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,959
There'll be an emergency,
we're all raring to go, I jump in,
what do I find?

120
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,920
Seat's in the wrong position, the
rear view mirror's out of line and
the steering wheel's in my crotch.

121
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,199
Time it takes to sort it all out,
aliens'll have taken Newport.

122
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,640
JACK LAUGHS

123
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,719
What about a rota?

124
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,000
Different people drive on different
days.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
We're a secret organisation,
hunting alien technology
from an underground base.

126
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,400
And you want a rota for who drives?

127
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,840
Just trying to help.

128
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,079
As soon as they're gone,
I'll be down.

129
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:52,640
Tosh, call up the radar within a
50-mile radius of the Bay
for the last six hours.

130
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,559
Gwen, check with that man - Neil, I
think his name was, voice like Sean
Connery - at Jodrell Bank.

131
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,759
See if they picked up any chatter
around the time of the sightings.

132
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,439
Owen, access the airspace provision
over Cardigan Bay, also any RAF

133
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,000
flightplans, see if it's just
a case of mistaken identity.

134
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,319
Take it slowly.

135
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,320
You're still very weak.

136
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,360
This way.

137
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,959
HE CHOKES

138
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,200
Is that Neil?
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.

139
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,079
I know, we're always after
something, aren't we? Ianto!

140
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,719
Would you work some coffee magic?

141
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,079
Lisa!

142
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,119
Let me go!

143
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,679
I can help you.

144
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,680
The human race is weak.
I can make you strong.

145
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,559
What's happening?
Internal power drain.

146
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,080
What's causing it? Something big
to drain that amount of power.

147
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,159
Tosh, run a system diagnostic.

148
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,079
Actually...

149
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,159
We've been having generator
problems all evening.
I was down there checking earlier.

150
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,439
Couple of bits of cabling
have come loose.

151
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,799
I thought I'd fixed it.

152
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,720
Let me have another look.

153
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,080
Fine. Go check.

154
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,320
Want some help? It's fine.

155
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,799
ALARM BLARES

156
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,399
You've got to shut down the power!

157
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,519
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

158
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,240
What happened?! His upgrade failed.

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,319
Was it an accident?

160
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,919
Tell me you didn't do this!

161
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,360
I wanted to repay
him for helping me.

162
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,159
By removing the
weaknesses of his humanity.

163
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,920
What have you done?!

164
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
You've killed an innocent man!

165
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,960
It's all right. It's not all right!
They're gonna come looking for me in
a minute.

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,559
If they see the body, if they
find out what we've been doing...

167
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,679
I can deal with them.
Don't you go near them!

168
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,520
You didn't mean to do this.

169
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,959
Something's happened to your mind.

170
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,759
Um...just, um...

171
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,880
Some kind of side effect
from this whole process.

172
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
It's post-traumatic.

173
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,600
You didn't mean to...

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,679
You've ruined everything now!

175
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,400
How hard have we had to work
to keep you alive?

176
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,679
And now you do this.

177
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,160
I need you to stay in here.

178
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
Rest.

179
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,839
Don't come out unless I tell you.

180
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
This can't happen again, Lisa.

181
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,639
If you harm anyone else, I'll...

182
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,440
Yes?

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
What will you do?

184
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,759
OK, the body.

185
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,600
I've got to deal with the body.
I can do this.

186
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
This is my fault!

187
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm responsible for this!

188
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,200
I'll hide the body.

189
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,879
Everything's gonna be OK.

190
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,159
That's a UFO?!

191
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,480
Only just! Arkan leisure
crawler, first generation.

192
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,839
Collectors' item, don't see
many of those around these days.

193
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,080
Tosh,
send a polite message saying great

194
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,519
to see them, but could they please
get the hell out of our atmosphere

195
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,039
they're spooking the locals. Done!

196
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,839
Shouldn't we be apprehending it?
Investigating it? Oh, please.

197
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,879
You interrogate an Arkan,
you'll be in there for a month.

198
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,040
And that's just the first question.
They are so boring.

199
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
Besides, they're mostly liquid,
the cells would be a mess.

200
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:34,400
There it goes again!

201
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,160
Ianto, we've got another dose of
darkness. You found anything?

202
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,080
ALARM BLARES

203
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,039
Ianto? I need to hear those
beautiful Welsh vowels!

204
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,079
Power's draining to the storeroom
at the bottom of the building.

205
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
Looking for human heat signals.

206
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,160
We've got... Two signals?
So assuming one's Ianto...

207
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,119
Who's the other?

208
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm thinking we're under attack.

209
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,840
Security's been breached.
We assume battle protocols.

210
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,399
That's impossible!

211
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:21,999
Nobody can get in without triggering

212
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:27,399
seven separate alarms.
Yeah, well, looks like our
system needs to be upgraded.

213
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:30,439
I'll head down and look for Ianto.

214
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,319
I'll come with you.
You all right with that?

215
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,599
Keep your comms open at all times.

216
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,400
Any doubts, shoot first.
Priority is to find Ianto.

217
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,799
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,639
What's down here?

219
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,079
Normally? Nothing.

220
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,359
'Progress report?' Signs of...

221
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,680
'activity at the eastern end
of the main corridor.'
We're losing your comms signals.

222
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,399
We're going in to have a look.

223
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,799
Whatever that power source is,
it's interfering with the comms.

224
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,919
Gwen, Owen? Can you hear me?

225
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,600
Damn! Can we get them back?

226
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,039
Trying other channels. There's
something else you need to see.

227
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,239
I've gone back through our
internal CCTV footage for
the last couple of hours.

228
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,479
Someone's tried to remove
the images from our system.

229
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,519
See, now I'm starting
to get a little peeved.

230
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,200
These people come into my
house, start using my things...

231
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,680
I've dug into the system memory.

232
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
What the hell's going on here?!

233
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,000
Jack?

234
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,239
Tosh?

235
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,880
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?

236
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,199
No comms.

237
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,959
We're on our own, then.

238
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,959
What the hell is going on?

239
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:28,799
What's the matter?
I can't see well enough.
But there's something in there.

240
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,199
Some kind of operating table.

241
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,360
Get the bolts.

242
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,320
OK? Yeah.

243
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,399
OK, one, two...

244
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,879
No! No, no, no, no!

245
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,679
What the hell is it?!

246
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,960
It's wrong.

247
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,759
It's beyond wrong!
It shouldn't be here!

248
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,320
Turn the thing off! TURN IT OFF!

249
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,599
Internal levels are being restored!
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?

250
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,639
COMMS CRACKLE

251
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:25,880
These things brought down
Torchwood One.

252
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,640
But they were all destroyed.

253
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,999
Why is there one
in our bloody basement?!
Just tell me what it does!

254
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,000
It's the remnants
of a conversion unit.

255
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,799
This machinery
turns humans into Cybermen.

256
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,760
If I don't hear something within 30
seconds, I'm coming down there!
Jack, it's Gwen.

257
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,160
The comms dropped out.
We're back online now.

258
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,959
'Any sign of Ianto?' No.

259
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,639
But we have found parts
of a Cyber conversion unit.

260
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,599
'Fully powered up and working.'
This is no time to be
kidding around, Owen.

261
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,640
I'm deadly serious!

262
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,040
I dunno why it's here,
or how it got here.

263
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,439
But that's what's draining
our power.

264
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,600
Jack? You there? I want you
two back up here immediately!

265
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,839
We still haven't found...

266
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,879
Jack, code zero incursion. Repeat!

267
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,600
'Code zero incursion.
We're under attack.'

268
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
If you don't hear from me within
15 minutes, activate total shutdown

269
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,839
procedures and get
yourself to safety.

270
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,719
But I can't just leave you all here!

271
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:34,200
If there's a Cyberman in
this building, we need
a last line of defence.

272
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,999
Just make sure it never
gets to the outside world.

273
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:50,960
Whatever you... Whoever you are...
I don't mean you any harm.

274
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
But come any closer, I'll shoot.

275
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,519
SHE CHOKES

276
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,119
Let me go!

277
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,759
Do not struggle.

278
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,359
You will be like me.

279
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,719
GWEN CRIES IN PAIN

280
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:24,440
Throw down any weapons, put your
hands up and turn and face me!

281
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,679
GWEN SCREAMS

282
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,240
You're a woman! Owen! JACK!

283
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,959
GWEN SCREAMS

284
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:38,520
She doesn't know what she's doing!
You are fighting the wrong guy!

285
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,919
Get me out of here, someone, please!

286
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,039
Switch it off!
I'm trying!

287
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,359
She's changed all the circuits!

288
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,679
Shut off the power everywhere!
Toshiko, cut all power in the base!

289
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,719
I do that, the base goes into
lockdown! We'll be trapped.

290
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,639
Just do it!

291
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,199
Switch it off!

292
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,399
Gwen? I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.

293
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:31,559
Sort of.
Jack, please get me out of here!

294
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,759
It's all right.
Where is she? Where did she go?

295
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,640
Please tell me you got her!

296
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,239
Stand guard by the door.

297
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm really sorry. What for?

299
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,720
Let's just get out of here.

300
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,960
Clear? Clear.

301
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:20,359
Oh, God, there she is. What is she?

302
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,479
Some form of Cyberman.
They're us, upgraded.

303
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,920
Humans with emotions removed,
created on a parallel world and
supposedly destroyed on this one.

304
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,199
What are we gonna do? I don't know.

305
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,239
She's gone.

306
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:41,679
GUN CLICKS
Get us back to the Hub.

307
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,479
Jack, what are you doing?!
Resisting the urge to shoot.

308
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:49,239
Tosh, get everything from the
weapons room. Fast as you can.

309
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:53,199
It's locked down, there's no manual
override. Just open the store!

310
00:24:53,199 --> 00:25:00,479
On your knees! Hands above your
head! Jack, for God's sake! What are
you doing?! I gave you an order!

311
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,720
Gwen, help her!

312
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,120
Did you know that thing
was down there? I put her there.

313
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,719
You hid a Cyberman
within Torchwood?!

314
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:16,880
And you didn't tell us?
What else are you keeping from us?

315
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,039
Like you care. I clear up your shit.

316
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,519
No questions asked
and that's the way you like it.

317
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,960
When did you last
ask me anything about my life?

318
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,239
Her name's Lisa.

319
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:38,000
She's my girlfriend. Why didn't you
tell us? We could have helped you.

320
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,279
Torchwood exists to destroy
alien threats.

321
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,519
Why would I tell you about her?

322
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,959
A little loyalty, perhaps?
My loyalty's to her!

323
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,559
She worked for Torchwood.

324
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,920
She was caught up in battle.
I owe it to Lisa...

325
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,999
WE owe it to her...

326
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,799
to find a cure.

327
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,959
Ianto, you have to believe me.
There is no cure.

328
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:06,560
There never will be. Those who
are converted stay that way.

329
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,200
Your girlfriend will
not be the exception.

330
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,120
You can't know that for sure.

331
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,599
Look, you need to know
what's happening here.

332
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,800
Because this is where these things
start. Small decisions
that become mass slaughter.

333
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,079
These creatures regain a foothold
by exploiting human weakness.

334
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,799
Then they take a base.

335
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,639
Rebuild their forces. And before
you know it, the Cyber race is
spreading out across the universe,

336
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,999
erasing worlds,
assimilating populations.

337
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,799
All because of the
tiny beginnings here.

338
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,640
We need to stop her...together!

339
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,359
You're not listening to me!
The conversion was never completed!

340
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,880
She already tried to kill Gwen!

341
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,679
You think she's gonna stop there?

342
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,920
There is no turning back for
her now! I'm...not giving up on her.

343
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,640
I love her.

344
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,560
Can you understand that, Jack?

345
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,959
Haven't you ever loved anyone?

346
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,400
You need to figure out
whose side you're on here.

347
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,520
Because if you don't know...

348
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,240
you're not going to make it
out of this alive.

349
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,759
There's no way this weapons
store's gonna open.

350
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,039
It's going to take six hours for
the power to come back online.

351
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,880
Let me talk to her.

352
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,439
I can still save her.
Save all of us.

353
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,040
She's not a monster.

354
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,440
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

355
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,240
Ianto!

356
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,639
Lisa... It's me.

357
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,640
You can't just let him go... Ssh!

358
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,959
The army will be rebuilt
from here.

359
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:02,199
This building is suitable.

360
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:05,240
Who are you?   Human point two.

361
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,480
No! Lisa...

362
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,039
So how come you look
like human point one?

363
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,439
I do not understand.

364
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:18,759
Look at yourself. Go ahead.

365
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,080
Remember, Lisa.
Remember who you are.

366
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,120
The upgrade is incomplete.

367
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,279
You're still human.

368
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,879
I am...

369
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,680
disgusting.

370
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,239
I have...

371
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:40,599
I am...

372
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,719
wrong.  We can help you.

373
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:45,920
I must start again.

374
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,279
Upgrade properly.  For God's sake!

375
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,719
Have you heard yourself?

376
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,759
Lisa, please.
I brought you here to heal you.

377
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,599
So we could be together.

378
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,879
Together. Yes. Transplant
my brain into your body.

379
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,879
The two of us...together.

380
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,679
Fused.

381
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,439
We'll be one complete person.

382
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,519
Isn't that what love is?

383
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,399
No.

384
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,399
Then we are not compatible.

385
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,759
Argh!

386
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,879
Code Nine manoeuvres. Go!

387
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Gwen! Gwen! Get out of there!

388
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,320
Lisa! What you waiting for?

389
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,280
Run. We all ran.

390
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,560
She's coming after us. There's a
surprise(!) Could you be any less
helpful?! I just helped you escape!

391
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,639
Shut up, both of you!

392
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,279
OK, now,
this is a fight to the death.

393
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,960
We do whatever is necessary
to destroy her.

394
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Forget what Ianto said.

395
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,199
That thing is not human. Clear?
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,920
What's this? Something Suzie
scavenged. She claimed that it could
open any lock in 45 seconds.

397
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,520
I want you out the exit gates up
the emergency stairs to reception.

398
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,080
She'll never open that door
without power! It weighs a ton!

399
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,799
Anyway, I'm not leaving you here!

400
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,599
Just do as I say! All of you!

401
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,560
Once in reception...

402
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,800
panel next to the desk,
pull it out.

403
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Take circuit 357 from the main
system and patch it to these.

404
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,879
There should be enough power
in there for what we need.

405
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:01,959
Once the main circuit goes live,
get out. Meet us by the water tower.

406
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:08,319
Go! ..You two...find anything
that even resembles a weapon.

407
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,599
Autopsy room. There should be
some lethal equipment... What are you
gonna do? Buy you some time. Go!

408
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,120
Hey! Lisa!

409
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,440
It is Lisa, isn't it?
You've been hiding in my basement.

410
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,399
That's OK.

411
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,879
Draining my power,
I can live with that...

412
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:30,119
But now you're starting to hurt my
friends. This is gonna stop!

413
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,800
Come on!
This building belongs to me now.

414
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,640
You will all be deleted...
I'm sorry for what they did to you.
But this ends here.

415
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,159
How did he survive that?
Is that all you got?

416
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,079
I'm not so easily deleted.

417
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,199
We can't help him.

418
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,199
Shit!

419
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,279
Is there another exit? No!
We're trapped?!

420
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,959
Get in!

421
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:44,159
No way!
Lie on top of me and it'll take us
both. I'm not laying on top of you!

422
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm not saying it's a brilliant idea,
but it's the only one we've got!

423
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,440
What do we do?

424
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,719
IANTO PANTS
(Ssh!)

425
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,959
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

426
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,519
Where is it?
Quick, please! Turn it off!

427
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,239
Turn it off!

428
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,719
All right, lover,
it's the man of your dreams!

429
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:31,479
I've had a couple of beers with
Daf and we're off for a curry,
so can you video Wife Swap?

430
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,199
Don't you touch her!

431
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,159
LISA SCREAMS

432
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,440
What the hell was that?

433
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,800
What? Snogging me!

434
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,160
Last kiss for the condemned man!

435
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,639
Little embarrassing given
we haven't been killed.

436
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,800
What?! It's not like I fancy you or
anything. I was on top of you.

437
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
I could feel your hard-on.

438
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,600
Yeah, well,
you didn't exactly struggle, did you?

439
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,199
It was kill or be killed.

440
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,199
Owen's right. There was no choice.

441
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,519
Ianto, move! Get out!

442
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,279
GET OUT I SAID! MOVE! MOVE!

443
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,159
You should be dead.

444
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,480
I'm the stubborn type.

445
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,679
Get behind me!

446
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,360
357, 357, come on!

447
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,399
That's right. Stay back.

448
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:54,000
This'll at least give you heartburn.

449
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,959
The power will run out.

450
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,720
I can wait.  Jack, help her.

451
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,480
Give her a chance to surrender...

452
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,079
Have you not seen what she's done?

453
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,999
Let her stay in the cells!
We have to reverse the process!

454
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,720
I've told you! We're past that!

455
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,320
Hold him back! What are you gonna
do? Don't ask questions, just
get him on there and hold him!

456
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,480
What is that stuff?
Kind of a barbecue sauce.
It helps identify its food.

457
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,479
Help what identify its food?!

458
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:23,559
I'm sorry.

459
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:26,399
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

460
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,520
You'll kill her!

461
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,079
Let me go! Let me help her!

462
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
Yes!

463
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,040
Hold him still!

464
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,719
NO!

465
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,599
Call it off her! You can do that!

466
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
Have some fucking mercy!

467
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,080
NO-O-O!

468
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,480
It worked!

469
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,639
What happened to...? No.

470
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,239
You could have saved her! Argh!

471
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,719
You're worse than anything
locked up down there!

472
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,559
One day,
I'll have the chance to save you...

473
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,840
and I'll watch you suffer and die.

474
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,119
It was the only thing
that would stop her!

475
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,000
Listen, when I was at reception, I
managed to trip the lockdown timer.

476
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,879
The power should be coming back
on any second. We can get back in.

477
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,680
Ianto!

478
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,679
Pizza!

479
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,799
DOOR BUZZES

480
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,039
Ianto?

481
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,839
Bloody hell!

482
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,639
Ianto? D'you want these or not?

483
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,839
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

484
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,519
Ianto! Stop!
She can't have survived that attack.

485
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,759
I used my initiative! I'm sorry!
When I want you to think for
yourself, I'll tell you.

486
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:15,879
Maybe if you'd told me
your plan, I wouldn't have done it!
Ianto, don't be stupid!

487
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:19,479
I've nothing left to lose. There's
always something left to lose.

488
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:21,119
I'm going back in to save her.

489
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,000
Anybody tries to stop me, I'll
shoot them. Ianto, put the gun...

490
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,079
You make a threat like that,
you better be prepared
to follow it through.

491
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,279
See, you disobey me now...

492
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:44,679
I really will shoot you. Get off me!
You wanna go back in there?

493
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,480
You go in to finish the job.

494
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,639
If she's still alive,

495
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,159
you execute her.

496
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,680
No way. You brought this down on us.

497
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,079
You hid her.
You hid yourself from us.

498
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:06,119
Now it's time for you
to stand as part of the team.

499
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,360
Jack... The girl you loved has gone.

500
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,199
Your loyalty is to us now.

501
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:17,040
You can't order me to do that.

502
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,199
You execute her or
I'll execute you both!

503
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,359
I won't do it. You can't make me.

504
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,479
You like to think you're a hero.

505
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:28,479
But you're the
biggest monster of all.

506
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm giving you ten minutes.

507
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,240
Then we're coming in.

508
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,200
Pick it up.

509
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,439
How can you ask him...?
I don't need your opinion!

510
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,080
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

511
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:33,999
Lisa!

512
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,199
Ianto...

513
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,680
Ianto, it's me. It's Lisa.

514
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm human again.

515
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,399
You fought so hard for me, I had
to hold on for you, so I took this
body and transplanted the brain.

516
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,759
You're not Lisa.
You always said you didn't love
me for what I looked like.

517
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,480
Last time you said that,
it was a Saturday.

518
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,880
We were hungover.

519
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,040
You made cheese toasties, and
moaned I hadn't descaled my kettle.

520
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,759
That night, we camped
on a beach in Brittany.

521
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,959
It got so freezing we wore our
coats and shared one sleeping bag.

522
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,599
When we woke up the next morning,
a dog was pissing on our tent.

523
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,080
Hold me, Ianto.

524
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,599
I need you to hold me.

525
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,559
I need you to tell me
it's all right.

526
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,000
HE CRIES

527
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,800
GUN CLICKS

528
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,800
What are you doing?

529
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,600
Ianto, it's me!

530
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,359
You wouldn't shoot me.

531
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,839
I did this for you!

532
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,359
I'm sorry.

533
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,879
I'm sorry.

534
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,839
Lisa!

535
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:17,920
We can be upgraded together.

536
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,519
ALARM BLARES

537
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,119
You'd never have shot him.
Not really.

538
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,120
Wouldn't I? Would you have shot
me if I'd gone to stand by him?

539
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,479
But you didn't.
If I had, though. But you didn't.

540
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,600
Will he stay?

541
00:46:56,839 --> 00:46:58,800
All that deception.

542
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,839
Because he couldn't
bear to live without her.

543
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,840
So have you ever loved anyone
that much?

544
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:19,920
When she had hold of you, I thought,
just for a moment, I thought
maybe you could die after all.

545
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,720
Wanna know a secret?

546
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,199
So did I.

547
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:34,040
And just for a second there,
I felt so...alive.

548
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,080
Are you kidding me?

549
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,839
That's him, we have to find him
before all hell let's loose.

550
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,520
It's little girls, their little
bodies. No-one can hurt me.

551
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,840
They protect their own,
their chosen ones.

552
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,760
Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?

553
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,719
Nothing can.

554
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,399
She was beautiful,
I loved her at first sight.

555
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,120
It's gone crazy.

556
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,280
No!
This means these creatures

557
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,599
can invade my life whenever they
feel like it and I am scared, Jack.

558
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,920
For the sake of the world,
this is our only chance!
