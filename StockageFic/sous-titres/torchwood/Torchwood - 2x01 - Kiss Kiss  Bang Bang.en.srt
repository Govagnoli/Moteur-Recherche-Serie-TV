00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:55,749
'Scuse me,

2
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:58,719
have you seen a blowfish
driving a sports car?

3
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,410
Thank you!

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,646
Bloody Torchwood!

5
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:11,184
<i>Species not on record,</i>

6
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,092
DNA-type says some sort of land fish.

7
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,730
All I'm saying is, you are speeding
and there are children.

8
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:18,626
Kids out at midnight,
they've got it coming.

9
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,708
Detecting high levels of algae.

10
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,431
Who's afraid of the big scary fish?

11
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,061
Big fish with a gun.

12
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,813
- Special weapons?
- Not that I can see.

13
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,112
Do we need special weapons?

14
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,571
What are we gonna
do when we catch it?

15
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:31,335
- Jack would know.
- Well, ]ack's not here, is he?

16
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:34,385
]ack's disappeared!
Fat lot of good jack is!

17
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:38,673
Blowfish!!

18
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:40,764
Hold on!

19
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,022
- Hold the wheel.
- Don't you dare, Owen!

20
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,127
Hold the wheel!

21
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,568
Right, got it.

22
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:32,821
Where is it, where's it gone?

23
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,023
Go! Go! Go!

24
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,711
Gwen, go left, Tosh go right,
Ianto take centre.

25
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,885
Positions!

26
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,543
Massive levels of adrenalin.

27
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:54,471
Mixed with approximately
three grams of cocaine.

28
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:55,645
This fish is wired.

29
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:58,107
So, this is Team Torchwood.

30
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,589
The teacher's pets.

31
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:01,324
But teacher's gone, hasn't he?

32
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,351
Leaving the kiddy-kids all alone.

33
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,400
And look at you,

34
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:06,792
trying so hard to be all grown up.

35
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,813
The Doctor,
with his hands full of blood.

36
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:13,182
The CMM,
with her oh-so-beating heart.

37
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,895
The Technician,
with her cold devices.

38
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:20,258
Which leaves me, with the Office Boy,
promoted beyond his measure.

39
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:23,082
All of you,
lost without your master.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,963
All of you,
pretending to be so brave.

41
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,005
All of you, so scared.

42
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,803
Ha ha ha!

43
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,541
So, what about it, minion?

44
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,709
Can you do it?
How good are you?

45
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,611
How sharp is your aim?

46
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,709
What if you kill her?

47
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,060
What if I kill her first?

48
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,279
Can you shoot, before I do?

49
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,635
Can you?

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,055
Dare you?

51
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:49,775
Would you?

52
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,569
Won't you?

53
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:00,954
Hey kids.

54
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,915
Did you miss me?

<i>Are you sure no more
like him came through?</i>

59
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,378
Cross-referencing with the
rift activity monitor,

60
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,596
doesn't look like it.

61
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,511
The car's impounded,  I'll get it
back to the owner in the morning.

62
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:25,427
- How you doing?
- Bio-profile's on screen.

63
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:28,210
Nothing in his genetic make-up
to contaminate the city.

64
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,745
Ok, Tosh, can you add that
to the species database?

65
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:31,585
- Ianto?
- Hello!

66
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,515
Sorry, can you deal with
the body when it's cold?

67
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,193
My pleasure and I'll make sushi.

68
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,796
No, the morgue and
I'll do fine, thank you.

69
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,069
Got pretty organised without me.

70
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,272
Yeah, well we had to.

71
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,614
I Did you decorate in here?

72
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,167
You left us, Jack!

73
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,171
- I know. I'm sorry.
- We knew nothing, Jack.

74
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:52,611
Where were you?

75
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,316
I found my Doctor.

76
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,610
- Did he fix you?
- What's to fix?

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,337
You don't mess with
this level of perfection!

78
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:05,778
Are you going back to him?

79
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,058
I came back for you.

80
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:11,880
All of you.

81
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:16,677
Rift activity!

82
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,905
<i>Get off, I didn't do it.</i>

83
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,352
<i>Please, leave me alone.</i>

84
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,247
<i>Duh...</i>

85
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,610
Help me!

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,345
Come any closer and
I'll open up his neck!

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,813
- Fine!
- What?!

88
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,338
Which artery do you normally sever?

89
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,948
- No.
- I'm not bluffing!

90
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,410
Well, see now you've
given yourself away.

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,039
Only someone who's bluffing
ever says they're not.

92
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:12,850
Oh, God!

93
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,130
Shit! Please, please stop!

94
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:17,525
Well...

95
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:18,937
No.

96
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:25,423
He's dead.

97
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,927
Please...

98
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,137
I...

99
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,204
was never here.

100
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:38,932
Go.

101
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,589
Thirsty now.

102
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:03,156
All right!

103
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:04,722
Now...

104
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,565
You... go.

105
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,838
You go.

106
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:10,097
You go.

107
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,041
You stay.

108
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,852
Go.

109
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:13,677
Go.

110
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:14,768
Go.

111
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:15,573
Stay.

112
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,314
Go.

113
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:16,804
Go.

114
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,237
Go.

115
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:17,699
Go.

116
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:18,272
Go.

117
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:18,916
Oh...

118
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,552
Stay, stay, stay.

119
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,293
Go.

120
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:21,699
Go.

121
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:22,077
Go.

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,566
Go.

123
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:22,944
Go.

124
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,712
The rest of you, go.

125
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll take one of everything.

126
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,285
Any questions?

127
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:31,655
All right, mate,
let's take it outside.

128
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,550
Oh.

129
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:34,438
Did I mention I'm armed?

130
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,673
Ha ha ha ha ha!

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,245
Fragments of rift energy, around
the neck, arm and shoulders.

132
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,057
He was grabbed... and pushed.

133
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,877
Explains the residual energy cluster

134
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:04,444
How did you ever manage without me?

135
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,362
So, there's a killer on the loose.

136
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,601
Bipedal, maybe humanoid.

137
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,506
Any other alien tech involved, Tosh?

138
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,737
No readings to suggest that.

139
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:12,821
Ok, let's get back and see what
we can piece together.

140
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:13,954
Technology gain you?

141
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,688
I was hoping for a power struggle,

142
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,719
resolved by some naked wrestling.

143
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,838
Thank you, Andy.

144
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,698
You can let SOCO in now, they can
eliminate us from whatever they want.

145
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,168
This another one of your spooky-dos?

146
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,840
Not yet, but I'll let you know.

147
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,749
"Thanks, Andy.
You've been very helpful."

148
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,199
Don't mention it, Gwen.

149
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,947
Whoa, that never beeps.

150
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,485
That's what I was thinking.

151
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,332
<i>I can't believe I got
the answer machine!</i>

152
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,542
<i>What can you be doing that's
more important than me?</i>

153
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:49,875
<i>Anyway, you've probably traced
the energy shift, found the body.</i>

154
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,738
<i>All me, sorry about the mess.</i>

155
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,207
<i>Bill me for the clean-up.</i>

156
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,183
<i>Now, drinks!</i>

157
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,782
<i>Retrolock the transmission coordinates,
that's where I am.</i>

158
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,016
<i>And hurry up, work to do!</i>

159
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:03,149
<i>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you're my only hope!</i>

160
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,941
Stay here. Don't come after me.

161
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,703
- Who was that?
- Stay here.

162
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,060
Hey, Jack! Wait!

163
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,876
See that! He swans back in
and then he shuts us right out.

164
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,638
- I'm not having this.
- I can track him.

165
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,582
Taxi!

Tell the police we're dealing with it.

178
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,691
Ok, so, who the hell was
the bloke in the hologram?

179
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,656
Jack recognised him.

180
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:14,817
Why didn't he let us go with him?

181
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:18,551
It's typical Jack, he disappears,
he comes back, then he runs away again.

182
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,567
We don't even know his real name.

183
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:21,854
Or which time he comes from.

184
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,895
He's supposed to be our boss,
we know nothing about him.

185
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,518
It drives me crazy!

186
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,361
It is more fun when
he's around, though.

187
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:31,675
- Yeah.
- Definitely!

188
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:32,333
Yeah, it is!

189
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,232
- You're putting on weight?
- You're losing your hair?

190
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:43,134
What are you wearing?

191
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,924
Captain Jack Harkness,
note the stripes.

192
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,826
Captain John Hart,
note the sarcasm.

193
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,446
I worked my way up
through the ranks.

194
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,208
I bet the ranks were very grateful.

195
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:51,859
I need a drink.

196
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,293
I thought you'd never ask.

197
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,666
So, how was rehab?

198
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,205
Rehabs. Plural.

199
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,019
- Drink, drugs, sex and...
- Murder.

200
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:17,250
Ha ha!
You went to murder rehab?

201
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:18,550
I know, ridiculous.

202
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,858
The odd kill, who does it hurt?

203
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:22,512
You clean now?

204
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:24,456
Kicked everything.
Living like a priest.

205
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,121
So, how's the Time Agency?

206
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:31,841
You didn't hear?

207
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:33,986
Shut down.

208
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:38,084
You're kidding.

209
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:41,468
No. There's only seven of us left now.

210
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:43,454
Wow.

211
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,499
It's good to see you.

212
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,667
It was never the same without you.

213
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,065
You need to go.

214
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,807
I don't want you on my territory.

215
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:55,647
What?

216
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,208
Time was, you couldn't get enough
of me on your "territory".

217
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,222
All right, everybody out!

218
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,114
Everything all right, Jack?

219
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,582
It's ok, ok, ok.

220
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:15,533
You've got a team!
How sweet!

221
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,813
Oh, pretty little friends!

222
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,048
No blonde, though.
You need a blonde.

223
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,069
- God, he's worse than Jack.
- Oh, do you have a team name?

224
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,796
I love team names, go on!

225
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:25,903
Torchwood.

226
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,220
Oh. Not Excalibur?

227
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,101
Blizzard? Bikini Cops? No?

228
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,325
Torchwood. Oh, dear.

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,434
Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones,
Toshiko Sato, Owen Harper,

230
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,141
- meet...
- Captain John Hart.

231
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:43,015
- We go back.
- Excuse me. We more than go back.

232
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:43,956
We were partners.

233
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,900
- In what way?
- In every way.

234
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,013
And then some.

235
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:47,895
It was two weeks.

236
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:50,650
Except that two weeks was
trapped in a time loop,

237
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,496
so we were together for five years,

238
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:53,727
it was like having a wife.

239
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,776
- You were the wife.
- YOU were the wife.

240
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:58,504
- No, YOU were the wife.
- Oh, but I was a good wife.

241
00:13:58,728 --> 00:13:59,693
I bet you were.

242
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,175
What?

243
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:03,588
Don't pretend you
haven't noticed, he's cute.

244
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:04,763
They're just shy.

245
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:05,980
What are you doing here?

246
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,239
I was wondering when I we'd get to that.

247
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:13,098
- That's the same as yours.
- A little smaller.

248
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,560
But lasts much longer.

249
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,217
Get two Time Agents
in the same room together,

250
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,994
it's always about the
size of the wrist strap.

251
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:22,190
Yes, sorry, what's a Time Agent?

252
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,812
What, he's never told
you about his past?

253
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,973
No, he hasn't.

254
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:26,931
Anyway...

255
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,003
I'm working with this woman,

256
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,709
beautiful,

257
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:37,765
clever, sexy, yadda yadda yadda,
and we both get shot.

258
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,779
And as she's dying, she begs me.

259
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,744
She tells me about these radiation
cluster bombs she'd been working on.

260
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,184
I don't like the sound of that.

261
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,569
Three canisters,

262
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,604
contents beyond toxic,
swallowed up in a riftstorm.

263
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:50,604
- And ended up here.
- Bingo.

264
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,959
That's the downside of your city being
built on a rift in space and time.

265
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:56,029
Now, left to their own devices,

266
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,863
the radiation will break
down the canisters

267
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,241
and then infect your people and planet.

268
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:02,185
They need to be neutralised.

269
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,795
What do you get out of this?

270
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,949
Dying woman's wish.

271
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:11,376
Now, there's only one problem.

272
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:12,732
I don't know where they are.

273
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,920
I Hoping local knowledge might help.

274
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,011
When we get back to the Hub,

275
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:18,412
I can run a citywide scan
on radiation surges

276
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:21,726
and cross reference that with the
rift activity during that time span.

277
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:23,810
What are you,
the brains and the beauty?

278
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,090
You see, together it's an easy job.

279
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:27,443
We do this,

280
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,241
you get of here when its finished.
Right away.

281
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:32,282
Does this mean I get to see your house?

282
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,802
You live in a sculpture?

283
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,928
Could you be any more pretentious?

284
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:43,641
Get on.

285
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,910
So, your team not allowed in this way?

286
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,986
This is the entrance for tourists.

287
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,847
I remember the last time you said that.

288
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,140
Where the hell...

289
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,704
It's roomy,

290
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:05,214
I'll give you that.

291
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:11,273
Your taste in interior design
hasn't got any better, though.

292
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,441
What is this, sewer chic?

293
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,180
Weapons.

294
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:38,137
And the rest.

295
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,612
Oh, you know me,
I'm a two-weapon man.

296
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,068
One pistol strapped to each leg,

297
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,830
laser knife beneath left elbow,

298
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,389
17 small explosive charges
in the lining of his coat.

299
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:48,886
I Slipped my mind.

300
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,065
He's a compulsive liar!
Why is he in the building?

301
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,743
There's a tiny 1% chance,

302
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,813
he's breaking a habit of a lifetime,
and telling the truth.

303
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,603
Which means this city is in danger.

304
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,603
What did he mean by a Time Agent?

305
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:02,869
You've never mentioned it.

306
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:03,984
That was in the past.

307
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh, here we go again.

308
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,606
You know everything about me, Jack.
Why d'you keep shutting me out?

309
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,109
Here and now,
that's what's important.

310
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,934
The work we do, the person I am now.

311
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,614
- That's what I'm proud of.
- Then why did you desert us?

312
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:24,715
Where did you go?

313
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,603
No, no, come on, where did you go?
Tell me.

314
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:30,064
Talk to me.

315
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,679
I have died so many times.

316
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,486
Been dragged back into life,

317
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,731
like being hauled over broken glass.

318
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,912
I saw the end of the world.

319
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,525
- How?
- Doesn't matter now.

320
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:53,112
But after it was all over...

321
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,902
...I knew I belong here.

322
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,779
What kept me fighting was the
thought of coming home to you.

323
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:11,995
- What's this?
- TMS.

324
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:14,009
That's an engagement ring, that is.

325
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,261
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

326
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,484
Rhys asked.

327
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,428
When you were away.

328
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,463
Wow! Gwen Cooper getting married.

329
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:29,984
Down on one knee?

330
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,159
He tried to, he had a twinge in his
back and had to lie on the settee,

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,333
and he popped the question.

332
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,697
- And you said yes.
- Well, no-one else will have me.

333
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,633
Good for you.

334
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:55,280
- We should get back to work.
- Mm-hm.

335
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:02,049
Seven hours ago we logged
a minor surge in rift energy,

336
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:03,406
across three locations.

337
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,623
Six of us, three locations, simple.
Two people per canister.

338
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,154
Excuse me, I give the orders.

339
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,832
Well, give some, big boy!

340
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,087
John's right. Sorry, erm,
d'you prefer John, or Captain?

341
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:16,052
With eyes like yours,
call me Vera, I won't complain.

342
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:19,436
Tosh and Owen, take the north.
Ianto and jack go west.

343
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,815
Me and Vera'll take the docks.

344
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:22,913
Excuse me, not to repeat myself.

345
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:24,325
Got a problem with this, Jack?

346
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:29,470
Not at all.

347
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:33,176
Now, given the canisters are
radioactive, don't open them, eh?

348
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:34,659
Let's go, guys.

349
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,876
Gwen, I need a word.

350
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,885
Oh, can I watch?

351
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,248
He's gonna give you all the
dos and don'ts. I love it.

352
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,003
She'll be with you in a second.

353
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:49,899
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,263
If I can get him talking, flirt a bit,

355
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:53,745
he might drop his guard.

356
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,829
I can find out what he's really upto.

357
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,451
- OK, clever.
- Thank you.

358
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:59,405
But dangerous, leave it to me.

359
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,105
I led the team while you were
away, Jack. I can handle this.

360
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:06,072
He knows you too well,
he'll never tell you the truth.

361
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,107
Three rules.

362
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,296
One: don't believe anything he says.

363
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,821
Two: always keep him in front of you.

364
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,037
And three:

365
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,625
under no circumstances let him kiss you.

366
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,911
As if I would!

367
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:20,710
Has he gone to  the no-kissing rule yet?

368
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:23,564
<i>He only invented that because
he wants me all to himself.</i>

369
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,648
Keep infront.

370
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:35,564
Nothing.

371
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,159
Are you sure this is the right spot?

372
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,718
Yeah. But containers
get shifted all the time.

373
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,718
This could take days.

374
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,225
So, that woman,

375
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,749
the one with the canister,

376
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,442
how did you get to know her again?

377
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:52,470
We were in love.

378
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,049
Oh.

379
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:56,972
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,098
Did they catch the person who shot her?

381
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:04,491
Do we have to talk about this?

382
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:06,085
No, no, of course not.

383
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,272
Don't mind me.

384
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,082
- Shouldn't you be asleep?
- I got it!

385
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:23,243
<i>Sorry?</i>

386
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:25,327
Manager at Hanovoods!

387
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,725
<i>The letter was on the mat!</i>

388
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,292
I got the bloody job!

389
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:30,641
Oh, my God! Rhys, that is fantastic!

390
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,196
Baby, you're fantastic too.

391
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,609
Yeah, just there!

392
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,812
- Who's that?
- It's some...

393
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:37,784
idiot I work with that's all.

394
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,469
<i>I don't suppose there's any chance
of me seeing you before breakfast?</i>

395
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,855
It looks like it's gonna be an
all-nighter. So, get yourself to bed.

396
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:47,785
I am so proud of you.

397
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:48,604
<i>I love you.</i>

398
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,422
Yeah, well, I love you more.

399
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:57,642
John?

400
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,397
John?

401
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,220
John!

402
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,136
- John!!
- Worried you'd lost me?

403
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,935
Whoa. Little bit jumpy there?

404
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,418
Keep in front of me, OK?

405
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,802
God, you're so untrusting.

406
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,261
But with your boss it's probably wise.

407
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,289
Yeah, I trust him just fine,
thank you.

408
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:31,423
Once a conman, always a conman.

409
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:32,458
What do you mean by that?

410
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:37,696
Look, just don't rely on him, Gwen.

411
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,186
There's a lot about him you don't know.

412
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:43,999
Fancy a peek?

413
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:49,873
Aha!

414
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,299
Is that it?

415
00:22:58,887 --> 00:22:59,992
What are you doing?!

416
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:02,524
Get off me!

417
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:04,468
Celebrating,

418
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:05,475
that's all.

419
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,498
God, the 21st century is so frigid!

420
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,477
What've you done?

421
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,106
Don't get up.

422
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:14,246
I mean, you can't anyway.

423
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:18,993
Paralysing lip gloss.

424
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,769
I think it might have even been
Jack taught me that trick.

425
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,056
Just one problem,

426
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,923
if you're not found in two hours,

427
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:29,419
your major organs will go into shutdown.

428
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:30,748
Thanks.

429
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:35,754
<i>You gonna be OK in here without me?</i>

430
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:41,180
He won't stay with you.

431
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,473
He and I shared something.

432
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,392
No bulbs.

433
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:25,623
No, cos that would only be helpful.

434
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,284
Oh, great, how are we gonna find
a canister in all this tut?

435
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:34,893
What are we doing with our lives, Tosh?

436
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:36,347
I know,

437
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,539
we should be out having fun!

438
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:42,259
Bet you'd normally be out
on the pull, this time of night.

439
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,972
Oh, no, bollocks to that, Tosh.

440
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:47,909
Talk about diminishing returns.

441
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,755
Not with you.

442
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,454
Well, you know,

443
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,121
I've done all that, aren't I?

444
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:56,232
Where did it get me?

445
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,149
No, you know, I need...

446
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,883
a proper woman, you know.

447
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:03,253
Someone I've got something
in common with, you know.

448
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,071
Got anyone on the horizon?

449
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,158
Like you say,

450
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,647
difficult to meet anyone
I've got anything in common with.

451
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,626
What with the things we see.

452
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,361
You beauty!

453
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:21,794
Yes!

454
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:24,640
Job done!

455
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:26,654
Good work, team!

456
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:27,969
Where's Gwen?

457
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,007
Ah ah ah!

458
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,573
Gun on the floor.

459
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,335
Or I shoot her.

460
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:40,447
- Jack, where are you?
- I muted the comms system,

461
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:42,685
as soon as we left
the palace under the pavement.

462
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:45,997
I love my little wrist strap.

463
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:47,507
Now...

464
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:49,703
Phones.

465
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:57,064
You touch her again,
and I will kill you. OK?

466
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:09,435
The efficiency of a gun,
or the brutality of wood?

467
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,218
Yeah, look, stop toying with me
and get on with it.

468
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:17,391
Oh, yeah!

469
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:19,573
Loving that officy feel!

470
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:21,978
I always get excited in these places.

471
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,623
To me, they're exotic.

472
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,441
Office romances...

473
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:29,182
photocopying your butt...

474
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:31,378
or maybe not your butt,
although as we're here...

475
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:34,184
The rift was active at these coordinates

476
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:35,995
200 feet above ground.

477
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,338
That means this floor...

478
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,150
or the roof.

479
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,464
How are you, Ianto?

480
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:46,615
All the better for having.
You back, sir.

481
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,195
Can we maybe drop the sir, now?

482
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,307
While I was away, I was thinking...

483
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:53,944
Maybe we could,

484
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:56,314
when this is all done...

485
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:59,209
Dinner? A movie?

486
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,463
Are you asking me out on a date?

487
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:06,155
Interested?

488
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:08,071
Well...

489
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,299
As...

490
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:11,816
long as it's not in an office.

491
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,152
Some fetishes should
I be kept to you sir.

492
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,554
Looks like we're gonna have
to go through every drawer,

493
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,897
bin and plant pot.

494
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:21,380
Right. OK.

495
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,722
I'll do this floor, don't want
you getting overexcited,

496
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,526
and you take the roof.

497
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:30,205
You're good on roofs.

498
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:32,946
Jack?

499
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,778
Why are we helping him?

500
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,518
He's a reminder of my past.

501
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,875
I want him gone.

502
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:45,560
By the way...

503
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:48,189
- Was that a yes?
- Yes!

504
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:46,025
Into the lift, eye candy.

505
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:53,783
Your friends are bleeding,

506
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:55,559
and dying.

507
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:58,663
You barely have enough
time to save them.

508
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:01,704
Owen? Gwen?

509
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:02,879
What am I, a child?

510
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,173
It's primitive technology,
easily blocked,

511
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:06,585
you should be embarrassed.

512
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,033
And when you get to the bottom, run.

513
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:12,115
You look like a man who enjoys a
challenge, see if you can save them.

514
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,387
Come back up here,

515
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,625
I'll shoot on sight.

516
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:17,568
<i>Going down.</i>

517
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:18,394
Going down!

518
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,975
Yes, please.

519
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,133
Why are you doing this?

520
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:25,398
We're a cosmic joke, eye candy.

521
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,517
An accident of chemicals
and evolution.

522
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,923
The jokes, the sex,

523
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,346
just cover the fact that
nothing means anything.

524
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:36,367
And the only consolation, is money.

525
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,577
So run, Ianto Jones!

526
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:41,766
<i>Going down.</i>

527
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:44,510
<i>Doors closing.</i>

528
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,281
Rear of the Year,

529
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,505
5094.

530
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:01,833
Still looking good.

531
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:04,882
Cute boy, ringing to
warn you about me.

532
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,085
Canister.

533
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,854
- If you've harmed them...
- They're pretty, but stupid.

534
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,931
You used to have better taste.

535
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,082
Doesn't look like that from here.

536
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:13,677
Just give it here.

537
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,712
Radiation cluster bombs? Really?

538
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,628
Let's not get hung up on details.

539
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:21,775
Little embarrassing that
you needed help to find them.

540
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:24,682
A little humiliated
you fell for the scam.

541
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,612
Your dolly birds did all my leg I work.

542
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:27,782
Is that what you wanted?

543
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,838
What I want is for you
to come to your senses.

544
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,542
Join me, Jack.

545
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,157
Back in the old routine.
We'd be emperors.

546
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:40,563
How can you stay tied to one planet
when there's thousands of worlds,

547
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,339
sparkling with wonder?

548
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,087
We should be up there,

549
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,311
among the stars,

550
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:49,003
claiming them for our own.

551
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,003
Just like before.

552
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,122
- I can't.
- Why not?

553
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:57,199
What the hell is there
to keep you here?

554
00:30:58,364 --> 00:30:59,818
Come on.

555
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:02,000
The glitter of the galaxy.

556
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,140
The mischief we could make.

557
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:11,260
Y'know, you never really
mastered that temptation spiel.

558
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,302
It's not a spiel. It's fact.

559
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,323
Move on.

560
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:17,540
Here I am,

561
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:21,195
in a new life and you're still churning
out the same old tunes.

562
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:24,593
And sorry, but they don't play as well,
now you're looking a little older.

563
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:26,901
What are they, wrinkles
around your eyes?

564
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:27,810
Laugh lines.

565
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,392
Oh, hell of a good joke.

566
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:32,147
It's you I'm laughing at. Canister.

567
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,385
Whoops.

568
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,585
Ha ha ha!

569
00:31:39,494 --> 00:31:40,278
Whoops.

570
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:20,405
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

571
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,132
Why didn't he just kill us?

572
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,405
He got what he wanted.

573
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,608
But maybe he just underestimated us.

574
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,730
<i>Tosh! Owen!</i>

575
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,647
Ianto!

576
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:42,654
<i>Tosh!</i>

577
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:43,982
We're over here.

578
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,277
- What happened?
- Where's Gwen?

579
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:48,955
- Have you heard from Gwen?
- No.

580
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:08,549
Rehab...

581
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,137
didn't really work.

582
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,914
Front door key.

583
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:19,158
Thanks.

584
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,486
If she's in one of these, we'll
never find her, there's too many!

585
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,758
Just keep looking!

586
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,402
God, I need more painkillers!

587
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:49,438
I'll try her phone again.

588
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,573
Over here!

589
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:14,478
- She must've dropped it.
- Gwen!

590
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,359
Gwen!

591
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,975
Unless it's another of
Captain John's tricks.

592
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,247
- What're you doing?
- If Gwen used the phone here,

593
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:23,610
I can use the network to
triangulate the location.

594
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,261
where she answered her last call.

595
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,058
Got it!

596
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:35,464
This is where she made the call.

597
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:38,191
Open every container door!

598
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:43,225
<i>She's in here!</i>

599
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,330
Gwen, it's all right.

600
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:47,463
We're here with you.

601
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,518
What happened?
What's he done to her?

602
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,001
She's still breathing,

603
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,530
no discernible injuries.

604
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:55,118
- Tosh, let's get this thing started.
- Ianto, take a swab.

605
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,418
Right, pupils dilating,
she's still conscious.

606
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,059
Stay with us, darling.

607
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,498
He's poisoned her.

608
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:12,303
Anti-toxin kit now!

609
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,638
Gwen, hold on.

610
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,615
Had to go and steal a car.

611
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:42,369
Get yourself noticed.

612
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,019
Now...

613
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:06,815
OK...

614
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,195
Pretty and resilient.

615
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,572
Is that even fair?

616
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,125
Maybe you didn't realise.

617
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,908
You can beat, shoot, threaten,

618
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:22,411
and even poison us,
and we keep coming back.

619
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,274
Stronger every time.

620
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:27,645
Well, I think you ought to know,
your boss is splayed out on the...

621
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:31,561
Pavement.

622
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,928
Now that's impressive.

623
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,655
Seriously, you can earn...

624
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:41,662
a fortune in the Vegas galaxies
with an act like that.

625
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:43,606
Go on, how's it work?

626
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:46,669
I can't die.

627
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:47,578
Huh...

628
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,906
- No but, really...
- No, but really, you can't kill me.

629
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:53,915
No matter how many times you try.

630
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:55,328
I can't die.

631
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:56,740
Ever.

632
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:04,873
But what does it cost you?

633
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,796
Every time you have to drag yourself
back here, how does it feel?

634
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:10,321
All... that pain and trauma.

635
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:14,740
Plus, you're reborn into
this godforsaken mess.

636
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:15,828
I pity you.

637
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,716
These people,

638
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:21,786
this planet,

639
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:23,940
all the beauty you could never see.

640
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,218
That's what I come back for.

641
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:28,806
Well, goody on you.

642
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,148
What's in the canisters?

643
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:31,799
It's come clean time, Captain.

644
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:34,735
Yeah, all right.

645
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,343
That woman I told you about,

646
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,874
had herself an Arcadian diamond,

647
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,168
the rarest gem in the Damascene Cluster.

648
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,075
Just when I'd got my hands on her,

649
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:45,550
she only generates her
own personal riftstorm.

650
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,669
God, I hate technological geniuses.

651
00:37:50,082 --> 00:37:52,152
You said this was a
dying woman's request.

652
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:54,263
Yeah, she was dying. I shot her.

653
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:57,872
Thought my luck had changed
when I found it had ended up here.

654
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:00,790
So, I'm thinking 50/50?

655
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,846
Even split, good deal.

656
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,167
Or if anyone fancies an orgy?

657
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,360
- Open it.
- What, not even a please?

658
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,402
Don't your manners get
brought back to life too?

659
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:16,326
Now!

660
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,992
This should give us
the location of the diamond.

661
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:25,971
There she is.

662
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,139
The woman you murdered.

663
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:31,137
<i>You've travelled several
galaxies for this.</i>

664
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:32,445
<i>Well done.</i>

665
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:33,591
Thank you, gorgeous.

666
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:34,487
<i>Except...</i>

667
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,479
<i>There's no diamond.</i>

668
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:37,570
What?

669
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,962
<i>Only this.</i>

670
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,493
No, no, no.

671
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,957
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, ...

672
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,272
It's got to be a diamond.

673
00:38:48,273 --> 00:38:49,629
It's all about the diamond!

674
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,838
What the hell is that...

675
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,269
<i>It's an explosive device,</i>

676
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,248
<i>which will latch on to the
DNA of whoever killed me.</i>

677
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:05,159
<i>It'll detonate in ten minutes.</i>

678
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,348
<i>It can't be removed
without exploding, so...</i>

679
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,441
<i>don't bother trying.</i>

680
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:14,035
<i>Goodbye... lover.</i>

681
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,077
- No Wait.
- See you in hell!

682
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:17,630
She can't be serious. Ten minutes.

683
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,819
Get it of me!

684
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,735
Actually, nine minutes 50, 49, 48...
Always at the ready!

685
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,749
OK, how big is this
explosion likely to be, Jack?

686
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,258
That technology, that size... big.

687
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:29,174
So, we should get him out of the city.

688
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:30,265
Nine minutes 37.

689
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,097
You've got to help me! Please.

690
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:33,917
Why?

691
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:37,287
Let her go.

692
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,643
Jack, help me!

693
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:43,900
Get back!

694
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:47,140
What've you done?!

695
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,607
It's hypersteel, impermeable,

696
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,530
deadlock sealed.

697
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:53,663
No way to undo them.
Unless you have this key.

698
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:56,492
You are UNBELIEVABLE!

699
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:59,373
And yet, you still find
me strangely attractive.

700
00:39:59,537 --> 00:40:03,481
Now YOU had better find a solution
pronto or she'll be blown up with me!

701
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:05,104
Would shooting him stop the DNA trigger?

702
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:05,495
No.

703
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:07,587
So, what are we gonna do now, team?

704
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,098
The orgy's still on offer by the way.

705
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,321
- Especially now the cuffs are out.
- Nine minutes, four seconds.

706
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,328
Tosh, the rift predictor program,
have you perfected yet?

707
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,463
- Pretty much.
- What?

708
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:17,800
- Anything in the next few minutes?
- Gwen, no way.

709
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:18,961
What's she talking about?

710
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,227
If we're in the rift
when that disc explodes,

711
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:22,482
the city will be safe.

712
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,231
- How does that save us?
- It doesn't.

713
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,509
Eight 32, 31...

714
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,565
- You're bluffing.
- Try me.

715
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,605
The car park where he arrived.

716
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,871
The crack in the rift is
still active up there.

717
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:35,906
That's where we're going.

718
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,502
Somebody better
start doing something.

719
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,602
- Cut his hand off.
- That would activate the bomb.

720
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:40,864
Don't make me pull you!

721
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:42,598
Get up the stairs, now!

722
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:01,110
Five minutes 22.

723
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:03,145
I can't find the frequency
the device works on.

724
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:04,369
There's no chance of jamming it!

725
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,691
Where's Jack? He should be here.

726
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:07,453
What I've been saying
all along, unreliable.

727
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:08,133
Shut up!

728
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,686
I think I'm starting to see
what he likes about this place.

729
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,211
She's beautiful, he's stunning.

730
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:13,176
Don't you ever stop?

731
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,358
What five minutes to live,
you want me to behave.

732
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:17,400
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
- That's a poodle.

733
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:18,546
That's nice.

734
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:25,049
- This better work.
- Trust me, I'm an improviser.

735
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,400
Out!

736
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:34,952
- Ok.
- Get out!

737
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:36,493
I do love a woman who's rough.

738
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,598
51 seconds.

739
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:42,493
You're not really gonna
sacrifice yourself, are you?

740
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:43,360
45 seconds.

741
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:44,423
We have to go.

742
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:46,378
No! What about a last-minute rescue?

743
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,937
Why be on a team if you
don't get a last-minute rescue!

744
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,098
40 seconds.

745
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:50,946
Tell...

746
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,554
Tell Jack...

747
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:55,995
Tell Jack I...

748
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,895
<i>30 seconds.</i>

749
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:04,300
Now what's he doing?

750
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,565
Get off me!

751
00:42:12,103 --> 00:42:13,180
Owen, it's not working.

752
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,187
15 seconds!

753
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:15,600
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to confuse the disc!

754
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,096
- Why hasn't it worked?
- I don't know!

755
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:19,082
- 12 seconds!
- Jack, do something!

756
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:22,988
I've gotta go, Jack.

757
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:27,632
<i>Five...</i>

758
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:29,520
<i>Four...</i>

759
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:30,792
Three...

760
00:42:31,324 --> 00:42:31,863
<i>Two...</i>

761
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:32,940
<i>One!</i>

762
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:33,807
<i>Go!</i>

763
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,597
<i>Run!</i>

764
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,767
What the hell?

765
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Jack, what's going on?
Why's it gone dark?

766
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:55,592
The rift's reverted to
the moment he came through.

767
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:58,347
Everything's jumped back to
the beginning of the night.

768
00:42:58,664 --> 00:42:59,964
Like you were never here.

769
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:02,048
Now we've got to avoid ourselves, great!

770
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:03,587
It's a temporal displacement!

771
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:06,132
Makes your tongue tingle, doesn't it?
Lovely!

772
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:07,724
What was in the syringe?

773
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,024
Torchwood DNA.

774
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:09,780
What?

775
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:13,654
DNA samples from the five of us,
fused and injected into his heart.

776
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:16,157
Temporarily corrupted his DNA coding,

777
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:17,612
confused the disc.

778
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,001
You mean, there's a bit
of all of you inside of me?

779
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,001
Sweet goddesses, that's all I need.

780
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,288
Thank you, Owen.

781
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:25,176
- You're welcome.
- I want you gone.

782
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,763
Well, we've got to work out
a way to get these off first.

783
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,700
Actually...

784
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,161
Old Artesian trick.

785
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:40,574
Keep it in the lining of the throat.
Has a lot of uses.

786
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:44,490
- You had that all along?
- You were my passport to survival.

787
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:47,678
No hard feelings.

788
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,000
Well, not in that sense.

789
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:58,930
Remind me never to
get on your bad side.

790
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:10,792
Definitely bigger.

791
00:44:13,953 --> 00:44:15,659
- If you need a new team member...
- No.

792
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,920
- Really? I could...
- No.

793
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,458
- But...
- No.

794
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:23,494
Go now, and you can harness
the residual rift energy.

795
00:44:24,682 --> 00:44:26,514
- Listen...
- Goodbye.

796
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:27,801
OK.

797
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,737
Oh!

798
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:47,500
By the way...

799
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,332
I meant to tell you...

800
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:51,374
I found Gray.

801
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:02,600
Who's Gray?

802
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,154
It's nothing.

803
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:14,883
Let's get back to work.

804
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:26,680
<i>Have you never seen something so mad,
so extraordinary,</i>

805
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:30,330
<i>that just for one second you think that
there might be more out there?</i>

806
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:31,691
<i>Who are you people?</i>

807
00:45:32,054 --> 00:45:33,901
You're Torchwood, yes?

808
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:36,460
There's a rift through space
and time that runs through Cardiff,

809
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:39,888
stuff slips through from other times
and planets and we monitor it.

810
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:42,364
Stop wasting our time,
we know you're an alien.

811
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,893
There's no such thing as aliens.

812
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:49,511
Get away from me!

813
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,399
What is it, not spooky enough?

814
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:01,024
Honestly, it's just sex, sex,
sex with you people.

815
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:04,129
You have picked the
wrong girl to stalk, mate.

816
00:46:05,234 --> 00:46:06,395
When are the others coming?

817
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,556
<i>They're already here.</i>

818
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,818
<i>Oh my God!</i>

819
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:10,567
<i>Welcome to Planet Earth.</i>

820
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,154
- Who the hell is this?
- Miss Martha Jones.

821
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,078
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.

822
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:21,686
You really are something special.

823
00:46:22,022 --> 00:46:23,197
What's happening?

824
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:24,143
I don't know.

825
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,133
Toshiko, show me the city now.

826
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,336
They're everywhere.

827
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,377
<i>You're the only one who can stop this.</i>

828
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:32,160
<i>If you don't it's the end of everything.</i>

829
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:34,020
<i>You always remember what you killed.</i>

830
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:35,395
Alien Jack?

831
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,290
Nuclear warheads, ten of them.

832
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:39,912
It's all over.

833
00:46:40,094 --> 00:46:41,548
Let's all have sex.

834
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,150
And I thought the end of the
world couldn't get any worse.

835
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:47,996
<i>Come on what do we do?</i>

836
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:51,954
Just keep watching.
Keep doing what we do.
