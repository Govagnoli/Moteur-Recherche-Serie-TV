Government,beyond the police.

Fighting for the future
on behalf ofthe human race.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,020
The 21st century is when everything
changes,and Torchwood is ready.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,600
Come on!

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,940
No,I can't,I'm late as it is.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,040
Rhys!

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,600
******to work,aren't you?

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,550
0h,I'll take that as a 'yes',then.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,660
Having you to come home
to,that's the best bit.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,400
Class D artefacts.

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,500
- Tosh,I need you to run a full check.
- Sure.

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,030
Owen,you can help.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,620
Happy to. Adam,I know
how much you love audits.

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,840
- It's gotta be done.
- If you could...

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,000
Go through the reports,find out
when they came through the rift.

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,250
OK with that? I have been
for the last three years.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,890
You're late.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,850
Yes,Paris was lovely,thank you!

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,750
Who the hell is this?

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,890
just cos that's what I said to
you on your first day. ..remember?

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,330
..A nice strong coffee...

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,540
Sorry,couldn't resist.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,170
Come here,you! Good to see you.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,100

Adam,what are you doing
with your personnel file?

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,400
Nothing,just finished updating
details of rift activity.

31
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,440
Any idea when this came through?

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,740
It's got a low meson energy reading.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,450
No,I'll keep looking.

34
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,520
- A year ago today.
- Our first kiss.

35
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,980
You remembered.

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,260
You OK,Owen?

37
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,380
Er,yes,yes,don't worry about me.

38
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,860
No,no,it'sjust,er...

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,450
kissing in work...

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,240
I wasn't expecting it.

41
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,460
We'll celebrate tonight.

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,800
Save it.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,610
You OK?

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,160
Yeah,fine.

45
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,800
- Did you miss me?
- Were you gone?

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,730
just doing a quick check.

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,340
We had rift activity two days ago,but
nothing seems to have come through.

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,060
Apart from me!

49
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,740
What's that?

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,510
It's a screen-cleaner.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,250
I thought you might like it,um...

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,520
Do you like it?

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,460
just what I need. A small rodent
looking at me while I work.

54
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,430
Think I'll call it Owen.

55
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,120
HE SIGHS He's like a
puppy,bringing her sticks.

56
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,140
When's he gonna realise
he's got no chance?

57
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,720
Love's blind,apparently.

58
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,930
He's idolised her for years now.

59
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,000
0h,leave him alone.

60
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,820
I think it's sweet.

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,860
He's happy.

62
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,960
Sorry,I didn't mean to frighten you.

63
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,440
- How did you get in?
- With a key!

64
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
This isn't funny.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,350
Stay back,all right? Stay back!

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,440
Gwen,what's going on?

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,940
How do you know my name? Eh?

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
I know how to use this.

69
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,130
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You know who I am...

70
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,000
Fine,if you won't tell me fine.

71
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,150
You stay there. Don't you move.

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,810
jack...

73
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,900
Yeah,someone's broken into my flat.

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,790
He had a key. He knows my name.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,750
- Because I live here with you!
- Shut it! Shut it!

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,220
Can you hurry,jack? He's a nutter.

77
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,000
You have picked the
wrong girl to stalk,mate.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,970
- Gwen?
- Stay there!

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,910
Jack?

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,790
Gwen,it's us!

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,410
In here,jack!

82
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,490
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,020
Look,he's put photos of us up.

84
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,300
He must have done it while
I was at work. He's deluded!

85
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,050
Says he's my boyfriend.

86
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,510
He is. It's Rhys.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,950
I've never seen him before in my life!

88
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,620
- You've been with him for years.
- See!

89
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,020
Give me the gun,Gwen.

90
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,640
No!He grabbed me,jack.

91
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,880
Who knows what he was going to do?

92
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,280
How can you say that?!

93
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,500
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

94
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,060
0h,come on,I know what
kind of sick games you play.

95
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,900
Pills to make you forget... Are you
phasing me out so you can have her?

96
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,010
- Stay away from him.
- We're engaged!

97
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,080
I bought you the bloody
ring you're wearing!

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,260
Why don't you come with me to the Mont

99
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,120
- Who the hell are you?
- He's one of us.

100
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,750
We can check you. jack will
stay and take care of things.

101
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,170
OK.

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,690
Don't let him go. If he comes
after me again,I'll kill him.

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,030
Trust me,I didn't do this.

104
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,420
But whatever's happened...

105
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,370
we'll put it right.

106
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,630
Right,well,no signs of long-term
damage,as far as I can see.

107
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,380
Or alien intervention.

108
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,900
But,I must be missing something.

109
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm sorry,but it's a mystery to
me why you can't remember Rhys.

110
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,520
Is this really necessary?

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,980
She needs to remember.

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,020
HE SIGHS Where did you meet?

113
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,890
Er,college.

114
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,390
Fancied her from the moment I saw her.

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,370
Notjust her looks,you know,I
mean she is a looker,er. ..

116
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,640
'Tell me about your first kiss.

117
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,690
'Erm,in the supermarket.

118
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,700

I? 'Bloody garlic.

121
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,590

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Sort of. It's like I'm...

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,810
'I said,I wanted to do something else.'

124
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,720
I'm seeing what he's saying,but...

125
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,650
I don't remember how I felt.

126
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,380
Believe me when I tell you
that that is your fiance.

127
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,310
Your memory'sjust playing
tricks on you,that's all.

128
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,070
'She starts to laugh.

129
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,880
'She calls me Rhys the Rant 'and then
she kissed me,right there in the queue.'

130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,120
And I thought then,jack,I thought,'

131
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm going to marry this bloody
mad woman,'even if it kills me.'

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,210
BEEPING Worked out
what that thing is yet?

133
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,780
No joy yet.

134
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,010
But you should have a look at
the detail,Tosh. It's gorgeous.

135
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,350
0h,let me get that.

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,170
Have you managed to open it yet?

137
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,290
Er,no,sorry.

138
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,150
I'm not doing very well,am I?

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,250
It's gonna be a long night.

140
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,010
Yes,which is why I brought. ..

141
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,430
..some sandwiches!

142
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,170
One for you... And one for me.

143
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,300
Smoked salmon,that is
your favourite,isn't it?

144
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,300
How d'you know that?

145
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm gonna need a beer.

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
What,while we're working?!

147
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,260
0h,yeah,ofcourse.

148
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,340
Yeah,right,relax,kick
back,it's a good idea.

149
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,240
Er,not for me though,thanks!

150
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,130
Don't leave me,jack.

151
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,760
You'll be OK.

152
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,470
What was that all about?

153
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
Temporary amnesia. 0wen's
checking possible causes.

154
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Weevil sighting by the
sewer in Rockall Street.

Jack_ Jack;

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,450
- Can you see him?
- Who?

157
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,520
I'll drop you off and
check out the sighting.

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,190
I could come with you.

159
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,850
It's been a while since
we went hunting together.

160
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,840
I'll be fine on my own.

161
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,230
DOOR SH UTS Go on. Live a little.

162
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,770
HE SIGHS Well,as it's you.

163
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,040
Thank you.

164
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,010
Call it a celebration.

165
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,630
Oh,yes?

166
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,740
Adam and I have been
together for one year today.

167
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,840
Right,right.

168
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,830
A whole year.

169
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,030
My stomach still flips
when he touches me.

170
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,420
I've never known anything like it.

171
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,830
The two of us,we just fit.

172
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,320
D'you know what I mean?

173
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,280
Erm,not sure I do,no.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,010
Don't worry. You'll meet
the right girl one day.

175
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,130
Yeah. Tosh...

176
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
D'you really think I look like a rodent?

177
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,920
SHE LAUGHS Come on,we're going to
crack this box even if it kills us.

178
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,770
Come out,come out,wherever you are.

179
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,450
Giving me the runaround,huh?

180
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,780
You picked the wrong day,my friend.

181
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,870
SPLASHING Get out!

182
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,680
Get out,son.

183
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,950
Dad?

184
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,230
RUN!

185
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,710
Jack?

186
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,190
Was it down there? The Weevil?

187
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
No.

188
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,000
How did you get here?

189
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,090
I came with you,jack,remember?

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,110
Yeah,ofcourse.

191
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,550
Are you OK?

192
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,240
jack,what did you see?

193
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,450
My past.

194
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,130
- If what you say is true...
- It is.

195
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,390
We love each other.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,080
But how could I forget that?

197
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,630
Nothing in. I WAS going
to take you out for a meal.

198
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,550
Didn't want the weekend
to finish,I suppose.

199
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,090
jack,please. Talk to me.

200
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,830
What about the past?

201
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,400
Is it your childhood?

202
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,170
I've always been here for you,jack.

203
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,100
From the very beginning.

204
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,410
I'm the one you can confide in,remember?

205
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,140
It was meant to be buried.

206
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,830
I buried the memory over 150 years ago.

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,910
Why now?

208
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,110
Well,maybe it's time.

209
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,550
Maybe up until now,your
subconscious was protecting you.

210
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,020
But you can't block
out the past forever.

211
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,460
I can't afford to remember.

212
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,330
- jack,talk to me,please.
- Why?

213
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,760
I can help. Trust me.

214
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm not sure I should do this.

215
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,850
just tell me what you see.

216
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,360
I can help you. That's why I'm here.

217
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,670
Where are you,jack?

218
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,820
Boeshane Peninsula.

219
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,390
My home in the 51st century.

220
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,500
We lived under the threat of invasion.

221
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,400
They came without warning.

222
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,200
We thought they'd pass over
us,like they always did.

223
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,300
But they didn't.

224
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,000
- Not that day.
- Who?

225
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,930
The most horrible creatures
you could possibly imagine.

226
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,750
Their howls travelled before them.

227
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,500
Run! Take Gray. Keep him safe!

228
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,740
- Take Gray.
- Gray?

229
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,580
My little brother.

230
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,470
No,no,Dad. Come with us.

231
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,470
No,I've got to go get your mother. Run!

232
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,210
One minute,I was holding his hand.

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,460
I don't know when he let go.

234
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,920
Gray?

235
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,050
Gray?

236
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,130
Gray! Gray,where are you? Gray!

237
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,610
One minute,his hand was in
mine,I don't know when he let go.

238
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,930
I don't thinkl noticed,I thought
he was there,just behind me.

239
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,790
Gray!

240
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,800
I retraced my steps,hoping
that I'd see him again.

241
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,820
Did you find him?

242
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,760
Gray!

243
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,090
I ran all the way home.

244
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
Where are you? Gray!

245
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,390
jack,what did you find?

246
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,100
Dad?

247
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,660
No!

248
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,030
Can someone help? Please!

249
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,000
I searched for Gray for years.

250
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,340
I never found the body.

251
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,340
It wasn't your fault.

252
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,100
I let go of his hand!

253
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,310
It was the worst day of my life.

254
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,970
It's the last thing I want to remember.

255
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,150
So,according to the molecular breakdown,

256
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,180
this potentially alien complex
artefact is,in fact,made out of wood.

257
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,470
Well,perhaps it fell
in the crate by mistake.

258
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,710
Picked up meson energy
from the other stuff.

259
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,530
Yeah,right!

260
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,240
0h,yes,sorry,it's a stupid idea.

261
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,690
I thinkjack brought it in.

262
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,690
No,I'm sure Adam found it on
an excavation a few months back.

263
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,020
I'll have a look in the diary.

264
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,890
I like to log the interesting stuff.

265
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,450
You write about artefacts in your diary?

266
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,790
Among other things.

267
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,070
So,we are done for the night.

268
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,540
I guess.

269
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,410
Everything all right?

270
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,450
Yeah,just,Adam hasn't rung yet.

271
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,240
Sure he will.

272
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,760
I know I would,if it
was our anniversary.

273
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,600
I wouldn't disappear.

274
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,010
Infact,I would. . .cherish you.

275
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,910
Ah,Owen!

276
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,840
Yeah,no,no,really,really,Iwould.

277
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,260
Infact,I wouldn't let you
out of my sight,Tosh...

278
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,220
..because I love you.

279
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,240
What?

280
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,810
Yeah,there we are. I've
said it. I love you.

281
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,170
Yes,I always have,actually,ever
since we started working together,

282
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,670
and in fact,I actually ache for you.

283
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,090
When you're in the room,I want
to reach out and touch you and...

284
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,570
- Owen!
- No,no,no,

285
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,290
I can't keep this secret any more!

286
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,190
My mum said to me,'Seize the
day',and so I am seizing it,

287
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
and I've got so much
love to give you,Tosh,

288
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,100
and you won't know
that unless I tell you.

289
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,960
So here I am,telling
you that I love you.

290
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,450
You know I know there's
Adam,OK,but you know,I think...

291
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,430
In fact,I know that we
would be amazing together,

292
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,930
erm. ..if you would only
just give it a chance.

293
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,990
Oh,God.

294
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,700
Say something.

295
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,700
That is completely inappropriate.

296
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,320
- Pardon?
- What are you thinking of?

297
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,810
- I'm sorry,Ijust wanted you to know.
- How dare you! I'm with Adam.

298
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,540
And even if I wasn't. ..

299
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,430
you're not my type.

300
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,350
Never will be.

301
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
Maybe I should be on my own tonight.

302
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,680
No way. What if you forget who you are?

303
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,590
I know who I am.

304
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,770
It's not just you who's lost something.

305
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,210
MOBILE PHONE RINGS But you remember.

306
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,030
All you know about me.

307
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,150
You're my girl,my best friend.

308
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,210
Suddenly,all that's gone.

309
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,930
A stormer of a night!

310
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,990
What about her,mate?
Where's he going now?

311
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,830
He just walked off!
He knows I'm waiting.

312
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,810
0h,fine. I'll help myself,then!

313
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,180
Here you are. Keep the change.

314
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,090
Buy some spot cream!

315
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm not coming here
again. It's overpriced.

316
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,520
There's a ¬£1.50 charge on the cash
machine. It's a bloody disgrace.

317
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,210
GWEN LAUGHS Honestly. Kids these days.
Don't know the meaning of hard work.

318
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,330
- What?
- Rhys the Rant!

319
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,930
Always when you're
in a queue,or driving,

320
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,850
or when you're on the phone to one
of those automated phone thingies. ..

321
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,930
Hey,it's OK. It's OK.

322
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,030
SHE CRIES Come on,sweetheart.

323
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,540
What's wrong?

324
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,690
My
diary.--

325
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,850
You're not in it.

326
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,280
Everyone else is.

327
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,690
Why would I leave you out
when you've been here so long?

328
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,770
Like I'm remembering a
man who doesn't exist.

329
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,620
What are you?

330
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,590
Cross me,and I will fill
you full of fake memorie

331
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,630
until your head is on
fire,because that's howl exist.

332
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,890
Gwen.

333
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,050
What did you do to her?

334
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,220
Memory is a very delicate thing.

335
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,820
Feeding myself in wiped
other memories out.

336
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,950
It's a side-effect of what I
have to do in order to survive.

337
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,110
jack has to know.

338
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,340
Remember this.

339
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,400
I know you didn't mean to kill her.

340
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,810
You just couldn't stop yourself.

341
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,400
Remember this.

342
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,710
I didn't do that.

343
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,970
0h,yes,you did,and she wasn't the first.

344
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,690
Please don't hurt me!

345
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,150
'Good old Ianto,loyal Ianto.

346
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,380
'Roaming the streets at night for bait.'

347
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,710
My. . .diary!

348
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
All human record is a lie.

349
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,500
You twist it into what
you want to believe.

350
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,370
But we know the rot in your heart.

351
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,650
You crave flesh.

352
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,300
No. Please.

353
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,690
Remember it.

354
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,540
Remember it. Remember it!

355
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,470
Remember it! Remember it!

356
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,160
I helped you dump the bodies.

357
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,430
It's me you call.

358
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,930
You know,I forgot what a rush
it is,feeding in the bad stuff.

359
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,780
Franklin? Franklin,wake up. Please!

360
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,370
Mom?

361
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,960
Where's Gray?

362
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,800
Where's Gray?

363
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,600
Where is he,son?

364
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,340
Where is he?

365
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,240
We were running so fast.

366
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,700
One moment,his hand was in mine...

367
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,360
No,not my little boy!

368
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,180
Not my little boy!

369
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,770
Why now?

370
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,380
Why now?

371
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,810
Anything?

372
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,900
It's still a bit of a
blur,but I'm getting there.

373
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,230
That's all we've got,really.

374
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,380
Memories.

375
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,990
That's what brought us to here.

376
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
To this point.

377
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,690
We found it before,we'll find it again.

378
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,260
You know,I,um,I always
worried that you'd. ..

379
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,290
..that you'd just
settled for me,you know.

380
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,040
Cos if you met me now,Gwen,with
all that goes on in your life,

381
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,430
could be that you
wouldn't look twice at me.

382
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,940
Don't say that.

383
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,980
- Do you remember that?
- No.

384
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,340
It felt like the first time.

385
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,380
But it was nice.

386
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,930
I like that.

387
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,700
I know.

388
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,530
Remind me some more.

389
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,790
What's wrong?

390
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,660
How far would you go for me?

391
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,100
I need to know.

392
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,570
Would you die for me?

393
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,410
Yes.

394
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,600
Jack;

395
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,060
Ianto.

396
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,970
What's wrong?

397
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,190
You'll have to put me in the vaults.

398
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,580
Lock me up.

399
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,360
I killed three girls.

400
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,110
Strangled them.

401
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,250
Stop kidding around!

402
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,320
I'm serious.

403
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,160
I murdered them,in cold blood.

404
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,830
I took their bodies,and...

405
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,300
You have to lock me away...

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,930
..before I turn on you.

407
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,970
None of you are safe.

408
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,780
Hey,hey,come here,come here.

409
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,750
What's happened to you?

410
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm a monster.

411
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,630
Best lie detector on the planet.

412
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,590
If something's untrue,the
light turns red.

413
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,550
Go.

414
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,780
MY"` ..hands on her throat.

415
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,630
And it felt so good.

416
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,270
Squeezing the life out of her.

417
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,300
It reads as truth.

418
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,300
I don't believe it.

419
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,880
OK,tell me about the second girl.

420
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,720
She tried to get away...

421
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,410
..but I was too quick.

422
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,490
Pleading. ..

423
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,210
And I... I didn't care.

424
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,760
Something in me wants to kill.

425
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,020
No. This is not you.

426
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,900
Something's changed you.

427
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,170
You're not a murderer.

428
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,560
I'm certain of it.

429
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,770
'All human record is a lie.

430
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,150
'You crave flesh.

431
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,110
'Remember this.'

432
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,830
A year ago today... you remembered.'

433
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,600
Do you remember that?

434
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,550
'Who the hell is this?'

435
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,970
'just cos that's what I said to
you on your first day,remember.'

436
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,410
JACK REWINDS 'Remember? Remember?'

437
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,920
Well,I came with you,jack,remember.

438
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,740
Remember,remember.

439
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,760
I can help you
- that's why I'm here.

440
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,660
'Remember this.'

441
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,230
Come here,come here,just look,look.

442
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
'Remember it.'

443
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,980
IANT0 SCREAMS 'Remember
it,remember it,remember it.

444
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,050
'Remember it.'

445
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,570
Where's Adam's blood sample?

446
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,210
Everything's in order here.

447
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,690
When was it last updated?

448
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,970
Um...2l‚Ä?hours ago.

449
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,300
Owen...

450
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,730
About last night,um,it
was selfish of me.

451
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,180
Owen,I think the world of you. ..

452
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,250
I know. I'm really sorry.

453
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,340
I don't want to
jeopardise our friendship.

454
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,730
The most important thing
is that you're happy.

455
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,590
Thank you.

456
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,310
Tosh... You are...

457
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,400
you are happy with Adam,aren't you?

458
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,640
Completely.

459
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,640
OK.

460
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,530
Hey,how are you today?

461
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,300
Um,things are coming back slowly.

462
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,010
Rhys thought I shouldn't
come into work but...

463
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,570
Hey,we'll look after you.

464
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,930
You just have to give yourself time.

465
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,770
COITIC 0|‚ÄôI,g|‚Ä?Up

466
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,810
THEY CHAT AND GIGGLE
Hey Ianto,come here.

467
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,270
You all right,mate?

468
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,680
Listen,I could murder a coffee.

469
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,810
Talk to me,Adam.

470
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,410
If that's even your name.

471
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,700
- What?
- What are you doing,jack?

472
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,170
He's not who you think he is.

473
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,730
He's been feeding himself
into our memories,by touch.

474
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,290
Is this some kind of sickjoke?

475
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,090
He didn't exist until two days ago.

476
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,980
Can somebody tell me
what's going on,please?

477
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,900
jack,we've known him for years.

478
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,190
- He is part ofthe team.
- No.

479
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,290
He just made you think that.

480
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,410
Come on,jack.

481
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Ah,you don't get to me like that.

482
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,450
jack,you know me.

483
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,090
You recruited me three years ago.

484
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,200
When I think of my team I see you there.

485
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,890
But I don't feel anything for you.

486
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,290
No pride,no warmth...

487
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,590
You,the one who I can confide
in,the one who unburied the dead.

488
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,240
jack,maybe you've forgotten
him. Like I did with Rhys?

489
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,910
I should have spotted it then.

490
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,220
That wasn't stress. That was him.

491
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,900
By making us think we know
him,he disturbs our real memories.

492
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,480
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

493
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,130
I'm taking him to the vaults.

494
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,740
-jack,this is ridiculous.
- No!

495
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,960
No!

496
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,910
- Tosh,that's not gonna help.
- It's fine.

497
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm just going to lock him up.

498
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,340
Let him go.

499
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,430
I'm not going to harm him.

500
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,530
Why should I believe you?

501
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,820
Tosh,Tosh,we can talk about this.

502
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,340
Drop the gun,jack.

503
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,930
Get off me!

504
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,600
This is what y0u've done to us. Move.

505
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,890
ADAM!!

506
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,340
Don't kill me. I had to become part
of your memories in order to survive.

507
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,700
I didn't mean any harm.

508
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,650
- You've changed us.
- For the better!

509
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,730
You didn't remember who you were.

510
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,360
I helped you.

511
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,160
Look at Owen,all his cynicism gone.

512
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,620
He's a different man now.

513
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,090
Selfless,happier.

514
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,510
And Toshiko,too -

515
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,620
she's never been this confident.

516
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,160
How did you come here?Why us?

517
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,640
All of you have such unique
memories,specially you,jack.

518
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,770
All those extraordinary
memories you hold -

519
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,890
some hidden,some absent.

520
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,370
Your singular mind.

521
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,110
That's what drew me here.

522
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,030
Good job. It's what we do best...

523
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
wipe out aliens.

524
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,020
You can't shoot me. You made me live.

525
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,470
And you always remember
what you killed...

526
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,480
don't you,jack?

527
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,280
Our memories define us.

528
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,550
Adam changed those memories...

529
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,730
changed who we are.

530
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,940
Now I have to help you all go
back,find a memory that defines you.

531
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,900
Rediscover who you are.

532
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,760
If I'm wrong,he'll still be
here when we've done this.

533
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:42,080
Let me take you back
to before we all met...

534
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,460
Feel around for anything
that makes you what you are...

535
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,140
..the hidden and the forgotten.

536
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,160
Tell me where you are.

537
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,910
'The college canteen...

538
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,850
'Rhys is sitting opposite
me,telling stupid jokes.'

539
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,340
RHYS: 'Where do you find a tortoise
with no legs? Where you left it.'

540
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,220
'It's my birthday. I'm ten.

541
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,790
'Mum spends the whole day screaming,'I
love you because you're my son '

542
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,710
'but that doesn't mean
I have to like you.' '

543
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,040
'Maths club,'

544
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,700
something so reliable about maths...

545
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,460
'always the right answer.'

546
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,900
'Meeting Lisa,'falling in
love,'never felt so alive.'

547
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,860
'I turn 16. She packs my bags.'

548
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,530
That is the nicest thing y0u've
done for me in years,Mother.

549
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,930
'Kissing him in the supermarket.'

550
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,850
The look on his face.

551
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,600
'My first flat.'

552
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,510
I don't have a flat-warming.

553
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,480
'There's no-one I want to invite.'

554
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,250
'Losing Lisa.'

555
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,700
Like the world had ended.

556
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,390
'The way he looks at me sometimes.

557
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,410
'As if he's scared of what
he feels for me,' I love him.

558
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,950
But not in the way I love you.

559
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,800
Take this.

560
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,990
'Knowing there has to be
more to life than this.'

561
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,070
'Knowing I'm special,'

562
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,020
waiting for someone to see it.

563
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,470
I saw it.

564
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,310
You save one life,100
lives but it's never enough.

565
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,520
Who'll save me?

566
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,430
I will.

567
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,620
'Coming here'

568
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,590
gave me meaning again.

569
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,510
You.

570
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,050
You each have a short-tern amnesia
pill. It'll make you forget Adam.

571
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,880
We have to wipe out the last
48 hours from our memories,

572
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,190
go back to who we were.

573
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,510
I'm going to lose so much.

574
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,890
None of it was real.

575
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,160
He loved me...

576
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,710
and I loved him.

577
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,910
It's no different from real memory.

578
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,880
He forced it on you.

579
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,080
You have to let it go.

580
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Goodbye,Adam.

581
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,340
just me left.

582
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,800
jack,I know what it's like not to exist.

583
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,950
Please don't send me back there.

584
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,760
I have to.

585
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,430
What are you going to do?

586
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,060
This will wipe out the past two days.

587
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,280
Well,you'll still keep the bad memories.

588
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,040
Because they were always yours.

589
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,190
But what about the good times,jack?

590
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,250
What about the last good
memory of you and your dad?

591
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,170
- It's lost.
- I can help you find it.

592
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,070
I can take you back there.

593
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,290
Before I die.

594
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,580
Why would you do that?

595
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:21,330
I was in the void for so long,the colours
of this world almost blinded me,jack.

596
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,760
It was so beautiful after the
darkness and the stench of fear.

597
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,920
You gave me that.

598
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,900
Let me do this for you.

599
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,390
Come on.

600
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,370
You want this.

601
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,720
It's early evening...

602
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,040
just me and Dad.

603
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,250
Oh,no,you don't!

604
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,570
JACK GIGGLES You're out!

605
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,880
You know,one day you won't want
to play with your old dad any more.

606
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,560
Never.

607
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,420
Are you there?

608
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,280
Yeah.

609
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,370
Me,Dad and...

610
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,870
- Dad! Mom said I could play too. ..
- Gray.

611
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,730
Hey,Gray!

612
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,790
- All right,son. One more.
- OK.

613
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,100
Whoa,I'll get it.

614
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,060
JACK LAUGHS I'm running for the ball!

615
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,160
Some other boy is there.

616
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,140
I don't know who.

617
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,470
- Can I play?
- Who are you?

618
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,860
- My name's Adam.
- Let me play.

619
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,730
Before it gets dark.

620
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,610
There's lots of room.

621
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,410
Hey,what are you doing?

622
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,250
Are you all right?

623
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,400
Ijust want to play.

624
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,230
He can play.

625
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,400
No!He doesn't belong here.

626
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,740
I don't want him playing with us.

627
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,740
I'm Adam.

628
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,930
Don't touch my dad.

629
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,140
Hey,easy!

630
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,510
Are you all right,Adam?

631
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,930
Yes,he just doesn't want to share.

632
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,200
Right,well,if you're going to
behave that way,we're going home.

633
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,740
- What?!
- Come on,Gray.

634
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,210
No,we don't leave yet.

635
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,740
We play some more,it gets dark,we
light a fire... Mum joins us.

636
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,180
Come on,son. I'll race you.

637
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,820
Race you!

638
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,740
Dad!

639
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,670
You did this. You spoilt it.

640
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,370
I made it happen.

641
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,530
Dad! Dad,I love you.

642
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,870
Dad,wait... Dad!!

643
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,350
I want the real memory back.

644
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Then let me live.

645
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:07,200
That box you found contains my last
good memory of you,your dad and Gray.

646
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,080
You see,I'm a part of it now

647
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,580
and I'll always live as
long as you remember it.

648
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,020
That's why you took me back.

649
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,200
Wasn't it lovely?

650
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,860
Playing in the sand,no-one
knowing what was ahead...

651
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,240
your dad laughing.

652
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,250
Gray,safe and happy.

653
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,390
I don't want to die!

654
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,470
You take that pill and you will
lose everything I've given you.

655
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,460
Wipe me out now and you will lose
all your memories of your father.

656
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,630
He will cease to have existed for you.

657
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,530
Goodbye,Adam.

658
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,930
Dad! Gray!

659
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,080
Come back! It wasn't like this!

660
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,790
Dad! Gray!

661
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,740
jack,how have we lost two days?

662
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,450
What d'you mean?

663
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,190
The last 48 hours.

664
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,630
None of us can remember a thing.

665
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,570
The system's blank,the
CCI‚ÄôV's been wiped.

666
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,410
What's been going on?

667
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,830
What've we been doing?

668
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,240
I don't know.

669
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,930
Great! That's two days of my
life that I'll never get back!

670
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,610
Looks like Toshiko got herself
a secret admirer,though.

671
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,910
0h,yeah?

672
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,950
To Tosh,love and apologies,Owen.

673
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,720
They're from you!

674
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,070
In your dreams,Tosh. I think
someone's winding you up,darling...

675
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,630
No,I don't do flowers...

676
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,400
..and I definitely don't do apologies.

677
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,410
Did you call?

678
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,410
Found your diary.

679
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,930
Yep,been looking for that.

680
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,220
And for the record...

681
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,950
measuring tapes never lie.

682
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,380
Yep?

683
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,340
Who's Adam?

684
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,940
Don't know.
