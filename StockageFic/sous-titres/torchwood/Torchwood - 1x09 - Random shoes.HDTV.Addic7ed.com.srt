1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,600
Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the Police.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Tracking down alien life on Earth,
arming the human race
against the future.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,839
The 21st century
is when everything changes.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,559
And you've got to be ready.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:25,560
This programme contains
some strong language.

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:35,640
The speed of light is
299,792,458 metres per second.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,000
Pain travels through the body
at 350 feet per second.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Even a sneeze can reach 100mph.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,639
And as for life,

10
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,919
well, that just bloody whizzes by.

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
So then, this is me,

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
Eugene Jones.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,720
Hey, Gwen. Jack! Er, Tosh...

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
The guys at the rope
just let me through so...
I'd say at least 50 miles per hour.

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,280
Travelled on the bonnet, bounced,
maybe rolled, smashed his face
on the road.

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Hey? Um, excuse me,
but that looks a lot like me.

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,679
He couldn't even cross the road
without messing it up.

18
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,600
No bag - nothing.
I mean, what was he doing here?

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,919
Perhaps he was hit deliberately...
Maybe he really did have
something important. Like what?

20
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:01,519
I don't know. He was always trying
to talk to us, show us stuff.
Perhaps we shouldn't have been so...

21
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,320
Gwen, I think it's just
an ordinary RTA. Guys?

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,680
It was a red car. There's red paint
under his fingernails. Am I dead?

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,720
Am I dead?

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,199
Am I dead?

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,119
PHONE RINGS

26
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,320
Yes? Hello, love. I've just been
to the shops and forgot tea-bags.

27
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,840
Hello...?

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,359
Eugene? Hi, Mrs Jones.

29
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,039
Something's happened.
We need to talk to you.

30
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,480
What happened? How did I end up here?

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
I mean, I'm dead, but I'm not dead.

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,840
So... Shit!

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,080
So, what? Am I a ghost or a zombie?

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,880
Oh, God. Right, calm.

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,479
Yeah? Stick with the team.

36
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,360
What? You're driving.

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,920
This is Torchwood,
it's going to be OK.

38
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, what?! Of course, I'm invisible.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,559
Why am I invisible?

40
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,959
Anything on his phone from today?

41
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,520
Just some pictures of random shoes.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,039
Mind you, it feels kinda familiar.

43
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:38,520
You know what, whatever's happened,
all of a sudden, I'm somewhere
I've always wanted to be.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Let's back up a bit.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,279
I mean, every story's got a
beginning. I think mine began here...

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,640
The final of the Interschool
Maths Competition, 1992.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,319
I used to be a maths head.
Binary coding, topology, quadratics,
I loved stuff like that.

48
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,800
And I'm supposed to be
really good at it.

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,199
And Rushmore, a mountainous 42...

50
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,359
So we congratulate
the winning team - Rushmore...

51
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,759
Dad took the day off work to come and
see me, but when the moment mattered,

52
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,400
I blanked,

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
let the side down,

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,039
made a mess of it.

55
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,080
Everyone blamed me
for losing the final...

56
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:37,759
..but it must have been
what happened afterwards
that started this whole thing off.

57
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,039
Have you ever had a proper look
at the collection? No, sir.

58
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,240
Would you like to? No, sir.

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
I play golf.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,960
Oh. Good, sir.

61
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639
I play golf. And one day when
I was playing really badly...

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,239
I was stuck in the first bunker
whacking away at all the sand...

63
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:09,320
..and this fell out of the sky,
and landed - plop! - beside me.

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,759
From the sky? Yeah.

65
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,079
It looks a bit like a golf ball,
so I picked it up
and put it in my pocket.

66
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,519
But when I had a proper look
later... Here.

67
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,760
I realised it was an eye.

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,039
And I thought, well,

69
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,479
"Where could that have come from?"

70
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
It fell from the sky.
Isn't that amazing?

71
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,240
Have it.

72
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,160
Where the bloody hell
have you been?!

73
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,840
Good evening. ..Good evening.
Come on, Eugene.

74
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,720
Have you got everything?

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,840
Yes. Thanks, sir.

76
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,959
I went to the school, didn't I!

77
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,560
'Dad was mad at me
for losing the final.

78
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:06,240
'But now I had the eye.

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,279
'And what I realised was, if it fell
from the sky, it probably...'

80
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,359
No... No, it almost certainly
belonged to an alien.

81
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,639
HIS MUM AND DAD ARGUE

82
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,839
DOOR SLAMS

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,519
That was the night Dad went away.

84
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,479
But it was OK, because I had the eye,
and the possibility
of an alien encounter.

85
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,680
I mean, if you leave something
really important behind,
you come back and get it.

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,719
Don't you?

87
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:57,159
I wanted that alien to come back
and claim his eye more than
I wanted anything in my life.

88
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:02,079
I worked out the possible provenance,
the life form and galaxy,

89
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,519
planetary escape velocities,
launch windows,
necessary fuel capacities,

90
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,839
and then, I waited.

91
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,519
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky

92
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,079
# He'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'll blow our minds

93
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,440
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky

94
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,600
# He's told us not to... #

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,720
My dad never came back.

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,440
As I got older, I became interested
in UFOs, collected alien artefacts,

97
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,199
watched the stars
and waited alone for my alien.

98
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,080
'And then,

99
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,839
'I found you, Gwen Cooper.'

100
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,639
Hi, I'm Eugene Jones
and, er, I have a keen interest
in your work and, er...

101
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,400
I've got something to...
I'd just like to show... Hi.

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Hi. OK, what it is...
Look, I've got to go.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
'But I couldn't quite make contact.'

104
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,079
Hmm, you again.

105
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,999
Gwen, I've got this thing
I really need to show you.

106
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,080
Sorry, that sounded...

107
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,440
'I couldn't get you interested in
the eye, no matter how hard I tried.'

108
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,919
Are you sure it's my Eugene?

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes, Mrs Jones.

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,799
Perhaps
you couldn't really identify him.

111
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,280
We could.

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,159
That's his tea there.

113
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,920
Shit!

114
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,719
What are we doing here?

115
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,639
Look at this.

116
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,319
Do you understand what's happened
to your brother, Terry? Yeah. What?

117
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,880
He walked into a road
and got run over.

118
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Where's your dad? He works for a big
corporation in America.

119
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
Gwen?

120
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
That's pre-Gorgon Pilurian currency.
I had them authenticated.
Are these Roman coins?

121
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,479
Hey, look, Rice Krispies. Man,
there are some rogues out there.

122
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh, hang on,
there's something missing here.

123
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,519
Mrs Jones, do you know what's
missing from Eugene's collection?

124
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,960
Why didn't they stop?

125
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,320
They killed my boy
and just drove on...

126
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,759
Excuse me.

127
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,240
I am sorry, Mrs Jones.

128
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,800
Look, Mum, I'm sorry,

129
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,360
but we've got the best team ever
working on this. Torchwood, me - top!

130
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,000
We'll get it sorted, Mum.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,839
See, I think
there's probably been some mistake.

132
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,839
So... So...

133
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,720
I gotta go.

134
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,159
I want to know what he last ate,
where he'd been...

135
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,400
Oh, wow!

136
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,240
This is... This is...

137
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,080
I am totally...

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,320
Christ almighty!
The Head of Vexor 11.

139
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,440
No way!

140
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,560
And... Wow!

141
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,320
A hand... In a jar.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,880
What was he doing out on that road?
Fuck knows. Categorising chevrons.
He was a geek.

143
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,839
Ah, this is truly legendary.

144
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,040
Gwen, he had a bit of a thing about
you, and now you're feeling guilty.
Sod off, Owen.

145
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,840
You do it, then.
I do it? The autopsy?

146
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Yes. I've got a stack of admin.
OK. Good. You're sure? Yes.

147
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Really? Yes.

148
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,640
I am in heaven.

149
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
Am I?

150
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,559
Is that...?

151
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,879
Number three scalpel.
Start at the sternum. Piece of piss.

152
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,600
OK, here we go.

153
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,760
This is also new to me, but
in an investigation like this...

154
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,439
OK, a red Vauxhall has been stopped
outside Caernarfon.

155
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:07,919
Very drunk guy has admitted
knocking a man over near Cardiff.
Fit's Eugene's description.

156
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,479
The man says he thought he'd be OK,
so he drove on. Ah, he was
a sweet guy. That's very sad.

157
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:17,359
Now, can we get on
with some proper work, please?

158
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:24,360
# Hope there's someone
who'll take care of me

159
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
# When I die

160
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,199
# Will I go?

161
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:37,279
# Hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free

162
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,279
# Nice to hold when I'm tired

163
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,999
# There's a ghost on the horizon

164
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,920
# When I go to bed

165
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,999
# How can I fall asleep at night?

166
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:06,919
# How will I rest my head?

167
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,719
# I'm scared of the middle place

168
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:18,040
# Or paralyse in light

169
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,719
# And godsend I don't want to go... #

170
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:28,359
Do you think Eugene
committed suicide?

171
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:31,360
It was a road accident
and there was no alien involved.

172
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,719
See, I'm not so sure because
something seems really odd.

173
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,319
I mean, I just...

174
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:42,679
I just feel that
there's something going on.

175
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,200
Marvellous.
Thank you for that Disney moment.
Now, who's making the tea?

176
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,319
I suppose Eugene's a bit odd and
a real local and amateur for you.

177
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,199
Why is it that only Gwen seems to
have a heart? I don't know if you've
noticed but the rest of us are human

178
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,640
and amazingly we still manage to
get on with our jobs. OK, you two...
OK, fine. Leave it, forget it.

179
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,160
I have.

180
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,559
Is that Eugene's DVD?

181
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,199
No.

182
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,520
Yes!

183
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,640
It was on loan from a video store.
You were nicking his stuff?
I was going to take it back.

184
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
I'll do it. Suits me.

185
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,119
There'll be a fine.

186
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,399
I'm going to go for some lunch.

187
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,319
All right.

188
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,680
Hi. Do you know when the video shop
round the corner opens?

189
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,320
No, he's a law unto himself.
Gwen! What are you doing here?

190
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,759
This is my lunch cafe. This is...
Do you know someone
called Eugene Jones?

191
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,520
That's me! That's me. Middle height.
Sandy hair. Ordinary looking...
Nope. What can I do for you?

192
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,799
I come in here every day.
Two eggs, ham and chips.
Two eggs, ham and chips, please.

193
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,759
So...

194
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,520
So...

195
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,799
Wow, this is so weird.
I used to follow YOU around.

196
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,080
Now you're following me!

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,760
Yeah.

198
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,800
No, you see,
I don't know whose those are.

199
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,199
I can't remember anything, except...

200
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,519
Phone Gary. He might know something.

201
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,600
Phone Gary, phone Gary...

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,160
'Hi, this is Gary.
Please leave a message.'

203
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,360
Hi, my name is Gwen Cooper. I have
some very bad news for you, Gary.

204
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,280
I'll give you a call back later.

205
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,159
That is so beautiful.

206
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,919
TV: These ancient creatures have had
their day.

207
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,359
All over these lush fern prairies

208
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,280
a grim evolutionary battle
has broken out

209
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,479
among the newer types of reptile...

210
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,200
Hello.

211
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Hi, gorgeous. Want to borrow
a dream? No, thank you.

212
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,240
I want to return some DVDs on
behalf of someone who's deceased.

213
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,599
Deceased? No shit.
That's pretty final. Eugene Jones.

214
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,119
Hey, I think he used
to come in here, with a mate.

215
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,960
Bit of a dreamer, kind of...
Irresistible?

216
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,079
Ordinary looking. Yeah.
He was killed in a road accident.
That's bad. Sweet guy.

217
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,600
£34, please. £34?!

218
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,359
Yeah. Sorry. He's had 'em out ages.
I haven't seen him in months.

219
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,199
I don't think I can bend the rules,
just cos he's dead.

220
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,760
Bread-head bastard. Sorry, Gwen.
That's OK.

221
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,560
Did he, er...?

222
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,920
Did he walk
into the oncoming traffic?

223
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,320
See, lot a people come in here.

224
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,680
They don't want to be themselves any
more, they want to be someone else.
They want me to transport them.

225
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,279
How about you, baby? Oh, leave
it out. I'm fine, thank you.

226
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,679
How about you? Me?

227
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,959
I'm outta here.
Moving to London in a couple of
months. You know what I'm sayin'?

228
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:54,160
You see, no disrespect, but Eugene
had "loser" written through him
like "Brighton" in a stick of rock.

229
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,920
Maybe he just couldn't live
with his...failure.

230
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
You wanna write a cheque?

231
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,039
Failure?

232
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,679
Is that right? Has my life
just been one big failure?

233
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,279
I mean, maybe I never quite lived up
to my early promises of maths genius,

234
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,880
but that's because I was waiting
for the alien to collect his eye
and change my life.

235
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,320
And while I was waiting,
I joined Passmore Telesales.

236
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,720
Oh, yes.
This is all nauseatingly familiar.

237
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,639
'Selling kitchens, home insurance,
barbeque sets.

238
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,680
'Selling life and...still waiting.'

239
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,839
Jason!

240
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,719
Kevin! The guy
with the personal hygiene problem.

241
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,880
Nothing changes, really.

242
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,240
Hi, Morag.

243
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,039
Me and Morag used to go out.

244
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,639
So, how come I can remember the
details of my fascinating daily life,

245
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,680
but the vital couple of weeks
before I died

246
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,119
are still a complete mystery to me?
Are you Gary?

247
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,640
Yeah, yeah. How do you, er...?

248
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,799
Are you... Gwen, yes.
I was just wondering whether
you saw Eugene the day he died.

249
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,920
No. Sorry.

250
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,799
Just doing a card. You know...

251
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,080
"Good luck in your new job"?!
He's dead. No! Who's it for, then?

252
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,680
His mum, you idiot! Shit.

253
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,519
Can you rub it out? It's in Biro.

254
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,000
People just don't understand.
Don't worry, mate, it's OK.

255
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,119
Is it true?

256
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,119
He got run over? Yeah.

257
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,159
Oh, God.

258
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,119
Sorry. I'm Linda.
I'm a Silver Seller.

259
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,960
It's all about belief, see?

260
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,920
If necessary,
I am Kitchens For A Lifetime.

261
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,879
Eugene was only ever himself.

262
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,919
He wasn't the best salesman then?

263
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,880
No. I think Craig kept him on
out of the goodness of his heart.

264
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,840
Have you met Craig? Is he your boss?

265
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,679
Are you two an item?

266
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,319
A snog in the ladies'
at the Christmas party.

267
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,279
But I can't talk about it here cos
of Craig's, you know...position.

268
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,320
Do you want to meet lunchtime
for a chat?

269
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:13,840
OK. Where does Gary sit?

270
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,239
Number 50. OK, thank you. Thanks.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,679
MOBILE RINGS

272
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,440
Owen. 'Gwen, Jack wants to know
where you are.' Yeah, sorry.

273
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,039
I had a few things to sort out.
I'll be back later.
'Yeah, well, make it quick.'

274
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,080
Well, one day Eugene came in,
very low. Why? Why was he low?

275
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,439
He wouldn't talk about it.

276
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:51,520
Anyway, I was fed up too
because Craig had...

277
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, anyway, I said,
I'd love to get away from it all
and go to Australia.

278
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Eugene suddenly got very excited.
He said, "Yes! You've got to go."

279
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,240
I said,
"But I haven't got the money,"

280
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,679
and he said he'd get it for me.

281
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,839
So he was going to pay for a ticket
for you to go to Australia with him?
Was he in love with you?

282
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, no! He loved someone
he said was unattainable.

283
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,039
He was just trying to look after me.
He said,

284
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:25,279
"Don't stay here
and waste your life waiting for
something that may never happen."

285
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,679
Where was he going to get
the money from? Exactly.

286
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,839
You said, "You haven't bought socks
in six years."

287
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,280
I said, "You haven't even had
a new pair of socks in six years."

288
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,959
He stood up, and he said...
MOBILE RINGS
That's your phone.

289
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:41,199
Yeah, he said...? He said,

290
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,239
"I'm going to sell it."

291
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,919
I said, "What?"

292
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,199
He said, "My alien artefact." So...?
So...? So he brought it in to work.

293
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,199
It's a plastic eye!
It's an alien body part,
and I'm going to sell it on eBay.

294
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:07,999
Eugene, it's very nice of you,
but I don't think that's going
to get me the bus into town,

295
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,000
let alone a flight to Sydney.

296
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,040
Some people laughed.
But he went ahead,
and of course, it just sat there.

297
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,240
She said maybe a photo,
a bit more of a description...

298
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,000
Then, out of the blue - £2.50.

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,239
A kid from Birmingham.

300
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:30,120
And then...
Eugene, you got a couple more bids.

301
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,959
Bloody hell! 75 quid!

302
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,400
That was just the beginning.

303
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,680
200... 300...

304
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,720
1,000... They just kept on going up.

305
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,799
£3,000! For a spare body part.

306
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,400
Pete said you can get
a bathroom suite with a celebrity
appearance for less than that!

307
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
Then one day, it just...

308
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,999
jumped.

309
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,439
Oh, my God, Eugene, you're rich!

310
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,319
£15,005.50.

311
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,520
Who bought it? Who bought it?

312
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,880
I've no idea. Is it all my fault?

313
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,080
Of course it's not!
MOBILE RINGS
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,639
Hello? 'Hi, it's Eugene's mum.'

315
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:24,960
Mrs Jones? 'There's something
I think you should see.'
OK. I'll come over.

316
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,559
That was Eugene's mum.
Sorry, I'm going to have to go.

317
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm sorry.

318
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,360
MAN: There he is...my son at the
Interschool Maths Final. Big moment.

319
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,400
Youngest contestant in Wales.

320
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,560
So, it's down to the wire, the
last question will settle the final.

321
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,920
What curve is represented by
y-squared = 4ax?

322
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,239
Come on. You got a brain the
size of Cardiff Arms Park!
What's the friggin' problem?!

323
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:06,959
What curve is represented by
y-squared = 4ax? Don't do this.

324
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,199
Don't let me down, boy.

325
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,359
No?

326
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,239
DING!
Time's up. No additional points.

327
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,800
The final scores are...

328
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,280
I don't understand. Someone gave him
the eye as a consolation prize?

329
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,479
Yeah, it was that Mr Garrett,
the science teacher.

330
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,040
A plastic eye!

331
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,560
As a consolation prize!

332
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,960
Still, Eugene treasured it.
That was the night Dad walked out.
Went away.

333
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,600
You can stop now, Mum.
What do you mean? He's dead.

334
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,080
He may have been able to square
the root of the square root, but he
couldn't cross the road! Terry!

335
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,200
He sold the eye online.

336
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,399
So something must have happened.

337
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:55,360
Dad left when he found out Eugene
was a failure. That's what Eugene
said. None of that's true.

338
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
He went cos of his job.

339
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,880
He has a very important job.

340
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,759
Does Mr Jones know about Eugene?

341
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,680
Well, you see, he works for
a big corporation

342
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,920
in America. Stop giving us that shit!
He's not Superman, Mum! He works at
a garage on Filey Road.

343
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,719
Eugene found him about two weeks
ago. He found him on the internet.

344
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,719
He's a cashier. Works nights.

345
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,079
Oh, God, now I remember
why I sold the eye.

346
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,959
Life can be such a let down,
can't it?

347
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:42,120
All those years I'd believed
my dad had gone to America
because I was a failure.

348
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,600
And here he was, all along,
doing his important secret
work in Filey Road, Cardiff.

349
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,960
When I found him,
I couldn't even bear to say hello.

350
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,360
I'd spent my life believing
in stupid stories, fantasies.

351
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,040
I've wasted my life.

352
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,680
Once I'd seen him there, everything
I'd dreamed about was like rubbish,

353
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,759
just a crock of shit,
including the eye.

354
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,200
So why not sell it?

355
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,159
Along with the woodworm
treatment and loft insulation,

356
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
and all the other crap floating
round the world.

357
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,079
Linda was welcome to the money.

358
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,119
No! No! NO! Don't, Gwen!

359
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,319
I don't want anything to do with him.

360
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,799
I'm sorry.

361
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,239
It's OK.

362
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,439
You turned your phone off.

363
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,639
It was Eugene.

364
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,999
He didn't understand
why his father left.

365
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,360
He just needs a bit of help.

366
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,359
To do what? He's dead!
Yes, Jack, I know he's dead, but...

367
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,840
This is not sounding good, Gwen.

368
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,559
I've got work to do. OK.

369
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,679
Eh? No. You can't just stop.

370
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,160
I mean, what about the £15,000?
Gwen? Gwen! OK. Listen to this.

371
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,519
Eugene had an alien eye in his
collection. He sold it online.

372
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,959
What, like a sixth eye?

373
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,439
A Dogon sixth eye?

374
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,959
Maybe.

375
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,799
It's possible.
There was a trade in them.

376
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,360
Who's got it? I don't know, but
I've nearly tracked it down.

377
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,800
What exactly is a sixth eye?
I mean, exactly?

378
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,039
It's one in the back. Let's you
see behind you, where you've been.

379
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,239
Kind of puts things in perspective.

380
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:55,800
It's useful,
fun, slightly terrifying,
that's why they were in demand.

381
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,959
See? See? I told you.
I can get it for you.

382
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,240
My alien...

383
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,760
See? See?

384
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,160
OK, you've got the weekend.

385
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,440
But keep your phone on.

386
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,320
God, you are brilliant.

387
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
And I'm brilliant too.

388
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,759
Oh, yeah, of course,
Gary and me were going to go to
that talk in Aberystwyth.

389
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,160
Black holes and anti-matter were
pretty important to me and Gary, but

390
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,200
if I'm going to spend a night by the
sea, I know who I'd rather be with.

391
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,799
I'd trust you with my life

392
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,719
if, you know, I still had one.

393
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,079
Gary?

394
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm not proud of what I've done.

395
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,680
You hiked the bid? I created
three or four online aliases,
and used them to inflate the price.

396
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,559
But why?

397
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,759
At first, just to cheer him up.
He was miserable.

398
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,559
But then the bidding
took off and we got...

399
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,519
I mean, I was involved at first.

400
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,920
I was just helping Eugene make money,
and then one morning...

401
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,959
Gary!

402
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,400
Gary, I think it's him.

403
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,479
Who? The alien.

404
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,119
My alien.

405
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,640
I think he's come back to
claim what's rightfully his.

406
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,159
Gary, I'd stopped believing in him.
I mean, I thought I was just
a total sucker but...

407
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,920
Who else would be bidding this
kind of money for a prosthetic eye?

408
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,360
He couldn't contact me any other way.

409
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,919
So he chose eBay? Cyberspace.

410
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,520
I mean, even an online auction
has a certain elegant symmetry.

411
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,840
I think I'm finally
going to meet him.

412
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,359
Well, I was
doubtful at first, you know, and
then suddenly, out of nowhere - bam!

413
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,000
15,000. I mean, the bid jumped
to a cool cowin' 15,000.

414
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah. Yeah. I remember us talking.

415
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,439
I thought it was £15,005.50.

416
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,320
Yeah, it was, yeah.

417
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,400
I mean, I wouldn't spend that
kind of money unless it was my own

418
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,279
personal private body part
or something. Would you? No.

419
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,919
No. No way! I remember, yes.

420
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,920
I waited a couple of days and then I
got an email telling me to come to,
er...come to a restaurant.

421
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,559
You saw Eugene the day he died,
didn't you?

422
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,160
Yeah, I met up with him before
he went to meet the alien.

423
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,719
I had a cup of coffee.

424
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,880
He was scared. Was I? Course I was.

425
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,920
So he went to make the exchange -
£15005.50 for the eye, right?

426
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,839
And this was somewhere on the
A48 perhaps? Or not. Or not?

427
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,800
Eugene was very secretive.

428
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,840
Could have been in Splott? Splott?

429
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,559
That doesn't sound right, mate.

430
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,119
Who are these people with you, Gary?

431
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,680
Why would Eugene take
a photo of your shoes?

432
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,959
And, whose are the other shoes?

433
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,039
They're just random shoes,
I should think.

434
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,320
I miss him.

435
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,919
Yes, yes, I can remember!
I called a taxi, and then, then I
put the eye in a freezer bag.

436
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,240
And then there was...
Yes, I was walking up this
road going up towards...

437
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,879
um, a shiny building with...

438
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:12,840
a great door which
said something about...

439
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,319
something about...

440
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:18,520
Happiness.

441
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,079
Happiness.

442
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,840
I don't want you to
find out what happened.

443
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,279
I don't want this to end.

444
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,839
I love you.

445
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,479
I love you.

446
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,560
I thought we were on holiday.

447
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,799
Yes.

448
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,440
Yes...this is it.

449
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,159
We came up the hill, and there
it was! There it was, the...

450
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,360
The Happy Cook?

451
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:14,680
Yeah, I walked towards the door,
wondering who exactly I would be

452
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:20,399
meeting, excited, quite stressed,
shitting myself frankly.

453
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,320
I opened the door...

454
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,440
I walked in,

455
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,079
and saw...

456
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,559
I've been looking for a pair
of shoes like that for ages.

457
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,999
And saw...

458
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,439
And saw...my mates.

459
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,480
Hi, guys. Good to see you,

460
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,399
but erm...I've got the rendezvous.

461
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,800
It's us.
I know but...he won't want a crowd.

462
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm meeting the buyer.

463
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,719
I'm meeting the alien.
We ARE the alien, man.

464
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,480
We bought it.

465
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
What? Here.

466
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,080
What are you having?

467
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,280
Erm...I'll have a milkshake,
thank you. Banana.

468
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,799
Yeah. So we are the official buyers.

469
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:24,120
Can we see the merchandise?

470
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,120
I don't quite know what
you're trying to tell me here.

471
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,480
See, we did it as a joke to cheer
you up. We didn't think
we'd be the actual buyers.

472
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,199
Then he said you said you thought
it was the alien, and we thought...

473
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,440
well, that's funny, innit?

474
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,799
Come on, Eugene, get real.

475
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:51,599
But then we thought,
"Let him dream, man.

476
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,480
"Life's short and really boring."

477
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,800
So then
we went on betting and then...

478
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,600
You bid 15,000 for the eye?

479
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,520
Not us. No. No way.

480
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
It turns out there
was real interest.

481
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,120
Someone else bid the fifteen
thou, but then HE got greedy.

482
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,640
Ketchup, please. He just couldn't
resist one more measly little bid.

483
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,679
£15,005.50. And then, well nothing.

484
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,400
Nada. Endville.

485
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,200
OK, shut the fuck up, Gary.

486
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,919
Point is, we bought it.

487
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,040
We are the purchasers.

488
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,680
Ta-dah!

489
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,840
So you've got
£15,005.50 on you, have you?

490
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,999
We've got £34.

491
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:39,439
£34, Eugene. That's not a
poke in the eye, so to speak.

492
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,519
I'm calling a cab.

493
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,279
Hey slow down.

494
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,640
Banana milkshake?
Thank you.

495
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,159
If it's all such a sodding
joke, why do you even want it?

496
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,679
I got a friend
with a visual impairment.

497
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,479
You're going to re-sell
it online, aren't you?

498
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:08,040
You cheap little gits. You know
he's out there... Who? The alien,
and he'll pay anything.

499
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,480
Eugene, man, I'm as partial as the
next guy to a bit of sci-fi but...

500
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,639
A green geezer with six eyes?

501
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,880
Get real, guy.
I checked the bid history.

502
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,359
Mr C Blackstaff is a collector of
alien ephemera and Nazi memorabilia.

503
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,479
Also beanie babies.

504
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:29,080
Teeny bit cuckoo,
but endearingly rich.

505
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,120
And if he's willing to pay 15,000...

506
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,079
Oi!

507
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,880
So now they're
inconveniencing customers.

508
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,040
You stepped in? Well, I tried.

509
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,959
I didn't really know what
the eye was any more...

510
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:56,880
..but I was damned if I was
going to let it go for £34
and a banana milkshake.

511
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,960
Heimlich!

512
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,160
Heimlich! What are you doing?
Getting the goods, idiot!
Get the milkshake!

513
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,679
Well, that's just not
acceptable behaviour.

514
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,760
Not at a Happy Cook. They were making
a public spectacle of themselves.

515
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,360
And that was it,
he was out the door and gone.

516
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,799
Oh, my God! That is so weird!

517
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,839
You bastards! You are so dead!

518
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,040
I mean, Josh, you're just a
dickhead, but Gary...

519
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
We were... I mean, we were mates.
Hi, doll.

520
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Are you talking to me? Yeah.

521
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,000
Sorry. Look, I don't know whether
you remember us from last week. Yes.

522
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,679
Yeah, now the thing is, there may be
people coming in to ask questions.

523
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,040
A woman specifically. And I think...

524
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,600
Josh. ..it would be in your best
interests if... Shut up, Josh.

525
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,359
The woman is complying, man.

526
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,760
OK. Cool.

527
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,119
What did you do that for, twat?

528
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,439
I miss him!

529
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,400
So he ran out the door and
you two ran after him? Yeah.

530
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
We chased him across the car park.

531
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
But Eugene was quite fast.

532
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,560
Josh had new shoes,
he was making a fuss...

533
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Hey, hey... You are overweight.

534
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,919
He hared across the road
and we lost him.

535
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,760
Honest to God.

536
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,439
OK.

537
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:41,000
That's it.

538
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
OK.

539
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,400
All those cars. All those
lives moving through space...

540
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,560
Hello.
Can you give me the number for Filey
Garage, Filey Road, Cardiff, please?

541
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,119
All that humanity whizzing by in a
frenzy of burgers and chips,

542
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,119
bank holiday fun, burst
tyres, screaming kids

543
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,800
and sudden heart-attacks.
Put me through, thanks.

544
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,959
Mr Jones?

545
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:16,320
You don't know me,
but I'm a friend of your son Eugene.

546
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,840
I've got some bad news, I'm afraid.
Now I remember.

547
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,999
Apart from a buzzing in my ear
where Josh whacked me, I felt good.

548
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,760
I was running across a
field on a Saturday morning.

549
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,040
The smell of exhaust
and banana milkshake,

550
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,720
a slight nausea, heart beating too
fast cos I wasn't that fit - all the
stuff that tells you you're alive.

551
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,640
By rights, I should
be well pissed off -

552
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,720
my mates had cheated on me

553
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,840
and I didn't meet any aliens, but
I realised that when I swallowed the

554
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:03,360
eye at the Happy Cook, I was given
a chance to look back on my life
and see it for what it really was.

555
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,240
Gary, I'm going to miss you.

556
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,920
Not the biggest turn-out you
could hope for, but still.

557
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,679
I wish I could...

558
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,360
God, Gwen, I wish I could say
thank you.

559
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,999
And here he is...

560
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,680
..my dad,

561
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,640
only 14 years late.

562
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:43,880
So, now I know it wasn't
my fault my dad left,

563
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,279
and that, of course,
he wasn't Superman

564
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:49,839
or an alien,

565
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,600
he's just an ordinary bloke.

566
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,399
Eugene...

567
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,120
He was a good boy,

568
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,920
but somehow...

569
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,999
things went wrong. I wasn't there.

570
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,799
I wish I could have
seen him...before...

571
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,119
An ordinary bloke
who made a mess of things.

572
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,079
# Oh, Danny Boy

573
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,040
# The pipes, the pipes are calling

574
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,999
# From glen to glen
and down the mountainside

575
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:43,840
# The summer's gone
and all the flowers dying

576
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:51,160
# Tis you must go
and I must stay behind

577
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,679
# But come ye back

578
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,520
# When summer's in the meadow

579
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,200
# Or when the valley's

580
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,719
# Hushed and white with snow

581
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,079
# And I'll be there

582
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,199
# In sunshine

583
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,359
# And in shadow... #

584
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,880
No!

585
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,640
Not yet.

586
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,520
Dad made a mess of things
and went away,

587
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,719
and that's a shame really,
it's a terrible pity,

588
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:33,800
because we missed each other.

589
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,039
Completely.

590
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,520
You know, 28 is one of
those perfect numbers.

591
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,759
It's equal to the
sum of its divisors.

592
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,479
I'm 28.

593
00:43:58,479 --> 00:43:59,959
I was 28.

594
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,559
I think I'm going to
have to go soon, Gwen.

595
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,080
Oh, God.

596
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,559
Yeah.

597
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:15,799
Also, 28 centimetres per second
is the top speed of a lone lobster.

598
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,319
Oh, hi.

599
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,199
Thank you. I'm sorry I
had to ask you to do that.

600
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,680
Yeah, no problem.

601
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,920
So, if it's the eye
that's been keeping me here,

602
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,879
now it's no longer inside me, why
the hell am I still hanging around?

603
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,519
Eugene?

604
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,519
The eye is in the bag now,
rather than in you.

605
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:55,000
Are you...?

606
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,199
Hello, stranger! Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.

607
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,760
Impressive.

608
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,959
Well, we haven't done
the tests yet, so...

609
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,759
Come on. We've got to go.

610
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:20,080
Jack, can you give me five? Yeah.

611
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:44,440
In an average lifetime, the human
heart will beat two million times.

612
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,599
You'll produce over eight
thousand gallons of saliva
and grow 350 miles of hair.

613
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:54,920
You'll eat the equivalent
in weight of six elephants.

614
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,800
Oh, isn't life amazing! Gwen!

615
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,359
GWEN!

616
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,639
GWEN!

617
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,439
Hi. Oh, my God.

618
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:27,119
Eugene! Are you OK?

619
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,799
It is so good to see you.

620
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:31,960
Eugene, you're on my leg.

621
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,559
Sorry! Sorry. No, no, it's fine.

622
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,080
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

623
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,720
Can he see me?

624
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,039
(Eugene...) He can see me!

625
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,919
Thanks.

626
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:53,160
No, thank you. Thank you.
You just saved my life.

627
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,720
That's OK.

628
00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:00,840
That's unbelievable.
That's un-bloody-believable.

629
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,399
Oh, God...

630
00:47:03,399 --> 00:47:04,839
I think that's it.

631
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,319
Goodbye, Gwen.

632
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,439
Don't go now, Eugene.

633
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:25,440
Eugene, please don't go now.

634
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,039
Eugene, please...

635
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:32,959
Please!

636
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:39,080
The average life is full of
near misses and absolute hits,
of great love and small disasters.

637
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:44,280
It's made up of banana milkshakes,
loft insulation and random shoes.

638
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,040
It's dead ordinary, and
truly, truly amazing.

639
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,080
What you've got to realise is,
it's all here, now.

640
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,440
So breathe deep and swallow it whole.

641
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,360
Because take it from me,
life just whizzes by,
and then, all of a sudden, it's...

642
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:04,239
At least it wasn't a
spaceship full of aliens.

643
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,239
Which year? I need to know. 1953.

644
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:11,079
Just three lost people who've
somehow become our responsibility.

645
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,759
A man like you,
out of his time, alone and scared.

646
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,360
I hate this filthy stinking place!

647
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,800
I died once.
It's like two separate worlds.

648
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,440
There's Torchwood...then
there's real life.

649
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:29,919
I'm scared.
