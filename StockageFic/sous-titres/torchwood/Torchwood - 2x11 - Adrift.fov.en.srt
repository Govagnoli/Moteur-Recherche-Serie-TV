Torchwood.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,980
Outside the
Government,beyond the Police.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,170
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,210
The 21st century is when
everything changes...

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,330
and Torchwood is ready.

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,040
From Mum:UR 9 mins late!MUMxx

7
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,270
Chill!:-P

8
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,780
Cheeky bugger!

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,180
Jonah Bevan,born 15th February 1993,

13
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,390
son of Nikki Bevan and Paul
Millet,14 Cliffs Rise,Penarth.

14
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,510
Disappeared walking home
from football practice,

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,550
been missing now for seven
months and eleven days.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,570
No body,no sightings since that night.

17
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,530
Disappeared right where we're standing.

18
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,330
Which is where we found this.

19
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,670
He sent a text to his mum,she was
looking out the window and they waved.

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,770
She says everywhere was deserted.

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,930
And the investigation?

22
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,660
Usual procedure
- searched the home,spoken to all friends and relatives,

23
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,420
made publicity appeals,but
no significant leads...

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,730
Is this beneath you now?

25
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,680
No!

26
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,260
Then what's with the attitude?
You've a face like a slapped arse.

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,380
I want you to tell me where you were.

28
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,420
Where I was when?

29
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,940
At the wedding.

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,370
I rang you. I had to work.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,240
Temple changed the
rota at the last minute.

32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,830
I checked the duty logs.
You had three days off.

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,290
Are you spying on me now?

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,060
I thought we were mates.
And you just don't turn up!

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,840
I just thought,being as Rhys
has got a problem with me...

36
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,580
Rhys thinks you're great! It's
you who has a problem with him!

37
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,240
You've always made sarky
comments about his weight!

38
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,620
He could stand to lose
a couple of pounds...

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,860
Let it go! Let it go.

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,840
Yeah,well,I can't! All right?

41
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,690
I don't want to sit there and watch
you pledge your stupid life to him!

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,750
I've got better things
to do of a Saturday!

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,450
Happy now?

44
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,810
- Oh,Andy!
- Get off!

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,880
I thought we'd been through
this. You're a lovely fella...

46
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,490
It's not like a bloody tap.
I can't just switch it off.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,150
But this was three years ago.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,470
I mean,I didn't know...

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,280
I didn't realise you
still had feelings...

50
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,970
I don't,all right? I just had a moment.

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,820
Don't flatter yourself.

52
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,320
OK!

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,540
If you want to talk about it...

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,000
I wanna talk about this kid. Jonah.

55
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,260
Teenagers go missing all the time.

56
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,500
I mean,why is this one so special?

57
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
I was the first one here.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,870
Sat with his mum all
night and all the next day.

59
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,960
Every time I tell her we've got
nothing new,I see a bit of her die.

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,090
Anything strange about the case?

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,830
Like you don't know.

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,790
What just happened?

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,220
Exactly.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,030
The camera records one
frame every six seconds.

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,460
He could've done a lot in six
seconds,jumped over the side...

66
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,340
No,he's looking at something glowing,just
out of the camera's line of sight.

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,970
Like a flare,it's not there
in the previous frame...

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,140
or the next.

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,540
Could be one of the
lights on the Barrage.

70
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,540
All right,stop lying. You
know what happened here.

71
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,790
Why aren't you telling me?

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,620
What are you talking about,Andy?

73
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,220
Right...45 minutes later...

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,670
What's your mate Mulder doing there?

75
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,530
Jack?

76
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,720
No recognisable rift activity
around the Barrage on that date.

77
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,970
What about if you tried...?

78
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,180
I ran checks for three
months either side.

79
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,290
Then extended the radius
by a mile and checked again.

80
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,670
Still nothing.

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
OK.Thanks.

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,150
When did you say this was?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,030
About seven months back.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,870
Were you on the Barrage that night?

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,770
They have this cute little coffee shack.

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,290
I sometimes stop by there.

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,240
A boy went missing.

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,280
Just under an hour
before you were there.

89
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,940
OK.

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,710
Jonah Bevan,15 years old.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,850
I thought maybe you were
out there because of him.

92
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Maybe if we'd registered rift activity.

93
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,090
No. I just checked with Tosh.

94
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,210
It was all clear.

95
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,650
Sorry. Can't help.

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,610
Do you want me to look into it for you?

97
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,610
No,it's fine.

98
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,250
So it was just a coincidence then?

99
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,910
Guess so. Gotta go.

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,230
Weevil hunting with Ianto.

101
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,660
So,you're covering it up then?

102
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,860
Jack said it was a coincidence.

103
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,960
- I can't help.
- Thanks a lot.

104
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,820
Should've known. Bloody Torchwood.

105
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,680
Fob me off,why don't you?

106
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,070
No. If there was something
going on,I would tell you.

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,570
Do you know what's happened to you,Gwen?

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,960
You've got hard.

109
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,570
Yeah? Well,maybe I've had to.

110
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,740
You used to care. You used
to be bothered about people.

111
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,840
Didn't matter who they
were,or what they did.

112
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,620
And now you're talking about coincidence,like
people go missing all the time.

113
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,280
Like it's a fact of life.

114
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,860
The old Gwen would have been up
there to see Nikki Bevan in a flash.

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,410
You're one of them now,aren't you?

116
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,920
Too busy to bother
with one missing child.

117
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,710
What is it,not major enough for you?

118
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,980
Not spooky enough?

119
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,420
Sorry to bother you.

120
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,080
Nikki Bevan? Gwen Cooper.

121
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm working with the police
on Jonah's disappearance.

122
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,350
Andy said you might be round.

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,940
Oh,he did,did he?

124
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,540
Reckons you've got a
different area of expertise.

125
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,850
What is it,forensics?

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,410
I'm just a fresh eye.

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,590
Sorry about the mess.

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
Wow,film fan,are you?

129
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,630
Crowds.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,650
Sorry?

131
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,030
It's all crowd footage.

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,670
Ever since he went. Football
matches,concerts,festivals...

133
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,050
Anywhere there's a crowd,I record it.

134
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,180
Go through it,frame by
frame,checking every face.

135
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,300
Sometimes I think it's him,but
the picture's so grainy,

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,730
I spend hours looking at
one corner of the screen.

137
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,920
But then the next day,I
check again and it's not.

138
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,450
It's the hope that's killing me.

139
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,080
Even if you saw him,what would you do?

140
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,610
Find someone that was with him.

141
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,290
If I could just let him know I saw
him. He's gotta be out there somewhere.

142
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,230
Do you think I'm mad?

143
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,990
No,I think you'd make
a great policewoman.

144
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,270
His room's as he left it?

145
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,310
I sleep in here some nights.

146
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,000
Bury my head in the pillow.

147
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,460
It still smells of him.

148
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,670
Except,the more I do it,the
more it smells like me.

149
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,810
I keep his diary for him.

150
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,280
I sit in here and imagine I'm him.

151
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,160
What do you think I did wrong?

152
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,790
Sorry?

153
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,730
Maybe I was too nosey...

154
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,930
or not interested enough.

155
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,760
Maybe he felt unloved.

156
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,520
All I've got is questions.

157
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,440
What about Jonah's dad?

158
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,320
We were only together about six weeks.

159
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,270
I thought when he first went missing and
was on the telly,his dad might get in touch.

160
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,590
But no,still manages to disappoint.

161
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,620
Oh,hang on!

162
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,370
Andy tried to find me a support
group,but there weren't any.

163
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,320
So I thought I'd set one up myself.

164
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,790
It's our first meeting. Will you come?

165
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,850
Oh,I dunno.

166
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,900
Andy'll be there.

167
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,670
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE
MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT

168
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,420
And I'm gonna do food. Oh,come on.

169
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,540
I don't wanna be sat there on my own.

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,690
I'll try,I've got to go.

171
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,210
I'm sorry,I know,I'm late.

172
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,000
Three hours!

173
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,810
It was a work thing,time just
got away from me. Ooh,wine!

174
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,830
We can do it another time though,yeah?

175
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,550
This is the fourth another time,Gwen!

176
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,050
- You said you'd cook.
- Did I?

177
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,870
When are we gonna have this talk?

178
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,540
Let's do it now. Come on,now's
good,I'm ready. Babies. Now.

179
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,230
- Really?
- Have I changed?

180
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,160
Since I joined
Torchwood. Am I different?

181
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,910
- Why?
- It's just something Andy said.

182
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,530
- OK,let me just tell you this one thing,OK?
- Go on.

183
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,510
He still fancies me.

184
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,540
Don't laugh,Rhys. That's why
he didn't come to the wedding.

185
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,420
Bloody hell. Poor sod.

186
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,860
I am a very sexy lady...

187
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,950
and you are a very lucky man!

188
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,400
Just remember that,OK?

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,280
We're not gonna talk
about kids tonight,are we?

190
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,550
We could do some practising.

191
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,060
Tell me you love me!

192
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,890
Gimme the toast.

193
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,610
Come on,tell me you love me first!

194
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,280
- Gimme the toast first!
- Tell me you love me!

195
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,520
- Gwen.
- Hi,Tosh.

196
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,630
I've dug up some new data
on that night at the Barrage.

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,750
I think you might
wanna take a look at it.

198
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,410
I'll be right there.

199
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,820
- Deserting me,are you?
- Yep.

200
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,740
Ugh,crumbs.

201
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,020
Hey,what have you got?

202
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,720
It's barely a blip on the system.

203
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,890
So insignificant,I've been ignoring it.

204
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
But when I looked closer...

205
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,930
This is what we recognise
as standard rift activity.

206
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,590
But what I've discovered is a negative rift
spike that occurred at the time you're querying.

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Now,we've always assumed that these
readings were residual rift flares.

208
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,640
Like an aftershock.

209
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,690
But,because this one coincided with Jonah's
disappearance,I think we've been misinterpreting.

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
OK,so?

211
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,800
So,we've always believed that things
can only come through the rift one way.

212
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,050
What if we're wrong?

213
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,530
What if the rift doesn't
just leave stuff behind?

214
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,820
What if it also takes?

215
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,970
Who else have you told about this?

216
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,770
No-one. I called you
as soon as I realised.

217
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,690
It could be a coincidence,or an anomaly.

218
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,750
I can't be sure unless I can
cross-reference it with other examples.

219
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,350
Can we keep this to ourselves?

220
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,640
There's something I have to do.

221
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,920
Whatever you think is best.

222
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,650
Thank you,you're a sweetheart.

223
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,770
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT.A NEW
SUPPORT GROUP FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OF MISSING PERSONS.ALL ARE WELCOME

224
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,440
You're looking into it,then.

225
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,480
Still the same old me.

226
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,310
Thank you.

227
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
Yeah,well,I dunno why
I bother,you're so rude.

228
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,980
How's Rhys? Other than hungry.

229
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,580
- It's you two.
- Oh,that's nice.

230
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,850
I thought there'd be more here by now.

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,980
It's gonna just be me,isn't it?

232
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,140
No,I'm sure it won't. People will come.

233
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,450
Yeah,you know,"If you
build it,they will come".

234
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,550
Field Of Dreams? No?

235
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,750
Just me,then.

236
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,670
Anyway,sit down.

237
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,550
It is gonna be just us,isn't it?

238
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,660
We're looking for Nikki.

239
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,330
Yeah,that's me. Come in.

240
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,000
It's brilliant you found us.

241
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,690
There's food there,drinks,so
help yourself.

242
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,380
Is this missing persons?

243
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,240
Yeah.Come in. Erm,do you wanna drink?

244
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,720
Bloody hell!

245
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,880
How many of them are there?

246
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,850
You OK?

247
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,490
It's getting a bit too much now.

248
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,550
I dunno what you mean.

249
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,340
I said I'd help you look for one lad.

250
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,680
What about all those
people in there,what...

251
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,260
40,50?

252
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,520
Am I supposed to help all them,too?

253
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,370
Course not. Just focus on Jonah.

254
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,040
The rest aren't part
of this investigation.

255
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,770
But they are. Of course they are.

256
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,100
No,no,they're not!

257
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,520
Find a pattern. Find out what
happens,we might find Jonah.

258
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,180
- What?
- Brilliant. You're brilliant!

259
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,810
- I've gotta go.
- Where you going?

260
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,660
Cross-referencing!

261
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,060
Cross-referencing?

262
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,250
Cross-referencing?

263
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,140
You said we need more data to
be sure the rift takes people.

264
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,320
List of all missing persons in
Cardiff over the last ten years.

265
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,380
I'll deal with the personal details,

266
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,670
and I'm sending you dates,locations
and times they went missing.

267
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,520
And you want me to check the dates they
went missing,against negative rift spikes?

268
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,850
Yes,I do,and I'll dig
out any CCTV footage.

269
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,560
What about Jack?

270
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,130
Do we tell him what we're doing?

271
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,640
When we're sure. Tosh,if
we can prove you were right,

272
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,180
we can start looking for
the people who've been taken,

273
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,810
maybe even try and
stop it from happening.

274
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh,my God!

275
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,990
There are really this many?

276
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,420
Now we tell Jack.

277
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,620
Cardiff has an epidemic
of missing persons,

278
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,460
totally out of kilter with
any other comparable city.

279
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,950
It's down to the rift.

280
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,230
Are you sure they aren't just missing persons?
People do go missing for other reasons.

281
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,840
No. Toshiko cross-referenced the
locations with the rift spikes.

282
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,600
Those we identified are
definitely victims of the rift.

283
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,170
What do we think happens to them?

284
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,010
Scattered through
time and space,I guess.

285
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,850
Cheery thought,thank you.

286
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,470
This is good work.

287
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,840
But I don't know what you want us to do.

288
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,340
Find a way to prevent it.

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,340
Toshiko,can we predict when
the spikes are gonna happen?

290
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,760
No. And they're gone
in a matter of seconds.

291
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,780
Then I don't know how we combat them.

292
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,580
Jack,we have a duty here.

293
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,810
These people are victims of the rift.

294
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,960
If they're attacked by a Weevil...

295
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,590
We can catch them. If they're
victims,we fix their wounds,

296
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,860
but this,we don't know when it's gonna
happen,we don't know where they end up.

297
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,140
Seriously,Gwen.Practically,tell
me what we should do.

298
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,430
We help those left behind.

299
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,180
Why not?

300
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,800
It's nothing to do with us. Move on.

301
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,270
Jack,you should see these people...

302
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,830
Some things we can't fix.

303
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,320
So we don't even try?

304
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,200
Look,Jack's right.

305
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,080
They need counselling.
Support. That is not us.

306
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,590
Ah,OK,is that what you all think?

307
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,420
We are the only ones who know the truth.

308
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,440
We CAN help them. We
don't have to be this hard.

309
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,520
It's not a badge of honour...!

310
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,100
- Close this down.
- Jack!

311
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,610
I'll talk to him.

312
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,350
So,is that it,then?

313
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,210
We sweep it under the carpet?

314
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,100
"Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change".

315
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,810
Oh,bollocks to serenity.

316
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,810
For a lovely girl,you've
got a very dirty mouth.

317
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,880
- Yes.
- I'm with Jack.

318
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,550
We did our best.

319
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,090
Thanks,Tosh.

320
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,170
On one hand,you've got blokes like Mo,

321
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,850
who swears it's the best
thing he's done in his life.

322
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,610
And then on the
other,you've got Big Dave,

323
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,330
who says it feels
like his life has ended

324
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,080
and now he's a second class
citizen in his own house.

325
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,260
Although to be fair,he said his life had
ended when Susy made him ditch the bike...

326
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,160
Will you just stop wittering!

327
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,170
Thank you. God...!

328
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,980
It's not wittering. It's talking.

329
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,580
We're supposed to be talking.

330
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,060
I've been trying to talk to you
for a week and you don't want to.

331
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,940
Wake up,Rhys! What's the
point? We don't need a talk!

332
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,480
It takes two seconds' thought!

333
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,500
How are we supposed to have kids with
my job? We don't do maternity leave!

334
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,010
"Jack,I'd love to help out with the
aliens,but I can't get a babysitter!

335
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,980
"I'll sort out that bomb once I've
dropped Rhys Junior off at nursery".

336
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,730
Stop dancing around a dead question!

337
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,400
You know,sometimes I fucking hate you!

338
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,400
I mean,look at you,caught up in your
little group,like nothing else matters.

339
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,170
Like being a hero is an
end in itself. It's not.

340
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,520
You save this city. Well done.

341
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,130
- You save the world. What for?
- Sorry?

342
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,820
Why are you doing it?
What are you fighting for?

343
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,460
- Because if I don't...
- Shut up,I'm talking now,right?

344
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,420
You do it so people
can live their lives.

345
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,330
And there's nothing
more important than that.

346
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,940
Falling in love,getting married,buying
flats,having kids,or not.

347
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,980
But real life. That's
what you're protecting.

348
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,420
And if you're starting to think that your
shit is more important than real life...

349
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,370
then we're not gonna
last very long,love.

350
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,830
- There's this thing at work...
- I don't care!

352
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,540
When you're with me,we deal
with us,right? Our lives.

353
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,160
You got a problem at
work,sort it at work.

354
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,650
Jack?

355
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,500
Jack,I...

356
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,130
Oh,God!

357
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,440
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,550
Ianto,I'm sorry,I didn't realise.

359
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,200
It doesn't matter.

360
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,350
And I wouldn't have
come in if I'd known...

361
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,350
Always room for one more.

362
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,340
We could've used you an hour
ago for naked hide-and-seek.

363
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,350
He cheats. He always cheats.

364
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,620
Was there something you wanted?

365
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,480
Jonah Bevan.The missing boy.

366
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,870
I'll make it my own special
project,my responsibility,

367
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,820
nothing to do with anyone
else. I'm not letting it go.

368
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,230
No.

369
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,490
What?

370
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,900
I don't know how I can be any clearer.

371
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,470
Oh,well...

372
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,220
Tosh has her projects,so
does Ianto. Why can't I?

373
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,950
- Leave it alone.
- I can't.

374
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,650
- Coming back in? Work to do.
- Yup.

375
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
Jack! We're not finished!

376
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,980
Yes,we are.

377
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,750
There's a package on your desk.

378
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,420
- Hello?'
- You still working?

379
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,910
- Sort of.
- Thought so.

380
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,470
There's a cup of tea here
'with your name on it.'

381
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,110
You think this will help us
with the Jonah Bevan case?

382
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,790
Just leave it,this is high tech stuff.

383
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,880
- Sorry,no. It's GPS.
- What?

384
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,780
Global Positioning System. About as
high tech as... oh,my mobile phone.

385
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,440
What you've got here is a glorified map.

386
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,060
Ooh,X marks the spot,eh?

387
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,550
X being the middle of
the Bristol Channel.

388
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,320
Oh,no,hang on,sorry,no.

389
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,510
Flat Holm Island. Who's
sending you out there?

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,050
That's just deserted scrubland.

391
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,020
Could you get us a refill?

392
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,680
While you bask in my
technical brilliance?

393
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,130
- Hello?
- You left me that package,didn't you?

394
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,360
Ianto?

395
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,410
I dunno what you mean.

396
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,580
What's going on?

397
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,720
- IANTO!
- Night,Gwen.

398
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,040
'Don't...'

399
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Right,so first thing in
the morning,we hire a boat.

400
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,120
I know a couple of boat
skippers who owe me a favour.

401
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,830
We'll head to Flat Holm,see
if we can't sort this out.

402
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,550
Or,you get me the boat and
I'll tell you what I find.

403
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,500
No boat trip,no boat. I'm part of this.

404
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,880
- OK.
- Brilliant!

405
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,060
- But you do as I say.
- Yeah,course.

406
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,690
Listen,I was going to ask -

407
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,610
promise me you won't laugh
- have you got any vacancies coming up?

408
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,120
You know,with Torchwood.

409
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,860
Cos I was thinking,I'm
great to work with.

410
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,860
You know you could tip them the wink.

411
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,080
Maybe. Yeah.

412
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,340
What can I get you,lads?

413
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,430
Two burgers and two cheeseburgers...

414
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,860
Fifty quid.

415
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,290
That's a bit steep,innit? Offer him 35.

416
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,330
Gwen,I'm not being funny,if
you wanna haggle,go to Morocco.

417
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,030
All right,50 quid.

418
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,320
Open waves,here we come.

419
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,100
Get us a couple of teas before we go.

420
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,230
You're kidding?

421
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,470
You're not kidding. I dunno...

422
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,620
Do this for me and
I'll give you 100 quid.

423
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,130
I'm sorry,Andy!

424
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,310
Yeah,right!

425
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,950
I'm sorry!

426
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,320
All right!

427
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,970
'Who are you?'

428
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,150
Torchwood,access code 474317432.

429
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm with Jack Harkness.

430
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,270
He's supposed to warn
us about visitors.'

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,420
Law unto himself,isn't he?

432
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,780
And he knows we'll always forgive him.

433
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,780
In the bush,those that stand out can
become immediate targets for predators,

434
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,190
At late February the population
has reached its former strength...'

435
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,530
This your first time?

436
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,460
We all find it difficult at first.

437
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,130
Are you looking for
anyone in particular?

438
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,890
Yes.

439
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,900
How many people are down here?

440
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,060
Didn't he tell you?

441
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,880
What's that?

442
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,400
Is he OK?

443
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,080
We do our best to help him.

444
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,300
Caroline...

445
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,480
Sorry,but why are they...?

446
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,060
MISSING HAVE YOU SEEN CAROLINE?

447
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,120
Are you all right?

448
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,520
Oh,my God...

449
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,120
They're here.

450
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,000
What are you doing to them?
What's going on here? Tell me!

451
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,420
I'll take it from here,Helen.

452
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,490
It was Ianto,wasn't it?

453
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,510
What are you doing?

454
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,130
I can explain.

455
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,360
No,no,no,no,no,no.
You stay away from me!

456
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,650
Let's go outside...

457
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,370
These are the people taken by the rift!

458
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,170
What are they doing
here? What have you done?

459
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,510
Gwen,listen to me.

460
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,300
He's here.

461
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,810
He's been here all along.

462
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,750
It's not that simple.

463
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,460
Open it!

464
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,690
- Gwen,before I...
- Now!

465
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,630
Hello?

466
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,140
Jonah?

467
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,740
I'm looking for Jonah.

468
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,490
Why?

469
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,950
Am I in the right room?

470
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,910
Yes. I'm Jonah.

471
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,060
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong room.

472
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,810
The Jonah Bevan I'm looking for is 15 years
old and he went missing from the Barrage.

473
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,350
That was me.

474
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,810
Who are you?

475
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,400
My name is Gwen Cooper...

476
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,380
and I'm with Torchwood.
What... What's happened to you?

477
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,870
I was walking home.

478
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,060
There was a light.

479
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:13,400
I woke up and the land was on
fire,there were flames,for miles on end.

480
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,480
A man pulled me from the flames.

481
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,440
Took me to a building,where
they tried to work on the burns.

482
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,280
I thought I was going to die.

483
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,310
I don't remember when the
ground started shaking,

484
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,190
and then I realised it
wasn't a building after all.

485
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,440
It was a rescue craft.

486
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,770
The last off a burning planet.

487
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,750
We watched the Solar System burn.

488
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,350
It was so beautiful.

489
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,270
I am so sorry for
what's happened to you.

490
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,520
Can I trust you to tell the truth?

491
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,900
Of course.

492
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,380
Am I really home?

493
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,030
Yes. You're home.

494
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you.

495
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,200
Jonah,I've come because your
mother is still looking for you.

496
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,120
She's still alive?

497
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,270
You've only been gone for seven months.

498
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,700
She never stopped looking.

499
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,360
I tried so hard to come home.

500
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,640
I was lost so long.

501
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,400
You're safe now,you are safe.

502
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,480
Can I see her?

503
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,040
Can you bring her here?

504
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,670
Is that what you want?

505
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,880
When I took over Torchwood,there
were two,just like Jonah.

506
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,600
Ravaged from falling through the rift.

507
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,940
Being kept in the vaults,neglected.

508
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,850
I wanted them looked after.

509
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,660
I set this place up.

510
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,460
Told the staff these were
experiments gone wrong.

511
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,240
How many are there?

512
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,840
Seventeen,last count.

513
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,010
It's increased over the last year.

514
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,120
Like the rift is trying
to correct its mistakes.

515
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,450
But not all the missing return.

516
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,530
No.

517
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,500
You can't keep them hidden.

518
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,670
They have families
who deserve to know...

519
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,790
Gwen,they're sick.

520
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,600
In ways you could never imagine.

521
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,980
We can't fix them.

522
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,610
We just care for them.

523
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,770
Jonah's asked me to bring Nikki here.

524
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,950
- No.
- She has a right to know.

525
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,570
No way.

526
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,770
She said not knowing is the worst part.

527
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,320
How are you going to tell her her
child has aged 40 years in seven months?

528
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,230
That he's scarred,that he
can't look after himself...

529
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,530
We don't have the right
to hide it from her!

530
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,960
If you tell her,you have to tell
her about the rift and Torchwood.

531
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,100
Then I will.

532
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,190
What if she doesn't believe you?

533
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,140
I have to try. We owe her the truth.

534
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,540
Jack,if you'd lost
someone,wouldn't you want to know?

535
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,830
Let me try. Please.

536
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,950
We've got another meeting on Tuesday.

537
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,650
Will you come to that,or..?

538
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,740
You're not here for small talk.

539
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,210
I've found Jonah.

540
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,570
- Is he dead?
- No.

541
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,830
Is he hurt?

542
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,530
- We're looking after him.
- Where?

543
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,530
Can I see him?

544
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,710
Yes.

545
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,380
Sorry.

546
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,890
There are things I
have to tell you first.

547
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,420
And all I'm asking is you trust me.

548
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,750
Andy,I know you hate me right now.'

549
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,480
I'm hanging up.

550
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,510
No,please don't. It's about Nikki.

551
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,630
- I found Jonah.
- Where?

552
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,750
I can't tell you that.'

553
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,050
Oh,here we go again!

554
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,870
Piss off,why don't you?

555
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,570
I've got Nikki with me. I've told her
about Torchwood and about what we do.

556
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,920
I need you to confirm to her that
I'm not mad or dangerous or a liar.

557
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,800
You used me,Gwen.

558
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,130
That's how you see me,isn't it?'

560
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,550
Occasionally useful. Worth stringing
along,in case I can ever help you.

561
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,410
Andy...'

562
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,100
You'd never recommend for me
to join Torchwood,would you?

563
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,690
No.

564
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Thank you.

565
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,750
I want to take Nikki to see Jonah.

566
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,010
But you've got to tell
her she can trust me.

567
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,490
We can fix this,Andy.We
can make it right.'

568
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,020
Put her on.

569
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,760
Nikki...

570
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,660
Andy?

571
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,440
OK...

572
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,550
..where is he?

573
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,870
Remember what I said. You
won't recognise him at first.

574
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,570
I know.

575
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,720
He's aged. He's been injured...

576
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,100
I just want to see him.

577
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,850
You understand what
I've told you now,Nikki.

578
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,220
- He's not a child any more.
- It doesn't matter.

579
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,380
I have to see him.

580
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,870
Let me see him.

581
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,430
OK.

582
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,590
Hello?

583
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,080
Jonah?

584
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,560
Yes?

585
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,500
I can't see you.

586
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,970
Jonah?

587
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,940
- Mum?
- No.

588
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,930
- No!
- It's OK,Mum,it's me,it's OK.

589
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,030
Stay away!

590
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,510
I'm sorry,I'm really,really sorry.

591
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,010
What're you doing? What
have you done to me?

592
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,190
Nikki,I promise,this is Jonah.

593
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,240
That is not my son!

594
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,740
Get me out,I want to get out of here.

595
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,040
Will you listen? This is him.

596
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,770
You are sick!

597
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,770
- Listen...
- All of you!

598
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,900
Did you fix my wardrobe door?

599
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,920
We bought it
flat-pack,made it together.

600
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,450
The bottom hinge comes loose.

601
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,200
- You said you'd sort it.
- No.

602
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,120
Every evening you buy a bottle of beer.

603
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,240
- You let me sneak one sip.
- Stop it!

604
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,110
- You've two alarms cos you sleep through the first.
- Make him stop!

605
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,400
You talk about when you can earn decent
money and afford some decent make-up.

606
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,540
I'm not hearing this!

607
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,110
You won't buy me a double bed cos you
don't understand what I need it for.

608
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,410
Shut up!

609
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,580
When I ask why you haven't
got married,you say,

610
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,000
"I'll never be lonely,cos
I've always got you."

611
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,880
It's me,Mum. It's me.

612
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,300
Jonah?

613
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,150
I feel so lost.

614
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,650
I've walked for
years,trying to get home.

615
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,620
I'm sorry.

616
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,650
Why?

617
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,710
That night.I was late. I'm sorry.

618
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,280
The sights I've seen,Mum.

619
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,220
It's fine!

620
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,610
It'll take time.

621
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,970
Look... It'll be OK.

622
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,900
You have to leave Jonah now.

623
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,300
- What?
- Helen,I'm fine.

624
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,830
It's for your own benefit.

625
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,220
No. I'm taking him home now.

626
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,420
Nikki,stop for a second.
You can't just take him out.

627
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,600
I know how to look after my child.

628
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,350
I'll tell them he's my father.

629
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,960
I can take care of him...!

630
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,900
We can't allow that.

631
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,300
He's my son,I say what's allowed!

632
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,880
Jonah?

633
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,700
- It's started again.
- What's happening?

634
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,870
He's starting the downswing.

635
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,650
What's a downswing?

636
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,750
What is it? Jonah?

637
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,680
You've seen him in the good phase.

638
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,470
It gets briefer every day.

639
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,420
It really might be best if you leave.

640
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,350
Helen...

641
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,370
Oh,it's all right,sweetheart,I'm here.

642
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,140
Make it stop!

643
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,700
I ever wish I could.

644
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,620
Please,it would be
better if you didn't stay.

645
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,440
- I'm not leaving.I'm not leaving him.
- OK.

646
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,820
Then you should move away.

647
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,200
Why?Will you tell me why?!

648
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,560
I'd never heard a sound like it.

649
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,500
This primal howl.

650
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,080
The scream lasts 20 hours every day.

651
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,900
Before the rift returned him,Jonah had
looked into the heart of a dark star.

652
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,890
What he'd seen had driven him mad.'

653
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,050
One Week Later

654
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,140
They say you can visit...

655
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,330
whenever you like.

656
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,420
When he's in a good phase.

657
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,030
Promise me you won't
do this to anyone else.

658
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,790
Before,I had the memory.

659
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,630
Whenever I thought of him,I'd
see him laughing with his mates,

660
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,220
playing football,scoffing his breakfast.

661
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,860
And now I just hear that...

662
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,180
that terrible noise.

663
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,110
- I thought you wanted to know what happened to him.
- I did.

664
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,630
I was wrong.

665
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,680
It was better when I didn't know.

666
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,430
Before you...

667
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,140
I had hope.

668
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,630
Apology,is it?

669
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,920
Tonight,we talk about what YOU want.

670
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,840
Kids...

671
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,020
..the future,anything you want.

672
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,610
Are you all right?

673
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,860
Hey,come here.

674
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,090
I'm sorry...!

675
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,510
Do you want to sit down?

676
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,540
OK.

677
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,860
Now then...

678
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,250
you tell me everything.

679
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,890
From the beginning.

680
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,340
There's this woman,Nikki.

681
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,200
She had a son...

682
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,680
..Jonah.

683
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,820
He went missing seven months ago...

684
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,010
Some people believe that in
the moments before your death,

685
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,070
your life flashes before your eyes.

686
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,980
Explosive devices.
