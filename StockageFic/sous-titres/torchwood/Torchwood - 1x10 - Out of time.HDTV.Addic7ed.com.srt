1
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:06,519
Torchwood, outside the government,
beyond the police.

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,880
Tracking down alien life on earth,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,919
arming the human race
against the future.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,040
The 21st century is when
everything changes...

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,519
and you've got to be ready.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,999
This programme contains
some strong language.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,519
Hello there.

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,320
Apologies for the
unplanned touchdown,
just hit some rotten turbulence.

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,160
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,919
Diane Holmes, pilot.

11
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,279
Is this some sort of secret base?

12
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,319
You must show me round one day.

13
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,320
Everything all right?
How long before we head off again?

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,440
My Uncle's expecting me.
When did you leave?

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,519
About half an hour ago. Which date?

16
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,599
Today, December the 18th.
Which year?

17
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,280
Which year?
Which year? I need to know.

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,879
1953.

19
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,759
There's no need to be frightened.

20
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,359
Who are you exactly?

21
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,679
The least you know about us,
the better.

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Meet the team. Toshiko.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,320
Gwen. Doctor Owen Harper.

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
John Ellis.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,359
Emma Louise Cowell.

26
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,000
Diane Holmes.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,880
Please, follow me.

28
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,800
At least it wasn't a spaceship
full of aliens.

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
That might have been easier.

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,880
But how can you travel
50 years in half an hour?

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Your aircraft slipped through
a transcendental portal. A what?
A door in time and space.

32
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,159
It's some kind of trick,
it has to be. Tosh?

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Celebrations of the Millennium
in your respective home cities,

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,200
photographs documenting the
development of Cardiff Bay

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,360
from the '50s to the present day,
blueprints of modern day aeroplanes.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,520
But if all this is true...

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,720
then how do we get back? You don't.

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
According to history, your plane
never returned. I'm sorry.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,959
What's going to happen to us?

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,439
Never mind about us.

41
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,400
What happened to everyone else?

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,879
Our families.

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,040
Your father died in 1959. He was 48.

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,999
Dad said he'd die young.

45
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,360
All the men in the
munitions factory did.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,480
Your mother lived
till she was 81 though.

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,200
I know this is hard to take in.
But is there anyone else?

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,079
My son, Alan Ellis.

49
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,279
He was born on the 6th of April,
1937, 14 Park Place, Grangetown.

50
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,479
He might still be alive.

51
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,840
The archives in the '50s
weren't that well documented.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,399
We'll try again tomorrow.

53
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:16,119
Right now,
you need to get some sleep.

54
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,120
Friends?

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,960
Boyfriend?

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,040
Not really. Never stayed
in one place long enough.

57
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,879
It's a bit basic.

58
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,720
Not when you've slept in barracks.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,560
I was going to close a deal
on a shop in Dublin tomorrow.

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,519
What do you trade in?

61
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,320
Food, knick-knacks, essentials.

62
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,760
What are you after? Bit of music.

63
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,960
RADIO PLAYS
BEETHOVEN'S MOONLIGHT SONATA

64
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,439
There's photographs
of my family in here.

65
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,319
I'll see what I can do.

66
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,639
Don't worry, Captain Harkness,

67
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,759
I'll look after the ladies.

68
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,679
Call me Jack.

69
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:37,160
DISTANT LAUGHING
Who else is here?

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,159
Couple of young girls. Pretty dress.

71
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,639
Thank you. I made it myself.

72
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,760
Where are you from? Bristol.

73
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,760
What were you going to Dublin for?
Auntie Nora's ill and Uncle Finn
can't manage the children.

74
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,400
It will be good practice for when
I have children of my own, Mum says.

75
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,120
She's gone next door
so Uncle Finn can telephone...

76
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,439
She'll know I'm missing by now.

77
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,120
Emma, she found out in 1953.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,119
Over 50 years have passed, remember?

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,039
What will she think happened?

80
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,840
It must have been like one of those
murders where they never
find the body.

81
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,040
They seemed to think the plane
went down in the sea.

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,480
These will be your means
of identification.

83
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,239
We've set up bank accounts for you
but we'll give you

84
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:00,640
an allowance so you can practice
with the currency and
money management. David Ward.

85
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,239
Sally-Anne Hope.

86
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:05,999
Deborah Morrison, and it's
spelt how Deborah Kerr spells it.

87
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,400
Your background stories
should incorporate your skills.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,759
John, you could have run
a corner shop.

89
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,119
No. We can fake references.
You can't take away our names.

90
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,239
For God's sake,
it's all we've got left.

91
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,200
It's my son's name,

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,520
it's the name above my shop.

93
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,639
You're right.

94
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,080
I didn't think.
You should keep your name.

95
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,400
I'd suggest you use £25 for your food
and then £20 for luxuries like
cigarettes, magazines.

96
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,440
My dad only made £10 a week!

97
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,279
Things are a lot more expensive now.

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,600
How did it do that? It's automatic.

99
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,719
It knows you're there. But how?

100
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,439
There are wave bouncing detectors
which emit radio waves
and then look for reflections...

101
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,320
Bananas! Of course,
bananas are far more interesting.

102
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Look at all this!

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,880
We'd just come off rationing in '53.

104
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,359
Yes, sorry,
we are a consumer society.

105
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,279
It's bloody fantastic.

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,880
How much food money have I got left?
£15.40.

107
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,720
£12.10. You'll ruin your teeth.

108
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
You sound like my mum.

109
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,840
They sell films in boxes
and you can watch them at home.

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I love going to the pictures.

111
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,439
Good God.

112
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:01,240
Welcome to the wonderful world
of scantily-dressed celebrities.

113
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,640
"Super Excel Waterproof
Luscious Lashes Mascara".

114
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,720
I've got to have that.
There's children around.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,200
She's a children's TV presenter.

116
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,799
So you like the musicals?
My best friend, Kate, and I

117
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,400
saw Calamity Jane five times.
I've got the LP.

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,159
You all right?

119
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,160
What does that mean?

120
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm just going to take a look
at the stadium.

121
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,520
You girls stick together now.

122
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll be back for supper.

123
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,559
Excuse me. Do you know a man called
Alan Ellis? He used to live here.

124
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,759
No, sorry, mate.

125
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm going to check on the plane
this afternoon.

126
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,440
Want to come?

127
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,679
I'm going to watch this.

128
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,759
And maybe make some paper chains.

129
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,760
Wonder what work
I can get in aviation.

130
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,240
I'm going to have to find a husband.

131
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,159
LAUGHTER

132
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,839
All right?
I'm Alesha, this is Jade. All right.

133
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,999
I'm Emma. Diane.

134
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,680
Excuse me, have to get ready.

135
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,559
Where d'you get those shoes?
They're lush.

136
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,999
Thanks.

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,080
Hello, old girl,

138
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,439
d'you miss me?

139
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,360
I've been reading up on you.

140
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,879
England to Australia in four days,
1952, that is impressive.

141
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,319
Yeah, terrible wind
across the Bengal Bay.

142
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,759
Something you ate?

143
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,359
So, how did you get into this?

144
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,680
Ferried planes during the war.

145
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,519
Of course, when it was over,
we were supposed to revert to
being dutiful wives and daughters.

146
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,999
But I'd got the taste for it. No
pig-headed man tells me what to do.

147
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,839
Ah.

148
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,760
"Sky Gipsy"?

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
After the engine.

150
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,999
The de Havilland Gipsy Six -
a work of genius.

151
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:05,359
Tuned with a higher compression
ratio to squeeze more energy
from its fuel mixture.

152
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,559
Can I take her up?

153
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,039
No, you could get arrested.
You haven't got a licence.

154
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,560
But I...

155
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,120
Bugger, it's no longer valid.

156
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,440
I guess I'm just another
pig-headed man

157
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,679
telling you what to do.

158
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,079
Well, you'd better make it up to me.

159
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,719
I want to learn
all about this new world.

160
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:36,439
Blackpool were 3-1 down, then
Stanley Matthews worked his magic -

161
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,520
scored two goals
in the last 20 minutes.

162
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,839
Bolton lost 4-3.

163
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,439
My boy was on his knees,
punching the air...

164
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,239
The FA cup final
live in my own living room.

165
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,959
I charged the lads a shilling each
to come and watch.

166
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,600
Ever the business man, eh, John?

167
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,759
That's an American accent, isn't it?

168
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,200
That's right.

169
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,639
So how did you end up here,

170
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,400
doing whatever it is that you do?

171
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,479
It's a long story.

172
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,559
I'm a slow drinker.

173
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,199
You know everything about me.
What's the problem?

174
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,320
Gets kinda complicated.

175
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,160
What, did you fall through time too?

176
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah, you could say that.

177
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,200
Sorry, mate,
you can't smoke in here.

178
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,160
What are you doing Christmas Eve?

179
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
We could go carol singing.

180
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,279
THEY ALL LAUGH

181
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,159
I'll be getting hammered.
Where are your families?

182
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,039
No idea. We grew up in care.

183
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,040
Like a children's home?

184
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
I haven't got anyone else either.

185
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,560
What happened to you?

186
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,520
My parents are dead,
so I came down here to start afresh.

187
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,079
So they didn't leave you
a house or anything?

188
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,120
No.

189
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,119
I've got nothing.

190
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,319
Were you close to them?

191
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,839
Yes.

192
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,999
I loved them very much.

193
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,799
Must have been an awful Christmas
for them, thinking I'd drowned.

194
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,080
I just want to know
what kind of life he had, my son.

195
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,719
He might have kids.

196
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:11,320
I could be passing my own
flesh and blood in the street.

197
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,279
Find him, Jack,

198
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,799
he's all I've got left.

199
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,919
Cheers.

200
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,119
What? I'm waiting for you
to pull out my chair.

201
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:37,399
Let me get this straight.
You expect equality AND chivalry?

202
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,079
I don't see why they should be
mutually exclusive.
Well, if it makes you happy.

203
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,159
Your chair, ma'am.

204
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,920
Thank you.

205
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,159
So what other strides
have women made?

206
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,680
Well, on the strange but true,
how about this,

207
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,680
you don't have to have sex
to have kids any more. What?

208
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,360
How come?
Get yourself inseminated, with a sort
of syringe, cheery little process.

209
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,919
Seriously,
men donate sperm anonymously.

210
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,040
A little shuffle into a pot
at a sperm bank.

211
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,320
And they say romance is dead.

212
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,760
Oh, come on,
I wasn't born yesterday.

213
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,319
No, but for a bird who's going on 90

214
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,519
you look pretty hot.

215
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,119
What was your favourite song?

216
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,520
Well, it's hard to say.
I know what mine was.

217
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,719
# I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty

218
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:56,640
# But they ain't got what we got
I'm tellin' ya, boys! #

219
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,919
What do you think you're playing at?

220
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,879
I thought I could trust you
to behave.

221
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,119
Where do you want to go now?

222
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
Well, I'm in your hands.

223
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
Well, we could go back to mine.

224
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,480
You could read up
about yourself on the net.

225
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,719
That sounds like a line.

226
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,960
It's not a line,
I'm not chatting you up.

227
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Not because I don't think you're
attractive,

228
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,000
but because I wouldn't want you to
think I was taking advantage of you.
Got any Scotch?

229
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,319
I don't see why she got you
involved. She was upset.

230
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,920
She was drinking.
I only had half a glass.

231
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,800
Enough to make a show of yourself.
We're not meant to draw
attention to ourselves.

232
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,079
We're not the same as them.

233
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,279
We can't trust anyone.

234
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,039
Will you be OK now, Emma?
Don't worry, I won't let
her out of my sight again.

235
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,759
I don't like liver.
Sit down, young lady, and be
grateful for what you're given.

236
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,600
And why should I listen to you?

237
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,799
Emma? Only my dad
gets to talk to me like that...

238
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,919
and I'm never going
to see him again, am I?

239
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,959
Or my mum,

240
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,999
or my best friend,

241
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:10,479
or my dog and I miss them...

242
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,359
and I hate this filthy,
stinking place!

243
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,640
I never had this sort of trouble
with my son.

244
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,839
Woman have been to space too, y'know.

245
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,239
You've got a lot of
catching up to do.

246
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,440
Do you have a girlfriend? No.

247
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,039
So who do all those beauty
products belong to? Me, actually.

248
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,919
No?

249
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:54,439
Oi, real men can moisturize too,
you know.

250
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,239
It's not very homely here.

251
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,920
No, I'm not here that much,
it doesn't seem worth the effort.

252
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,439
You smoke too much.

253
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,879
So I gather.

254
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,840
Amelia Earhart...

255
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,720
she disappeared in 1932.

256
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you think she's
still out there somewhere?

257
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,759
No, doubt it.

258
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,359
One in a zillion chance,
you ending up here.

259
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,400
A whole new world.

260
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,919
Oh, it's not so bad,

261
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,520
once you get used to it.

262
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,719
I reckon you'll fit in just fine.

263
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,559
I'm glad you haven't got
a girlfriend.

264
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,200
Me too.

265
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,079
# ..Come around
and knock me down again

266
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,239
# Worry

267
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,160
# Oh, worry, worry, worry,
worry... #

268
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,440
I take it that
wasn't your first time?

269
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,799
I had a lover.

270
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,439
He was married.

271
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,600
And you didn't care?

272
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,039
Well, I was free to do what I liked

273
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,319
and I didn't have to cook
and clean for him.

274
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,200
It suited me.
I'm not exactly marriage material.

275
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,640
I always thought the '50s were

276
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,560
uptight, sexually repressed and...

277
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,800
You didn't invent it, you know. Oh?!

278
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,560
Can we do it again?

279
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,160
Don't see why not.

280
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,800
We could have an affair.

281
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,839
We could be fuck buddies.

282
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,880
What's a fuck buddy?

283
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,040
It's, um,

284
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,519
it's a friend that
you have casual sex with.

285
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,759
There's nothing casual
about what we just did.

286
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,520
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.

287
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,239
Sex shouldn't be devalued.

288
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,000
Both parties should give it
100% concentration.

289
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,400
Because when you
take off together...

290
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,199
It's the next best thing to flying.

291
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,839
SHE SCREAMS

292
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,800
Emma is my auntie's step-daughter.

293
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,560
She meant to spend Christmas in
Cardiff with a friend

294
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,040
but they had this awful argument
last night and she rang me.
Got my number from Mum.

295
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,640
The thing is, she doesn't really
want to go back home so I thought...

296
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,080
I thought maybe, she could stay with
us. We've got a lot to catch up on.

297
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,520
For Christmas?
GWEN MOUTHS

298
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,840
I'd better get a bigger turkey.

299
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,760
Thanks. This is Rhys,
my long-suffering boyfriend.

300
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,879
He lives here.
Don't your parents mind?

301
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:19,239
Emma's parents are a bit religious.

302
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,079
Oh, better not tell them
you saw my morning glory then, eh?

303
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,719
The thing is I couldn't tell him
your parents were dead.

304
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:35,279
He'd ask too many questions.

305
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,200
The thing is, he doesn't know
exactly what I do.

306
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,079
We can't expect John and Diane
to look after her.

307
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,400
They're strangers.
I had to take her in.

308
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,839
Diane didn't even come home last
night. I think she was in a B&B.

309
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,920
I'll take her job-hunting later.

310
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,760
Jack, John's son.

311
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,679
I think I've found him.

312
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,759
Come and meet Alan, though I'm not
sure how much help he'll be to you.

313
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,280
Alan,
there's someone here to see you.

314
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,439
He's a nephew on your father's side.

315
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,839
He's been tracking down
the family history.

316
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,360
Is Sally coming?

317
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,760
Sally's his wife.

318
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,000
She passed away a while back.

319
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,399
Sorry, this isn't
one of his better days.

320
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,039
What's wrong with him?

321
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,160
Alzheimer's.

322
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,880
What's that? He's senile.

323
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,599
He doesn't remember who he is
most of the time.

324
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,560
Couldn't live at home any more.
He'd leave hobs on,
forget to dress, you know.

325
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,680
He never had any children so there
was no-one there to look after him.

326
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:03,720
That's you and your dad
playing footie out the back.

327
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,760
That's your dad and your mum
and your new television set.

328
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
When can I go home?

329
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,399
You're not well enough, love.

330
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:18,400
I don't like it here.
They took my clothes.

331
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,759
I'll have a word, they're in the
wash. Keeps me going, this one.

332
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,039
What did he do, for a living?

333
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,440
Was he in retail?
I think he was a fireman.

334
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,959
That's what I did.

335
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,439
In the war.

336
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,559
£60 for half an hour!

337
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,480
No worries. I'll pay.

338
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,400
A Cessna!

339
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,359
Oh, it's my first plane.

340
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,040
I bought one after the war,
they've hardly changed.

341
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,960
Dream to fly.

342
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,439
We'll soon get you back
behind the...throttle.

343
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,920
Thanks, Owen.

344
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,839
Matthews did three set-ups
in 20 minutes,

345
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,399
then Bill Perry
cracked home the winner.

346
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,399
You said he had wings on his feet
and that's why he was
called a winger.

347
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:17,599
You used to say clever
things like that. Blackpool won.

348
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,519
Yes!

349
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,599
Alan, it's me, your dad.

350
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,439
I bought you that football annual
you wanted for Christmas, Alan.

351
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,280
It was in my desk drawer.

352
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,040
Alan, please...

353
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,160
Everything all right?

354
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,640
He remembered who won the FA Cup
final when he was a boy.

355
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,200
He sometimes remembers
snippets from his childhood.

356
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,680
It's quite common with dementia.

357
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,399
When's Dad coming, Mum?

358
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm not your mum, love.

359
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,600
Alan?

360
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,080
Who are you?

361
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:06,520
John's witnessing the end of
his world, the end of his line.

362
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,359
And we can't help.

363
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,399
There's no puzzle to solve,
no enemy to fight...

364
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,120
just three lost people who have
somehow become our responsibility.

365
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,960
Best I can do is Friday 29th,
three o'clock.

366
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
Can't you take her up today?
Fully booked.

367
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,079
It's all right, I've flown
for years. I can go on my own.

368
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,799
Not without a licence, sorry.

369
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,760
Maybe you could cancel someone?

370
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,560
We'll pay extra. I couldn't
do that do my regulars.

371
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,799
Look, it's fine.
Book me in for the 29th.

372
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,800
It's Diane Holmes.

373
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,360
Diane, I'm really sorry.
I should have called ahead.

374
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,520
Oh, for goodness' sake,
this is so silly.

375
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,200
It's just I was
really looking forward...

376
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
Ignore me. Let's get out of here.

377
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,600
MUSIC: "I See You Baby"
by Groove Armada

378
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,719
Do you think
she'll be all right though?

379
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:17,959
I don't think she's even had a proper
boyfriend. Stop fussing.

380
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,320
She'll be fine, man.

381
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,040
What was that for?

382
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,159
For putting up with me.
I deserve a lot more for doing that.

383
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,120
Oi! Hands off!
Go back to your friends, good boy.

384
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,319
What are you playing at?
I wouldn't let him do anything.

385
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,919
You might not have had much choice.
Gwen, you're over-reacting.

386
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,480
I was just having a kiss
and a cuddle.

387
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,480
He was after a lot more than that.

388
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,560
This is...disgusting.

389
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,319
I just want you to know that people
are more sexually aware these days.

390
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,999
Then maybe you'll be more careful.

391
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:41,160
Mum said that no man wants to marry
soiled goods. Attitudes have changed.

392
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,959
As long as it's safe and between
two consenting adults, no-one cares.

393
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,399
So...how many men have you
done it with?

394
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,719
A few.

395
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,520
Were you in love with all of them?

396
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,520
No. Sex can just be about
having a good time together.

397
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,639
If you're in the right mood,
with the right guy, it's the best,
no big deal.

398
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,519
So if I meet a boy and we get on,

399
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,719
and he wants sex,
then you think I should let him?

400
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:17,880
No, no, that's not what I said.
What are you saying?

401
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,800
Sex...is nothing to be ashamed of.

402
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,080
And as for you, well, your first
time should be with someone special.

403
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,600
Do you wish you'd waited for Rhys?

404
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
He's your special someone, isn't he?

405
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,039
Yes... Yes, I suppose.

406
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,079
And I bet sex with him
is better than with the others.

407
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,519
Well...

408
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,119
I will wait for Mr Right, I think.

409
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm really not the kind of girl
who sleeps around.

410
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,759
I'm going to brush my teeth.

411
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,479
Thanks for the chat.

412
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,879
Not a problem.

413
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Leave it.

414
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,280
I can't if I want to fly
a jet plane,

415
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,720
because that's all flying is now -
pressing buttons.

416
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
You used to have to know
how to fix an engine,
how to gauge the wind but...

417
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
Leave it.

418
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,920
Open this.

419
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,400
Oh!

420
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,639
It's beautiful.

421
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,240
Well, how did it go?
This coat I'm wearing is their
latest fashion, '50s inspired.

422
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,999
They offered me a job on the spot.
Oh, that's brilliant. Oh!

423
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,440
Now we need to find you a flat
near here.

424
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,999
The shop's in a new branch in London.

425
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,159
I've always dreamt about
working in a London fashion house.

426
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,199
They open the day after Boxing Day.
I'll be a shop girl
and a trainee buyer.

427
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,520
I can house share. They've given me
numbers.

428
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,559
London's a big city.
That's what my mum used to say.

429
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,000
There's no rush.
There's nothing to keep me here.

430
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,480
I'm sure we can find you
something in Cardiff.

431
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,959
You keep looking.

432
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,279
Need to make a plan, get work,
get my driving licence.

433
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,119
It will all help. Thanks, Jack.

434
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,759
I was looking for a bus timetable.

435
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,159
Want to get out to the DIY stores,
see if there's any work going.

436
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,359
Best of luck! Thank you.

437
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,519
Where are you taking me?

438
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,080
We're here.

439
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,559
Bear with me.

440
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,840
We have had such a girly day
shopping.

441
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,719
What's up?

442
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,399
Your mum rang.

443
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,319
Funny thing,
she's no idea who Emma is.

444
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,719
No? And I'm thinking back
to you and me on the couch...

445
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,800
Work calls, you go out
in the middle of the night

446
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,879
and come back with
a surprise relative.

447
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,279
So, let's have it,
who exactly is Pollyanna?

448
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:21,400
Ah, is it to do with work?

449
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,640
It's so hard to explain.

450
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,559
Do you even know her?

451
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,039
She was lost.

452
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm sorry.

453
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,999
What worries me is how easy it is
for you to lie to me.

454
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,680
It's my fault.
I'll leave by tomorrow.

455
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,200
You don't have to go.
She's 18 years old.

456
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,839
I couldn't turn my back on her.

457
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:55,239
It's like two separate worlds -

458
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,199
there's Torchwood,

459
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,799
and then there's real life.

460
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,400
That's why you've got to let me go.

461
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,200
I, er,
couldn't help noticing you standing
out here in that beautiful dress.

462
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,520
This beautiful dress
is a gift from my lover.

463
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,479
Then he is a fool
to let you go out in it alone.

464
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,960
What shall we drink to?

465
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,439
Chance meetings.

466
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,799
# Oh, the good life

467
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:48,600
# Full of fun

468
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,879
# Seems to be the ideal

469
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,000
# Mm, the good life

470
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,119
# Lets you hide
all the sadness you feel

471
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,960
# You won't really fall in love

472
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,400
# For you can't take the chance

473
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,000
# So please be honest

474
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,480
# With yourself... #

475
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,799
Let's go home.

476
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:41,520
# It's the good life

477
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,400
# To be free

478
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,599
# And explore the unknown... #

479
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:53,440
MOBILE RINGS

480
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,559
# Like the heart aches

481
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,759
# When you learn
you must face them alone... #

482
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:02,880
Hello?

483
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,519
My car keys are missing.

484
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,040
John was behind the counter
earlier on

485
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,519
and I can't get hold of him.

486
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,480
He's gone home.

487
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,639
John!

488
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,519
John!

489
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,799
Let me go!

490
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:08,479
You can't just throw it away,
not without trying.

491
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:13,199
I'm not as strong as you.
You don't understand.
I do. I was born in the future.

492
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,960
Lived in your past.
My time is gone too.

493
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Why are you doing this?

494
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Speaking to me in bloody riddles,

495
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,760
keeping me here when my wife
is dead, my son is a shell.

496
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,760
John, you're still young.
You can get work, make friends,
start a family.

497
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,879
I did all that, Jack.

498
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,760
Years ago.

499
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,400
When I was meant to.

500
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,760
I wish I could say something.
There's nothing to say or do.

501
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,759
I can't leave you here.

502
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:42,559
Then we'll wait.

503
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,839
The sun will rise,

504
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,439
we'll have some breakfast,

505
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,159
take a walk.

506
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,560
Yes.

507
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,319
A new day.

508
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:58,360
And I'll suffer it all
and smile and wag my tail.

509
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,080
And then,
as soon as your back is turned,

510
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,200
I'll make sure I do it properly.

511
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,760
Because I want to die.
You don't get reunited, John.

512
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,800
It just goes black.

513
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,560
How do you know?

514
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,200
I died once.

515
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,119
Who are you? A man,

516
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,200
like you, out of his time,

517
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:27,439
alone and scared.

518
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,920
How do you cope?

519
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,400
It's just bearable.

520
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,440
It has to be.

521
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,519
I don't have a choice.

522
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,119
But I do.

523
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,960
If you want to help me,

524
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,640
let me go with some dignity.

525
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,000
Don't condemn me to live.

526
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,239
Are you scared?

527
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,319
Yes.

528
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,319
You're very quiet.

529
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,719
I don't know if I can

530
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,160
do this anymore.

531
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,960
This isn't how it works for me.

532
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,280
I've slept with enough women,
I've done the fuck buddies thing.

533
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,320
This is not it.

534
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,160
I can't concentrate.

535
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,519
All I see is you,

536
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,319
all I can think about
is what you're wearing,

537
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,399
what you're thinking, what your face
looks like when you come.

538
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,839
It's been, what, a week?

539
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:00,799
And it's like,
when I'm not with you,

540
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,319
um, I'm out of focus.

541
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,120
How have you done this to me?

542
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,600
I'm scared.

543
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,600
I'm fucking scared.

544
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,479
I love you too.

545
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:07,360
The thing about love...

546
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,480
is that you're always
at its mercy.

547
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,960
Emma, these are your tickets, OK?

548
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,559
On the back is your seat number,
keep this with you at all times.

549
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,959
I've also got you
a return just in case.

550
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:03,360
Now don't go talking to any
strangers and phone me as
soon as you get there, OK?

551
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,559
No!

552
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,719
I'm not letting you do this.
I'm not a possession, Owen.

553
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:34,159
You can't do this, it's madness.

554
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,359
If I listened to everyone
who told me that,
I wouldn't have broken any records.

555
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,640
You don't have to go.
If I don't, then I'll always
wonder what it's like.

556
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,079
London, Gwen.

557
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,799
You're not thinking straight,
let's talk about it.

558
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:14,359
No, I'm sorry.
We can make this work.
You belong here now, with me.

559
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,119
I belong in the sky.
Well, we can get you up in the sky.

560
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,400
Soon you can fly whenever you want.

561
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,840
Look, weather conditions are
the same as the day we arrived.

562
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,160
That rift will open again,
I can feel it.

563
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,799
Diane, listen to me,
there is no way back.

564
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:30,840
You cannot get home.
Then it will take me somewhere new.

565
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,760
Merry Christmas!

566
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,640
I'll come with you.

567
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,279
I fly solo, Owen.

568
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,839
I go faster and further than others.

569
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,880
We have no idea how this rift works.

570
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,320
You can end up anywhere.

571
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,679
That's the beauty of it.
It's too dangerous! It's what I do.

572
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,839
What about me?!

573
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,760
Please, please, don't go.

574
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,039
What memories I'm taking with me.

575
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,400
Merry Christmas.

576
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,880
'Because
when you take off together,

577
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,800
'it's the next best thing
to flying.'

578
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,400
Somebody's not only kidnapping
weevils, they're causing them pain.

579
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,999
These guys are using weevils
to carry out the perfect murder.

580
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,120
You want to release a weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!

581
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,599
I've been having sex
with someone else. His name's Owen.

582
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,480
Who are you, Owen Harper?

583
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,639
We're gonna hunt you down
and we're gonna make you surrender
that creature that you kidnapped.

584
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,919
Out there in the darkness,
something is coming.
