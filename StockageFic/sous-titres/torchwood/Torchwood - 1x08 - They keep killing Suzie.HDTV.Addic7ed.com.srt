1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,199
This programme contains
some violent scenes.

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:11,520
'Torchwood - tracking down
alien life on earth, arming the
human race against the future.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,999
'The 21st century is when everything
changes and you've got to be ready.'

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:21,079
Suzie Costelloe. Why did you
kill those people? The more I used
the glove, the more I control it.

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,079
If I could get it to work all
the time, it could resurrect...

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
I loved this job. I really loved it.

7
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,399
At last. You must be Torchwood?

8
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,679
My team bitch about
you all the time.

9
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,720
And you are? Detective Swanson.
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
So I've heard. Are you always this
dressy for a murder investigation?

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,680
What, d'you rather me naked?

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,279
God help me, the stories are true.

13
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,879
So who's the victim?
That's victims, plural.

14
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,000
Yesterday, a man was murdered at
96 Oakham Street, Alex Arwyn, 28,

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,759
single, estate agent, here we go,
that's from the scene of crime.

16
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,319
Today, in here, we get two more,
Mark and Sarah Brisco, both 33,

17
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,079
married, he's a surveyor,
she works in education.

18
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,560
What about the smears of blood?
Is that writing?

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,359
Work in progress. Come inside
and see the finished thing.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Oh, my God...

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,520
Looks like somebody
wants your attention.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
They've got it.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,280
We found a few of the killer's
hairs from the first murder.
Lab results should be in soon.

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Good, we'll need that.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Now, if you could just clear
the room? Some of this equipment
is strictly need to know.

26
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,560
It was only a matter of time.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
What was?

28
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,480
Torchwood walks all over
this city, like you own it.

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,440
Now these people are paying
the price - ordinary people,

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,519
ripped apart, with your name
written in their own blood.

31
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,119
From where I'm standing, you did
this, Captain Jack Harkness.

32
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,759
You did it.

33
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,080
Still, at least
we've got a head start.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,679
If it's someone we've pissed off,
that narrows it down to...

35
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:11,040
ooh, four or five million.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,879
And that's just the humans.

37
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,279
Tosh, how we doing?

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,800
There's no record of Mr and
Mrs Brisco on our database.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Nor yesterday's victim, and no
link between him and the Briscos.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,480
No connection between any of them.

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,640
Jack? They've got the results
on the killer's hair.

42
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,039
Initial findings say,
Caucasian male, early 40s,
smoker, drinks tequila.

43
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,279
Doesn't match any DNA profiles.

44
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:48,439
Only thing of interest
is a compound we've never
seen before. Recognise it?

45
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
Oh, we're in trouble. What is it?

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
Compound B67.

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,480
You're kidding? Retcon.

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,080
He's got Retcon in his blood.

49
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:15,800
B67, aka Retcon, aka the magic
ingredient of the amnesia pill.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
And this belongs to us?

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,760
This killer is somebody
we gave the amnesia pill to?

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,199
Is he remembering
that he's a serial killer?

53
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,440
Or is he becoming a serial killer
because of the Retcon?

54
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,199
Wait a minute. I've taken Retcon.

55
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,239
Then better stay away
from sharp objects.

56
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,520
Ianto, how many people have
we given amnesia pills to?

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,799
2,008. Hey, what if they
all become psychotic?!

58
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,240
D'you have to sound so happy?

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm just saying. Mean Streets!

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,039
Tosh, narrow the list
down to fit Swanson's profile,
start checking them out.

61
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,959
You two, there's got to be a link
between the victims, find the link,
find the killer. Get to it!

62
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,479
Jack? If there is a link, why don't
we just ask the victims ourselves?

63
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,320
Not the right time for a seance,
thank you very much. The first time
I met Torchwood, you had that glove.

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,479
Heh-heh, no way!
Not after what it did to Suzie.

65
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,239
It brings people back to life. We
could question the murder victims.

66
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,999
That's exactly what she said.

67
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:17,679
She was one of us, we trusted her
and she's dead cos of that thing.

68
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,239
The glove stays in
the safe where it belongs.

69
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,640
These murders are happening
because of Torchwood.

70
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,919
So Torchwood has got to
do something.

71
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,599
It fell through the Rift
about 40 years ago.

72
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:39,439
Lay at the bottom of the Bay
till we dredged it up.

73
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,640
I always figured,

74
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,879
this wasn't just lost.
Whoever made it,

75
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,599
wanted rid of it.

76
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,480
You know, we never
gave it a cool name.

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,440
I thought we called it
the resurrection gauntlet?

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,920
COOL name.

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,040
What about the Risen Mitten?

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,960
I think it's catchy.

81
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,960
Jack? You OK?

82
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't forget, the maximum
resurrection time is two minutes,

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,840
and that was only cos Suzie
had practice.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
The most we're likely to get
is 30 seconds. Tosh, ready?

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Ready.

86
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
And, recording.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,040
This man was victim number one.
Name - Alex Arwyn.

88
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,039
Come on, Alex. Come back.

89
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,159
How does it work?

90
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:50,760
You just sort of feel.
Like reaching into the dark.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,039
Finding the dead.

92
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,639
I can't... I don't...

93
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,079
Ah.

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,479
Damn! Ah!

95
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,999
Ah! Nothing!

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
Sorry.

97
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
Never was very good
with this thing. Owen?

98
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,199
I tried last time.

99
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,800
We all had a go, it only responded
to Suzie. Well, I never had a go.

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,640
It's cold.

101
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
It warms up.

102
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,520
The glove relies on some sort of
empathy. Maybe compassion and...

103
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,479
Just be yourself.

104
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,999
BEEPING

105
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,959
SHE GASPS

106
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,400
Somebody help me!

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,519
Oh, my God, help me,
help me, help me! Alex!

108
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,480
I need you to listen to me.

109
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,760
Somebody help! HELP ME!

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,880
Alex, you were attacked. Do you
know who it was? Who attacked you!?

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,279
Who are you? How long?

112
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,919
- Where am I?
- 15 seconds.

113
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,799
Who are you? I'm trying
to help, sweetheart.

114
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,800
I want my mum.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,640
Please! Let me see my mum...

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,880
He's gone. Let me keep trying.
Gwen, he's dead.

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,480
I can bring him back. The glove
only works once. I can do it,
let me try. Gwen. Look at me.

119
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
He's gone.

120
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,680
That was amazing,
she's a natural. 24 seconds!

121
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,639
Give Ianto a stopwatch, and he's
happy. It's the button on the top.

122
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,600
What d'you think, Gwen?
D'you want to stop?

123
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,480
Recording.

124
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,680
Victim number two - Mark Brisco.

125
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:51,840
Oh God, I can feel him, it's like a
rope from my heart to the glove...

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,359
Oh, it's so warm.

127
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,119
Hey, there. Just look at me.
Look me in the eye. That's it.

128
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,759
(Where am I?)

129
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:10,039
You've been hurt,
we don't have long, we need
to know who attacked you.

130
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,759
(Is my wife all right?)

131
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,279
We're looking after her.

132
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,759
Now Mark, who was it?

133
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:22,680
(It was that man. He belonged
to Pilgrim, he went to Pilgrim.)

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,200
What's Pilgrim?

135
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,600
(Oh my God, he had a knife.)

136
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,400
No, Mark, he's gone, we don't have
long, quickly, what was his name?
35 seconds.

137
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,119
(Max.) Never knew his surname.

138
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:44,119
Trying Pilgrim and Max,
get a description.

139
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:47,720
You gotta give us something more
so we can catch him. He's going.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,040
There was...

141
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,400
There was someone who knew
him better... That woman...

142
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,840
She was always talking to him...
What was her name? Where's my wife?

143
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,919
Her name! Suzie.

One minute five seconds.

146
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,720
Jack? Did I hear that right?

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,000
Could be anyone,

148
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Could be anyone,

149
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,960
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.

150
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,999
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.

151
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,600
We've been talking
to the wrong corpse.

152
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,960
Pilgrim. A religious support group,
more like a debating society,
meaning of life, does God exist?

153
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,200
All that stuff. The point is,
it was tiny, more like a hobby,
run by Mark Brisco's wife, Sarah.

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,759
She had all that
stashed in the wardrobe.

155
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,839
Handwritten and photocopied,
that's why we couldn't find any
records, she wasn't even online.

156
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,719
No mention of Suzie, or Max?
Not a word.

157
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,719
She didn't even keep a register.

158
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,800
It wouldn't be our Suzie, though.

159
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,679
She wouldn't go to that support
group bollocks. How do you know?

160
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,800
I mean, were you friends?
Any of you?

161
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,520
Who was her best friend
in this place?

162
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,440
She sort of kept herself to herself.

163
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, then.

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,879
If she needed to talk, maybe
that's exactly where she'd go,
a group of complete strangers.

165
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,520
Could be. You've got a point, Gwen.

166
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,800
Time we got to know our deceased
colleague a little better.

167
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,040
Have I got this right?

168
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,119
When I die,
you get to keep all my possessions?

169
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,639
My whole life's gonna
get stashed in a locker?

170
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,200
Rules and regulations.

171
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,760
What if I leave all
my stuff to Rhys?

172
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,840
We'll stash him away, too.

173
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,360
Tread carefully, people.
With respect.

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,719
This is the life of Suzie Costello.

175
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,880
That's all we are, in the end.

176
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,079
A pile of boxes.

177
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Is her father still alive?
Don't know.

178
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
But you must've looked him up?

179
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,199
To tell him his daughter was dead?

180
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,919
When Suzie left Torchwood,
she was on the run.

181
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,120
She wiped all her records.

182
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,480
I couldn't retrieve her files,
she was good at computers.

183
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,359
Huh... She was good at everything.

184
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,800
She was good at murder too.

185
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,879
Laugh a minute, that was Suzie.

186
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,679
What's that?

187
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,000
A book.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Emily Dickinson.

189
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Poet.

190
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,079
Jack.

191
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,360
Pilgrim.

192
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,839
She's part of it.

193
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,800
That proves it, then. No choice.

194
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,799
It's time Suzie came back.

195
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,920
Do we all get frozen?
Torchwood staff, when we die,
do we all get kept?

196
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,280
Rules and regulations.
How long for?

197
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,039
Forever. Recording.

198
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,239
Have you got your stopwatch? Always.
I'll record from my station.

199
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,519
I'm sorry, but I don't want to look
her in the eye. Sorry.

200
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,519
Anyone else?

201
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,760
Any advice?

202
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah, I know. Empathy.
Even though she did try to
kill me. You and me both.

203
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,039
SHE GASPS

204
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm getting a reading.

205
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,519
No, it's gone...

206
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,960
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

207
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
Just...memories.

208
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,120
Nothing living. She's too far gone.

209
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,359
What do we do now? Nothing we can do.

210
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,920
That's it.

211
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,880
We're out of options.
There's always the knife.

212
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,840
When she killed all those people,
she always used the knife, it's made
out of the same metal as the glove.

213
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,120
We've seen it before,
metallic resonance.

214
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,599
The glove works better if
the knife's part of the process,
like closing a circuit.

215
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:15,559
Then let's use it. Small detail.
The knife was used to kill people.

216
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,999
She's already dead.
So we kill her again.

217
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,080
Ianto?

218
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,040
Life knife.

219
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,879
Anything?

220
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,920
No, there was just a sort of
spark and then it was gone.

221
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,039
I'm sorry, Jack.
You're gonna have do it properly.

222
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,519
What the hell.

223
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,319
SUZIE AND GWEN GASP

224
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,479
Suzie? I've gotta go!

225
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,439
I can't stay, they know.
Just look at where you are.

226
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,040
Think back, try to remember...
Suzie! Suzie! Look at me!

227
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,039
Jack. Oh, my God.
There's a knife in my chest,

228
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,879
did you kill me?
You killed yourself, remember?

229
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,759
But... Oh my God, I shot myself.
We've got to ask you about Pilgrim.

230
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
No. Wait a minute.
Didn't I kill you?

231
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,320
Never mind that,
we need names and details.

232
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,080
Who's using the glove? I'm sorry.

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,159
Oh, wouldn't you know it,
Gwen bloody Cooper. 30 seconds.

234
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:30,159
When you were in Pilgrim
you gave the amnesia pill to
a man, Max, do you remember?

235
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,159
What? You brought me all
the way back, just for Max?!

236
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,720
We need to find him. Who is he?

237
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,480
What's his surname?

238
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,280
He was...

239
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,040
some loser... We're losing her!
Stay here. Damn you!

240
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,800
Don't force it, Gwen. She's not
getting away this time, stay here!

241
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,240
No! I told you to stop!

242
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
It's all right, I've got her,
I've got her...

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,040
Hold on... OK, pulse. She's all
right. We need to get her out of
here. Can you give me a hand?

244
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,959
It's the glove,
I told you they get hooked.

245
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,720
All right, don't make
a fuss, it's over now.

246
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,519
Um, excuse me. I'm still counting.
There's not much point, she's dead.

247
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,240
No, according to the
equipment, she's unconscious.
What the hell's going on?

248
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,239
Oh, my God. He's right.

249
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:19,999
She's alive! Suzie's still alive.
Look at her, she's bloody breathing!

250
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,320
She can't be...

251
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,319
Nope.

252
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,600
Still breathing.

253
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,920
No stopping her. She won't die.

254
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,999
One minute thirty and counting.

255
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,360
MACHINE BEEPS

256
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,080
How long's it been?

257
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,920
Three months.

258
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,519
When can I die?

259
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,440
I just want to go.

260
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,480
Can't you leave me alone?

261
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,559
You seem to be stuck.

262
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,679
But...

263
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,440
Am I gonna stay like this?

264
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,640
For how long?

265
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,440
Don't know.

266
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Can I see my father? No.

267
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,240
You wiped your records.

268
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,399
We had no trace of him.

269
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,239
So, he doesn't even know that I'm
dead? Well, you're not any more.

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
This is sick.

271
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
You started it.

272
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,280
Right now, we've got an
investigation underway.

273
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,759
Pilgrim.

274
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:03,040
You visited these Pilgrim meetings
and gave an amnesia pill to someone
called Max. How do we find him?

275
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,720
What for? What did he do?

276
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,679
He was just an ordinary bloke.

277
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,960
We think the Retcon
triggered a psychosis.

278
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,559
He's started killing.

279
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,799
How many victims? Three. Same as you.

280
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,639
We need to know, how much
Retcon did you give him?

281
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,559
Owen. Hello.

282
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,359
Scared to face me?

283
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,959
(SIGHS) You frighten
the shit out of me, yeah.

284
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,120
What about Toshiko?
Is she still here?

285
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,919
Yeah, she's here.

286
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
All the gang. Happy days.

287
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,399
But the amnesia pills,
how many did you give him?

288
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:44,160
One a week. Every week.
For two years.

289
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
Christ! No wonder.

290
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,999
What the hell did you do that for?
I just...

291
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:52,600
I wanted someone to talk to.

292
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,960
About this place.
It was driving me mad.

293
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,200
And he was just...

294
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,359
He listened, that's all, he listened.

295
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,079
Every week, as soon as I'd finished
talking, I'd give him the pill.

296
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,560
You overdosed him.
I didn't know that!

297
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,160
Keep getting it wrong, don't I?

298
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,639
Is that why you brought me back? Did
you think I wasn't guilty enough?

299
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:19,880
What was his surname? I don't know.

300
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,039
All I ever did was talk about me.

301
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,360
It's all my fault, isn't it?

302
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,560
Never bloody stops being my fault.

303
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,879
Can't you just let me die?

304
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,400
You don't get off that easy.

305
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,439
Yeah, you did warn me,
right at the beginning.

306
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:46,760
He said, "This is the one
job you can never quit."

307
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,200
Then let's get to work.

308
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,239
Come on, Suzie!

309
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,800
Just like the old days.

310
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,160
There's gotta be something.

311
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,520
Hold on... There's someone missing.

312
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
This girl came every week,

313
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,279
student, blonde...

314
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,319
She's not in these photos.

315
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,520
Who was she? Lucy.

316
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,560
Lucy Mackenzie.

317
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,360
Said she worked at a club.
Which one?

318
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,040
Uhhh...

319
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Come on, Suzie?

320
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,559
Which club?

321
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,759
For God's sake, this Max is killing
every single member of Pilgrim.

322
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,840
Now tell me, Lucy Mackenzie,
where did she work, which club?!

323
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,040
Wolf.

324
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,920
The Wolf Bar.

325
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,919
POUNDING ROCK MUSIC

326
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,919
Cover the exits.

327
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,200
Bloody hell, like I didn't have
a banging headache already.

328
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,999
That's the glove, Gwen.

329
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,119
Gets inside your mind.

330
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,440
Yeah, all right Suzie, stop
creeping me out. Just tell us, any
sign of Max or this Lucy Mackenzie?

331
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,800
Nothing yet. Keep moving round.
Keep alert, people.

332
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,799
To repeat, Max is described as 40,
six-three, six-four, stocky, short
dark hair, tattoo down his left arm.

333
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,240
That narrows it down.

334
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,960
Can't even look at me, can you?

335
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,760
It's not like you
to be so judgemental.

336
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,839
Not like you to go
on a murder spree.

337
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,000
All right, so it
drives us mad, this job.

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,760
God knows, I've done
some stupid stuff.

339
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,160
But now, I've got to keep
on working, every day,

340
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,359
in a job that's got a bit
less honour, because of you.

341
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,000
Wait, I've got a match on that guy.

342
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,200
Where is he?
Northwest Bar. Show me.

343
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,320
Owen, get in closer,
which one do you mean?

344
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,639
Wait, he's going over for the...

345
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:18,960
Wait, I've got a match on our
girl, Lucy Mackenzie, the student.
That's her, that's definitely her.

346
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,559
It's too late, he's going over.

347
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,720
Got the bastard!

348
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,080
That isn't him.

349
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,399
Gwen! Behind you!

350
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
That's one for Ianto.

351
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,080
Risen mitten, life knife
and that old classic,

352
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,360
stun gun. Come on, let's get him
out of here. You saved my life.

353
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,679
Maybe I came back for a reason.

354
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,279
SIRENS WAIL

355
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,759
OK, so your name is Max Tresillian,
can you confirm that?

356
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,280
You live at 106 Endeavour
Terrace, is that right?

357
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,200
Parents, Sandra and Dave, yeah?

358
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
You're inside the
Torchwood facility.

359
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,040
GROWLS

360
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,479
And five, six...
Keep watching.

361
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,520
Soon as we reach ten...

362
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,440
Just stops dead.

363
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,680
If this is a drug-induced psychosis,
it's a very specific one.

364
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,880
Like he reacts to
the word Torchwood.

365
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,999
Thanks, Jack.

366
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,199
Sorry.

367
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:48,280
But if that's caused by
Retcon, we've got a million
more problems on the way.

368
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:52,960
Let me know what the scan says.
But, what about Suzie?

369
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,159
What are you gonna do with her?

370
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,159
No idea.

371
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,040
What do you think?

372
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,280
You're the boss.

373
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,159
Torchwood!

374
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,880
GROWLS

375
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,800
Can't you ask Jack?

376
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,320
Just one favour?
I want to see my father.

377
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,000
Tell us where he is,
we could bring him in.

378
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,880
I'm not letting him
anywhere near Torchwood.

379
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
If he's still alive.

380
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
What's wrong with him?

381
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,279
Cancer.

382
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,400
All that waiting, and
then I go and die first.

383
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
I could contact him on your behalf.

384
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
And say what?

385
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,879
So, tell me. Since I've been gone,
you enjoying it?

386
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:06,159
Yes. Well, you know,
this place is sort of...

387
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:12,639
It's mad, isn't it? Insane.
Bloody nuts. Best job I ever had.

388
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,959
Me too. And the worst.
Yeah, tell me about it.

389
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,760
Funny thing is, you always
imagine when you're dead,

390
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,239
they're gonna miss me at work.

391
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,760
Indispensable!

392
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,440
But look what happened.

393
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,399
I got replaced...

394
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,439
..by someone better.

395
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,159
You got that glove working,
better than I did. Just got lucky.

396
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,839
No, it's more than that.

397
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320
The others, they prefer you.
Don't say that.

398
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,560
You got my job.

399
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,040
Almost like you planned it.

400
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,760
Except I didn't.

401
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,279
And I'm sorry, but I've got
my own function at Torchwood

402
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,240
and I'm a lot more
than just a replacement.

403
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,920
Have you slept with Owen?

404
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,200
There you go,
replaced me completely.

405
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,559
I had a boyfriend who used
to walk into rooms like that.

406
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,120
The grand entrance.
It got kind of boring.

407
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,399
Although, he was one of twins, so
I put up with it. Twin acrobats.

408
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,279
Man, I gotta write that book.

409
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,279
Maybe even illustrate it. I can talk
for a long time, a very long time.

410
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,119
Takes me a while to piece
things together. Meaning?

411
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,839
Suzie had the glove.

412
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,320
You put her in charge of it.

413
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,760
But tell me, Jack, did you
ever ask about her father? How do
you mean? He's got cancer.

414
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,079
He's been dying
slowly now for years.

415
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,799
And what do you do? You give
his daughter the one device that
brings people back to life!

416
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
Is it any wonder she got
obsessed? Oh, so is this all
my fault?! Well, isn't it?

417
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,320
Did you ever stop and think?

418
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,960
Did you...

419
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,839
Did you ever look at Suzie?

420
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,760
Did you ever...

421
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,039
think what that glove
would do to her, did you?

422
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,639
Right from the start,

423
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,399
you thought that Suzie's
death was because of you,

424
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,199
Cos it happened when you arrived.

425
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:20,719
Then you brought her back
to life, all the way,
because you wanted it so much. OK!

426
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,720
We're both responsible!

427
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:30,199
Now, what the hell are we going
to do with her?! I don't know.

428
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,199
What if she never dies?

429
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:42,319
Have you thought of that? Like...

430
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,440
Undying, forever. Just you and her.
No way. Could be.

431
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,479
I wouldn't wish that on her.
I'd sooner kill her right now.

432
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:53,039
Could you, though? Kill her?
Yeah. Really? Oh, yeah.

433
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,240
'Jack, can you come to the
conference room? Something I need
you to see. Kind of urgent.'

434
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,920
I was going over Suzie
and Gwen's medical records.

435
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I ran them through the filter.
Watch the footage.

436
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,959
This is the moment when Gwen brought
back Mark Brisco, the husband.

437
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,959
See?

438
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,120
Now look at his death. See?

439
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,000
The energy flow stops
just as he's about to die. But...

440
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
have a look at Gwen with Suzie.

441
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,639
Whoa.

442
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,479
What is that?

443
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,799
Energy.

444
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,439
Life.

445
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:41,000
But with Suzie, it's a permanent
connection and she's getting
stronger. It's still going, now.

446
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,759
She's draining the life out of Gwen.

447
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,600
There's always a price.

448
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,800
More coffee? Is that all you do?
Just leave me alone.

449
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Have a biscuit, at least.

450
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,519
Go on.

451
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,880
Just for me.

452
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,199
The wearer of the glove
can bring somebody back, but
loses their own life in return.

453
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:11,599
How do we stop it?

454
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,439
We've got to kill her.

455
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,079
Suzie's got to die.

456
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,719
Again. Who's gonna do it?

457
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,999
Like you said.

458
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,480
I'm the boss.

459
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,800
Toshiko! Where the hell's Suzie?
And where's Gwen?

460
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
Interrogation Room.

461
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,160
No they're not... Find them, fast!

462
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,560
I can't see them.

463
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,480
Hold on. Scanning. Nope.

464
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,159
Nothing on internal scans.

465
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,599
What's going on, where've they
gone? Just keep looking... Bring
up the SUV. Still there.

466
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,880
I'll try exteriors...
What about Gwen's car?

467
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,600
What's she doing?
Getting herself fired.

468
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,440
Unbelievable. How stupid is that?
Thinking she could just drive off.
Come on. Let's go get them.

469
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
What the hell...

470
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,320
Ianto?

471
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,039
Ianto? Captain!

472
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,600
What happened?

473
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,199
I thought you must've done it.

474
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,759
We've gone into lockdown.

475
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,759
Then reverse it! I can't.

476
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,359
It's 100%.

477
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,440
The doors are sealed.

478
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,519
We're locked in! I'm taking you
to see your dad and that's it, OK?

479
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,800
Sorry.

480
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,039
I must be mad.

481
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,920
Jack's not stupid.

482
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,559
He's gonna catch us.

483
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,400
Oh, you never know.

484
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,480
We might get lucky.

485
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:04,320
Everything's gone. Computers,
mobile coverage, the lifts,
everything... We're sealed in.

486
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,599
How long does Gwen have
before she dies? Two hours,
maybe less. Come on! Think!

487
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:12,559
If Suzie set up the lockdown, how
did she do it? Entered an override?

488
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,559
She's officially dead,
she wouldn't get access.

489
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,280
Then how did she do it?
What the hell did she do?!

490
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,999
There's got to be an answer.
Suzie couldn't physically
start the lockdown,

491
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:29,960
Gwen wouldn't have let her.
But there's no-one else! Wait
a minute... We've got a guest.

492
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,400
..Stopped for me

493
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,440
The carriage held but just
ourselves and immortality

494
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,280
Because I could not stop
for death... Is that a poem?

495
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I wonder. Emily Dickinson?

496
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,200
But what does it mean?
It's a verbal trigger.

497
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,119
Say it out loud, maybe repeat it 100
times over and the Hub locks down.

498
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,400
But if that's part of the system,
Suzie must've installed a vocal
command programme, way back.

499
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,160
Back when she was alive, yeah.

500
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,999
Max is just a Trojan horse. Suzie
planned this right from the start.

501
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,959
'Do you see? Max, the Retcon,
everything, it's all been a hoax
to get us to resurrect Suzie.'

502
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,160
She gave Max a whole complex
of subconscious triggers.

503
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,320
Like, she dies,
Max becomes a time bomb...

504
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,159
He doesn't see her for three months
and, wham, the orders kick in.

505
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,439
He follows Suzie's program,
and starts killing.

506
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,759
And the whole chain of events
forces us to bring Suzie back.

507
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,599
And then she escapes! That is not
bad! I'm picking her for my team.

508
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,439
If she could lockdown the Hub,

509
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:39,079
she must've installed
a way of reversing it.

510
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,839
A bit more colour in your cheeks.

511
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,720
It's all thanks to you.

512
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,560
That night...

513
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,800
my last night on Earth,
or so I thought...

514
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,719
..before I shot myself, I shot
Jack right through the head.

515
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:11,320
I killed him, stone dead and
then he just stood up and lived.

516
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,560
Am I right? Did that happen?

517
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,320
Gwen? Yes, it did.

518
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,559
So he can survive a bullet
through the head? Yeah. How?

519
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,119
I don't know.

520
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,799
He won't explain it properly.

521
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:28,159
Said something happened
to him a while back. He said...

522
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:32,280
He said he can't die.

523
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,439
Not ever.

524
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,039
And he makes judgments about
whether I'm allowed to live.

525
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,719
It's all very easy for
Captain Jack, isn't it?

526
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,239
Do you ever wonder? What?

527
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,719
Who is he?

528
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,920
All the time.

529
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,919
DIALLING TONE
I've got reception, sir.

530
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
How do you do that?

531
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,000
We're sealed off! Just used
the Water Tower as a relay.

532
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,560
Nice work, Ianto!

533
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,719
But who the hell do we phone?!

534
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,959
PHONE RINGS
Detective Swanson.

535
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,080
Who is it? Torchwood.

536
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,320
You'd better not be wasting my time.

537
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,319
I was wondering if you could
do us a favour. The humble police,
helping the mighty Torchwood?

538
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,039
Why don't you just help
yourselves? Like you normally do.
Because we can't. Why's that?

539
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,240
Why don't you just help
yourselves? Like you normally do.
Because we can't. Why's that?

540
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,199
We're sort of busy.

541
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:51,199
Well, I'm busy too,
try someone else. No, no, no...

542
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,560
It's just because we can't at the
moment because we're sort of stuck.

543
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,760
In what way? We're locked in.

544
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,280
You're locked in?

545
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,279
Just a bit. Locked in where?

546
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:06,240
Um. In our own base.
You're locked inside your own base?

547
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,720
And it's not funny.

548
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,479
And how am I supposed to help you,
exactly? We need a book of poetry.

549
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,320
'It's NOT funny!'

550
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,600
Oh, God, driving at night...

551
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,559
GWEN SWITCHES RADIO ON

552
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,519
# Just a little... #

553
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,160
Oh, my God.

554
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,799
I don't know this one.

555
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,999
It's ancient.

556
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:43,080
My Mum used to sing this,

557
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,520
when I was a kid.

558
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,119
All those years ago...

559
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,640
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #

560
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,920
..before I died.

561
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:57,999
# Soleil, soleil

562
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:00,679
# Soleil, soleil

563
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,320
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #

564
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,759
All right, Captain Jack,
just say that one more time.
Nice and clear.

565
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:15,399
LOUDSPEAKER: We're locked in our
own base and we can't get out.

566
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,960
LAUGHTER

567
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,279
OK, you've had your fun.
Listen, Detective Swanson,
one of our team is in danger.

568
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,319
Right, you lot, back to work...

569
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:26,799
OK, we've got it.

570
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:31,759
The Complete Poems,
it's gonna cost you 20 quid.

571
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,640
What does the book say? Er, I don't
know, what am I supposed to do?!

572
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,160
Find I Could Not Stop For Death.

573
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,879
Read out the next verse.
What if it doesn't work?

574
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,080
Read out the whole book.

575
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,559
It's gonna be a long night.

576
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,280
Tired?

577
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm fine.

578
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,400
Don't want you falling
asleep at the wheel.

579
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,039
One corpse is enough for this
car, thanks. Don't say that.

580
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,680
What? Corpse. Cos you're not.

581
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,719
What am I, then?
I dunno, you're just not, though.

582
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,960
When you're dead...

583
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,799
I mean, when you die...
What happens?

584
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:28,240
What do you want me to say?
The truth. Really?

585
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Tell me.

586
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,079
You religious? Just sort of
in passing, you know.

587
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,039
Do you believe in Heaven? I dunno.
Yes, you do. What do you believe?

588
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:46,599
Stupid, but I always
sort of think...

589
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,959
Like, you know,
white light and all that.

590
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,079
And I think of my Gran.

591
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,280
Like she'll be there.

592
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,759
Waiting for me.

593
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,040
The smell of carbolic.

594
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,240
Your faith never left primary school.

595
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,119
So what's out there?

596
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,519
Nothing.

597
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,319
Just nothing.

598
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,239
But, if there's nothing,
what's the point of it all?

599
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,080
This is.

600
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,240
Driving through the dark.

601
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,159
All this stupid, tiny stuff.

602
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,840
We're just animals,
howling in the night,

603
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,560
cos it's better than silence.

604
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,919
I used to think about Torchwood,
all those aliens, coming to Earth...

605
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,719
What the hell for?

606
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,480
But it's just instinct.

607
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,320
They come here cos
there's life, that's all.

608
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,000
Moths around a flame.

609
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,760
Creatures clinging
together in the cold.

610
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,680
So when you die, it's just...

611
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,999
Darkness.

612
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,439
And you're all alone?
There's no-one else?

613
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,120
I didn't say that. What do you mean?

614
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:16,639
Why do you think I'm so
desperate to come back?

615
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,080
There's something out there...

616
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,599
in the dark...

617
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,399
..and it's moving.

618
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,519
Parting is all we know of
heaven and all we need of hell.

619
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,359
No, try another.

620
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:44,000
Success is counted sweetest
by those who ne'er succeed.

621
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,879
Christ, she was a bundle of laughs.

622
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:49,399
Success is counted sweetest by
those who ne'er succeed. Nope.

623
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,639
Wait a minute, just had a thought...

624
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,320
If words cause the lockdown,
maybe numbers reverse it...

625
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,240
Try the ISBN, every book's
got a different number.

626
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,720
You getting this? Yup, hang on,
I'm looking... Read it out.

627
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,920
The keyboards aren't working. The
membrane might recognise the code.

628
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,439
OK. Got it!

629
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:13,879
ISBN 019 8600 585.

630
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,080
That's it! Everybody,
move, move! Cathy, thank you.

631
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,600
Pleasure!

632
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:33,999
I've got the tracker on
Gwen's car. It's a hospital.
Giving you the co-ordinates now.

633
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:40,600
On the way. How long's she got?
It's only a guess, but I'd give
Gwen about 40 minutes.

634
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,839
Kathy, I want the road
ahead clear. I'm gonna break
the speed limit, big time.

635
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:49,840
All units, give Torchwood priority,
repeat, give Torchwood priority.

636
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,559
MACHINE BEEPS

637
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,160
Suzie... I don't, em... I'm not...

638
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,159
Oh, my God, this headache, it's...

639
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,199
What's happening to me?

640
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,079
I'm sorry, Gwen.

641
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,199
You're getting shot in the head.

642
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,999
Slowly.

643
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:37,920
And believe me, it hurts.

644
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,800
Almost better.

645
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,320
Completely gone, soon.

646
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,199
No!

647
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,559
No, no, no...

648
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:56,560
Dad?

GWEN CRIES

650
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,880
It's me, Dad.

00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:04,440
Wake up!

652
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,479
Dad? It's Suzie.

653
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,480
Hello, Dad.

654
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,239
Ow!

655
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,440
And goodbye.

656
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,399
What are you doing?

657
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:27,040
BEEPING
Oh, that's worth coming back for.

658
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
Sending him into the dark.

659
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,600
Just what the bastard deserves.

660
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,679
They're moving again. Can't predict
a specific destination, not yet.

661
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,999
Keep feeding it through,
we're catching up.
PHONE RINGS

662
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:54,400
Hello?

663
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,359
Did you like the poem, Jack?

664
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:59,200
Suzie, don't let her die.

665
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,119
The glove is killing Gwen
and keeping you alive. I know.

666
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,839
Then stop. But I get to live.

667
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,280
Why would I stop? For Gwen's sake.

668
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,159
She replaced me.

669
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,359
Now, I'm doing the same
to her. Isn't that fair?

670
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,999
Suzie, we've got a tracker
on that car, we're gonna
catch up, I promise.

671
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:26,200
And what happens then?
If she's dead, then I'm gonna
kill you, Suzie Costello.

672
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,799
I promise, I'm gonna kill you
for the last and final time.

673
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:32,760
But would you?

674
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,200
When there's a part of her
that's now me?

675
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,079
Could you really do that
if I'm the only thing left of her?

676
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,800
Why are you doing this?

677
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,079
Because life is all, Jack.

678
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,680
You should know.

679
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,399
I'd do anything to stay.

680
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:52,879
Anything.

681
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:55,039
Suzie. Please. Just stop.

682
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:01,159
She's a real find, this one.
Gwen Cooper.

683
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,520
She's better than me.

684
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,160
She's so much better.

685
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,719
I was never any good.

686
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,280
Jack, I'm sorry.

687
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,519
SUZIE!

688
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:21,520
Jack, she's heading for
the coast line on the B587.

689
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,839
It's a place called Hedley Point,
there's some sort of ferry, goes
out to the islands. Get a move on.

690
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:26,919
Owen, how long we got?

691
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,119
Minutes.

692
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,199
It's beautiful, Gwen.

693
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,119
Can you see?

694
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:58,360
We'll take the ferry.

695
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,039
Go out. As far as we can.

696
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,840
Keep on running
cos he won't hurt us.

697
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,199
We'll keep on going, you and me...

698
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

699
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,800
Have you gone? Gwen?

700
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,799
Can you hear me? Gwen?

701
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:33,439
Poor Gwen Cooper.

702
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,319
Safe journey.

703
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,480
Let her go.

704
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,640
I can't.

705
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,360
Let Gwen go. I can't.

706
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,720
Owen, how is she?

707
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,600
Owen! Report!

708
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,799
I think we're too late.
If I kill you, does she live?

709
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,800
But you can't, Jack.
Cos look at me.

710
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,119
I'm the last thing left of
Gwen Cooper, can't you see it?

711
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,040
Just the smallest bit of her?

712
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,920
Not one bit.

713
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,919
Owen? Anything?

714
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:15,599
Nothing. But I broke the connection.

715
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,559
I killed you. Can't die.

716
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,879
Never gonna die.

717
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,079
How much more of this do you want?

718
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,880
It's all your fault, Jack.

719
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,559
You recruited me.

720
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,880
The glove. Tosh! Destroy the glove!
It's keeping them connected!

721
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,879
Ianto, armaments, code five.

722
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:06,920
Captain, my captain.

723
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,559
Do you want to know a secret?

724
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,920
There's something moving in the dark

725
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,679
and it's coming,

726
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,359
Jack Harkness.

727
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:23,920
It's coming for you.

728
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:29,200
Whoah! Whoah! It's OK.

729
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,159
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

730
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:35,680
SIRENS WAIL

731
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,520
# If I should die this very moment

732
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,079
# I wouldn't fear

733
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:51,079
# For I have never
known completeness

734
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,240
# Like being here

735
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,959
# Wrapped in the warmth of you

736
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:04,559
# Loving every breath of you

737
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,199
# Still my heart, this moment

738
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:14,239
# Or it might burst

739
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,400
# Could we stay right here
till the end of time?

740
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,880
# Till the earth stops turning?

741
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:30,679
# Wanna love you
till the seas run dry

742
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:37,560
# I found the one
I've waited for. #

743
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,760
Thanks for doing this.
Part of my job, sir.

744
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,359
No, I should be doing it, but...

745
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:06,640
One day, we're going
to run out of space...

746
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,799
If you're interested...

747
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,839
I've still got that stopwatch.

748
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:18,279
So?

749
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:21,880
Well. Well, think about it.

750
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,559
Lots of things you can do
with a stopwatch.

751
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,279
Oh, yeah.

752
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:31,400
I can think of a few.
There's quite a list.

753
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,839
I'll send the others home early.

754
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,680
See you in my office in ten.

755
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,440
That's ten minutes and counting.

756
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,759
Oh, Jack?

757
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,600
What do you want me to say
on the death certificate?

758
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,520
Good question.

759
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
She had quite a few
deaths in the end.

760
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,960
I don't know.

761
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,640
Death by Torchwood.

762
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,479
I'll put a lock on the door,

763
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:03,599
just in case she goes walking again.

764
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,679
Nah, no chance of that.

765
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:10,039
The resurrection days are over,
thank God.

766
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,640
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure.

767
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,639
That's the thing about gloves, sir.

768
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,720
They come in pairs.

769
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,840
