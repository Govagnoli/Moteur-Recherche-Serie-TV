Torchwood.

00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:06,329
outside the Government, beyond the police.

00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,377
Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:13,770
The 21st century is when everything changes,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,743

Mike

8
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,100
did you hear that?

9
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,111
Someone's in the living room!

10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,193
-Are you gonna go in there?
-Are you?

11
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,051
-Emergency, which service? 
-Police.

12
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:13,540
My name's Beth Halloran, 
I'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens.

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,985
I think there's a burglar in the flat,
come quickly.

14
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:18,362
-Come on!
-Mike! Mike!

15
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:20,692
Sit down!-

16
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,419
of them! My husband's been injured, send an ambulance!

17
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:24,865
Get the TV stuff unhooked.

18
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,385
-just take whatever you want!
-Keep her quiet.

19
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,456
Wait, wait. Did you hear that?

20
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:34,303
Emergency ****

21
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,051
-What's happening?
-Get away from me!

22
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,457
-What is that thing? 
-Please, don't...

23
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:41,167
Don't... Please...Stop, Stop!

24
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,611
-I'm sorry!
-What's going on?!

25
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,815
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,678
No-0-0-o!

27
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:50,080
Get away! No-0-0-o!

29
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,382
Tosh, what happened?

30
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,238
Two IC one males, one fatality, one seriously wounded

31
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:08,248
after a fall from a fifth-floor window onto a police vehicle.

32
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,651
Bloody hell! Here you are, 
has he been stabilised?

33
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:22,294
Gwen, Owen, go with him to the hospital, 
see if he says anything.

34
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,469
Interview the husband and wife while you're there. Tosh, with me.

35
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,780
Bit weird, this one. Might be one of yours.

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,523
Nobody saw anything, heard anything, blah, blah, blah.

37
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,983
Dunno why we bother asking anymore.

38
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,612
Thanks, we'll take it from here. 
If you could just wait outside.

39
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:44,977
-In my opinion, the husband 
did it. He was expecting to be burgled.
-Really?

40
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:49,307
Yeah, look. No other reason I can think of 
for keeping sports equipment in the bedroom.

41
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:52,330
0h, you should come round to my house for a game of hockey sometime.

42
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:57,928
-Making friends?
-Not really. What have you got?

43
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,978
No glass inside, 
so it was definitely broken out.

44
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:06,595
Police say the stab wounds were caused 
by some long, narrow blade. 
Which that isn't.

45
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:10,385
No other weapons in the room could have done this. So how the hell did they manage it?

46
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:13,473
Husband was unconscious, 
and the wife probably weighs less than I do.

47
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:18,370
-I can't see either of them doing this.
-you'd be surprised what you can do.

48
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:24,412
I didn't see anything. We all heard this weird noise,

49
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:31,570
then the next thing I know, I'm in the corner and he's just sitting there, dead.

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,580
-The other one was just gone. 
-And then what?

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,464
Nothing. I just stayed there till the police arrived. I couldn't move.

52
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:39,852
I should have checked on Mike.

53
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:44,021
Don't be silly. You did the right thing. I'm fine.

54
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,532
Be quiet, you. The doctor said you should rest.

55
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,225
I don't think the doctor meant my mouth.

56
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,162
Actually, he did, he was very specific.

57
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,042
He said, 'No talking for a whole week.'

58
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,123
Lies, lies! Why so many lies?!

59
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:02,815
OK, thanks for your time. We'll let you get some rest now.

60
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,585
-Not a trace of blood on their hands, either of them. 
-Then who did it?

61
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:11,003
-She did, obviously. 
-Why obviously?

62
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,503
Well, look at her.

63
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,682
It's OK.

64
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:22,254
Yeah, I can see what you're saying, she's absolutely terrified.

65
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:28,589
It's always the one you least suspect. Hubby's out cold, and she survives while two burglars get mangled?

66
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,743
-She did it, she must have. 
-How?

67
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:33,446
-I haven't worked that bit out yet.
-Ah, I see, I see.

68
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,681
All right then, jessica Fletcher, 
who dunn it?

69
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:39,559
The husband. His wife's in danger, 
he has a cricket bat under the bed.

70
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,114
-You fill in the blanks.
-Right, OK.

71
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,807
So, he kills one man, wearing gloves, 
and then he swallows the murder weapon

72
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,112
and the gloves, 
and then he knocks himself out?

73
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:52,191
-Something like that, yeah.
-To be continued.

74
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,183
-Yeah?/It's me. Anything?
-No, nothing. They're completely clear.

75
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:58,944
Well, one of them did it, 
we just need to figure out how.

76
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:03,315
Stay with the burglar
all night if you have to. 
Keep an eye on those two.

77
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,027
-OK, fair enough. 
-Tosh...

78
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:09,410
That was jack. 
He says that you should stay with the burglar,

79
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,440
and find out if he knows anything, 
all night, if you have to. I know.

80
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,305
-And keep an eye on the other two.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.

81
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,466
Oh, will you get me a coffee before you go?

82
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,481
Yeah, course. What are team mates for?

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,700
You haven't got a pound for the machine, have you?

84
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:31,434
Hospitals. They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them.

85
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,595
-Pound. Coffee. 
-Thank you!

86
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:11,834
Oh, you're safe, all right? 
You're safe, just tell me who did this to you.

87
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,234
The woman.....in the flat,

88
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,888
keep her away from me!

89
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:23,331
Page the doctor. 
Can you move, please? 
We need to lie him down. ********

90
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:29,217
-Tell me everything. 
-Where am I?

91
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:31,135
-Where's my husband? 
-He's safe.

92
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,135
-What do you mean, safe? 
What have you done with him? 
-Nothing yet.

93
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,196
Tell me what happened in the flat, Beth.

94
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:42,364
It had to be you or Mike, so how did you do it?

95
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,107
You can't treat people like this.

96
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,512
I've been burgled, attacked!

97
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:48,741
I want a lawyer, I want a phone call.

98
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,137
-If you're charging me...
-We're not charging you. 
We don't have to.

99
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:55,987
There'll be no lawyer, no phone calls, 
just us, and this room

100
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:59,445
for as long as it takes. 
Now, tell me what happened!

101
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:04,445
I told her... and the police. 
Please, I don't know anything!

102
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,205
Look at them.

103
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:18,010
The second one just died in hospital. 'Keep her away from me, the woman in the flat.'

104
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,358
Those were his dying words. Why would he say something like that?!

105
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,761
I don't know, I swear. I never touched him.

106
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,782
-Is it Mike? Are you covering for him? 
-No!

107
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:28,687
Jack?

108
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,414
Beth, we know these men attacked you and your husband.

109
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:44,066
Now, if you fought back, 
people will understand.

110
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,571
It was self-defence.

111
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,725
I promise...I promise I have no idea what happened to them.

112
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,328
All I know is that it wasn't me.

113
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:07,059
'just us and this room for as long as it takes?'

114
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,566
Terrifying.

115
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,548
-Really? 
-Absolutely. 
Shivers down my spine.

116
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:16,635
-You don't look scared.
-Oh, it...passed.

117
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:22,660
-Tosh, anything on the body scan?
-Nothing out of the ordinary.

118
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,454
-What about the light? Power surge?
-Nothing from us.

119
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:29,519
There was an electro-magnetic build-up around her, but how did she cause it?

120
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,024
Same thing happened at the hospital. Can't be a coincidence.

121
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,552
It's her, I know it is.

122
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:40,368
-OK, let's do some tests, 
see who or what we're dealing with. 
-I'm on it.

123
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,974
What kind of tests?

124
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,748
just little things to clear this all up. 
Blood samples...

125
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,957
Blood samples? 
I haven't done anything!

126
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:53,684
Look. ..

127
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:56,505
I believe you, but this is our job.

128
00:08:56,505 --> 00:09:00,914
Something strange happened at your flat. We've gotta make sure you had nothing to do with it.

129
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,726
-I didn't.
-Then you've nothing to worry about.

130
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,426
They're doing these tests whether you like it or not.

131
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:10,844
Don't make this any harder on yourself. Come on.

132
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,252
This is where you work?

133
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:27,773
Yep. Cosy, isn't it?

134
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,859
Who are you people?

135
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,214
Don't you have any windows?

136
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:37,320
It wouldn't really be in keeping with the whole secrecy thing, people looking in.

137
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:41,345
-We don't sniff the sub-etheric resonator. 
-Sorry.

138
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,023
It's so big.

139
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,851
-This is crazy. 
-Yep.

140
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:54,318
I suddenly feel very, very small.

141
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:55,770
Come on.

142
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,767
Let's just get these tests done. Then you can get home, OK?

143
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,477
-Come on, Owen.
-We'll start with a few blood tests, 
nothing to worry about,

144
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,654
just a little...needle.

145
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:10,243
-What? 
-Needle's snapped.

146
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,478
-Haven't you got a nurse to do this?
-He's a doctor. It's OK.

147
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,193
I'm not gonna do this if you can't even...
What are you doing?

148
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:25,149
-Bear with me.
-Hey, hey!

149
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:30,032
When was the last time you were in hospital, Beth?

150
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:33,699
I don't remember. 
I don't think I ever have. 
Why, what's wrong with me?

151
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,092
-Any operations? Checkups?
-No, nothing.

152
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:39,841
When was the last time you felt ill? You had a cold?

153
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,293
I don't think I ever have. 
I take a lot of vitamin C.

154
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,630
Mm, hell of a lot I reckon.

155
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,900
OK, Beth. You make light bulbs blow, we can't break your skin.
What planet are you from?

156
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,247
Earth.

157
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,792
Stop wasting our time! 
We know you're an alien!

158
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,117
There's no such thing as aliens.

159
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,728
Beth, janet.

160
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,515
janet, Beth.

161
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,244
-What is it?
-It's an alien. But you know that cos you are, too.

162
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:15,557
No, it's not.

163
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,252
I'm not. I work in an office...

164
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:20,501
Why do you give off electro-magnetic waves? Why?!

165
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:24,075
I don't know! Stop it!

166
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,698
Why are you doing this?! I want Mike.

167
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,150
I want to go home.

168
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:37,400
Why is it doing that?

169
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,869
I don't know.

170
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:41,025
It's never done it before.

171
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,452
-This is real, isn't it? 
-Yeah.

172
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,582
I don't know about my skin, 
or any of that other stuff.

173
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,826
I just... How can I prove it to you?

174
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:56,227
How can I...prove to you...

175
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,127
that I'm not an alien?

176
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,743
-You said we weren't allowed to use that again. 
-It's just a mind probe.

177
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,696
-Remember what happened last time we used it? 
-That was different.

178
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,270
That species has extremely high blood pressure.

179
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,302
0h, right, their heads must explode all the time.

180
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,675
Jack, You can't do this. 
What if you're wrong?

181
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:30,734
-If she's human, it'll kill her.
-I'm not wrong.

182
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,070
-We have to find out what she is.
-Take it easy, jack.

183
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,257
-Stop at the first sign of trouble.
-Or the first sign of exploding.

184
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,196
Gwen...

185
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:40,547
bring her up.

186
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:42,874
OK.

187
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,163
Hey!

188
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,376
-Not too tight, is it? 
-It's fine.

189
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,870
-Are you sure this is safe? 
-Yep.

190
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,193
just try not to, you know, 
kill me, or anything, OK?

191
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:03,441
You'll probably get dehydrated during the probing.

192
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,078
Thank you.

193
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,803
-We're all set. 
-The probe drills down through 
your consciousness,

194
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:24,987
so if there's anything hidden, 
it'll pop to the surface.

195
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:25,809
Will it hurt?

196
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:27,385
Yeah.

197
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:30,959
Your bedside manner's rubbish.

198
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,652
You should see his manners in bed, 
they're atrocious. So I've heard.

199
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,032
0h, they are. I remember this...

200
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:40,806
-All right, we all ready?
-I suppose.

201
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:45,796
OK, we'll do this slowly. 
Tosh will controlthe probe, 
Owen will make sure you're not in danger,

202
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:50,514
Ianto will have more water when you need it, 
and I'll be right here, OK?

203
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,432
What about him? 
What does he do?

204
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:53,745
I'll be watching.

205
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,737
Are you ready, Beth?

206
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,903
All right.

207
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:03,511
OK, Tosh.

208
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:14,310
Human.

209
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,600
-Safe. 
-Who killed the burglars, Beth?

210
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,637
I don't know! I... Ah!

211
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,059
-Safe. 
-What planet are you from?

212
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,785
I'm human! 0h, God, it hurts!

213
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,986
-Please, please, stop!
-Go deeper.

214
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:38,326
-Are you sure? She...
-Do it!

215
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,090
Vital signs are all over the place, 
but still safe.

216
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,300
Getting electro-magnetic build-up again.

217
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,340
Who killed those men?!

218
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,439
I don't know! Make it stop!

219
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,494
-That's it, come on! 
-Go deeper.

220
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,709
-Safe.
-Deeper!

221
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,585
Something's happening to the lights!

222
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,625
-The electro-magnetic pulse is off the scale. 
-She can't take much more!

223
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,305
jack, we've got to stop this!

224
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,611
Oh, my God!

225
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:58,555
I wouldn't get that close.
Toshiko, what happened?

226
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,608
Hit a buried compartment. Locked away.

227
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:04,378
She couldn't have been aware of it.

228
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:14,799
-Who are you? 
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

229
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:21,149
-Where are you from? 
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

230
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,846
How do you like my boots?

231
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:32,939
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

232
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:39,711
jack, what is it, what is she saying?

233
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,871
Name, rank, serial number, 
and that's all she's gonna say.

234
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,411
How do you know?

235
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:48,250
Cos I know who she is 
and why she's here.

236
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,838
-Switch off the probe. 
-Off.

237
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:15,435
0h, you weren't lying, that really hurt!

238
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:20,845
Did you find anything?

239
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:32,836
She's a sleeper agent. 
It all clicked when I saw the implant.

240
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:34,715
A sleeper agent? Who for?

241
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:37,309
No-one knows very much, 
they don't leave survivors.

242
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,591
Official designation is Cell 114.

243
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:43,484
They infiltrate planets, 
adapting their bodies, 
gathering intelligence,

244
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:47,168
sometimes for years, watching, 
until they're ready to take over.

245
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,320
OK, that's...creepy.

246
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,223
If we're lucky, she's the first.

247
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:55,729
They send an advance guard to gather intel.

248
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:59,682
Given false memories so they blend in.

249
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,929
She has no idea she's not human.

250
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,413
Her real self must have taken over briefly, 
killed the burglars.

251
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,124
-Self preservation.
-Told you she did it.

252
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:17,009
Yeah, The point is, by the time they attack, 
they know every single thing about the planet.

253
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:18,199
Tosh.

254
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,338
The implant gathers information. 
Normal X-rays don't show it.

255
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,873
She's projecting a false image.

256
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,305
It's got all this data stored inside it.

257
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:38,190
This is a force-field generator. 
it creates an impervious layer above the skin, 
just a nanometre thick.

258
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,297
-That's why you couldn't get the needle inside her. 
-Right, well...

259
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:44,017
God, look, they even know about us.

260
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,048
They know more about this place than I do. 
Nobody knows more than I do.

261
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:50,925
What if there's more of them? 
What are we gonna do about this?

262
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,122
For a start...

263
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,206
I think we should tell her.

264
00:18:55,383 --> 00:19:01,478
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

265
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:05,879
-Where are you from?
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh...

266
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,243
Can you turn it off, please?

267
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,784
-So I killed those men? 
-Yes.

268
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,022
And I'm a mass-murdering alien?

269
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:24,874
-Yes. 
-My whole life...

270
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,505
all my memories, they can't be fake.

271
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,427
I know I love Mike...

272
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:35,299
-and he loves me.
-He does, and you do.

273
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:42,252
-So what's real?
-You both are, you both fell in love.
That happened.

274
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,506
Do you feel human?

275
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:50,687
-Yes.
-Yes. Well, then you are.

276
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:54,132
What makes us human?
Is it our minds or our bodies?

277
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:02,751
And what happens when the disguise comes off?
I want to have kids one day.

278
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:06,827
Is feeling human...
enough for that?

279
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,309
Can you fix me? 
Can you make me human?

280
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,426
No.
Eventually, you'll activate.

281
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:19,983
Your real memories will come back,
and Beth will disappear.

282
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,395
What do you mean, activate?

283
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:26,943
Once you gather enough information, 
you'll send it back home, 
and start the invasion.

284
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,788
There must be something you can do.

285
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:33,531
All this technology, everything you do here...

286
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,782
You can't keep me locked up next to that thing!

287
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,041
-Are you gonna kill me?
-No. No, of course we're not.

288
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,456
Have you killed other aliens?

289
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,602
Only when we've had to.
When it was the last resort -

290
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,917
kill or be killed.

291
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,357
I wish this wasn't happening.

292
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,022
I'd never know.
I'd just live a normal life.

293
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:19,071
-Until the day ofthe attack.
-I won't do anything! 
I'm not that person!

294
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:23,576
I'm sorry, but you are.

295
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:46,503
We can't let her go, 
she's too dangerous.

296
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:51,089
We could freeze her. 
Use the alien cryogenics.

297
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,365
Wake her up if we figure out 
how to stop her memories from coming back.

298
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:57,439
-Freeze her? For how long?
-As long as it takes.

299
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,366
-At least she'd be alive.
-Her implant would still gather information.

300
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:04,565
-Can't we deactivate it?
-I can isolate the transceiver 
and fry it in an EM pulse.

301
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:09,686
Right now It's not sending or receiving anything now. I've checked it five times on every frequency.

302
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:11,188
Won't that let them know we're onto them?

303
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:15,597
No. If we freeze her, she'll never activate and they'll never know.

304
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,169
What about her husband?

305
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,184
She'd have to disappear completely.

306
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,419
No goodbyes.

307
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:30,806
We had a holiday booked.
Nothing special, just a weekend away.

308
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,817
-Am I ever gonna see him again?
-I don't know.

309
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,954
0h, those men...

310
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,068
0h, my God, those poor men!

311
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,741
What's happening?!

312
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:57,769
The real memory is coming back, 
destroying the fake human persona.

313
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:00,169
The sooner we do this, 
the better for everyone.

314
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,322
Beth? Beth, come on.

315
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:11,580
Promise me something, 
if you can't figure out how to keep me human,

316
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,487
don't wake me up.
just turn the machine off.

317
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:17,502
That's not a promise I can keep.

318
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:23,574
OK, you then. I bet you can.

319
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:28,297
-just don't let me hurt anyone.
-You have my word.

320
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:35,007
It's funny, I've always had this nagging feeling like I didn't fit in.

321
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:39,554
just. . .so desperate to have a more exciting life.

322
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:43,957
-I'm going to hit the transceiver with an EM pulse.
-You won't feel anything. It won't harm you.

323
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:48,827
It'll take out the force-field generator too 
so I'll have to fry them both.

324
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,148
Do it. I don't want to be invincible.

325
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:55,254
After that I'm gonna sedate you, 
then we'll freeze you.

326
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:58,360
It'll be just like going to sleep.

327
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,990
Only a bit colder.

328
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,562
-Bye, Gwen. 
-Bye.

329
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:13,681
Done.

330
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,781
'If you want the whole bloody seat to yourself, be my guest.

331
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:39,579
'In fact,' I said, 
'why don't we ask the other passengers to get off,

332
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,588
'and you can have the whole carriage to yourself?
Would you like that?'

333
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:45,739
-You didn't!
-I did. I was really loud, too.

334
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,855
I couldn't help it, I was just really annoyed. So then...

335
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:54,144
So then, right, she gives me the dirtiest look, right, and she...

336
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:59,305
David?

337
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:03,885
What is that?!

338
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,266
What's happened to your arm?

339
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,954
Hey! Where are you going?

340
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:15,466
David, you're scaring me!

341
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:20,221
What are you doing? 
What's happening? 
Come back here!

342
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:23,954
David!

343
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,758
It's done.

344
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,705
I'm sending her down to the vault.

345
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,078
-Can somebody tell me 
what the hell is going on?
-0h, shit!

346
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,508
-What happened?
-Beth's gone.

347
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:20,684
-I thought she was frozen! 
-She was! Her vitals were at zero.

348
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:26,075
-Checking systems, command history...
-What did she do? 
Is it a virus, a lockdown?

349
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:30,940
-No, she just turned off the lights.
-What is it with her and light bulbs?

350
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,535
-She went through the tunnels.
-Time to change the locks again.

351
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:38,969
She knew everything about this place, 
it was all in her arm. The tunnels, 
layout, security codes.

352
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:42,003
She could've shut us down, 
blown us up, anything!

353
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,220
-She didn't.
-I swear she was frozen.

354
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,071
-Tosh, you switched off the transceiver?
-Yes.

355
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,210
-Are you sure?
-Well, I was until you asked.

356
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,637
-Unless there was another false image.
-Hang on, hang on.

357
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:57,168
Everything about her was a lie.
All of her vital signs were a false image.

358
00:27:57,168 --> 00:28:00,791
She can fool the equipment, 
tell it what we're expecting to see,

359
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:05,575
so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate, we try and freeze it and it does the opposite.

360
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:09,244
Simulating that much information would need a huge amount of energy.

361
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:13,912
-No wonder she had a big electro-magnetic field. 
-That's why the lights blew when she got upset.

362
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:16,081
So, what's she doing?
Did we activate her?

363
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:18,524
She couldn't be activated.
If she was, we'd all be dead.

364
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:21,564
We took her off the network.

365
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:22,888
She has some other agenda.

366
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:27,162
Hey.

367
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:29,324
How are you feeling?

368
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:33,466
What's going on?
Nobody will tell me anything.

369
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:37,134
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

370
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:43,718
Listen, you know l love you, don't you?

371
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:46,086
Course I do. I love you, too.

372
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,941
-Do you promise? 
-Why?

373
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:55,539
I just had to be sure.

374
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:59,126
I have to go away.

375
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,067
What do you mean? Where?

376
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:07,152
I can't tell you, but it's for your own good.

377
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,812
Beth, what are you talking about?

378
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:13,185
No. I'm sorry. I just...
I have to stay away from you.

379
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:17,188
If I don't...I'm gonna end up hurting you.

380
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,906
Well, this is hurting me. Don't go.

381
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:25,670
Whatever happens...

382
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,756
just know that I love you...

383
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:31,270
and I always will.

384
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:37,632
If you've...If you've done something, 
I don't care,

385
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:41,718
-just don't leave me. 
We'll get through this. 
-No, not this time.

386
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:46,878
I have to put things straight, and I can't do that anywhere near you.

387
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:50,287
-I love you too much for that. 
-Don't let the police take you!

388
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:55,993
I'm not gonna let you go. I don't care what it is, I don't care what...

389
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:02,638
-What was that? 
-I don't know. It sounded like...

390
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,039
He... Help!

391
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,383
Help! Somebody, get a doctor!

392
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:27,385
Help!

393
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,449
-Somebody!
-What are...

394
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:32,836
Somebody!

395
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,871
-Beth! 
-Sorry...

396
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:40,251
I was just...It was an accident, 
I just wanted to say goodbye...

397
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:43,818
She's got a weapon system built into her arm.

398
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,484
Clear.

399
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:50,814
It's getting worse. She's losing control, we need to contain her fast.

400
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:52,429
Come on, Beth. Let's get you back.

401
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:56,196
-No! No!
-Come on! Come on! Get up! Go.

402
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,212
So, what else happened at school today?

403
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,563
-Alex has got a girlfriend.
-Oh?

404
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,536
-Have not! 
-Have too.

405
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:08,986
-She's called jessica.
-I'm gonna kill you so much.

406
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:13,218
-Patrick Grainger?
-Alex, don't kill your sister.

407
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:19,063
Not before tea anyway!

408
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,899
Patrick?

409
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,181
0h, my God, stop it!

410
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:25,801
Get away from him!

411
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:30,908
Oh, no!
Please, don't hurt my children!

412
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:36,171
No, please!

413
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:52,978
Oi! Fuckflap! Get back in that truck or I'll shove it up your arse!

414
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,468
0h, shit!

415
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,671
Tosh? We got her. It's all over.
We're on our way.

416
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:11,319
You OK?

417
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,527
Yeah... I think so, yeah.

418
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:17,162
-What the hell was that?
-Petrol tanker.

419
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:21,280
Looks like someone wanted to take out the M4 link road for some...

420
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,123
No! It's not the road. There's an underground fuel pipeline.

421
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:28,608
It's the special fuel supply for the military, they use it in emergencies.

422
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:29,921
Not any more. Hold on.

423
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,366
I've got a report coming through.

424
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:35,938
-Patrick Grainger's
been murdered.
-Who?

425
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:39,495
Leader of the Council, stabbed several times in the chest, and once in the forehead.

426
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:42,504
-Sound familiar?
-Why would anyone want to kill him?

427
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:46,477
He's also the city co-ordinator.
Takes charge of the city during major emergencies,

428
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:49,219
-has all the security protocols. 
-How do you know that?

429
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,552
I know everything.

430
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,389
And it says so on the screen.

431
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,502
They're putting all the pieces in place.

432
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:59,520
Gwen, take her. 
Tosh, Owen, it's starting, 
it's happening right now.

433
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:18,556
Tosh? It's not just her.

434
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:21,427
She's part of a cell, and they've activated.

435
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:22,950
It's happening.

436
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,121
-Tell me how to stop it!
-It can't be.

437
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:28,974
-Think! 
-Beth, look at me.
Look at me!

438
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,573
-How do we stop this? 
-I don't know.

439
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:37,045
I'm cut off from the cell.
I don't know what the mission is. I'm sorry.

440
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:39,384
What about your implant. 
How did you get out of Torchwood?

441
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,832
The technology is part of me. 
I can switch it on, 
I can use the tools.

442
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:46,091
Can you do that now? 
Can you trace the other cell?!

443
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,746
No! What if it goes wrong?

444
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:50,718
If you don't, Beth, 
other people will die. 
Not just Mike.

445
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:04,227
There's only one left.

446
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,852
-I can track him.
-Let's go. Come on.

447
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:27,116
Hang on, I've got an idea.

448
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:33,380
No. I can't just hook something up! 
The entire telephone network is down!

449
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,611
-What about a mobile 
connection? 
-The entire telephone 
network is down!

450
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,942
Mobiles, landlines, tin cans with bits of string.

451
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:43,894
Everything. Absolutely everything. 
All phones broken.

452
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:46,666
Hello? Anyone there? No, 
cos the phones aren't working.

453
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,531
-What's that? 
-CB radio.

454
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:54,133
They knocked out the phones, 
but they can't knock out the radio waves. 
Not yet, anyway.

455
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:58,112
-What about we try... 
-There is no way of getting in touch with jack!

456
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:01,514
-No way! 
-Tosh, Owen, can you hear me?

457
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:02,854
Jack;

458
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:06,575
-Thank God. What happened?
-There's a cell, it's active.

459
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:10,325
Four including Beth, two are dead.
We're tracking the last guy now.

460
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,576
-If we can get to him, 
we can stop this. 
-What can I do?

461
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:17,530
He's heading for an abandoned farm outside the city. 
I need to know what's there.

462
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:26,241
Where the hell's he going? 
There's nothing there!

463
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,868
Nothing on the surface.

464
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,393
-He's nearly there, we need to hurry.
-Hurrying, thank you.

465
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:35,182
-What happens when it starts?
-How do you get in the heavy weapons?

466
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:38,216
I don't know. 
I think we just have this arm stuff.

467
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:40,107
How do you manage to take over so quickly?

468
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:43,666
I don't know. I didn't even know how to use this thing until today.

469
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:50,958
***************************

470
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,562
The army sealed it off in the 'l??s, 
doesn't say why.

471
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:55,910
Let me see if I can get into the military files.

472
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:02,598
Come on, guys, 
that wasn't even difficult. 
You disappoint me.

473
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:05,501
It's almost obscene 
what you do to security systems.

474
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:08,059
-0h, God./What is it?
-The mineshaft.

475
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:12,994
The military are using it for storage. 
Nuclear warheads. Ten of them.

476
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:16,003
-Nobody's supposed to know, 
not even us.
-That's how it starts.

477
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:19,539
-No heavy weapons.
-Exactly. They don't need any! 
They use our own against us.

478
00:36:20,627 --> 00:36:24,244
We left the key under the doormat. 
All you need is to walk in and take over.

479
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:27,211
-Tell me you can stop it.
-Going as fast as we can.

480
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:30,807
If we don't, we won't feel a thing.
We're at the centre of the blast radius.

481
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,454
-That's comforting.
-Come on, have a little faith!

482
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:36,726
With a dashing hero like me on the case, 
how can we fail?

483
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:42,962
He is dashing, you have to give him that.

484
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:47,215
-And what if they can't stop it?
-They'll stop it.

485
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:51,100
-Yeah, but if they can't? 
-Then it's all over.

486
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,951
Let's all have sex.

487
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:57,684
I thought the end of the world couldn't get any worse.

488
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:13,095
Halt! Stop the vehicle!

489
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:15,150
Get out ofthe vehicle now!

490
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,931
Lie face down on the ground!

491
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:20,268
0n the ground or we shoot!

492
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:21,603
Fire!

493
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:42,745
-Have we thought this part of the plan through? 
-This isn't gonna be pretty, 
brace yourselves.

494
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:45,236
-How are we going to stop him, Jack?
-Like this.

495
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:07,189
This wasn't supposed to happen today. How do we stop it?

496
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:12,589
Gwen? Gwen!

497
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,961
It doesn't matter.

498
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:21,557
You can't stop us.

499
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,186
We know what your weakness is.

500
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:30,571
We know who you are, jack Harkness. 
We know all about you, and Torchwood.

501
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:35,443
We got a lot of information before you switched her off.

502
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:39,686
You'll be factored into our plans.

503
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,553
-Gwen? 
-Nearly there.

504
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,676
I've got it. He's done.

505
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:51,800
Don't bother, your transmitter's dead.

506
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,840
-So is your force-field.
-You're lying.

507
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,410
0h, yeah?

508
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,512
Factor that into your plans.

509
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:02,753
Now, when are the others coming?

510
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,665
They're already here.

511
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,286
I won't let you take me.

512
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,239
Run!

513
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:43,841
It's done.

514
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:47,556
-I'll do it, but I'm not happy.
-just do what you have to.

515
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,273
We're set with the cryogenics when you're ready.

516
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,221
Will it work this time?

517
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:11,427
Tosh has reconfigured the casket.
It'll work around the implant.

518
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:16,504
-No more false images.
-If we'd been one minute later

519
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:17,796
We weren't.

520
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:23,051
-We stopped him.
-What happens when you have to stop me?

521
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:28,909
-If the freezing doesn't work?
-It won't come to that.

522
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:35,633
I can feel it coming.
It's pushing me out.

523
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:39,353
What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?

524
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:41,610
We will figure something out, Beth.

525
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,362
No, we won't.

526
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,761
I'm too dangerous for that, 
we both know it.

527
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:53,484
Do you...have someone...

528
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,140
at home?

529
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,759
A fiance.

530
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:00,426
Have you ever hurt them?

531
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,113
More than once, yes.

532
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,759
Remember how guilty you felt?

533
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:11,582
Imagine that...times a billion...

534
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:17,345
all the time...every second of the day.

535
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,641
That's how I feel now.

536
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:27,282
And the worst part is, 
when I turn back,

537
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:32,174
I won't feel guilty any more.
I'll want to carry out my mission.

538
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,891
I won't even care about Mike.
I'll forget all about him.

539
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:44,922
I don't wanna die as one of those things, Gwen.

540
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,681
-I don't wanna forget about Mike.
-Then don't.

541
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:57,984
Let's do this. Who knows 
what we'll be able to do 
in a month? A year?

542
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:00,556
Thanks for being so good to me.

543
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,595
Remember me the way I am now.

544
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,331
Remember...Beth.

545
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:18,604
Beth...

546
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:23,697
Beth...

547
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:28,509
I won't let you freeze me!

548
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,566
I'll kill you all!

549
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,986
Let her go! Let her go!

550
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:37,992
No! Wait, wait, wait, don't shoot! It's a trick.
She won't hurt me.

551
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:39,540
Move away from her now!

552
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,603
Everybody, calm down!

553
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:46,046
Beth.....you don't want to do this.

554
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:47,505
Let Gwen go.

555
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:53,432
I'll kill her first, then all of you, 
then the rest of your miserable species!

556
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,607
Beth, please! They will kill you.
You have proved to be better than that,

557
00:43:56,607 --> 00:44:00,486
you helped us to stop the invasion. You can be human. Please!

558
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:05,364
-Not human enough. 
-Beth.

559
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:09,031
Goodbye, Gwen.

560
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,298
Good luck.

561
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:33,514
She wanted you to shoot her!

562
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,926
She used her last shred of humanity to do this.

563
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:42,009
We couldn't take that chance.

564
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,482
She must have known that.

565
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,258
She did.

566
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:52,063
She just wanted to make it easier for us.

567
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:46,036
Do you think we stopped it?

568
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:50,254
Maybe. Maybe we've just put it off for a while, I don't know.

569
00:45:50,254 --> 00:45:53,009
-We don't know anything.
-We know plenty.

570
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:57,899
We know about the implant.
We can disable their force-field.

571
00:45:57,899 --> 00:46:02,237
We know how they attack.
We know that they can be killed.

572
00:46:02,354 --> 00:46:04,887
While they think they have 
the element of surprise,
we know they haven't.

573
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,612
But, until that day, 
we just keep doing what we do.

574
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:12,881
0h, them be fightin' words,
they be, Gwen.

575
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:22,137
-So, have you set a date?
-Oh, don't get me started, please.

576
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:24,084
My mam's already been on the phone, saying,

577
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:27,117
'What about the local church? It's ever so lovely.'

578
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,768
Go home.

579
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,040
Keep doing what we do.

580
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:40,940
Good night, jack.

581
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:04,985
He's a frozen soldier from 1918.

582
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:08,208
-We have to wake him up every 12 months. 
-Leave me alone!

583
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,648
-It's me. Toshiko. 
-Is it time again?

584
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:13,325
Two different times should never exist simultaneously.

585
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:15,333
You shouldn't be here!

586
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,214
Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital.

587
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,362
We've got a few ghosts.

588
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:21,901
I think you'd better come with us.

589
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:25,432
He needs to be in the hospital, ready to step from one time to another.

590
00:47:25,432 --> 00:47:29,203
-You're the only one who can stop this. 
-Why me?!

591
00:47:29,203 --> 00:47:33,965
It's not years in the future. It's now.

592
00:47:33,965 --> 00:47:37,858
