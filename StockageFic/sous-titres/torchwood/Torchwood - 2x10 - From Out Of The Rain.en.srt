1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,570
Torchwood.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,130
Outside the Government,
beyond the police.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,250
Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,370
The 21st century
is when everything changes,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,690
and Torchwood is ready.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,690
Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,010
have we got a show
for you tonight!

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,770
A once in a lifetime show.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,770
Amaze your ears,
astonish your eyes,

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,450
then run along home and
tell your friends and neighbours.

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,730
A once in a lifetime show,

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,890
never to be forgotten
for the rest of your lives.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,610
So, why not step inside?

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,570
We're waiting for you.

15
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,290
Great!

16
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,690
What is that?

17
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,570
I know where you came from, mate,
I know where you're going.

18
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,210
Tosh?

19
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,810
I heard this sound.

20
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,290
An old sound, like a pipe organ.

21
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,210
A what?

22
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,450
Did you hear anything?

23
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,770
No.

24
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,370
Is there a circus in town,
or a travelling fair,
something like that?

25
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,010
On a night like this?
They'd be wasting their time.

26
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,410
Where's Ianto? He'd know.

27
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,810
He's gone to the cinema
with Gwen and Owen,

28
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,050
some kind of opening night
he wanted to check out.

29
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,250
The building's got
a record of rift activity
but it's been quiet for years so...

30
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,610
A nice trip to the cinema, you said.

31
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,530
Yeah, that's right.

32
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,130
Ianto, nothing down here, mate.

33
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,090
Oh, come on, Owen.
It's more than just a cinema.

34
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,290
It's the Electro!

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,450
Oh, wow!

36
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,290
Where's that stupid
bloody son of ours?

37
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,010
He said he'd be here on time.
He'd better be. He's got the film.

38
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,650
And what good
is a cinema without a film?

39
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,570
Good evening, gentlemen.
Evening, madam.

40
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,050
Welcome to the Electro.

41
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,010
I love this place.
Used to come here with my dad.

42
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,970
They'd show kids' films
on Saturday morning.

43
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,130
So where's the popcorn
and the ice cream?

44
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,650
I think you've missed out.

45
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,450
It's educational. OK.

46
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,250
Come on.

47
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,090
What time do you call this?
Sorry. People are waiting.

48
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,210
You won't believe this,
but when I was splicing the film...

49
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,250
Just get up to
that projection room.

50
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,450
Now!

51
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,730
MUFFLED ORGAN MUSIC

52
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,410
As proud owners of the Electro
museum, it is our privilege

53
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,370
to be able to show you
how the cinema and Hope Street
looked in days gone by.

54
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,530
If you watch carefully, who knows?

55
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,610
You may even see long-dead
members of your family
waiting in the cinema queue.

56
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,370
Bernard!

57
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,530
JAUNTY PIANO MUSIC

58
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,610
Do you recognise any of
your long-lost relatives, Gwen?

59
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,290
There's Aunty Peggy. She's been on
the gin. Can you be quiet?

60
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,850
He's showing the wrong bloody film!

61
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,890
Where's Hope Street gone?

62
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,170
Oh, shit!

63
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,130
Where the hell
did that film come from?

64
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,330
I've no idea. I swear I didn't edit
those clips. Don't be stupid.

65
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,810
It's true.
Just bloody well change it. I can't.

66
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,570
The machine won't switch off.
Oh, get out of the way.

67
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,970
This is crazy!

68
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,010
It's the same pictures
over and over again.

69
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,810
Yeah.

70
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,730
Come on, let's go.

71
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,130
Wait!

72
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,610
I just saw Jack. Where?

73
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,690
In the film.

74
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,770
What are you talking about? What?
I swear I saw him.

75
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,010
Ianto... Wait. just wait.

76
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,290
Come on.

77
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,930
Let's go. Yes, come on.

78
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,970
Are you coming?

79
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,370
When the film stopped,
these shadows went past me.

80
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,730
What kind of shadows?

81
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,370
I don't know. It wasn't clear.

82
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,810
There was something else.

83
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,690
You were up there on the screen.

84
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,370
As large as life.

85
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,010
What was I doing?

86
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,490
You were on some sort of stage.

87
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,410
Outside a big tent.

88
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,170
You seemed to be part
of a travelling show.

89
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,290
I heard it.

90
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,970
Heard its music.

91
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,570
Just a snatch of it.

92
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,090
That film was beautiful.

93
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,250
All those acts performing for us.

94
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,530
Part of history,

95
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,730
trapped on film forever.

96
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,490
Their days were numbered.

97
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,850
Cinema may have
saved their images,

98
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,210
but it finished off
the travelling shows.

99
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,770
Killed them.

100
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,450
I'm at the bus stop, Mum.

101
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,890
By Hope Street.

102
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,410
No. Gemma's brother
couldn't bring me home.

103
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,010
His car don't work.

104
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,530
Well, what about Dad?

105
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,970
Can't you wake him? Mum?

106
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,450
Would you like a ticket
for the travelling show, my dear?

107
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,730
No, thanks.
Every young person's dream.

108
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,170
Perhaps she'd like
to join the show instead.

109
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,530
Why not? You could travel with us.

110
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,010
Forever.
Look, just go away, will you?

111
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,810
Did you hear what I said?

112
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,330
SHE STRUGGLES FOR BREATH

113
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,530
So you say
the projector went haywire?

114
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,250
Yeah, even with the mains
switched off it still kept running.

115
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,450
Playing those film clips.
It's like it had a mind of its own.

116
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,650
Working now. I know.

117
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,170
Where did you get these? The
basement. There were stacks of cans.

118
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,890
I've been compiling old footage
of Hope Street and the Electro
for the opening night.

119
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,210
But the circus clips weren't on it.
I swear.

120
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,570
The film that was shown wasn't meant
to be here?

121
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,450
No, and that's what's so scary.

122
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,370
I mean, it kind of played itself.
It's like it wanted to be seen.

123
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,370
Like something tried to get through?

124
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:58,250
Yeah. And there was a sound,
like old fashioned music.

125
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,090
Played on an organ or something.

126
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,730
And there was a face
looking out at me.

127
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,530
And there was a smell, like...

128
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,570
Like bromine. Or iodine.

129
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,970
Like film itself. That's right.

130
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,530
And this is the film?

131
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,810
Yeah.

132
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,090
TOSH: 'Jack, the systems
here are behaving very oddly.'

133
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,290
And I heard the sound you mentioned.
That fairground sound.

134
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,690
Can you trace the source?

135
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,170
No. But there was a peak
in rift activity at the Electro.

136
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,370
'Then nothing. Plus I'm recording
unusual rift traces nearby.'

137
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,810
Where? 'Chain Lane.'

138
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,290
Runs parallel to Hope Street.

139
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,090
Sending the co-ordinates now.

140
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,130
DISTANT SIRENS

141
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,250
Tosh, we're on our way. Tell
the police we're dealing with it.

142
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,450
Epileptic maybe?
Could be wearing a tag.

143
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,970
She isn't.

144
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,010
She got ID?

145
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,850
I'll check. What's wrong?

146
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,330
She's got a heartbeat
but she isn't breathing.

147
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,010
Shouldn't really be alive.
And look at her mouth.

148
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,730
She's got no saliva. Look, her
lips are cracked. Dry as a bone.

149
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,730
We need to get her to hospital.

150
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,850
Sorry. We're closed.

151
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,050
Do you hear me? We're closed.

152
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,050
Make her cry. You what?

153
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,090
I want to drink her tears.

154
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,850
SHE STRUGGLES FOR BREATH

155
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,050
SIRENS WAIL

156
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,130
The name's Nettie Williams.
Her parents are outside.

157
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,770
She was visiting a friend.
Have any witnesses come forward? No.

158
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,250
Has anyone been able
to communicate with her?

159
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,530
No. No change in her condition.

160
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,330
Motor response? Non-existent,
they're treating it as a coma.

161
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,450
And they're wrong?

162
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,450
Totally. There's no signs
of cerebral dysfunctions,
no symptoms of hypoxia.

163
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,130
And her body's dehydrated.

164
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,170
You know when a spider sucks
the liquid out of its victims?

165
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,850
Well, this is a bit like that,
except they've
left her partly alive.

166
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,130
She couldn't cry about it even
if she wanted to, the poor kid.

167
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,370
She's got no tears.

168
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,690
There's been another one.

169
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,530
Who's she?

170
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,890
We don't know. The paramedics
found her. It freaked them.

171
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,730
She was lying in an open doorway.
Looking like this.

172
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,730
Where was this?

173
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,290
The corner of Hope Street.

174
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,330
The same. Heartbeat but no breath.

175
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,410
Her mouth's been drained
of moisture.

176
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,810
This makes no sense, they're almost
dehydrated and possibly brain dead

177
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,610
yet somehow they're still with us.

178
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,850
Some part of them
has been taken elsewhere?

179
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,970
That's impossible.

180
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,090
For the body to be alive there
must be a life force somewhere.

181
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,610
Yet they've separated it, stolen it.
Who has the power to do that?

182
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,970
I don't know.
But we need to find out fast.

183
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,170
Two people chosen at random.
Who's next?

184
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,970
Whatever's doing it
has the whole city to choose from.

185
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,770
Or the world.

186
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,930
I knew those two.

187
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,850
They argued day and night.

188
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,930
That is you.

189
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,810
All right, now I've seen everything!
I told you so. You did stand-up?

190
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,250
I never did stand-up.
OK, then. A song and dance.

191
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,770
I was sensational!

192
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,610
I don't believe this, Jack.
What were you doing there?

193
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,090
He was part of the freak show.

194
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,690
Some things never change.

195
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,210
Are you being rude about me?

196
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,170
Look at the state of them.

197
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,770
I do love his leotard.

198
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,090
The night travellers. The what?

199
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,370
Tosh, play that back.

200
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,570
So, they did exist.
Did you work with these people?

201
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,690
I didn't work with them,

202
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,010
I never knew anyone who did.

203
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,330
They only performed
in the dead of night.

204
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,770
Anyway, it was just a tale
that was around at that time.

205
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,530
A ghost story.

206
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,450
They came from out of the rain.

207
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,770
That's how people described them.

208
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,250
Jack, what did these
night travellers do?

209
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,250
Left a trail of damage and sorrow
wherever they performed.

210
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,210
Tosh, can you run this
frame by frame? Er, sure.

211
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,530
What are you looking for?
I'm not sure.

212
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,370
But something's wrong.

213
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,810
Something's missing.

214
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,690
This must be back, now, yeah?
80 odd years.

215
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,290
Then the travelling shows
faded away.

216
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,570
No-one came to watch them and
without an audience they died out.
Forgotten.

217
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,170
Until all we have to remember them
by were these film clips.

218
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,330
Jack!

219
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,810
This film. It's not the same one
we saw at the cinema.

220
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,890
Course it's the same one.
No, things are different. Tosh...

221
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,770
Easy to miss at first, but after
watching it a few times I realised.

222
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,610
Just there. There was a woman
in front of that water tank.

223
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,730
Yeah there was, Ianto, you're right.

224
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,770
That's right, I remember her.
Wearing almost nothing.

225
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,730
And there was a man in like
a top hat, a sort of MC.

226
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,890
Yeah. That's right. He was
reaching down to the audience.

227
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,210
Are you sure you brought
the right can of film back?

228
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,010
Positive. So what are we saying?

229
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,490
That two people from a piece of film
have decided to go AWOL?

230
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,690
Yeah.

231
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,890
Like you said,

232
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,250
trapped in film forever.

233
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,290
When they opened the cinema,
it gave them a chance.

234
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,170
When that kid ran the film,
he let them loose.

235
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,010
So they've become physical?
They've escaped the film?

236
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,570
We need to find out more about
the havoc they caused in the past.

237
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,730
We need evidence.
Possible witnesses.

238
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,170
After all that time it'll be tricky.
What, town and parish records?

239
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,770
Sure, we can do that. How far back do
you want us to go?

240
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,970
As far as you can.

241
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,410
We don't sleep till we find them.
Toshiko, keep checking
for sightings.

242
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,730
There's got to be a way
of tracing them. Ianto, with me,
I need your local knowledge.

243
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,170
Oh, is that what
you're calling it these days?

244
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,090
So, two people who should
have been dead for years.

245
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,810
What kind of creatures are they?

246
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,450
No-one ever knew
the night travellers were coming.

247
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,650
They'd just appear from nowhere.

248
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,370
Not like the team I was with.

249
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,290
We'd send out flyers,
bang drums, blow whistles.

250
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,370
Ours was a small company.

251
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,170
Working the UK.

252
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,050
Trying to find paying customers.

253
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,610
I was sent to investigate rumours
of the night travellers.

254
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,730
By who?

255
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,370
Long story.

256
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,290
So I joined a travelling show.

257
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,490
I was billed as
the man who couldn't die.

258
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,610
The night travellers
always found an audience.

259
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,490
They knew where to look.

260
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,210
Step along now,
ladies and gentlemen,

261
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,250
come and see
the show of a lifetime!

262
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,370
Fill your eyes

263
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,450
with the spectacle

264
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,690
of the tattooed man!

265
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,850
Witness for yourself

266
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,970
the superhuman strength
of the Mighty Stromboli!

267
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:36,290
He can take on
Samson, Goliath and Hercules

268
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,730
with one arm
tied behind his back,

269
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,690
and still have strength
to dig their graves.

270
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,170
Come along now,
ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,010
the night won't wait forever.

272
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,410
Come and see the amazing Pearl!

273
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,610
She lives in water.

274
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,170
She sleeps among the waves.

275
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,970
She can reach
the bottom of the oceans.

276
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,450
She has swum the seven seas.

277
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:24,610
She is the nearest thing
that you will ever see

278
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,050
to a living mermaid.

279
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:37,130
She will take your breath away.

280
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,330
How many other old cinemas
are there in Cardiff?

281
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,130
Most of them have been pulled down.

282
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,250
And the ones that are left?

283
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,250
Converted.

284
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,570
This one is a pub.

285
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,330
Four-pint jugs for a fiver
and girls in free before 11.

286
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,810
I'm registering the sea!

287
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,010
The sea? Inland?

288
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,530
Running through the centre of town?

289
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,610
TYRES SCREECH

290
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,730
What is it?

291
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,890
I thought...
I thought I saw something.

292
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,010
Saw what?

293
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,090
Ghosts.

294
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,290
Don't be stupid.

295
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,970
SHE SCREAMS

296
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,610
So the Electro is the only one left.

297
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,170
Could the night travellers
have performed there? Possibly.

298
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,570
If cinema killed
the travelling show, maybe
this is their way of fighting back.

299
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,690
Their only chance to escape
before every old movie theatre
and piece of film has gone.

300
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,970
What better way to get revenge?

301
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,450
They were left forgotten,
on pieces of film.

302
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,050
And now they're looking
for a new audience.

303
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,930
What is it, Tosh?
She was picking up the sea.

304
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,570
In the middle of town.

305
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,810
It's gone now.

306
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,810
I was getting the sound of waves.

307
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,210
Seagulls.

308
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,970
I could almost smell the ozone.

309
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,010
No other sightings? No.

310
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,650
What the hell are they up to?

311
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,330
I like the lights.

312
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,810
They make the rain glisten.

313
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,090
And they're part of us.

314
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,370
EERIE BREATHS

315
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,210
Smell the water.

316
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,170
Taste it.

317
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,450
Careful.

318
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,170
How many now? Six.

319
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,330
I wish I could see the air
they once breathed.

320
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,850
You know you can never see it.

321
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,570
We could never see it.

322
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,330
We have their ghosts here.
I can see them whenever I want.

323
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,610
Our audience.

324
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,050
They'll never leave us.

325
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,570
We can't see. But we can hear.

326
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,810
Listen.

327
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,010
EERIE BREATHS AGAIN

328
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,490
I can!

329
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,690
I can hear them.

330
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,810
Little last breaths,
still sighing their sighs.

331
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,330
Can we bring the others?

332
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,010
Make ghosts forever?

333
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,690
The others shouldn't be
in some old dark cupboard.

334
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,890
They should be here with us.

335
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,930
And I want to travel again, perform.

336
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,490
All right.

337
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,090
But first we need
the rest of that film.

338
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,090
Found in a car with their parents,
near Hope Street.

339
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,850
Oh, no.

340
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,330
What happened to the parents?

341
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,730
They're in the same cataleptic state.

342
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,370
They came from out of the rain.

343
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,210
What did you say?

344
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,890
Nothing. Why?

345
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,850
Those words, 'From out of the rain'.

346
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,810
I'm sure I've heard them before.

347
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,890
Oh, I remember, it was Christina.
She was a patient.

348
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,210
Here? No, at Providence Park,
it's a psychiatric hospital.

349
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,330
I know it.

350
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,770
I used to work there.
She was a full-time patient,
been there since she was a child.

351
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,370
She was a strange one.

352
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,410
Whenever anything, any kind
of entertainment show was laid on,
she became scared.

353
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,450
She'd run away and hide.

354
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,130
Did she say why?

355
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,890
Yes. She said they were coming
to steal her last breath.

356
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,170
Poor love.

357
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,890
I think we've just found
ourselves our first witness.

358
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,090
They came from out of the rain.

359
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,930
At night. Came to the village.

360
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,730
How old were you at the time?

361
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,650
Oh, just a child.

362
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,810
Five, I think, or six.

363
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,570
Are you visiting someone?

364
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,570
Christina, we've come to see you.

365
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,370
No one comes to see me.

366
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,650
Your eyes are older than your face.

367
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,570
Is that a bad thing? Yes.

368
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,010
It means you don't belong.

369
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,490
It means you're from nowhere.

370
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,650
Christina, tell us about them.

371
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,930
The people who came out of the rain.

372
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,610
There was music. Hurdy-gurdy music.

373
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,970
Acrobats.

374
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,410
And a man with fire in his hands.

375
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,850
Who else was there?

376
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,890
A man in dark clothes,

377
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,090
and a woman. A beautiful young
woman in a silvery costume.

378
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,690
She seemed to glisten.

379
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,890
They touched you, I can sense it.

380
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,570
They touched you
as they passed you by.

381
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,770
Tell us about the man, Christina.

382
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,090
Oh. He spoke to me.

383
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,810
He asked if I would like to
join the travelling show.

384
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,570
He took a kind of flask
out of his pocket.

385
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,010
It was polished like silver.

386
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,810
I asked him his name.

387
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,250
Oh, I shall never forget it.
I never shall.

388
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,730
He said he was the ghost maker.

389
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:04,530
He wanted to take my breath
and put it in his flask.

390
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:10,010
He said I could travel
with his circus,

391
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,850
I would be in his audience forever.

392
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,850
I turned and ran away
as fast as I could.

393
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,810
People went missing from the village
that night.

394
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,930
My mother,

395
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,610
my father...

396
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,370
Here we go. Church Stretton, 1901.

397
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,810
People went missing when a
travelling show visited the town,
and there was one earlier on.

398
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,770
1898, a small village
called Wellsfield.

399
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,810
These disappearances,
there's a lot of old wives' tales
attached to them through the years.

400
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,570
People still alive but
been deprived of breath,

401
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,850
children being told to hold
their breath while the
travelling show passes by.

402
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,530
Yeah, this local paper,
didn't take it seriously.

403
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,610
Hunstanton Chronicle, March 1911.

404
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,810
"Police and doctors were left
amused and baffled when
Mr Alfred Mace insisted

405
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,490
that his dead wife could be brought
back to life providing a certain
flask could be found."

406
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,530
He reckoned his wife's last breath
had been put in a flask.
A silver flask.

407
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,490
And the last breath of each victim.

408
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,850
So that's how he makes his ghosts.
So if we find the flask...
We can save them.

409
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,370
Now we have the film.

410
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,610
Time to bring the others.

411
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,450
Jack, this is Jonathan,
they're here, they're at my flat,
you've got to get over here now!

412
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,170
Who was in there?

413
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,010
A woman, lying under water.
I thought she'd drowned.

414
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,490
Anyone else? No.

415
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,850
Be careful.

416
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,410

417
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,730
Did Bernard say he
was coming here today?

418
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,170
No.

This way, please.

422
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,890
So they haven't left the area.
They probably can't.

423
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,250
Probably need to be near
the Electro.

424
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,370
All my old film cans have
been opened. What was on them?

425
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,810
Clips from circus sideshows.
They're bringing more through.

426
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,570
Then we need to stop them.

427
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,490
Gwen, Owen. Meet us at the Electro.

428
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,010
Look, what's going on?
I've got to find my Mum and Dad.
If anything's happened to them...

429
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,690
Hey, there's that smell again.
Like chemicals.

430
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,890
Yeah, I can smell it.

431
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,450
Like when you develop a film.
That woman.

432
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,850
She grabbed me.
But her hand, it was different.

433
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,810
It wasn't like a hand.
It wasn't like flesh.

434
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,370
It was it was like touching a piece
of plastic, a piece of celluloid.

435
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,450
They were on this film for 80 years.

436
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,090
Became part of it.

437
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,850
What if we filmed them?
A film of a film?

438
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,650
Yeah.

439
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,370
Then they'd be trapped.
Is this thing loaded?

440
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,450
If they were trapped
on film before...

441
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,490
They can be got rid
of in the same way.

442
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,970
Let's suppose they're made of
camphor and nitrate,
made of shadows, made of light.

443
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,890
Just enough light. We film them.
Capture them in that...

444
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,250
Then expose the film to as much
light as possible. Of course.

445
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,330
We'd blank them out, we'd lose them.
Let's hope so. Jack?

446
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,410
Yeah? We're at the Electro.
Something's happening inside.

447
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,730

Maybe it's my mam and dad.
Would they lock themselves in? No.

451
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,850
Please let them be OK. Please.

452
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,050

00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,090
No, Jonathan. Mum!

Dad!

456
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,330
What's happened?

457
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,850
Please!

458
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,090
Don't die, please! Speak to me!

459
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,810
No! Leave me alone!

460
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,610
They've been frozen in place,

461
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,090
a circus needs an audience.

Jonathan, come on. Leave me alone.

465
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,010
Owen, find out who's upstairs.

466
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,450
The same pictures as before.

467
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,690
Jack.

468
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,570
They're coming through...

469
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,570
Open up!

470
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,170
We've done it. We're together again.

471
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,010
This place is ours. It belongs to us.

472
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,290
This whole city belongs to us!

473
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,170
What are you? There's not a
breath in your poor, sad body.

474
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,290
You're no use to me.

475
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,810
The flask! He's got it!

476
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,570
I've got it!

477
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,570
Gwen, are you all right? Oh!

478
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,730
Yeah. Are you OK? Yes!
Owen, look after the family.

479
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,410
Argh!

00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,450
No! Please!

481
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,530
If their breaths escaped the
flask all the victims will die.

They're flat-lining,
call the crash team.

485
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,050
One.

486
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,730
I think we saved just one.

00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,930

489
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,170
I heard it,

490
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,370
something inside calling out to me.

491
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,290
So we managed to save one.

492
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,170
But which one?

493
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,090
There was nothing we could do.

494
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,450
They all died so suddenly.

495
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,610
Except this poor little soul.

496
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,730
I suppose he'll be next to go.

497
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,330
What are you doing?

498
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,890
I need your help.

499
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,610
What is that thing? Please.

500
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,370
Just trust me. Give me a hand.

501
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,490
Careful.

502
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,930
Hold his head. What's in there?

503
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,730
Something that belongs to him.

504
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,810
His last breath,

505
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,570
his life.

506
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,850
What have you done to him?

507
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,730
It worked.

508
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,970
Welcome back.

509
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,970
Those reels of film in
Jonathan's workroom...

510
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,530
I took them out, destroyed them.

511
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,330
Let's hope that's an end to it.

512
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,210
What worries me are all those
long lost pieces of film,

513
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,610
tucked away in dusty cellars,
hidden in lofts.

514
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,010
The night travellers could
still be there, somewhere.

515
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,450
Just waiting.

516
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,450

Why is this one so special?

520
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,730
Something's glowing, just out
of the camera's line of sight.

521
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,370
Cardiff has an epidemic of
missing persons. Oh, my God.

522
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:40,130
I'll make it my own special project.

523
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,570
No, leave it alone... I can't.

524
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,770
He's got to be out there somewhere.
Can we keep this to ourselves?

525
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,130
You're covering it up,
in the Bristol Channel?

526
