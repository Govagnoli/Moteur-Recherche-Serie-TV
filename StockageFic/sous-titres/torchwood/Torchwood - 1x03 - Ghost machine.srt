1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,840
Torchwood. Outside the
Government, beyond the police.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,199
Tracking down alien life on Earth,
arming the human race against
the future.

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,720
The 21st century is when everything
changes, and you've got to be ready.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,759
Owen. Gwen. Left into the alley,
right, 30 metres.

5
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,160
What can you see?
I can't get a visual...

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Just a signal.
Definitely alien in origin.
Diagonal right, towards the castle.

7
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,199
Jack, sharp right, 20 metres.

8
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,239
Can you identify the target?
Still trying to get a visual...

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,440
20 seconds to contact.

10
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,440
15 seconds.

11
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,519
No heroics, we've got no idea
what we're dealing with.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,119
Ten seconds.

13
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,600
Got it!

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,039
Got a visual.
Suspect's male, wearing a hoodie.

15
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,560
Go, Gwen!

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,240
Come on! Open it up! Open it up!

17
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,079
In trouble now, mate.

18
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,479
Damn!

19
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,000
You star, you did it!
I was that close...

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,680
No, you got it.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,120
I've lost him, Tosh, I've lost him.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
I swear, whatever it is...

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
You're holding it.

24
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,480
Let me check the cameras.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
BEEPING

26
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,999
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
FOOTSTEPS

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
STEAM TRAIN CHUGS

29
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,360
Hello?

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,640
Who are you?

31
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,399
Can you hear me?

32
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,880
I want to go home.

33
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,799
No-one knows who I am here.

34
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm lost. Come back...

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,319
Come back.

36
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,400
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER TANNOY

37
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm sorry,
that damn gate cut us off.

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,800
Gwen? Are you all right?

39
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,800
I've just seen a ghost.

40
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,800
This is the feed
from the station camera.

41
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,479
Gwen grabs the kid.

42
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,280
She's got his jacket, and
he just slips out. You OK with this?

43
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,679
And then?

44
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,080
Jack and Owen arrive.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,239
Then, nothing. Sorry.

46
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,679
No. It was as real as this is.

47
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,319
More real. I didn't
just see that boy. I could...

48
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,320
I could hear what he was thinking,
I could feel it. Like I was lost.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,520
Intense emotion can be part
of a neurological event.
Hallucinations, dementia...

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
I wasn't hallucinating, Owen.
And I'm not bloody senile.

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,320
You pushed this button which caused
this apparition moment? Yeah.

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,479
Jack, please don't!
THEY ALL SHOUT "NO"

53
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,279
As if! But that's how it felt.

54
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,799
Like an apparition.

55
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,239
A ghost. Toshiko, where do we start?

56
00:04:55,239 --> 00:05:00,679
The guy you were chasing,
I've got lots of CCTV, so tracking
him down's gonna be easy.

57
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,879
You said there was a name on the
card around the little boy's neck?

58
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,239
Flanagan. Tom Erasmus Flanagan.
Unusual name, that'll help.

59
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:11,280
Run a full check. Births, marriages,
deaths, criminal record, passports.

60
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,120
However long it takes,
wherever he is, we'll find him.

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
I've found him.

62
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,680
Flanagan, Thomas Erasmus.
74 Brynaeron Terrace, Butetown.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
He's in the phonebook.

64
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,320
Hi, I'm DI Cooper, this is DS Harper.

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,880
Could you spare
a few minutes, please? Yeah, OK.

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,879
Dad, visitors. It's the police.

67
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,959
Oh! Caught up with me at last,
have you?

68
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm Gwen.
This is Owen, he's training.

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,999
It's just routine - we're looking
for eye witnesses to an incident
at the railway station last night.

70
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,640
We were here, weren't we, Dad?
Strictly Come Dancing finals.
Who won?

71
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,440
That newsreader.
She's got legs up to her armpits!

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,759
Would you like a cup of tea?

73
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
I'd love one, thanks.

74
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
Owen will give you a hand. This way.

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,280
She'll talk him to death out there.

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
He'll give as good as he gets.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,639
She was right, though.
We were in all last night,
we wouldn't have seen anything.

78
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,799
Just for the record,
you are Tom Erasmus Flanagan?

79
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,920
My father was an Erasmus,
his father before him.

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, that's not
a Welsh accent, is it? No.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,679
Lived here 66 years,
and still sound like a barrow boy.

82
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:37,280
I was evacuated during the war -
1941.

83
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,519
The Germans bombing
the hell out of the East End.

84
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,520
Cardiff was being bombed
as well as London, wasn't it?

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,599
We were taken to the countryside.

86
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,919
My mother packed me a suitcase...

87
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
Big sister wrote my name on a card.

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
They put me
on a train at Paddington.

89
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,999
Kept saying I had to go, had to be
a good boy, telling me not to cry,

90
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,399
and the pair of
them were crying their eyes out!

91
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,600
That was the last I saw of them,

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,400
though I didn't know
that then, of course.

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,079
Waving goodbye.

94
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,399
How old were you? Eight. You must
have been very, very frightened.

95
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,519
I didn't know a soul here.
And there was a mix-up.

96
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,520
I kept my head down so much
they forgot all about me.

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,999
So they left me all on my own.

98
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,360
Felt like the end of the world.

99
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,960
I wandered down this tunnel,

100
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,160
totally lost.

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,879
Forgotten.

102
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,239
Looking for someone,
anyone, who'd look after me.

103
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:43,080
"Why don't they
come for me?" I kept thinking.

104
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,639
No-one knows me. I'm lost.

105
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,040
They worked it out in the end,
they came back for me,

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,759
and I got taken in by a lovely
couple, no kids of their own.

107
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,519
And well, at the end of the war,
I had no-one left in London.

108
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,400
So I stayed here.

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm still here now.

110
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,799
Just!

111
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,040
I don't get it.

112
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,800
He WAS the boy at the station.

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,799
I can't comment -
I was stuck in the kitchen
with Motormouth, thanks to you.

114
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,280
So was what I saw just a bit of him
from years before? Hanging around?

115
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,200
PHONE RINGS

116
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,200
Hi. Gwen, I'm just putting a wash
on, you got any whites need doing?

117
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,519
I don't know.
Just leave it, I'll sort it out.

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,680
No, no, no it's no trouble.

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,160
Just remind me, which drawer do the
tablets go in? Ah, just leave it.

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,759
OK, so, are you in or out tonight?
I don't know.

121
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,760
Again?! Sorry? All I'm asking
is you in or out tonight?

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,919
I don't know. I can live
with all the Secret Squirrel stuff,

123
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,640
but if you can't even tell
me if you're coming home!

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,159
Well, nagging isn't helping.
Right. Well, that's me told.

125
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,679
Aw, Rhys... I'm not staying in
on the off chance.

126
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,720
Daf's having mates round.
I'll stay there. Do what you want.

127
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,959
CAR HORN BEEPS

128
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,160
Hello?

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,679
All right!
ENGINE REVS

130
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:22,360
Our friend
with the alien machine in his pocket

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,600
is one Sean Harris
aka Bernie.

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,559
And what he's doing with an
alien machine is anyone's guess.

133
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,759
19. String of convictions - burglary,
shoplifting, credit cards...

134
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,320
Do warn me if he's dropping in(!)

135
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,079
The theft conviction -
he was stealing tyres off a car

136
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,199
when the owner turns up, gives
him so much grief, he apologises.
starts putting them back on again.

137
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,879
Which is when the police show up!
And here - shoplifting conviction.

138
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,159
Bottle of vodka and three Pot
Noodles. A criminal mastermind(!)

139
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,240
Got anywhere with that
mystery object? Alien, of course...

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,520
Gorgeous nanotechnology,
makes NASA look like Toys 'R' US.

141
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,160
Well, you've really narrowed
things down, haven't you?

142
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,599
At the station it was doing this.
When I held it,

143
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:10,959
it lit up and went mad.
It's not doing it now, is it? No.

144
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,560
So. What next?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440
This kid, Bernie,
where does he live? Splott.

146
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
Splott?

147
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,120
I believe estate agents
pronounce it "Sploe".

148
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,599
Hi, I'm looking for Bernie,
is he in? Friend of his, are you?
Yes, I'm from...

149
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,559
I'm his mother. He's a
robbing little bastard

150
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,600
who won't set foot in here
till he pays me the £50 he owes me!

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
He's barred.

152
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,759
He said he'd get me a iPod and
he never. And he smoked my fags.

153
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,199
Wouldn't piss on him
if he was on fire.

154
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,480
Bernie Harris, the
Scarlet Pimpernel of Splott.

155
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,800
Tell me about it,
give me aliens any day.

156
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,160
Any luck? Nope, but I got
four pasties for a pound - anyone?

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,919
If I wanted days like this
I'd've stayed in the police.

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
We did try, Jack.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,399
What's he gonna tell us? "Got it
off an alien down the market."

160
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,520
Where are we going?

161
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,800
To the station.
Controlled experiment.

162
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,560
We replicate the original
events as far as possible.
Observe and analyse the results.

163
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,119
What I have to do that again?!
Someone does - any volunteers? Whoa!

164
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,840
We don't know what
it is, what it does. Nope.

165
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,120
Jack, this could be dangerous. Yep.

166
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't mean to be picky, but I think
I can spot some flaws in this...

167
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm sorry, I thought you gave up
looking for a 19-year-old kid
this morning(!)

168
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,120
I figured maybe you were after
something more exciting.

169
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,719
A bit of a challenge.

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,119
This door-to-door stuff
never gets us anywhere.

171
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:00,879
BEEPING
Guys, come here! Owen!

172
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,959
Owen!

173
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,399
Wait...!

174
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,079
THUNDER RUMBLES

175
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,160
RAIN

176
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,559
WOMAN WEEPS

177
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,200
He's a rotten bastard!

178
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,600
My mam was right,
his eyes are too close together!

179
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,560
I said, "Just a dance,"
but he wasn't having a bar of it.

180
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
I shouldn't have gone outside with
him, I should have known better!

181
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,360
What's your name?

182
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,359
MAN CALLS MENACINGLY: Lizzie!

183
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,440
Lizzie Lewis...

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,039
You're a bad one, Ed Morgan!

185
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,959
The girls said not to go
with you, and they were right.

186
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
Am I bad?

187
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,560
Am I a bad boy?

188
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,960
You're a big girl now, Lizzie.

189
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
You can make your own decisions.

190
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,640
That's why I like you.

191
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
You're not like the others.

192
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
You don't follow the herd.
You're smart.

193
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:51,279
Don't you like it that someone
can see how smart you are?

194
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,719
Hmm?

195
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,480
I can see you, Lizzie.

196
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,200
The way you really are.

197
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,559
SHE SCREAMS

198
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,919
I don't want to hurt you, I don't...

199
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,079
I-I told my mam I'd be home by 9!

200
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,559
Shhhh...

201
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,320
PLEASE!

202
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh, God, someone help me!

203
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,999
Help me!

204
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,080
Help me...!

205
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,159
Owen? Are you all right?

206
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,679
She...she was so scared!

207
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,319
I-I-I couldn't...

208
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,800
I couldn't move!

209
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,400
I couldn't help her!

210
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,279
The first time, it happens to Gwen.
A boy, at the railway station.

211
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,719
Who's now in his 70s, alive and
well, and living in Butetown.

212
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,840
The second time it happens to Owen.

213
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,520
Like me, you didn't just see it,
you felt emotions that weren't yours.

214
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,440
She was terrified.

215
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,679
The victim's name was Lizzie.

216
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,279
It was maybe 40, 45 years ago.

217
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,679
Toshiko, do we know anything
about her yet?

218
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,640
Elizabeth Lewis. Lizzie. Only child
of Mabel Ann Lewis of Hafod Street.

219
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Died March 29th, 1963.

220
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,600
Raped and murdered on
Penfro Street, under the bridge.

221
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,119
17 years old. He killed her.

222
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:05,720
No-one was brought to trial. She
told her Mum she'd be home by nine.

223
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,479
So what about Ed Morgan?
That's what she called him.
"You're a bad one, Ed Morgan"

224
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:15,440
Look him up.
It's kind of a common name.

225
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,239
What's the connection? Where did they
come from? It's like being haunted.

226
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,039
Quantum transducer!

227
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,879
Look.

228
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,839
Wow. I'd kill to get one of those.

229
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,519
Transducers convert energy
from one form into another.

230
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,160
They're in headphones. They convert
electrical signals into sound.

231
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,960
They're in this device too
converting quantum energy
and amplifying it.

232
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,840
Into ghosts? Of course. It's emotion.

233
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Human emotion is energy.

234
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,879
You can't always see it, or hear it,
but you can feel it.

235
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,760
Ever had deja vu?
Felt someone "walk over your grave?"

236
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,160
Ever felt someone
behind you in an empty room?

237
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,519
Well. There was.

238
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,880
There always is. A ghost.

239
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,520
What else have we got on
Lizzie Lewis, what else have we got?

240
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,680
Um. 1963 - the records
aren't always that detailed.

241
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,200
What about newspapers? Witness
statements, coroners' reports. Owen!

242
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,640
What do you want me to find?

243
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,679
To re-open the case you need
new evidence, or a new witness.

244
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,080
I saw it happen.
You didn't! You weren't there.

245
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,439
You saw the echo of a moment,
amplified by alien technology.

246
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,000
So just tell me
how that will play in court?

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
Since when did we care about court?

248
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,360
Tomorrow we look for Bernie
Harris and find out what he
knows about this ghost machine.

249
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,240
We do our job and find
where this thing came from.

250
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,279
Now, go home.

251
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,239
Gwen! With me!

252
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Jack?

253
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,560
Whoa.

254
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,119
You need to know how to use these.

255
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,479
Though I hope you never have to.

256
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,119
So, do I...

257
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,680
SHE LAUGHS

258
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,239
I'm sorry, it's just...I don't
even kill spiders in the bath.

259
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:22,079
Nor do I, not with a gun.

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,600
It's all yours.

261
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,480
Target's that way.

262
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,119
Right.

263
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
Let's leave the roof
in one piece, shall we?

264
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,200
One hand, not two.

265
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,839
Turn sideways to the target.

266
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,519
Looking along your
shoulder, down your arm,

267
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,439
a straight line to the sights.

268
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,599
Bring up the gun.

269
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,240
Too fast.

271
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,520
It's all in the breathing.

272
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,480
Hold it firmly, don't grip it.

273
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,680
Breathe in. Focus.

274
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,720
Breathe out.

275
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
Squeeze gently.

276
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,239
(Wow.)

277
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,279
That was a joint effort.

278
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,839
Try it again.

279
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,640
This time on your own,
and remember, breathe in.

280
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,599
Don't grip it too tight.

281
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:17,120
Hold it and cock it back.
I didn't cock it right.

282
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,000
Nice and slow.

283
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,519
Up a little. Yeah.

284
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,680
Breathe first, then go.

285
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,239
You know how to do it.

286
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,080
Two hands or one? One.

287
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,760
Woo-hoo! Wow!

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,959
Nice work!

289
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:59,039
Like I said,
I hope you never have to use 'em.

290
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,039
Yeah.

291
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,720
Oh, God, look at the time.

292
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,880
When do you get to go home? You
seem to live here. You don't, do you?

293
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,080
Gotta be ready, the 21st
century's when it all changes.

294
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,159
And I hate to commute.

295
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,279
Where do you sleep?

296
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,359
I don't.
Doesn't it get lonely, at night?

297
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,159
I'd better get back,
Rhys'll be wondering where I am.

298
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,120
Goodnight. Goodnight.

299
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,159
Hello?

Ha-hey!

303
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,999
'Look, just so you know, erm,

304
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,720
'I-I-I put your whites on earlier,
even though you were bloody grumpy.

305
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,799
'They're still in the machine
so you'll need to hang them up.

306
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,679

but I didn't do the washing-up.

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,919
'But there's not much of that
so...and you haven't done it
for weeks anyway. Ha-ha!

308
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,720
'I'll see you when I see ya. Ta-ra.'

00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,799
Lizzie Lewis... You're a bad one,
Ed Morgan. Are you the-ere?

314
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,360
The girls said not to go with you
and they were right! Am I that bad?

315
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
Li-zzie...

316
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,519
Am I a bad boy?

Help me!

320
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,040
So, I've got to stay out
of trouble now, have I?

321
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Best behaviour.

322
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm a fully-trained police officer,
I'll have you on the floor
and handcuffed like that.

323
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,159
Mm-mm! Promises, promises!

324
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm so proud of you.

Rhys!

327
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,200
The taxi's here, we're gonna
be late! I haven't worn these
since the Luckley's interview.

328
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,400
I'll wear jeans with a shirt and
tie. It's mum's 60th. She wanted us
smart, that's the whole point.

329
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,040
I bust my zip!
I'll be flashing my family
allowance if I'm not careful.

330
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,440
What are you doing? Come on.
You're joking.

331
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,800
I'll staple it! You're not coming
near my valuables with that.

332
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,320
Hiya.

333
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,360
Daf and Karen had a barney.

334
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,720
She's making him sleep in the
spare room. I didn't fancy the sofa.

335
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,840
Look, I don't mind
you working all the hours.

336
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,280
I really don't. As long as you still
want to come home at the end of it.

337
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,000
I do. I'm here.

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
And you're gorgeous.

339
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
Bet you haven't hung the washing up.

340
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,360
Let's leave it
till tomorrow, eh? Aye.

341
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,560
Who is it? Mr Morgan?

342
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,760
What do you want?

343
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,519
Well? Mr Morgan.

344
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,959
I need to come in. Who said there
was gas? I can't smell anything.

345
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:43,640
There's nothing wrong. I'd have
noticed. Can you smell anything?

346
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,160
Was it next door? Can we go
into the living room, Mr Morgan?

347
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,599
There's nothing in here.

348
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,319
No gas fire, I mean -
I haven't got one.

349
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,919
There's an electric heater.

350
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't hardly use it.

351
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,680
What are you looking for?
Sit down, Mr Morgan.

352
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,319
Was it next door?

353
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,880
She can't mind her own business.
Something wrong with her.
She makes stuff up. Is it her?

354
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,760
You won't find anything, if it is.

355
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,559
It's all in her head, know
what I mean? What's your name?

356
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,319
How long
have you lived here, Mr Morgan?

357
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,719
Years. This was my mam's house.

358
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:34,640
You'd remember your neighbours.
People who lived in this street
a while ago?

359
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
People who lived...just round
the corner?

360
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
Like in Hafod Street?

361
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,360
Like...

362
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,879
Mabel Lewis? She only passed away
a few years ago, did you know?

363
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:48,879
Of course, she'd moved away
long before that.

364
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:53,440
Couldn't bear the memories.
Her daughter. Her only child.

365
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,879
Died in '63.

366
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,119
HEARTBEAT

367
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,439
Lizzie.

368
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,719
Little Lizzie Lewis.

369
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,240
She loved dancing. Do you remember?

370
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,479
You should.

371
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,879
Pretty girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes.

372
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:15,200
Used to wear a little pink coat.
Bet she saved all her pennies
to get that.

373
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,040
All the rage.

374
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,800
She was wearing it
last time you saw her.

375
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,680
Last time anyone saw her.

376
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:24,839
Alive.

377
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
Remember now?

378
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:36,120
(I know what happened
under the bridge that night.)

379
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,639
(Just the two of you. In the dark.)

380
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,880
(Water dripping from the roof
into the canal.)

381
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,760
(Lizzie's hair all wet
from the rain, cold and crying.)

382
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,920
I know what you did, Ed Morgan.

383
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,160
And here you are, just...living
your life...free as a bird.

384
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,919
Lizzie told her mother
she'd be home at nine.

385
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,400
"Please don't," she said. "Please."

386
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,319
PLEASE!

387
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,439
"You're a bad one, Ed Morgan."

388
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,359
"The girls said not to go with you,

389
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,279
"and they were right."

390
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,960
Get out! Get out! GET OUT!

391
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,559
You thought you'd got away with it!
You'll get nothing from me! I told
you before, you'll get nothing!

392
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,840
Get out of my house!

393
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,439
Get out of my house!

394
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,240
Bernie Harris!

395
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,040
Oi!

396
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,920
You mind out! Sorry!

397
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,320
Sorry!

398
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,919
Go on! Kick his head in!

399
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,640
Mam, there's a man in the garden!

400
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,600
There's TWO men in the garden!

401
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,360
Bernie Harris! Who?

402
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,800
That wasn't a question.

403
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Don't hurt me please, I got asthma.

404
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm not going to hurt ya.

405
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm going to bloody kill ya.

406
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,879
Why do they call you "Bernie"?
I burned my neighbour's shed down
when I was 12. Why?

407
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,240
I was having a fag.
Got a bit carried away.

408
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,839
Well, this IS cosy.
I hope he bought you flowers.

409
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:32,120
If this is about the dodgy fags,
I don't know what happened to 'em.

410
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:36,839
Well.

411
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,080
It's worth knowing, we're probably
the only people you can tell.

412
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,239
Me and a mate was using this
lock up, down on Moira Street.

413
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,839
Used to belong to this old guy.
Soft in the head, he was.

414
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,719
Still loads of his stuff
in there but we chucked most of it.

415
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:59,239
There was this old biscuit
tin full of foreign coins,
weird bits of rock, and that.

416
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:04,199
Thought it might be worth something.
Take it down the Antiques Roadshow.

417
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,759
Yeah(!) You don't know.
Cash In The Attic, all that.

418
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,480
So I takes the tin home with me
and that thing switched itself on.

419
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,399
It makes you see things.

420
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,839
Real things. Real people.

421
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,800
I was down the Old Wharf,
in the bay.

422
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,839
I seen this woman, with a bundle,
something wrapped up.

423
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:27,079
It was night time. She was putting
it into the water all secret like.

424
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:32,320
It was weird cos it was
like I was her, somehow.

425
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,600
She was scared, because she knew
what she was doing was wrong.

426
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,439
I knew, without seeing.

427
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:41,559
It was her baby, wrapped up.

428
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,519
Dead. She hadn't told anyone.

429
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,200
Then she just ran away.
And I realised, I KNEW her.

430
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,559
She's old now, but she lives up
by the Catholic Church in Splott.

431
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,080
So I goes up to see her.
Told her what I'd seen.

432
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,800
She give me money not to tell
anyone. You blackmailed her?

433
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,520
She offered.

434
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,359
I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

435
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,879
There's the old bridge,
on Penfro Street.

436
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:07,040
I saw a man...and a girl,
from ages ago.

437
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,040
He was following her back from
a dance, along the canal... Yeah.

438
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,959
I know, I saw it.

439
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,239
He doesn't know anything, does he?

440
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:19,599
It's been fascinating meeting you.
Where you going? That's mine!
You can't walk off.

441
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,359
I've got rights. So you don't
want the other half, then?

442
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,239
The other half.

443
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,679
Weird bits of rock. Foreign money.

444
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,319
Alien rock.

445
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,960
Alien money. Driftwood,
washing in through the rift.

446
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,559
So, Bernie. Was this thing
in two halves when you found it?

447
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,880
I've got it...
Like clicking Lego together.

448
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,559
You split this into two pieces,
didn't you? C'mon, you lot.

449
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,799
We'll take these too, if you
don't mind. Come on, you lot!

450
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,200
Aren't you gonna arrest me? We're
not the police. But I stole it.
I know.

451
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,159
And you're going to rob it
back off me. So call the cops.

452
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't go!

453
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,999
I only used it once...

454
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,400
..That half.
Anyway I couldn't use it again.

455
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,160
Why not? I'm going to die.

456
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,319
I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.

457
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:21,959
I'm just lying there,
bleeding, and then I die.

458
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,440
Just like I am now, not old.
What do you mean?

459
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,559
Come on, Gwen!
I'm gonna be 20 in July.

460
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,640
Do I die before then? GWEN!

461
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,560
Just wait there, I'm coming back.

462
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,999
Jack!

463
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,440
Jack!

464
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,320
Jack, I need to speak to you.

465
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,599
Gwen, no-oh-oh-oh!

466
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,439
Hello?

467
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,960
Help me, please...

468
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,039
I was too late, I couldn't stop it.

469
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,080
Stop what? He's dead.

470
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,320
Owen had the knife.

471
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,279
He wanted to kill him.
Owen? Oh God, I couldn't stop it!

472
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,760
Help me!

473
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,160
Christ, Gwen,
what were you thinking?

474
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,120
I didn't see him.

475
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,680
I didn't see anyone but me.
I just said his name. Owen.

476
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,639
Bernie said he saw himself,
dead in that street.
You saw Owen with the knife.

477
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,320
But I was holding it.
My hands were covered in blood.

478
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,759
That was one future,
one of many possible futures.

479
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:13,560
Whatever you saw, what Bernie saw,
might not happen.

480
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,399
Might not?!

481
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:17,440
Can't we find out?

482
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,919
You've got all this stuff,
alien stuff - isn't there anything
that can help? I'm sorry.

483
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,199
I wish we'd never found it.

484
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,520
Poor Bernie. Seeing himself dead.

485
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,320
He might not be.

486
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Possible futures.

487
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,960
He might like to know that. You're
certainly finding it a comfort(!)

488
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,920
I don't know what to do.

489
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,320
I found your Ed Morgan earlier -
did a trace.

490
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,999
I found him too. Phone book.

491
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,999
Took all night.

492
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,760
But I found him.

493
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,079
Paid him a visit this morning,
put the fear of God into him.

494
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,680
What did you find?
His medical records.

495
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,879
He's claustrophobic, paranoid,
depressive, got a couple of
recorded attempts of suicide.

496
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,959
He's barely left his house in years.

497
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:45,519
Look Owen, if Jack finds out...
Well, he won't, will he?

498
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,599
PHONE RINGS

499
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,879
Hello?

500
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,640
I think he thought I wanted money.

501
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,799
He kept saying, "You'll get
nothing from me." Paranoia. Yeah...

502
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:49,919
He said, "You'll get
nothing from me. Leave me alone.

503
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,880
"I've told you before."

504
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,999
Told who?

505
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,560
'Look, I've seen things

I know it sounds mad,

513
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:43,079
Dead, yeah.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

514
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,280
But you don't know how to stop it.
For you, or for me.

Ed Morgan. Owen went freelance
earlier and paid him a visit.

520
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,800
Wanted to frighten him.
Sounds like he succeeded.

521
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
I think Bernie Harris got
there first. Tried to blackmail him.

522
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,279
Bernie was blackmailing him?!

523
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:17,040
Looks that way. Ed thought
Owen was part of the same outfit.
Are you home yet?

524
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,239
No. I'm at Bernie's place.
We're heading over, stay
right there. Owen, with me!

525
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:24,759
Tosh, keep an eye on CCTV,
in case Bernie makes a run for it.

526
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,280
So you saw Ed Morgan assaulting
that girl and thought you'd make
some money out of it.

That's Bernie's street!

Yeah, I would be, if someone
would just...just tell me...

I'm gonna die. I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.

Bernie said he saw himself dead

Have you come for me, too?

I used to see it in people's
faces when they looked at me.

547
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
They knew!

548

Edwin... Little bitch.
You're all the same!

552
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,999
You'll blame me, make me the bad
one! Edwin, put the knife down.

553
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:32,799
I've wasted my life for you.
We won't tell anyone,
no-one else will know.

Stay calm. I won't say a word. You'll
never see me again. I promise.

I've got the knife, Edwin.

You were so close.

563
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:09,399
You were going for her, weren't
you? Just like with Lizzie.

As close as I am now.

567
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,919
Owen had the knife.
He wanted to kill him.

Why should you get away with it?

569
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:28,319
Owen. You said you were sorry,
that you didn't want to hurt her,
but you didn't stop.

570
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,120
Owen! What if I didn't stop?
Would I be sorry? Owen, NO!

I don't know.

Go and deal with Bernie!

No-one died. You stopped it from
happening. You got here in time!

Help me.

I couldn't stop it.

00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:05,479
He wanted to die.

583
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:07,640
He would have found
a way, no matter what.

584
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,760
I screwed up, I know I did.

585
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,919
But um...

586
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:14,639
I didn't kill him.
I could of, but I didn't.

587
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,639
No. I did.

588
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,080
Tosh is right.
It could have been anyone.

589
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,279
What about that? The problem
with seeing the future is you
can't just sit and look at it.

00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,479
Got to try and change things.

Come on.

598
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,919
I killed him.

599
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,039
I've still got blood on my hands.

600
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,079
He killed himself.

Come on, Gwen.

All that energy.

We're surrounded by 'em.

We can't see 'em,

610
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,599
we can't touch 'em...

611
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,720
..but they're there, all right.

612
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,680
A million shadows of human emotion.

Internal power drain.
