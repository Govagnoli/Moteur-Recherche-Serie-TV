00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,960
Torchwood. Outside the
Government, beyond the police.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,770
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,400
The 21st century is
when everything changes.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,300
And Torchwood is ready.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,770
What's this?

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,450
That's an engagement ring, that is.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,740
You're getting married?

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,450
Yes, Rhys asked.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,430
And you said yes?

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,940
Well, no-one else will have me.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,110
I need stability, jack, someone
I can rely on.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,460
Friday night

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,560
0h, it's the service she's meant
to be late for, not her hen do.

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,600
Where is she?

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,270
Here she is!

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,700
Here comes the bride Looking for a ride

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,440
Here comes the bride And
she'll take it up the aisle!

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,980
Ey, thought you'd bottled it.

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,300
No, I had a lot on at work.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,930
2 hours earlier

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,950
Careful, Gwen...

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
this thing eats people.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,590
Oh, sorry, love, on your way.

24
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,380
jack, It's a shape-shifter!

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,760
He could look like anyone now, but
he's leaving a trail of black blood.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,200
He's changed but it's definitely him.

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,710
He's heading towards Trinity Street.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,590
So, is there anything to eat
tonight, or is itjust booze all the way?

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,900
Booze, blokes, bopping and booze!

30
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,980
Gwen Cooper, you're nicked.

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,520
Oh, no.

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,570
This is such a bad idea.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm getting married in...
like, what, what.. thirteen hours.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,740
Oh, look at me!

35
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,250
Ah, you're gorgeous. Rhys is so lucky.

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,660
I know. I've heard about his cock!

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,630
What have you done to your arm?

38
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,870
Owen should take a look at that.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,310
Um, nothing, it'sjust a scratch.

41
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,430
Saturday morning

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,820
Gwen.

46
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,500
Gwen, you're pregnant. Almost full term.

47
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,720
Pregnant? That's not possible.

48
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,270
How are you doing, Gwen?

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,340
jack, tell me what's going on?

50
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,880
- Owen says I'm pregnant.
- You think?

51
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,190
jesus Christ. What with?

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,710
It's an exo-biological insemination.

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
That alien last night.

54
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,220
0h, get off.It bit me, jack. That's all.

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,430
It passed the eggs on in the bite.

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,890
Some species do that. A sneaky
way of keeping the bloodline going.

57
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,000
Boy, would Darwin have a field
day, if he'd made it to space.

58
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,940
Mmm. Yeah. Great.

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,060
Listen, Gwen, you are going
to be fine, I promise, OK?

60
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,030
If there was any biological
incompatibility you would be dead.

61
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,560
Now, according to this scan you're
carrying a non-sentient blastopheric mass.

62
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,230
A what?

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,740
It's a kind of alien egg. But I'm
going to look after you, I promise.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,110
We've got procedures for this situation.

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,370
This has happened before?

66
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,030
You've heard of immaculate
conception, haven't you? Well...

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,740
Right, we take you back to the Hub.

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,120
You lie back, I run a bio-xenic microtron, a
couple of days, you'll be right as rain.

69
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,430
Whoa, a couple of days?

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,660
In five hours I'm walking
down the aisle, Owen!

71
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,840
No, you're not.

72
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,960
Gwen, I hate to say this, but you're
going to have to postpone the wedding.

73
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,450
No! No way. Have you any
idea how much a wedding costs?

74
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,880
Listen, Gwen, you are not
carrying the baby jesus.

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,870
I don't care! I can't
put Rhys through this.

76
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,250
He's had to put up with enough, OK?

77
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,380
So I'm not postponing the wedding.

78
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,770
You are not thinking straight.

79
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,500
Do not bring my bloody hormones
into this, Mrjack Harkness!

80
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,110
OK, calm down.

81
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,750
Owen has said if this wasn't safe
I would know about it by now. Right?

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,750
As far as I know yeah...

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,490
OK, so I am good until after the wedding.

84
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,080
Then I'll do whatever I have to do.

85
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,970
Once I'm Mrs Williams.

86
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,640
Not before.

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,250
Hello?

88
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,420
- Rhys?
- Gwen!

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,700
Morning, lovely.

90
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,640
Don't worry... Banana Boat's on the phone
to the florist, checking the buttonholes.

91
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,540
0h, he showed up, then?

92
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,500
Yeah, Lanzarote cops let
him go with a warning.

93
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,910
Rhys, I need to see you.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,550
It's bad luck before the wedding.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,460
What's happened?

96
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,560
How is she?

97
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,280
She's going ahead with the wedding.

98
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,620
Which is fine, as long as she
doesn't go into labour at the altar.

99
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,360
Rhys might forgive her being pregnant, 

100
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,630
but not giving birth to a razor-toothed
monster that eats his family.

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,370
Could that happen?

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,020
Well, look, the pregnancy's advanced and
we're not familiar with the species.

103
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,410
Which is why you, Owen, need to
open up the guy with the teeth

104
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,190
and make sure there's no surprises.

105
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm on it.

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,680
Tosh, y0u've got an early pass to the
wedding. Keep an eye on Gwen. Ianto...

107
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,620
jack?

108
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,310
Gwen's going to need a
new wedding dress. Bigger.

109
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,130
Gwen? What is it?

110
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,710
You've got me going out of my head.

111
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

112
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,540
No, I'm not.

113
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,220
Can I help you?

114
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,100
Yeah, I'm looking for a
wedding dress for a friend.

115
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
0f course you are, sir.

116
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,370
You'd be surprised, we're quite used
to men buying for their 'friends'.

117
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,630
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,260
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.

119
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,850
Pregnant! You're pregnant!

120
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,000
Sorry, everything that could
have screwed things up...

121
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,410
I don't know what to say.

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,140
Don't say anything, all right!

123
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,070
Sorry.

124
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,760
It's not your fault.

125
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,390
It's them, it's jack. ..

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,630
It's not like he didn't know
you were getting married today!

127
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,660
Why the hell did he have
to send you out last night?

128
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,530
Because it's my job!

129
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,450
Well, are you going to be all right?

130
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,650
I'll be fine.

131
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,010
They'll take me to the Hub.

132
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,590
- 0wen's got this big machine thing.
- Good.

133
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,180
Yes.

134
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,540
Right, erm, look, I'll...

135
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,680
get Banana to start ringing people.

136
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,050
We'll tell everybody
you're ill.Appendicitis. ..

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,810
We're not postponing the wedding.

138
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,760
No way.

139
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,910
Forget the money, I want you where
they can look after you, right?

140
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
Getting married today doesn't matter.

141
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,760
It matters to me!

142
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,430
It's not about the money, Rhys.

143
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,880
I want to marry you. Today.

144
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,100
Whatever happens.

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,050
If the skies are suddenly
fill full of spaceships, 

146
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:40,250
or an army of weevils climb out ofthe
drains on St Mary's Street, you fool!

147
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,430
Do you not understand what
I'm saying, Rhys Williams?

148
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,710
All I want to do today is marry you, 

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,320
that's all I want to do.

150
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,440
Erm, Owen?

151
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,200
- Look at you.
- Do you like it?

152
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,730
Drop-dead gorgeous, Tosh, and I
think I speak with some authority.

153
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,640
I don't really get a chance to
dress up much. What are you wearing?

154
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,820
The truth is, Tosh, weddings have
never really been me, either.

155
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,110
Love 'em and leave 'em. That was me.

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,980
Owen, you should come, could be fun.

157
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,180
Have you ever seen a dead man dance?

158
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,300
I've seen Fred Astaire
in Easter Parade. Twice.

159
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
Late night TV.

160
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,050
God, you need a date, don't you?

161
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,200
Which this isn't, is it?

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,280
No, Owen, it isn't.

163
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,760
I just want you to come to the wedding.

164
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,040
Please.

165
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,920
0h, all right, I'll dig
out my dancing shoes.

166
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,640
I know it's been a
while, duckling, but, er ....

167
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,320
We never dreamed this.

168
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,200
Rhys and I wanted it to
be a surprise for you.

169
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,830
You're always full of
them, but, well, this beats them all.

170
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,570
Is this why you haven't come to see us?

171
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,550
All those cancelled visits?

172
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,100
No, no, Dad, don't be silly. It's my job.

173
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,100
This mysterious job.

174
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,400
All the same, Swansea
isn't on another planet.

175
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,750
You could have phoned, duckling.

176
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,990
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,440
Oh, don't be sorry, Gwen.

178
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,950
I can't wait to see the
look on Rhys's mum's face.

179
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,150
It's wonderful news, Gwen! Your dad's been holding
his breath waiting for a little grandchild.

180
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,830
I was with Rhys and his
mates all night last night.

181
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,690
No-one said anything
about Gwen being pregnant.

182
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,440
Well, Rhys was probably under orders.

183
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,930
Gwen knows how to control her men.

184
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,750
Studied under the Mistress.

185
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,870
Oh, here's Rhys's mum and dad.

186
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,450
- Brenda.
- Geraint.

187
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,820
- Barry.
- Hello.

188
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,930
Lovely to see you, Brenda.

189
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,430
What a lovely outfit.

190
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,060
Such a brave choice for you.

191
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,110
And you were so made for green.

192
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,510
- Big day at last.
- How's the bride?

193
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,650
Erm, maybe there's something
we should talk about...

194
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,320
- Gwen!
- This isn't going to work, Rhys!

195
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,030
We haven't thought it through.
What about after the wedding?

196
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,800
I've been thinking the same.

197
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,390
My mum and dad think that
they're getting a grandchild.

198
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,440
Your mum and dad are going to be
excited, they're going to be planning things.

199
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't tell them I've lost a baby.

200
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,600
They'll be devastated.

201
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,010
We could tell them the truth.

202
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,700
talk sense now, Rhys.

203
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,190
Well, the lies don't work, Gwen.

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
Remember? You tried it.

205
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,490
What do you think the
truth will do to them?

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,110
We've seen what comes through the rift.

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,930
I don't want my mum and dad living in fear
of what's prowling around in the sewers!

208
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,440
Hey, jack.

210
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,630
Hey. How are you doing?

211
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,380
Oh, you know, so far so good.

212
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,890
Look, Tosh should be with you any time.

213
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,190
Call it moral support.

214
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,590
I don't need a baby-sitter.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
Give it here.

216
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,740
We don't need you at all, jack!

217
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,930
You've already done
plenty to mess up today.

218
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,480
Do us both a favour and
keep well out of it, yeah?

219
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,100
Yeah, I hear you, Rhys.

220
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,720
Look, still, congratulations...

221
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
It's not his fault...

222
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,010
Aw, this is nice, in't it, Trina?

223
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,110
Class on toast. Ey, you
should get a brochure, Mervyn.

224
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,980
If some poor girl ever gets
drunk enough to marry you.

225
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,870
Eh, yeah, that's funny, 

226
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,360
I tell you what, it's going to take more than a
swanky hotel to get a catch like me down the aisle.

227
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,200
And here's mad Mervyn, the
Minister of Sound!

228
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,040
Well, the Duke of Disco, the Regent
of Rock and the Lord of Love.

229
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,900
Whatever you say, mate. Listen, do you
want a hand with the decks and the lights?

230
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,860
Aye, but...

231
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,890
I tell you what, reckon I'm up for
a bit of a Mervyn sandwich later.

232
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,010
All right, love? You've got a big
box. Do you want a hand with that?

233
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,350
No, thank you. I'm fine.

234
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,240
Are you going to the wedding?

235
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,550
I'm a friend of Gwen's.

236
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm Banana.I suppose you can tell why.

237
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,360
You come up in spots
and go soft quickly?

238
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,060
I'm playing the best man.

239
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,930
Evolution is full of surprises.

240
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,460
I get to check everything
personally, right.

241
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,840
- The disco, cake, flowers, seating.
- Bridal suite?

242
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,660
Do you fancy a little drink later?

243
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,570
Sorry, I'm intolerant
to vaso-active amines.

244
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,880
Bananas make me vomit.

245
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,810
Now, a looker like you must
be on the bride's side.

246
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,510
I don't think they've got your
sort of style in Rhys's family.

247
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,750
I like to put on a show.

248
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
jack sent me over with this.

249
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,130
It's beautiful.

250
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,400
And, I don't blame you for telling
jack and Owen to stick a postponement.

251
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,780
I think it's wonderful you're
getting married, whatever.

252
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,970
Tosh, thank you.

253
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,380
You're very lucky.

254
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,690
You know, Tosh, it'll
happen for you, one day.

255
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,720
There's always Owen. ..

256
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,130
I don't think so.

257
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,930
'In sickness and in
health, till death do us part'?

258
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,280
That's going to sound
like a bad joke, isn't it?

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,390
Erm, I'll let you get on.

260
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,090
If you need me, I'll be downstairs.

261
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,770
-Good luck.
- Thank you.

262
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,940
No, I like that one. Good choice.

263
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,910
I estimated Gwen's size from
the Hub security laser scans.

264
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,900
As you know, my dad was a master tailor.

265
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,730
He could size a man's inside leg measurement
by his stride across the shop threshold.

266
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,480
Ah, the family eye.

267
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,040
Remind me to test it some time.

268
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,270
- Well, if later on. ..
- jack.

269
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,020
- Yeah, brilliant, like that one.
- We've got a problem.

270
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,730
Look what our friend was hiding.

271
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,370
And that is?

272
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,820
A proteus gland. The shape-shifting
organ of a Nostrovite.

273
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,120
- And what is that, exactly?
- Trouble.

274
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,950
Big trouble.

275
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,510
No good-looking woman

276
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,660
should be at a wedding without a flower.

277
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,520
Ouch!

278
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,100
Bugger. Sorry.

279
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,030
Can I get you another drink?

280
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,530
Actually, do you feel
like getting a bite?

281
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,620
Another spritzer, please.

282
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,260
My God! It's true!

283
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,140
But how?

284
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
Steady on, girl.

285
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,320
I'm on stage later.

286
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,780
Hey, baby, if you're looking for
my room, youjust passed it, mind.

287
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm not. And don't call me 'baby'.

288
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,650
So what shall I call you, then?Beautiful?

289
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,310
Don't call me anything.
Don't say anything.

290
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,460
Don't move!

291
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,410
What have you done with him?

292
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,740
What the hell is going on?

293
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,830
You're lucky, I'm watching my figure.

294
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,520
But maybe I'll keep you for tea.

295
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,160
A Nostrovite is a shape-shifting
carnivore with a taste for human flesh.

296
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,980
It's intelligent and sneaky and, damn
it, I should have seen this before.

297
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,460
That's it with shape-shifters - you
never know what you're looking at.

298
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,130
What's the big deal? It's dead.

299
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,870
Yeah. This one is.

300
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,920
Does there have to be more?

301
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,270
Nostrovites mate for life.

302
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,850
You know, like swans and penguins.

303
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,600
Yeah, except you don't find
Nostrovites on greetings cards.

304
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,240
Right, and then the male Nostrovite carries
the fertilized eggs in a sac in its mouth

305
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,390
and passes it on to a host with a bite.

306
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,250
Gwen.

307
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,390
And where does the mother come in?

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,720
Well, she tracks down the
host, and rips it open.

309
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,640
That's Nostrovite childbirth.

310
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,230
And momma's out there right
now, looking for Gwen. Come on.

311
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,050
Are you all right?

312
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,520
0h, yeah, yeah, it wasjust a twinge.

313
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,420
He'll be flexing his muscles.

314
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,970
Not long to go now.

315
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,660
Tosh isn't responding.

316
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,810
Then let's get going.

317
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,190
Sure you're ready for this, Owen?

318
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,460
You know Nostrovites.

319
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,290
You think it's 100 feet away, and
it's chewing on your liver.

320
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,290
I don't need my liver. You need me.

321
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,860
The singularity scalpel?
Where are you going with that?

322
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,820
We need to get to Gwen
before the Nostrovite, 

323
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,200
we might not get back to the Hub and
the microtron weighs about two tonnes.

324
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,740
That thing kills people.

325
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,420
- I saved Martha with it.
- Lucky shot.

326
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,420
Listen you two, you'd
better start trusting me, OK?

327
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,600
I've been working on
it, and I've got it sussed.

328
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,830
With that Nostrovite, we
don't have too many options.

329
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,070
He's got a point.

330
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,970
What is it with you?

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,020
Ever since Owen died, all you
ever do is agree with him.

332
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,820
I was brought up never
to speak ill ofthe dead.

333
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,620
Even if they're still talking.

334
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,430
OK, Owen. But you better be
sure you know what you're doing.

335
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,590
Camouflage dressing?

336
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm having her dressmaker's number.

337
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,860
No way did Gwen look
pregnant last night.

338
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,880
0h, we must have had
way too much to drink.

339
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,080
She was late, wasn't she?

340
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,010
We must have been out of our
heads by the time she showed up.

341
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,510
0h, must have been, not to
notice she was pregnant.

342
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,150
Great night, or what?

343
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,840
You look like an angel.

344
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,250
Mum, I'm so sorry about this.

345
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,020
Gwen, it's a baby.

346
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,760
It's G0d's blessing.

347
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,230
You will be a good
wife, and a wonderful mother.

348
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,650
And me and your dad, we'll always be
there for you, and for our grandchild.

349
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,450
I'll see you downstairs.

350
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,530
I love you.

351
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,490
Mom..I love you too.

352
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,660
Hurry up, Geraint. And make sure
you don't leave a wet patch!

353
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,250
Gwen?

354
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,200
What is it?

355
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,050
I can't do this.

356
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,900
I can't lie to you and Mum, Dad.

357
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,820
Dad, this baby isn't Rhys's.

358
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,080
There's still no sign of Banana Boat.

359
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,220
He'll be fine, Dad.

360
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,270
Rhys, your mother says this
wedding is becoming a nightmare.

361
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,890
As if Gwen showing up
pregnant wasn't bad enough.

362
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,600
Now you are sure it's yours, aren't you?

363
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,280
Dad! I'm marrying her!

364
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,990
I love Gwen, every atom of me loves Gwen, 

365
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,390
has done since the first
time I laid eyes on her, OK?

366
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,870
You loved Cerys Morgan once.

367
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,760
I was 12 years old!

368
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,670
Still no Banana Boat.

369
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,330
Get away from me.

370
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,790
Well, I wish I could, love.

371
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,290
Don't bother, I've
tried. We're stuck fast.

372
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,560
I can't believe it.

373
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,460
Can you at least move your hand? Away!

374
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,020
If there's another man, if you don't want to
go through with the wedding, it's all right.

375
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,030
We'll sort things out.

376
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,130
There isn't another man.

377
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,500
- But you said.
- Please listen.

378
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,900
Cardiff is in the middle
of a space-time rift.

379
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,050
A what?

380
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,230
I work for an organisation that
controls what comes through it.

381
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,690
Comes from where?

382
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,390
Other planets. Other dimensions.

383
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,990
Aliens, Dad.

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,710
I'm talking about aliens.

385
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,490
That's what I do, Torchwood.
We're called Torchwood.

386
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,130
We hunt down aliens that
come through the rift.

387
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,170
Oh, my God.

388
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,670
Look, one bit me last night, don't
ask me to explain, I can't.

389
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,470
I'm pregnant. Rhys isn't the father.

390
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,260
It's an alien.

391
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,160
It's an alien.

392
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,890
Poor girl, this wedding's
got her stressed to pieces.

393
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,940
Thinks that baby of hers is
an alien from outer space.

394
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,420
- What?
- It'll be all right.

395
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,080
Once we get through today.

396
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,410
Gwen seems to be taking her time.

397
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,970
You remember how it is, Brenda.

398
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,790
The bride likes to make an entrance.

399
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Maybe, but I wasn't late for my wedding.

400
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,900
No. Barry might have got away.

401
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,470
If it comes back, it's
going to kill us, isn't it?

402
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,320
Calm down. I've got friends.

403
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,280
They'll find us.

404
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,630
But what if they don't?

405
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,750
What if it comes back? I mean, we're
it's bloody packed lunch, in't we?

406
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,620
Help! Help!

407
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,140
- Shut up!
- Help! Someone help!

408
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,300
If it hears you screaming, it'll
come and shut you up... permanently!

409
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,080
Help! Someone! Help.

410
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,070
That's enough, unless you want
to start singing in falsetto.

411
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,490
That really hurt.

412
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,760
Friends and family of Rhys and Gwen, 

413
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,520
we're here today to celebrate
the marriage of two people, 

414
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,770
a ceremony binding in law...

415
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,360
- How much further?
- A few minutes.

416
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,710
If people are going to make such
a big deal about getting married, 

417
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,910
why come all the way out
into the middle of nowhere, 

418
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,320
where no-one can find you, to do it?

419
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,250
That, to me, suggests inner conflict.

420
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,000
It's because the happy couple
want everything to be perfect.

421
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,020
An alien egg in your belly and
its mother coming to rip you open.

422
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,170
Yeah, perfect. ..

423
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,130
Rhys and Gwen have chosen to solemnise

424
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,060
their commitment before you...

425
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,710
But first the law requires
me to ask of you all, 

426
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,260
if there is anyone here...

427
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,660
who knows of any reason
why these two may not marry?

428
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,390
Stop!

429
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,980
Stop it! Stop the wedding!

430
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,120
- Hold on!
- jack?

431
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,040
Gwen, believe me, I'm sorry.

432
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,620
But this has to stop now.

433
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,810
Ijust knew that baby wasn't Rhys's.

434
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,790
What the hell are you doing here?

435
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,900
jack, I am marrying Rhys!

436
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,750
Not now. You can't.

437
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,180
Butt out! You've screwed things
up enough between me and Gwen.

438
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,740
You'll not mess up our wedding!

439
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,090
Listen, I am trying to save Gwen's life.

440
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,780
Yours, too.

441
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,590
What's going on, jack?

442
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,600
I've got a fix on Tosh's comms.

443
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,630
Tosh. Are you OK?

444
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,770
just get me out of here!

445
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,280
All right, mate. I'm Banana.

446
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,320
- More like a gooseberry.
- Owen.

447
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,310
Oh, jesus, that's disgusting.

448
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,170
Let's get you out of there.

449
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,140
There were two of them?

450
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,460
Ma and Pa Nostrovite.

451
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,950
They hunt in pairs. But childbirth
is more of a. . .three-way.

452
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,040
He finds and impregnates a host.

453
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,100
She then comes in like the
midwife from hell, hanging around, 

454
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,790
watching, waiting, until
the time is right.

455
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,480
Then it gets messy.

456
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,380
So you think it's near?

457
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,880
She's a shape-shifter, Rhys.

458
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,350
She could be out there making
small talk with your mom and dad.

459
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,290
You reckon it's all over, then?

460
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,770
Some good-looking guy sweeps up the aisle
and tells you to hold off on the confetti.

461
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,110
What are you going to do, marry Rhys?

462
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,550
So the baby's his, is it?

463
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,780
Didn't you see the look on
her face when he showed up?

464
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,680
Anyway, I'd better go and find Mervyn.

465
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,170
Tell him not to bother getting George
Michael out the back of the van.

466
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,360
We're not stopping the wedding.

467
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,050
Gwen, there isn't a choice.

468
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,880
Ever since I've met you, jack, all Rhys
has had to put up with, with me, is crap.

469
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,880
The lies. The danger. The complications.

470
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,340
But he's stood by me.

471
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,750
Who else would do that?

472
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,030
Who else would marry me

473
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,800
knowing that I am carrying
some kind of monster inside me?

474
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:01,940
I love him, and I'm going
to marrying him, today.

475
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,730
Thanks. But it is my wedding, too.

476
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,240
Don't I get a say?

477
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,940
That's all we need.

478
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,510
Ianto, after the girl, I
need this contained.

479
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,890
jack.

480
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,880
0h, God!

481
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,250
I want Gwen out of here now, jack.

482
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,200
jack, I've seen the shape-shifter.

483
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,950
It's a woman. She's in black.

484
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,930
Do you know what's going on?

485
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,950
I'm in the dark, too, Brenda.

486
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,920
The problem seems to be an American
with no sense of timing or fashion.

487
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,490
And your daughter!

488
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,940
Call the police!

489
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,150
Mervyn's been murdered!

490
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,140
jack, I'm afraid the
situation is uncontained.

491
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,110
OK, Ianto, get to the
SUV, jam the phone lines.

492
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,780
The last thing we need is
someone calling the police.

493
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,090
Tosh, you're with me, we'll
find that woman in black.

494
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,680
Gwen, Owen needs to operate now.

495
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,060
I want Gwen safe jack, now.

496
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,310
I want her safe, too, Rhys.

497
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,740
So we do what I say!

498
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,460
Rhys, jack knows what
he's doing darling, OK?

499
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,780
Look, if we run, the Nostrovite
will be waiting for us.

500
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,820
And we're running out of time.

501
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,360
What's the plan, jack?

502
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,510
I've got an idea.

503
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,570
Then I'm staying here OK?

504
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,190
Fine! Tosh, with me.

505
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,390
What the hell's going on here?

506
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,610
I had a signal before.

507
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,720
Move! I need everyone to stay
calm and do exactly as I tell you.

508
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,350
- Who the hell are you?
- Torchwood.

509
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,710
Gwen's Torchwood?

510
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,050
You mean you're real?!

511
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,270
- jack!There she is!
- Everybody down!

512
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,660
My God...!

513
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
Damn, that thing's fast!

514
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,630
But it won't have gone far.

515
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,770
Not without what it came for.

516
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,520
Come on.

517
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,570
That? The singularity scalpel?

518
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,810
That is your 'idea'?

519
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,320
Gwen, it's cool, believe me.

520
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,870
I've done a lot of work on it
since the whole Mayfly business.

521
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,410
What is it?

522
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,980
Alien medical apparatus...
so Owen thinks.

523
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,380
Thinks?

524
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,620
- Rhys? Rhys, are you in there, Rhys?
- That's his mother.That's Rhys's mother.

525
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,740
Hiya.

526
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,020
There's...There's a monster, Rhys.

527
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,940
That American and the japanese
girl, they went after it.

528
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
Stay here.

529
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,640
jack, everything OK?

530
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,550
It got away Owen. How's the patient?

531
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,100
Rhys and his mum are with her.

532
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,490
jack! That's Rhys's mum, there!

533
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,120
Come on.

534
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,600
This isn't Rhys's baby, Brenda.

535
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,710
It's an alien.

536
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,570
Get back, you ugly bitch!

537
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,420
What the hell do you think you're doing?

538
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,620
- That's my mother!
- No.

539
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,130
- It's the alien.
- I'm not an alien!

540
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,920
You're good, I'll give you that.

541
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,030
But I'm not!

542
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,320
Yeah, and the Lone Ranger
didn't have a thing with Tonto.

543
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,890
Does the shape-shifter copy smells too?

544
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,830
No. It'sjust physical.

545
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,970
Well, I'd recognise that
bloody awful perfume anywhere.

546
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,440
It's Brenda, jack.It's Brenda

547
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,380
That's for calling my
mother an ugly bitch!

548
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,470
If that's Rhys's mum, then
who's that outside?

549
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,770
Move! There she is!

550
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,580
The bond between mother and
child is a wonderful thing.

551
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,480
Let her go.

552
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,540
- Your mother for my child.
- No deal.

553
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,690
You don't have a say

554
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,760
Don't listen to it, Gwen.

555
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,040
It's OK, Mum, I'll make sure you're safe.

556
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,030
It won't kill you, you'll be OK.

557
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,100
You can't do this.

558
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,700
It's my Mum, Rhys. jack...

559
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,170
Rhys!

560
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,110
- OK, Mum...
- Gwen...

561
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,950
..you're going to be OK.

562
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,980
It's OK, Mum.

563
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,100
Stay calm, still.

564
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,510
Come to momma!

565
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,570
That's the kind of daughter
every mother must dream of.

566
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,550
Cool as ice, packing an automatic.

567
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,180
Gwen told me about you
but I didn't believe her.

568
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,120
It'll be back. Owen, get Gwen ready, I
want that thing dealt with now.

569
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,690
Gwen, I'll be with you in a minute.

570
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,020
I need to talk to Rhys.

571
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,460
- What about?
- Something and nothing. Trust me.

572
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,380
What, what?

573
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,770
Listen, Rhys, the singularity scalpel.

574
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,020
The last time I used
it I had two good mitts.

575
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,080
So you can't operate it?

576
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,450
I know you'd be more happy that whoever
had Gwen's life in their hands could...

577
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,020
well, rely on both of them.

578
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,180
Now I thought I could askjack. ..

579
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,150
No, no, erm, show me what to do.

580
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,360
Right, it kinda works itself.

581
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,410
Hello, jack.

582
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,600
Not quite the blushing bride, am I?

583
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,360
But I'd given up on things
going to plan a long time ago.

584
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,020
If life always turned out the way we
expected, what would be the point of living?

585
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,860
I didn't expect to
meet someone like you.

586
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,230
Ifl hadn't, I'd be married by now.

587
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,490
You're not the only one who met somebody
that knocked their world out of kilter.

588
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,410
Rhys has always been there for me.

589
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,120
Through all this madness, even
when I haven't even deserved it.

590
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,820
He's not afraid to tell me he loves me.

591
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,580
Gwen

592
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,100
Get her out of here!

593
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:00,710
Come on, then! Do me a favour!

594
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,580
Hey, are you all right?

595
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,140
I'm running around in a wedding dress with what
feels like a keg of lager stuck up my skirt.

596
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,690
What do YOU think, Rhys?

597
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,120
Come on.

598
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,620
What happened?

599
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,050
Put it down, Owen.

600
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,790
It thought that I'd gone off.

601
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,420
- Where's Gwen and Rhys?
- They've done a runner.

602
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,710
I emptied a clip into
that thing as did Gwen.

603
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,140
But some mother-instinct or something
is making that cow unstoppable.

604
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,760
Our guns don't work.

605
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,290
Then I guess we're
gonna need a bigger gun.

606
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,340
Rhys, I can't go any further!

607
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,890
- It's here!
- It'll hear!

608
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,250
I don't think there's any
point in keeping quiet, Gwen.

609
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,330
What the hell are you doing with that?

610
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,610
Owen showed me how to use it.

611
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,870
just do it! Do it!

612
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,920
- Rhys!
- All right, all right.

613
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,600
I've got it now.

614
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,940
I love you... I really love you.

615
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,110
Gwen!Gwen!

616
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,560
Gwen?!

617
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,000
Get away from her, Rhys!

618
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,520
Let me have my young
and I won't hurt you.

619
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,090
You're too late! It's gone!

620
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,630
And I've had a gutful of you!

621
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,600
You get my girlfriend pregnant, 

622
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,630
you impersonate my mum and
you ruin my wedding day!

623
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,890
Fuck!

624
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,040
Rhys, you're a bad boy.

625
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,260
And you know what bad boys get?

626
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,970
How's that for a shape-shift?

627
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,970
Jack;

628
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,740
Hey, that whole Evil Dead thing
looks pretty good on you, Rhys.

629
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,160
- OK?
- Yeah.

630
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,250
And...

631
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,330
the hero always gets the girl.

632
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,830
I am sorry.

633
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,090
I've spoilt everything, haven't I?

634
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,720
Do you still want to marry me?

635
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,550
..I call upon these persons here present

636
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,670
to witness that I, 

637
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,150
Gwen... Elizabeth. .Cooper. .

638
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,170
Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams, 

639
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,440
to be my lawful wedded husband.

640
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,180
..Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams, 

641
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,140
to be my lawful wedded husband.

642
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,310
Come here.

643
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,810
You ready to see that
dead man dance, Tosh?

644
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,360
Come on.

645
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,290
Mind ifl cut in?

646
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,240
Why not? I'm danced off my feet.

647
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm gonna find a beer.

648
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,170
Enjoy the honeymoon.

649
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,050
I will.

650
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,570
What will you do while I'm gone?

651
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,110
Ooh, the usual.

652
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,110
Pizza, Ianto. ..

653
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,470
save the world a couple of times.

654
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,790
Will you miss me?

655
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,620
Always.

656
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,830
Rhys is a lucky man, a perfect husband.

657
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,890
He's loyal. . . brave. ..

658
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,350
..he's got a hell of a swing on him!

659
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,550
And best of all, he really loves you.

660
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,340
I know.

661
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,370
MayI...erm...?

662
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,830
Yes.

663
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,470
There you go.

664
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,340
Cheers, mate.

665
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:43,200
You'd never think a couple of hours ago they all
nearly got torn apart by some alien psycho-bitch.

666
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,180
It's all been a bit too
much for my mum and Brenda.

667
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,390
I never thought I'd see that.

668
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,560
OK, jack, what's going on?

669
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,090
Strange thing when you mix
Level Six retcon with champagne.

670
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,470
Really makes the party go with
a swing. Then you fall asleep.

671
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,890
You retconned our families?

672
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,400
It's probably for the best.

673
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,190
I don't want my mum remembering
what happened to her today.

674
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,340
Maybe the happy couple shouldn't either?

675
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,100
No, thank you. There'll be
no secrets in this marriage.

676
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,080
Time for bed, I think.

677
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,920
We'll see you after the honeymoon.

678
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,890
Stay out of trouble.

679
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,390
Thank you for the
dress. It was beautiful.

680
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,060
Something tells me our
bed time is a long way off.

681
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,510
That's right, guys, it's been a busy
day, but we are not finished yet.

682
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,500
We've got a lotto do. We've
got a major mop-up operation.

683
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,310
And I want your best work.

684
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,880
Remember, it's Gwen's wedding.

685
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,420
That's what I love about Torchwood.

686
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,810
By day you're chasing
the scum ofthe universe.

687
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,050
Come midnight, you're the Wedding Fairy.

688
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,360
It's more than just a cinema.

689
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,190
It's the Electro.

690
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,950
A once-in-a-lifetime
show.

691
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,320
Why not step inside?

692
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,060
I just saw jack.

693
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,480
Part of this freak show?

694
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,300
The night travellers, they did exist.

695
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,230
They only performed
at the dead of night.

696
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,420
So two people from a piece of
film have decided to go AWOL?

697
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,040
- What's wrong?
- Her mouth's been drained of moisture.

698
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,910
What the hell are they up to?

699
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,670
Time to bring the others.

700
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,150
This way, please.
