1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:07,775
Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.

2
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:10,723
Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.

3
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:14,681
The 21st century
is when everything changes. . .

4
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,996
and Torchwood is ready.

5
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,011
WEEVIL ROARS

6
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:25,569
He's dead.

7
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,439
BELLJANGLES

8
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:36,350
Sorry, we're closing.

9
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,314
Excuse me, ma'am.

10
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,052
Documents on the body identify
the victim as Meredith Roberts.

11
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:53,294
No obvious signs of violence.
Are we saying it wasn't the Weevil?

12
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:57,975
Give me a chance, Miss Cooper.
I've only just started.
'Jack, your VIP visitor is here.'

13
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,287
I didn't realise
we were having a visitor.

14
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:05,322
Suddenly, in an underground
mortuary, on a wet night in Cardiff,
I hear the song of a nightingale.

15
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:11,640
Miss Martha Jones.

16
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:27,695
Oh, it's good to see you, Jack.

17
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:33,291
Toshiko, Owen, Gwen,

18
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:36,166
Ianto, meet Martha.

19
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,166
Just a casual visit or. . . ?

20
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,561
I'm here to complete your postmortem.

21
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,686
Dr Jones is from UNIT.

22
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:46,921
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, I get
a bit confused. Which one's UNIT?

23
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,403
Intelligence, military,
cute red caps.

24
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:53,079
The acceptable face of
intelligence gathering on aliens.

25
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,426
We're more ad hoc.
But better looking.

26
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:00,143
I identified a pattern
from UNIT's data on sudden deaths.

27
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:05,659
Toxic shock. Nothing to link
the victims. Different ages, sexes,
ethnic origins, occupations.

28
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,656
But there was
a statistically significant
concentration in South Wales.

29
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:13,403
Come on, Martha, be honest. You
just came all this way to see me.

30
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:16,531
Still struggling to conquer
your shyness, Jack?

31
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:20,596
So what about this pattern,
then, Dr Jones?

32
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:24,202
They were being written off
as suicides or accidents.

33
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,277
Look.

34
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,916
Puncture mark.

35
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:34,867
Hypodermic needle.
You'll find his bloodstream was
pumped full of ammonium hydroxide.

36
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,788
Bloodstream.
I was going to do that next.

37
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,501
Have you checked his medical records?
No. I wasjust about to.

38
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:43,697
Let's give it a go. You never know,
Owen, you might learn something.

39
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:49,851
One Meredith Roberts, age 45.

40
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,326
I know there's been a major crash
on the NHS system.

41
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,528
Wiped a shedload of files.

42
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,081
Including all the victims I flagged
up from the UNIT data. And now yours.

43
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,636
A computer crash wouldn't delete
data so cleanly. This is deliberate.

44
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,190
Let me look into it.

45
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,987
How's the family? Getting better.

46
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:10,387
They send their love. Give them mine.

47
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:15,108
So, End of the World Survivors Club.

48
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,216
God, I am so glad to see you, Jack!

49
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,503
See, you did come all this way
just to see me. It's the jaw line.

50
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,175
Once seen, always yearned for.

51
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,245
D'you miss him?

52
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:33,088
No. I made my choice.

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,198
Maybe sometimes. Ah!
Tiny bit. Tiny, tiny.

54
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:40,598
Then I come to my senses again.
Anyway, I've got plenty to occupy me.

55
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,961
Oh, yeah, Miss Highfalutin'.
What is it? Medical officer?

56
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,634
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:51,225
So do I have to call you ma'am? No.
Just follow my orders to the letter.

58
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:55,461
You should have called me
if you were looking for a job.

59
00:04:55,457 --> 00:05:00,690
I wasn't. This woman from UNIT
rang out of the blue,
said I was just what they needed,

60
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,773
that I'd come highly recommended
by an impeccable source.

61
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,611
You mean. . . ?
Well, who else would have done it?

62
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,608
He must have thought
he owed you a favour.

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,491
Guess we all do.

64
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:19,877
Do you think you could get me one of
those white caps for personal use?

65
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,670
Ianto might look good in it.

66
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,310
You want uniforms, get your own. Now,
am I going to get the guided tour?

67
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,511
Yes, ma'am, whatever you say, ma'am!

68
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,062
Huah! Leave it!

69
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,382
So that's the hot house. Tour
continues this way, ladies, please.

70
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,698
No dawdling. Um, so,
you know Jack pretty well, then?

71
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:41,208
Oh, we were only together
for. . .a few days.

72
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,935
But it was pretty intense.

73
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:48,447
You mean. . . ? Oh, God, no!
No, not that sort of intense.

74
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,682
Nothing like that.

75
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:54,157
Why? Are you and him. . . ?
No, no, not at all.

76
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:57,001
We must be the only two people
on the planet.

77
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,629
I know. What are we doing wrong?

78
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,036
Oi, you talking about me?

79
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,938
No, no, we were just discussing
alien flora, weren't we? Oh, yeah.

80
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:11,100
She's no fun.
Raise your game, girls!

81
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,891
You've got some well weird kit.
What's this?

82
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,733
Be careful. It's an alien artefact.

83
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,570
There's a lot of argument
about this.

84
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:22,852
But for my money, it's got to be
a surgical instrument. Really?

85
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,847
He's guessing. Typical medic. Hmm.

86
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,049
Well,
I call it a singularity scalpel.

87
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:33,398
See, what it does is concentrates
energy on a tiny fixed point without
damaging anything on the way.

88
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:38,547
It's brilliant. It's amazing. Yeah,
do you remember the last time
you did that, Owen. . . ? Yes.

89
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:42,665
Right, now,
all we're going to do is,
we're going to vaporise this paper

90
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:45,986
without even scorching the cup.

91
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:48,219
This is going to end in tears.

92
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:49,738
OK.

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,045
Aagh!

94
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,442
Er, haven't quite got
the calibration right yet.

95
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,671
Jack, there's been another attack.
Assault with a hypodermic.

96
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,795
Only this time, the victim survived.

97
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,310
Woman, aged 27.
She's in the hospital.

98
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:23,181
Medical records wiped,
just like the others.

99
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,295
Yeah, but the doctors
said they'd finished with me.

100
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,327
We're a bit different.
We know this is tough on you, Marie.

101
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,013
But did you recognise
the man who attacked you?

102
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:41,362
I already told the police.
We're different from them, too.
No, I never seen him before.

103
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,647
Did he say anything
in the course of the attack? No.

104
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,558
Open wide.

105
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:50,636
Look, he just,
he came towards me with a great
big bloody needle, didn't he?

106
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,952
You know, my dog bit him and then
I kicked him in the nuts. Respect!

107
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:59,739
MUSIC: "Feel Good Inc" by Gorillaz

108
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,056
This is a. . .three four.

109
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,282
So you and Jack go back a long way?

110
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,229
Forward and back, really.

111
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,992
What brought you together?

112
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:36,944
Let's say we were
under the same doctor.

113
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:43,533
These killings -
why the ammonium hydroxide?
It's a weird way to kill someone.

114
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,738
Yeah, it's gross. It's like
injecting them with bleach.

115
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,413
Unless the objective
isn't just killing.

116
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,771
It's destroying something
in the victim's bloodstream.

117
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:56,560
It's getting rid of evidence!

118
00:08:56,558 --> 00:09:00,005
Locally, we've got a murder victim
and a survivor.

119
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:03,761
Both attacked with hypodermics, both
with their medical records wiped.

120
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,232
And more cases across the UK.

121
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,757
We think the point of the attacks
is to destroy evidence
of their medical condition.

122
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:12,183
Gwen, Ianto, pursue
the criminal investigation. OK.

123
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,502
Martha, Owen will follow up
with the medical side. Fine.

124
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,376
Tosh, any luck in retrieving
those medical records? Not yet.

125
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,094
I'm gonna have to dig down
into the system memories,

126
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,095
see if I can find any remnants
of deleted or temporary files.

127
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,217
Completely illegally, of course.

128
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,770
Do what you have to.
We're not dealing with a freak
with some needle fetish.

129
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,529
This is a conspiracy.

130
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:33,924
Ianto, the police have found
another body in Heath Park.

131
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,127
It's got all the hallmarks
of the other attacks.

132
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,756
I'll get Gwen, head out there now.

133
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:53,423
What have you got?

134
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,295
Body was found early this morning.
Caucasian male, early 20s.
OK, thanks.

135
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,372
Who is he? Barry Leonard. Student.

136
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,165
Doctor said it looked like. . .
Toxic shock.

137
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:15,836
The attack took place in the woods,
so no witnesses, no CCTV.

138
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:17,234
Same as the others.

139
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:21,317
Yeah. Tosh just checked Barry's
medical records - already wiped.

140
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,837
The puncture mark on his eyeball was
identical to the other victims.

141
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,135
I mean, Jack's right.

142
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:30,105
These attacks are not random,
they're clinical. Professional.

143
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,781
More like assassinations.

144
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:35,495
Except Barry Leonard was a student.
Who'd assassinate a student?

145
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:39,257
Student Loans Company. Yeah, yeah,
I think you've just cracked it.

146
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,810
But why delete medical records?

147
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:46,891
You know, what did all these people
have in common? Owen's analysing
Marie's test results now.

148
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:51,081
So we've got no idea where the
killer will strike next and the
attacks are getting more frequent.

149
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:53,840
We keep looking, Gwen,
we'll find something.

150
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,632
'Martha, call from the hospital.

151
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:57,792
'Marie's had some sort of seizure.'

152
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,191
They want us at the hospital.
Marie's collapsed.

153
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:03,635
Yeah? My money's on this stuff. From
Marie's blood. It's a new one on me.

154
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,300
Yeah, me too. Have you run
an isoenzyme analysis on it?

155
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,539
No, not yet. What are you thinking?
Parasitic infection? Could be.

156
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,529
It's got to be down to this stuff,
or I haven't got a clue
what's wrong with her.

157
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,454
Yeah - no infections,
no deficiencies in organ function,

158
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:23,603
perfect cholesterol levels,
ideal blood pressure. Yeah, exactly.
She's so normal, she's abnormal.

159
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,729
Marie? Marie, can you hear me?

160
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,198
Mmm, yeah.

161
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,678
OK, you've got something
in your blood that
we don't recognise, all right?

162
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:35,754
We think it's behind
your current illness

163
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,151
and we need to know what's been
happening to you so we can help you.

164
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,388
Well, you're the doctors.
You tell me.

165
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:49,220
'Barry was my best mate.
We were doing the same course.'

166
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:50,864
Met him on the first day.

167
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,858
Was Barry doing
any sort of drugs at all?

168
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,329
Well, he used to be really clean.

169
00:11:56,326 --> 00:12:00,808
Reckoned he had to be careful
about what went into his body
because of his diabetes.

170
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,043
Barry was diabetic?

171
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:06,639
Sure. But when they cured that,
he was doing booze, blow. . .

172
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,481
Wait a minute. You're telling me
Barry's diabetes was cured? Sure.

173
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:14,430
That's impossible. Well, he stopped
taking insulin. He was fine.

174
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:18,706
Owen, something you should know.
So who performed this miracle cure?

175
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,340
He was very quiet about that.

176
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,297
All I know is, he was suddenly
flashing a load of wedge about.

177
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:27,335
Barry Leonard is said to
have recovered from diabetes.

178
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,370
Thanks, Ianto.

179
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,214
Listen, Marie,
you're gonna have to level with us.

180
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,895
This could be a matter of
life and death. Have you ever
had a serious medical condition?

181
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,682
Too good to be true.

182
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,683
What do you mean?

183
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,489
I had HIV.

184
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:47,279
You're perfectly clear of antibodies.
That's not medically possible.

185
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:51,198
That's the Reset. Reset?
What are we talking about? A drug?

186
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:54,755
Right, I'm not familiar with Reset,
so any idea of a chemical name?

187
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:04,539
Where d'you get it from, Marie?
I got it from the Pharm. The farm?

188
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,130
What farm?
No, P-H-A-R-M, the Pharm.

189
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:10,813
It's a medical research place,
all right?

190
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,286
How did you get it from there?
They gave it to me.

191
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:18,201
They paid me a lot of money. They
said I should to keep quiet about
it cos it was part of the contract.

192
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,282
Are you saying you were
a clinical trial subject?

193
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:23,643
Marie? Convulsing. Marie!

194
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,432
I'll give her another 10ml.

195
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,513
You're all right.

196
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,065
MONITOR FLATLINES

197
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,184
She's dead.

198
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,768
BUZZING

199
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,201
Emergency! Get us out of here!

200
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:58,126
BUZZING INCREASES

201
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,782
So it's an alien larva,
incubating in human bodies.

202
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:13,499
We've never seen anything like it.

203
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,819
So it left Marie's body
when she died,

204
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:18,855
looking for another host
for its next stage of development.

205
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:21,062
Which could have been us. Yeah.

206
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:24,374
Fortunately, when they didn't
find one quickly, they died.

207
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,054
I wonder what this cute
little larva grows up to be?

208
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:32,249
This, folks, is a molecular model
of the drug that
we found in Marie's blood.

209
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,717
She called it Reset.
So what does it do?

210
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:38,323
Think about when you run a virus
scan through your computer, yeah?

211
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,111
The software works its way through
the files and when it finds

212
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:44,639
a Trojan or a virus or whatever,
identifies it and then deletes it.

213
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,392
That is what this stuff does
to the human body.

214
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:52,024
But it's not just viruses.
It's harmful bacteria, toxins,
even mutant cells, you name it.

215
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,057
It's like the body's been turned
back to its factory settings.

216
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:56,853
It's the ultimate magic bullet.

217
00:14:56,853 --> 00:15:00,095
Supersedes anything and everything
in the pharmacological armoury.

218
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,891
That would be the greatest medical
discovery in history. Exactly.

219
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,322
Except, it comes bundled
with a lethal alien parasite.

220
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,927
Ah, not so good a discovery.

221
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,686
The parasite needs a healthy body
until it's incubated.

222
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,920
So the parasite egg
incorporates this magic bullet,

223
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,955
which puts everything in the system
back to its factory settings. Reset.

224
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,474
Neato.

225
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,146
So who runs the Pharm? Well,
the public image is innocent enough.

226
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:30,749
Private-public partnership between
the government and a consortium
of the pharmaceutical companies.

227
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:33,775
Researching and developing
cutting-edge biotechnology.

228
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:37,062
Their IT systems are way more
cutting-edge than they need to be.

229
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:40,726
Plus, they've got seemingly
unrestricted security clearance.

230
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:44,969
Which means they'd have
the capability to erase
medical records if they wanted to.

231
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,441
Exactly. Who runs this outfit?

232
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,285
Institute director is a Dr Aaron
Copley. Yeah, I know his work.

233
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:53,917
He's one of the most respected
research scientists in his field.

234
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,075
Harvard graduate.
Did research at Cambridge.

235
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:59,155
Last job, Harvard Professor
of Molecular Pharmacology.

236
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,116
Came to the UK to set up the Pharm.

237
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,985
Hmm, he's kinda handsome, too.

238
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,904
D'you think he'll like visitors?

239
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,336
Torchwood.

240
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:30,126
Sorry you've had
a wasted journey, Mr. . .Harker.

241
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,801
Harkness. And it's Captain,
but you can call me Jack.

242
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,477
Captain?
Where did you park your boat?

243
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,187
I like a man with a sense of humour.

244
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,470
Know any good gags
about clinical trials?

245
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:45,386
Well, Jack, none of these faces
mean anything to me.

246
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:51,214
And as the institute director,
I would have met them personally,
had they been our trial subjects.

247
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:54,932
Dr Copley. . . Professor, actually.

248
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,730
But I can call you Aaron, right?

249
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:02,760
See, this is a little awkward.

250
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,524
Two of these people were murdered.

251
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:08,441
Another died of a parasitic
infection of alien origin

252
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,915
and one of the victims mentioned
your organisation's name

253
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:16,076
shortly before she died.
Alien origin? That's preposterous.

254
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:20,150
Er, Professor,
when I was writing my MD thesis,

255
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,337
your published works on immunology
were very helpful, so thank you.

256
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,020
Glad to be of service.

257
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:30,056
Now, if there was a drug
that could restore the human body

258
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,770
back to its factory settings,
as it were, you would know about it.

259
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,326
You're right, I would.

260
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:38,487
But nothing like that exists.

261
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:41,849
I had a boyfriend whose
nostrils flared when HE was lying.

262
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:48,433
I'm already late
for my next appointment.

263
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,593
You go ahead.
We'll have a look around.

264
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,831
Well, obviously our research suites
are classified,

265
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,749
so we can't grant you access
to those, but we'd be delighted
to give you the PR tour.

266
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:00,141
Normally, Aaron,
we go where we like.

267
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:02,186
Not here, actually.

268
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,063
Ask Whitehall.

269
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:05,579
We're fireproof.

270
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:09,814
Yeah. I had a bad experience
with a politician recently.

271
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,097
I tend not to listen
to Whitehall any more.

272
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:17,125
Let me get someone to guide you
back to your vehicle.

273
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,088
Was it me,
or was he a little touchy?

274
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,560
Yeah, so much for
the polite approach.

275
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,877
We need to turn this place over.

276
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:26,001
BEEPING
Oh, yeah.

277
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:31,509
Cos this place has the highest
concentration of alien life forms
this side of the Rift.

278
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,348
Grey is so not her colour.

279
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,251
I can't hack in there, Jack.

280
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:53,011
And if I keep trying
a brute-force approach,
they'll know they're under attack.

281
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:56,441
An alien life form is preying
on humans. I need a way in there.

282
00:18:56,438 --> 00:19:01,717
Tosh, I've got the results of that
research. On the screen now.

283
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:10,869
Ianto, that's brilliant! They're
in the market for volunteers.

284
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:14,865
That's understandable,
given their wastage rate.
One of us goes in undercover.

285
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:18,224
No, we don't know enough about it.
Too many things could go wrong.

286
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:21,734
Unless you put a medic in there.
Someone who knew what to look for.

287
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:23,734
Yeah, but I can't do it.
They know me now.

288
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,893
I know it's hard to believe, Owen,
but I wasn't thinking of you.

289
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,922
No way.

290
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:33,324
Come on, Jack, I've been
in worse places and you know it.

291
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,866
OK.

292
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,500
Jack, can I have a word?

293
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,823
I know you're big buddies
from way back whenever, but you
can't just send her in like this.

294
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,704
Trust me. She's more than capable.

295
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,253
I'd rely on Martha
if the world was ending.

296
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,813
In fact, I did.

297
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,372
OK, these are the plans
for the Pharm's buildings.

298
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:09,165
From what Jack and Owen saw,
they reckon that the main house

299
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:12,199
contains Copley's office,
medical research suites

300
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:16,476
and the accommodation
for the clinical trials subjects.
What about the rear buildings?

301
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:19,317
Restricted area,
fenced off, armed security.

302
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:23,431
Jack thinks that's where
the readings of alien life
forms came from. Cool.

303
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,460
But you don't need to go anywhere
near there. Spoilsport.

304
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:31,262
The first thing you need to do
is get yourself accepted
as a clinical trials subject.

305
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:36,616
Don't try too hard, don't draw
too much attention to yourself.
Be invisible. I can do that.

306
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,933
Once you're in, we need you to gain
access to the Pharm's IT systems,

307
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,966
close down the system firewalls
and security protocols.

308
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:47,482
Tosh can gain access to the files
and see what they're up to.
Industrial espionage.

309
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:53,442
It's very civilised. Once you've
done that, get out. Don't take any
unnecessary risks. Understood. Cool.

310
00:20:54,873 --> 00:21:00,425
So, Jack asked me if I could
get you a UNIT cap to wear.

311
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,226
Did he? Well, red is my colour.

312
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,099
So am I right in thinking
that you and he. . . ?

313
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,740
We. . .dabble.

314
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,417
Yeah? Yeah.

315
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:17,289
So what's his dabbling like?

316
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:22,009
Innovative. Really?
Bordering on the avant garde.

317
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:23,926
Wow.

318
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:26,685
Oh, yeah.

319
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,399
Huh. So shall we get
your cover story sorted? Absolutely.

320
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,125
Fake ID.

321
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,914
First name Samantha.

322
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,718
Thought the Jones would be safe.

323
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:39,710
OK. How do I stay in touch?
Communication's very tricky.

324
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,342
The whole place could be wired.

325
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,458
We don't want you chattering away
to us and being overheard.

326
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,621
But I want to monitor you
at all times. So?

327
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:51,176
I don't need contact lenses.
You need these. OK?

328
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,415
Oh, I'm a camera! As Chris Isherwood
once said to me when we were
cruising the Kurfurstendamm.

329
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:05,718
And we. . .can. . .text.

330
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:10,005
Wow! Power comes from the body heat,
so they only work
when you're wearing them.

331
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:14,272
Yeah, so you have to wear them
everywhere. I'll do some things
with my eyes shut, then.

332
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:16,551
In an emergency,
we can speak directly to you.

333
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,592
The lens will communicate with
your sensory neuroreceptors.

334
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,266
Bypasses the auditory system.

335
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,501
But can't these signals
be intercepted?

336
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:27,614
Alien technology. Which exploits
a solution to the EPR paradox.

337
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:31,095
Oh, quantum entanglement
of remote particles. OK, cool.

338
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,376
Did I mention she was brilliant?

339
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:40,012
It's standard procedure to take
two blood tests. One of them
will be analysed overnight.

340
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:44,678
Thank you, Nurse. So tell us
the places you've been to, Samantha.

341
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:50,115
Well, I had a great time
in North America, France
and Germany, Australia. . .

342
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:52,067
What about the Third World?

343
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,023
Africa, Latin America?

344
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:57,470
No, but I'm sure
I'll get round to it.

345
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,498
Travel off the beaten track
can be a bit of a problem for us.

346
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:04,423
If you had some exotic tropical
disease, there could be unexpected
side effects,

347
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:07,144
and volunteers' welfare
is our absolute priority.

348
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:11,935
I don't think there'll be any
problem with that. And I'm very
conscious of health issues.

349
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:19,001
My mum's a nurse.

350
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,163
This is Professor Copley, Samantha.

351
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:25,510
Institute director.
Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

352
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:28,397
Tell her to get close to Copley.

353
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,074
I see you're a postgraduate
student at the moment.

354
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:35,185
- That's right.
- Studying what?
- Creative writing.

355
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,307
So I really need the cash.

356
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:43,143
I'm sure you'll understand,
Samantha, that we have a lot of
applicants. Tell her not to lose him.

357
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,103
We'll let you know in due course.

358
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,775
- Actually, there's something
I should have told you.
- Oh, yes?

359
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,480
It'll show up in
the test results anyway.

360
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:01,443
I did have a hepatitis infection.

361
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:05,112
No, no, no, she's bullshitting.
It's her way in.

362
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:09,389
I mean, I'm fine now,
but it stays in the blood.

363
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:12,501
Strictly speaking,
it's incurable, right?

364
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,538
That puts a different
complexion on things.

365
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,495
We could use a
subject with hepatitis.

366
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:19,975
- Are you available
to start right now?
- Well, sure.

367
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,941
I've brought my overnight things.

368
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:25,608
Then all we need is your signature
on this confidentiality agreement.

369
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:28,053
She's in.

370
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:32,848
As Chris Isherwood also said,
it's not the getting in,
it's the getting out.

371
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:37,202
- Thank you.
- What sort of drugs
will you want me to take?

372
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:40,041
We have got various products
at the clinical trials stage.

373
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:42,830
You'll be given a briefing
once we've finalised the programme,

374
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:46,867
and of course we won't proceed
unless we have your informed consent.

375
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,783
Come on, Martha.

376
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:58,025
Let her settle in.
It's gonna be a long night ahead.

377
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:09,772
You and Martha are getting on well.
Yeah, you know me - Mr Sociable.

378
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:13,084
She's beautiful. Is she?

379
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:18,379
You know she is.
Yes, well, fair cop.

380
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:20,692
And a doctor.

381
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,725
Perfect match.
No, she's only interested in work.

382
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:27,842
Do you think? Yeah, a bit of
flirting so I'll show her the ropes.

383
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,606
Plus, if I tried anything with her,
I think Jack would have my kneecaps.

384
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:39,278
What happened
to that, um, pool tournament
you were organising? That?

385
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:41,749
It was never a tournament.

386
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:46,423
What was all that about, then?
It was supposed to be a date. Sorry?

387
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,582
I was asking you out on a date.

388
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:51,183
A date?

389
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,500
You didn't realise? You and me?

390
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah.

391
00:25:55,689 --> 00:26:01,252
I see. And. . .you still want that?
Yeah.

392
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,051
Right.

393
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:08,048
I just thought if we spent
some time together, an evening. . .

394
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:09,561
All right.

395
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:11,955
Sorry?

396
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,162
Just do it. Are you being sarcastic?

397
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:16,278
No.

398
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,750
You're being polite. You'll stand me
up. I've just said yes, haven't I?

399
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,306
One date, see how it goes,
which might be nowhere.

400
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:25,510
That's fine. A drink. OK. Yeah.

401
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,866
I'm going to keep
flirting with people, OK?

402
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:32,213
Just cos of this, doesn't mean
I'm going to stop flirting.
You can be king of flirts. OK.

403
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,689
Right, then.

404
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:36,013
Yeah.

405
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:39,603
Good. We should, er. . .
concentrate on Martha.

406
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,166
Yeah.

407
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,572
Tosh, can you get us past this?
Easy peasy.

408
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:50,451
She just needs to get the
lenses to within the EPR field.

409
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:51,673
Tosh, can you help her blag her
way into the computer system?

410
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:56,309
It'll take time to talk
her through it. We don't have time.
I want her out of that office.

411
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,463
Well, if I can get her to give me
remote control of the computer. . .

412
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,755
. .I have control.

413
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,745
The life cycle of the parasite.

414
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,534
They call it the Mayfly. Wow.

415
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:46,613
We've never seen a species
like that before. It's beautiful.

416
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:50,372
It's lethal.
But what is Copley doing with them?

417
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:55,358
Martha, now we've got control,
we can go through all of this here.
Get out of there pronto.

418
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:06,509
Do you have that code-breaker
software? I'm sending the patch now.
Thank you.

419
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,337
'Break out in Zone A.
All return to Zone A immediately.

'The escaped creature

424
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:52,107
Jack? I've got the list of the
clinical trials subjects here.

425
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:54,134
Meredith Roberts,
Marie Thomas, Barry Leonard.

426
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,929
All the murder victims.

427
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:58,453
Ooh, who's BD?

428
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:05,681
Executive actions?

429
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,967
The Pharm are running
their own hit man,

430
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,357
which is unusual
for a medical research facility.

431
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:13,438
Wait, there's a name here
that we haven't seen before.

432
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,834
Elin Morgan? She hasn't been
reported missing or dead.

433
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:19,115
She soon will be.
Take Ianto and pull her in.

439
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:58,669
If the Pharm have their own hit man,
God knows what they're capable of.
Yeah, and I put her in there.

Agh! Ah!

444
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:21,282
EERIE WARBLING CONTINUES

445
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,042
Agh!

446
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,636
There it is!

447
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:34,472
Call patrol. Creature located.

448
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,899
I can't get her back.

449
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:47,420
We have to get her out of there.
That place is swamped in security.

450
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:51,086
If we steam in, we'll be putting her
at risk! We can't leave her there.

451
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:55,408
If I can't get her signal in 30
minutes, we think of alternatives.
Anything could be happening to her.

452
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,963
Martha can handle herself.
She's been in worse situations
than this. Sure about that?

453
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:08,311
What's that? Billy Davis' mobile.
He'll be at Elin's flat
in three minutes.

454
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:29,374
Hands above your head! Up!

455
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:40,597
Jack, we've got Billy Davis. He
could help get you into the Pharm.

456
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:47,347
Will you tell this gorilla to
let me go? ! What is going on? !

457
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:50,988
- Good work.

458
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:54,228
- You can't treat me like this!
- You lied to us, Samantha.

459
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:57,699
Can I just explain? I got bored stuck
in that room, so I went for a walk,

460
00:33:57,698 --> 00:34:01,259
and first that thing attacked me,
and then your heavies assaulted me.

461
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:03,892
You don't owe any
loyalty to Torchwood.

462
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:10,202
- Jack Harkness has treated you
in a criminally irresponsible way.
- Who? I really don't understand!

463
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,807
Don't bother.
This is not an interrogation.

464
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:15,882
Torchwood is irrelevant to us,
not even a nuisance.

465
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,713
In fact, they've done us
quite a favour putting you in here.

466
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:23,796
We've analysed your test results -
you really are something special.

467
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,429
Agh!

468
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:33,300
I got terrible guts, dunno what
it is. Bad conscience, Billy.
Try confessing. Get stuffed.

469
00:34:33,298 --> 00:34:36,461
OK, let's do it the hard way.

Merciful Christ! What the. . . ?

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,377
Agh-hhh!

472
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:46,049
They have a tendency to act up.

473
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:48,492
Losing him! Please!
Something to say, Billy?

474
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:52,636
Yeah, yeah, whatever you want, just
get it away from me! Get it off me!

475
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,880
OK, Billy, you've been
on a killing spree, why?

476
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:00,589
I work for the Pharm!

477
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,750
They'd been giving people
this Reset drug.

478
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:06,025
But there were these side effects -
parasites or something.

479
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:10,906
They were gonna die anyway, so I had
to get rid of them before any weird
symptoms showed up. . .in public.

480
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:13,457
Do you know what lymphocytes are,
Samantha?

481
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:16,537
A kind of white blood cell,
part of the immune system.

482
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,729
Well, your lymphocytes are really
quite extraordinary.

483
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:25,609
We've never seen anything like
them before, not in a human being.
Aliens are a different matter.

484
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:28,446
Aliens? I don't know
what you're talking about.

485
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,761
Your lymphocytes and God knows
what other cells have mutated.

486
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,725
- Mutated? How?
- Under the influence of radiation.

487
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:37,994
Radiation
that's not found in the temporally
stable environments on Earth.

488
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:39,638
I don't know what that means.

489
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:45,578
We've dealt with aliens before,
but we have never come across
anything as exotic as you.

490
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:49,025
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.

491
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:52,454
Tell me about it.
How is that possible?

492
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:55,739
What did you see out there?

493
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,367
This is mad.

494
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,847
I don't know what you mean.

495
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,644
Fine. If that's the
way you want to play it.

496
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:08,320
However it happened, it means you
have a uniquely effective immune
system, which is what we need.

497
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:11,196
We're developing a drug that's
going to change the world, Sam.

498
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:16,075
Incurable cancers, AIDS - all the
scourges of the human race wiped out.

499
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:19,197
A revolution in medicine
and social welfare.

500
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:20,986
Except it's still imperfect.

501
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:26,947
I'd like to know what your funky
lymphatic system makes of
those imperfections.

502
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,337
I am not taking that!

503
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,733
But you volunteered.

504
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:41,164
OK, we're going into the Pharm
and you're going to front it.
Yeah, yeah. OK.

505
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:45,450
My stomach! My stomach!
My stomach! Agh!

506
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:52,311
Agh! Whoa!
Owen, we need him alive! Yeah, all
right, I'm flying blind here, Jack!

507
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,871
Do something! Let's start with this.

508
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:06,339
I think I've got it, OK?
I've got the calibrations right.
I can get it out of him.

509
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:13,771
Whoa! God! Owen, deal with it.
Are you sure you had
those calibrations right?

510
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,653
I'm sorry, all right?

511
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:23,925
He must have breathed in larva
when one of his victims died.
This could have been me, or Martha.

512
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:31,589
I've given her twice
the critical dose.
So, Mayfly larvae are incubating?

513
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:36,036
Are you sure about this? Her
immune system's clearly reacting.

514
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,221
There's obviously
quite a fight going on inside her.

515
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,700
Keep your nerve.
We're making history.

516
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,856
Ianto, what have you done
with Billy Davis' body?

517
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,412
Um, I was just about to
dispose of it. Why?

518
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:54,488
I've thought of a way we can
use him to get us into the Pharm.

519
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,285
Clever, huh?

520
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:02,887
Oh, you are warped on the inside.
How do you think of these things?

521
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:05,596
I'll take that as a compliment.

522
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:44,997
Tosh, Gwen, Ianto, check out Zone A.

523
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,994
We're going after Martha. Let's go!

524
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,369
Hands above your head!

525
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:11,083
What have you done to her?

526
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:16,804
Tell me that's not Reset!
She's survived the larval stage,
the only subject ever to do so.

527
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:20,755
Fascinating. Turns out these
bugs practice sibling cannibalism.

528
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:24,428
Only the strongest individual is left
now. God knows what happens next.

529
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,668
Put a stop to this! I can't.

530
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,828
I don't know how.

531
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,162
Put your hands above your head!

532
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,158
Ianto.

533
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,393
Bloody hell.

534
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,420
Jack, this thing's killing her.
I don't know what I can do.

535
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,181
Owen, stay calm,
there has gotta be something.

536
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:26,692
What's happening here?
This is what the Pharm is all about.

537
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:29,969
We farm captive aliens
for the exotic chemical
products they metabolise.

538
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:35,521
What the hell do you get from
a weevil? Some pesticides, and a
quite powerful chemical defoliant.

539
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:39,153
But the weevils aren't what's
going to clinch the Nobel for us.

540
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,745
The Mayfly, our feedstock for Reset.

541
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:47,587
Given time, we'll tweak the
product for human use, and then
it'll be bigger than penicillin.

542
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:56,060
Jack, I can give you
a report on Zone A.

543
00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:00,292
They're holding dozens
of creatures. They seem to be
using them as test subjects.

544
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,750
Understood, Ianto.
Tell Tosh to go for total shutdown.

545
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:24,109
This place is a torture chamber.
I don't need to debate
medical ethics with you.

546
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,059
You abused the Mayflies,
you turned them into parasites!

547
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,817
We didn't understand how
the Mayflies reproduced.

548
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:32,770
We tried to limit the damage.

549
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:35,615
What, by murdering people?
They were going to die anyway.

550
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:39,487
We're on the edge of
the greatest discovery in history.
It has to be worth a few sacrifices!

551
00:41:39,482 --> 00:41:42,292
You must understand that, Jack,
you're involved in alien research.

552
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:43,362
Not like this.

553
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:54,436
I'm closing this place down.
In your dreams. This is a state
of the art, official facility.

554
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:56,987
Oh, I'm not going to
do it by sending a memo.

555
00:41:56,984 --> 00:42:00,101
We're in control of your IT systems.

556
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,140
As we speak, we're crashing your
data banks, wiping your records.

557
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:07,025
That's cyber terrorism!
And that'sjust for starters.

558
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:13,057
We're going to trip the systems
of your fire, radiation and
biohazard safety networks.

559
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,207
The power will be cut,
sprinklers will be activated,

560
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:21,567
and a large part of this facility
will be sealed and flooded with
inert gases. The aliens will die.

561
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:24,243
They're already dying. This way
they'll be put out of their misery.

562
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,966
For God's sake,
we're on the same side!

563
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:32,157
No. Combating hostile aliens
is one thing, but this is slavery,
exploitation, a war crime!

564
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:34,468
Jack, I need your help!

565
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:38,989
What the hell are you doing? !
This is the only way
we'll save Martha.

566
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:43,780
I think I understand how it works.
You'd better be sure
because it's never worked before.

567
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:48,814
Owen, are you sure it's safe? OK,
Jack! Owen, tell me you're sure!

568
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:52,645
You could kill her with that thing!
We're losing her!

569
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:55,532
Ah!

570
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:03,960
A SINGLE TONE BLEEPS
What have you done?

571
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:13,343
Oh, bloody hell, it worked.
Thank God for that.

572
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,263
Let's get her out of here.

573
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,981
I am prescribing rest and
recuperation for you, madam,

574
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:29,727
and a few days in bed,
preferably under my supervision.

575
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:32,809
Owen, I don't know how to break
this to you - I've got a boyfriend.

576
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:36,239
Yeah, but has he saved your life
like I did?

577
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,446
Um, yes, actually.

578
00:43:39,437 --> 00:43:41,280
Oh.

579
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:43,996
Arms up on there.

580
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,992
Do it.

581
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:50,869
'Facility shut down programme. All
personnel must evacuate immediately.

582
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,467
'Facility shut down programme.

583
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,145
'All personnel must
evacuate immediately.'

584
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,423
OK, let's go!

585
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:02,578
Did you really think I was
going to let you just walk away?

586
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:07,645
You've ruined everything I've worked
for. Now, let's not be stupid. OK?

587
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,809
We're both rational men, scientists.

588
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:18,924
I know you don't want to shoot.

589
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:25,384
You're next!

590
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,146
Owen! Can you hear me, Owen? !

591
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,584
You've got to help him!
Owen, stay with me. Owen.

592
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:36,138
Owen, look at me, look at me.
Owen, look right at me.

593
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:40,174
Stay with me, Owen, stay with me.
Stay with me, buddy. Come on.

594
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:43,607
Owen, speak to me!

595
00:44:57,272 --> 00:44:59,035
He's dead.

596
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,459
Owen. . .

597
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,285
The time is 21.30.

598
00:45:25,282 --> 00:45:27,284
Autopsy on Owen Harper.

599
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,601
Torchwood officer 565.

600
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:31,964
Aged 27.

601
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:34,754
Autopsy begins.

602
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:37,472
The energy just went off the scale.

603
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,745
Can you see where it is?

604
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:42,144
You can't use it.
Who knows what'll happen!

605
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:44,226
I was hoping for a miracle.

606
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,781
Where did he go? It's here. Martha!

607
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,895
It must be death,
because it's stolen my life.
