8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,990
Well, hold on a tick.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,510
Yes, follow me, Gerald.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,820
Well?

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,890
We're pretty close.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
This way.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,110
Don't panic.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,300
I thought you were a ghost.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,080
Scared the wits out of me!

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,440
Sorry.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,580
Thought you'd be used to
us creeping around by now.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,060
Have you seen any recently?

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,830
Ghosts.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
I've seen three today.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,390
It's getting worse.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,090
Well, you're a very brave girl.

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,630
Thank you, sir.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,720
Where did you see them?

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,400
In the ward.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,650
St Teilo's Militry Hospital

27
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,440
Mind, half of this lot see things anyway.

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,760
Nerves shot to pieces. Poor chaps.

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,120
Soon as they're better, they'll
be sent back to the Front.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,130
Field Marshal Haig's order.

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,070
'Every position must
be held to the last man.

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,910

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,950

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,030
Gerald.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,610
Come on.

36
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,110
We're right on top of it!

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,730
Hello?

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,570
Tell them.

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,810
Tell us what?

40
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,930
Tell them what to do.

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,370
You're the only one who can stop this.

42
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,800
If you don't, it's the end of everything!

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,400
Tommy!

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,550
Take me.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,890
I'm in there in the ward, in 1918.

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,630
You have to take me
so I can be here now.

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,510
just take me!

48
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,610
- Tommy, you'd better come with us.
- Why?

49
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,410
Don't worry.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,750
I'm Gerald and this is Harriet.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,480
We'll look after you.

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,270
Who are you?

53
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,610

Thomas Reginald Brockless.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,570
Tommy.

60
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,670
24 years-old.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,810
Sort of.

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,670
Well, he's either 24 or he's not.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,640
Depends how you work it out.

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,970
All right, when was he born?

65
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,110
Owen, you ready?

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,870
Yeah, nearly.

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,790
Is that a dress, Tosh?

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
I do believe it is, Owen.

69
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,740
Well, where is he?

70
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,060
He's been here for 90
years, longer than any of us.

71
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,530
Any of you.

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,150
Torchwood have used alien
cryogenics since Victorian times.

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,120
They froze Tommy in 1918.

74
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,030
So he's 24 or 114 years old.

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,120
I know which one I'd choose.

76
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,190
We have to wake him up
every 12 months or so.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,510
Well, defrost him.

78
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,310
One day only, then back in the freezer.

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Why?

80
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,170
Check he still works.

81
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,120
One day, we're gonna need him.

82
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,120
Right, everybody ready?

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,590
Come on, Tommy.

84
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,000
Charging 200, clear!

85
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,270
Charging 360. Clear!

86
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,990
Gwen, quick. It's all right!

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,850
Get off me, leave me alone.

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,690
- Tommy!
- Leave me alone!

89
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,380
Tommy!

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,340
Tommy, listen to me!

91
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,470
Tommy Brockless!

92
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,220
It's me, Toshiko.

93
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,260
Toshiko.

94
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,820
Remember?

95
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,140
Gets harder every year.

96
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,540
Good left hook, though.

97
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,970
Do you know where you are?

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,700
Torchwood.

99
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,830
That's right.

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,740
Is it time again?

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,030
Blimey.

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,610
How are you feeling?

103
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,480
HE COUGHS I could murder a cup of tea.

104
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,830
Don't expect the best china.

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,710
I'm starving.

106
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,270
Here, tuck in. There's
enough to feed an army.

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,410
Nice dress.

108
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,630
Thank you.

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,820
Got your slacks on
underneath. Is it that cold?

110
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,250
It's the fashion this year.

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,680
1968, they were in miniskirts.

112
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,490
Thought all my Christmases
had come at once.

113
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,930
Shame they haven't made a comeback.

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,250
I still don't get it. Why is he here?

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,890
Like I said
- one day, we're gonna need him.

116
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,600
And pull to me.

117
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,340
Good. Seems fine.

118
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,940
- Ijust need to take a few blood samples.
- Blood samples.

119
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,690
We wake you up once a year and
stick needles into you, it's not fair.

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,440
Once a year for you, it's
every day for me.

121
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,820
So, while we wait.

122
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,660
Tommy Reginald Brockless, born 1894
February the 7th in Blackley, Manchester.

123
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,020
Private officer in 10th
West Yorkshire regiment.

124
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,140
Very good.

125
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,090
Only son of Constance
May Bassett, died 1900, 

126
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,670
and Thomas Campbell
Brockless, died june 1931, aged 57.

127
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,770
Heart attack.

128
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,880
That's right, isn't it?

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,620
Yes. I'm sorry.

130
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,830
It's all right.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,510
Ijust haven't had that
much time to get used to it.

132
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,750
Right, I need to have a look at this leg.

133
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,750
St Teilo's Hospital, 1918.

134
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,790
There was a time-shift.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,530
A fracture in the rift means that two
slices of time were erupting into each other.

136
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,170
A slice of 1918, and?

137
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,520
A slice ofthe future.

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,010
But we don't know exactly what slice.

139
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,210
It could be tomorrow, it
could be in 100 years' time.

140
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,950
What will happen?

141
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,980
Chunks of 1918 will start
to appear at the hospital.

142
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,930
A few at first, then more and more.

143
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,220
When the time-shift is
complete, it'll start a chain reaction.

144
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,850
Unless we stop it, time-shifts'll start happening
all over the country, then all over the world.

145
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,030
But how does Tommy fit in?

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,550
He helps to stop it somehow.

147
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,270
Torchwood 1918 left us sealed orders.

148
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,230
'Eyes-only documents.

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,960
'FA0 Torchwood commander
overseeing case 1918/T B.

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,350
Tommy Brockless?

151
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,900
It's stuck.

152
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,740
- No, it's locked.
- OK, where's the key?

153
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,020
temporal lock tied in with the
rift frequencies at the hospital.

154
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,620
***the box will open and we'll
find out exactly what Tommy does.

155
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,100
But why would they keep
us in the dark, jack?

156
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,700
I guess we'll find that out, too.

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,410
Seriously, what do you think?

158
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,140
You look like a film star.

159
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,570
Who, Charlie Chaplin?

160
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,950
Come on.

161
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,030
Have you got any more of those
pretty boys in the freezer?

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,530
Hands off, missy. Tosh got there first.

163
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,150
Thanks for holding
the fort while I'm out.

164
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,580
No worries, have fun.

165
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,080
Be careful.

166
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,390
Where are you off?

167
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,010
Drink, film, maybe a pizza.

168
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh, very nice.

169
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,870
I'll be on the mobile if you need me.

170
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,640
- Have a lovely time.
- Bye!

171
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,250
He's a frozen soldier from 1918.

172
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,870
Nobody's perfect.

173
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,830
Slow down, what's the hurry?

174
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,440
I've only got one day, I
want to see everything.

175
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,240
Captain Scott...

176
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,660
sailed from here, when he
went off to the Antarctic.

177
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,010
1910.

178
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,590
I was 16, papers were full of it.

179
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,450
Took him two years to get
there and then he snuffed it.

180
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,890
So, what've you been up
to since I last saw you?

181
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,520
This and that.

182
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,330
Work, mostly.

183
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,730
What?

184
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,610
I knew you were going to say that.

185
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,680
It's what you always say.

186
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,090
So how's the piano playing going?

187
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,480
That's what you said last year.

188
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,660
'I'm gonna learn the piano.

189
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,750
' Never got round to it.

190
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,070
I bet you never learnt Spanish, neither.

191
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,310
I bought a book, though!

192
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,430
Oh, are you made of money?

193
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,870
I haven't had time.

194
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,930
You talk about your life like
you've got no control over it.

195
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,590
Well, Torchwood's pretty much 24/7.

196
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,250
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,820
But you weren't conscripted.

198
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,470
I mean, it's your choice, right?

199
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,870
Yeah... I suppose it is.

200
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,320
He's a bit of all right.

201
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,560
He's the boss.

202
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,060
Nothing changes.

203
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,260
She's all right, too.

204
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,950
Harriet Derbyshire.

205
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,410
Wonder what happened to her.

206
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,840
She died the year after that was taken.

207
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,760
26 years old.

208
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,700
So young.

209
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,880
They all were.

210
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,060
Nothing changes.

211
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,070
Where are you going?

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
St Teilo's Hospital.

213
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,580
And bloody cheer up, will you?

214
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,300
Good shot!

215
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,080
You're still winning.

216
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,130
It's alljust maths, really.

217
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,110
Angles, velocity...

218
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,350
Give you women a vote, equal
rights, look what happens, eh?

219
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,620
So, er, you got a boyfriend yet?

220
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,080
You sound like my mother.

221
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,150
Ah, so you haven't, then.

222
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,960
You had a girlfriend? In 1918.

223
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah. Ellie.

224
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,740
We courted for two years.

225
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,260
What happened?

226
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,750
I, er, stopped seeing her...

227
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,220
last time I was home on leave.

228
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,840
The war changed me.

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,100
I couldn'tjust carry on like before.

230
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,870
Right pair we make.

232
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,280
Hello?

233
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,050
I said hello.

234
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,780
Can you hear me?

235
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,930
Look, can you hear me? If you just...

236
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,130
Hello?

237
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,420
Are you all right, love?

238
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,490
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

239
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,140
They're knocking down the hospital?

240
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,940
Yeah, that's what they said.

241
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,100
Could that have
triggered the time-shift?

242
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,590
Could have.

243
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,160
Maybe all the psychic trauma and rift
energy charged it up like a battery.

244
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,990
1918, this place was
full of wounded soldiers.

245
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,230
They had four years of it.

246
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,200
Passchendaele, the Somme.

247
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,090
A million British soldiers
killed during the Great War.

248
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,990
It was like walking into hell.

249
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,890
Believe me.

250
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,450
I was there.

251
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,980
Owen? You got anything?

252
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,480
All quiet here.

253
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,440
just that little spike from earlier.

254
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,580
This is more Tosh's thing than mine.

255
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,750
Shalll give her a call?

256
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
Not yet.

257
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,290
just keep watching.

258
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,550
Yes, mate.

259
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,440
Half a bitter, and a vodka and diet
tonic with a slice of lemon, please.

260
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
***

261
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,240
Seems like there's
always a war somewhere.

262
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,830
That's not exactly a war.

263
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,690
Looks like one.

264
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,010
First year they woke me up...

265
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,010
1919...

266
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,910
they told me it was all over.

267
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,250
We won.

268
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,300
'The war to end all wars, ' they said.

269
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,420
And then three weeks later, you
had the Second World War.

270
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,360
After all that.

271
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,800
Do you never wonder
if we're worth saving?

272
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,020
The human race.

273
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,230
Yes.

274
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,380
I think we're worth saving.

275
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,590
Wars and all.

276
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,830
What?

277
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,490
What?

278
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,520
I wasjust thinking...

279
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,590
I'd do anything for you.

280
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,930
Yeah, all you have to do is say, 'Tommy, you're
my brave, handsome hero, and I need you.'

281
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,670
Is that all?

282
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,080
And whatever it is, I'll do it.

283
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,440
I mean it. Anything.

284
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,490
What is it?

285
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,340
I dunno.

286
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,960
I just felt something...

287
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,240
Jack?

288
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,390
jack.

289
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,770
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #

290
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,670
# I like them all...#

291
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,900
I bet you say that to all the girls.

292
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,000
# Show me a skirt, and my
brain simply whirls...#

293
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,270
Matron won't have singing.

294
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,190
You'll get a good telling
off if she hears you.

295
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,840
# I love their dimples and curls #

296
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,010
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #

297
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,790
# And I start my day over again #

298
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,890
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #

299
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,270
# And I start my day over again...#

300
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,280
jack, you see anything?

301
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,470
'Cos I've got a little
mountain range this end.

302
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,970
' Yeah, we've got a few ghosts here.

303
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,270
'Gwen, you OK?

304
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,410
'Gwen?

305
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,080
' I'm fine.

306
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,390
They're ready for you now.

307
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,010
Hello?

308
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,230
Hello?

309
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,360
I see you.

310
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,940
Why won't you leave us alone?

311
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,050
You shouldn't be here!

312
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,900
I don't mean you any harm.

313
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,750
You shouldn't be here!

314
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,340
You shouldn't be here!

315
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't mean you any harm.

316
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm going to get you!

317
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,250
Stop, stop, no.

318
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,050
- Please, no, Tommy, no.Stop!
- I'm putting you down.

319
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,520
I'm putting you down.

320
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,670
What?

321
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,320
Nothing.

322
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,390
Thanks.

323
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,070
Thanks?

324
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,330
Itjust caught me out.

325
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,080
- It doesn't matter.
- What?

326
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,760
I know it's silly...

327
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,510
but I'm a bit older than you.

328
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,880
I was born in 1894.

329
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,050
You know what I mean.

330
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,220
So I'm old enough to die for my country
but I'm too young to give you a kiss?

331
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,330
You daft lass.

332
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,500
What goes on in that head of yours?

333
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,040
Thanks.

334
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,460
You're welcome.

335
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,150
I might be young, but I've
seen a fair bit in my time.

336
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,680
So what do you want to do now?

337
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,430
Well, we could go back to mine but there's
only room for one and it's bloody freezing.

338
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,530
You want to come back to my place?

339
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm hardly rushing you.
You've known me four years.

340
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,820
Four days...

341
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,480
OK.

342
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,050
Let's go.

343
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,150
I'll race you, come on!

344
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,350
jack.

345
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,300
Toshiko!

346
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,950
We're on our way.

347
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,100
Demolishing the hospital is
what triggers the time-shift.

348
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,080
So, don't demolish it.

349
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,260
Too late, it's already started.

350
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,470
What happens next?

351
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,380
Two different times should
never exist simultaneously.

352
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,300
You want to be in 1918, or now.

353
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,070
Not both.

354
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,040
So when 1918 becomes fully manifest...

355
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,600
It's really going to screw us up.

356
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,010
OK.

357
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,110
Linear time.

358
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,310
Screwed up time.

359
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,710
Imagine your life as a straight
line, from birth to death.

360
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,730
Try drawing that line on the
paper without straightening it out.

361
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,220
It's impossible.

362
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,510
That's why we've got to stop it.

363
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,930
Ianto, is that box doing anything yet?

364
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,650
Still locked.

365
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,370
We need to find out how fast
the time-shift is happening.****

366
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,280
Tosh, Owen, go to the
hospital, we need readings.

367
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,830
Cover the place with rift monitors.

368
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,600
Gwen, go through the files, see
if there's anything we missed.

369
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,540
Need a hand?

370
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,420
just a couple more.

371
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,980
Listen, Tosh, I've been meaning to say...

372
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,000
just be careful.

373
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,900
What do you mean?

374
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,730
You're very close to Tommy.

375
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,160
I've only known him for four days.

376
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,530
Yeah.

377
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,980
You've fallen for him, haven't you?

378
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,930
I can be myself with him.

379
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,750
I don't have to pretend.

380
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,470
No, I understand.

381
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,210
I didn't think you had some
weird fetish for defrosted men.

382
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,310
Ijust, um...

383
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,220
I don't want you to
get hurt, that's all...

384
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,270
if you have to say goodbye.

385
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,460
'0wen, can you hear me?

386
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,330
' What is it?

387
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,040
'I need you to go down into the east wing
of the hospital, 'head for the second floor, 

388
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,170
what used to be the radiology section.

389
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,640
'I think that area contains
a clue to the time-shift.

390
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,850
'I read this earlier, but
it didn't make any sense.

391
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,860
' In the Torchwood 1918
field report at the hospital, 

392
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,580
they describe a certain
detail of their encounter.

393
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,440
It reads...

394
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,490
'Through a hole in the external
wall, we hear the roar of great engines.

395
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,670
'Outside is a woman in strange
armour, ripping a Union jack, 

396
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,410
'perhaps some future
heroine ofthe Empire.

397
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,640
' What does it mean?

398
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,540
'It doesn't sound like us, now.

399
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,910
' The time-shift has started, but maybe it
doesn't complete until years in the future.

400
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,020
Got it!

401
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,220
It's some kind of advert...

402
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,790
for car insurance.

403
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,760
'That sound they heard
must have been traffic.

404
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,470
' It's not years in the future...

405
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,410
it's now.

406
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,980
Instructions?

407
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,060
Yeah, for Tommy.

408
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,360
And Toshiko.

409
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:44,160
In 12 hours, there'll be a brief moment when
both times exist before the time-shift completes, 

410
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,510
when Tommy can be here now, and in 1918.

411
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,260
He needs to be in the hospital, ready
to step from one time to another.

412
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,250
So he'd be right inside the time-shift?

413
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,910
And he can close the
fracture that caused it.

414
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
And when the fracture's closed?

415
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,250
1918'll be back where it belongs.

416
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,420
So will I.

417
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,150
For good?

418
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,460
Yeah.

419
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,830
You're the only one who can do this.

420
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,420
We brought you from 1918 to
now, and when you go back to 1918, 

421
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:28,300
your life will be like a
thread, stitching time back together again.

422
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,200
A stitch in time.

423
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,950
How?

424
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,960
This is a rift manipulator.

425
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,670
It's basically a key.

426
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,300
Once you're inside the time-shift, you
can close the door behind you.

427
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,020
And that's it?

428
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,730
I'm gone?

429
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,800
Tommy, stay with Ianto.

430
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,410
Tosh? With me.

431
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,030
What happens to him?

432
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Three weeks after we
send Tommy back, he dies.

433
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,750
How?

434
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,620
He's shot by a firing squad.

435
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,960
I don't understand.

436
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,030
In 1918, Tommy was
suffering from shell shock.

437
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,150
That's why he was in the hospital.

438
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,150
When Torchwood took him and froze
him, they froze his most recent memories.

439
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:36,280
When he returns to 1918, he'll
revert back to who he was.

440
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,050
He'll be shell-shocked

441
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,980
and so he'll be executed by
the British Army for cowardice.

442
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,970
They can't shoot him for that.

443
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,430
Lots of soldiers who were shell-shocked
recovered enough to be sent back to the Front.

444
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,110
But once they were there...

445
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,200
they broke down again.

446
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,660
So they kill him?

447
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,710
More than 300 of them.

448
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,610
Then we can't send him back.

449
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,040
- We have to.
- I can't do that.

450
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,120
Yes, you can.

451
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,160
He trusts you.

452
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,360
To send him to his death?

453
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,770
To help him save the future.

454
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,090
It has to be you.

455
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,200
We've kept these in the archives.

456
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,350
You were wearing them in the
hospital when Torchwood took you.

457
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,890
Good job the moths
haven't got into them.

458
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,230
So I'll be saving the
world in some pyjamas?

459
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,680
How daft is that?

460
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,500
Torchwood 1918 saw you with Tommy in
the hospital, telling him what to do.

461
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,760
I know you.

462
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,400
You're strong enough to do this.

463
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,360
Does Tommy know what happens to him?

464
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,640
No.

465
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,120
If he asks me, what do I say?

466
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,870
Where's Toshiko?

467
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,490
Still in with jack.

468
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,810
so

469
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,880
TOITIOITOW |T|0|‚Äô|‚ÄôIi|‚ÄôIQ.

470
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,360
What time is it now?

471
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,310
Ten to nine.

472
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,760
So what do we do till then?

473
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,270
You don't know, do you?

474
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,790
What would you like to do?

475
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,610
The night before we went over
the top, we used to play cards, 

476
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,210
write letters, have a
drink, if anyone had some.

477
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,690
Well, we could do that.

478
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,490
Yeah.

479
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,910
But you're not coming with me.

480
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,370
I'm going on my own.

481
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,280
We were just wondering what
Tommy should do tonight.

482
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,100
He can come home with me.

483
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,540
He's not our prisoner, he
doesn't have to stay here.

484
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,420
Does he?

485
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,440
No.

486
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,090
If that's what you both want.

487
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,660
Tomorrow morning, 6.30.

488
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,440
Come in.

489
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,460
You're very neat.

490
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,570
Yes.

491
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,920
Well, there's only me here.

492
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,660
And me.

493
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,050
just for tonight.

494
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,980
Then I'll be gone.

495
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,380
I never thought it would really happen.

496
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,570
I won't even be able to write to you.

497
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,500
You're going to be so far away.

498
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,970
I worried you'd see me getting older.

499
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,220
This time tomorrow, he'll
be back in 1918.

500
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,860
In his own time.

501
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,970
Would you go back to
yours? If you could?

502
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,190
Why, would you miss me?

503
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,810
Yep.

504
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,710
I left home a long time ago.

505
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,560
I don't really know
where I really belong.

506
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,110
Maybe that doesn't matter any more.

507
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,290
I know you get lonely.

508
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,990
Going home wouldn't fix that.

509
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,520
Being here, I've seen things
I never dreamt I'd see.

510
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,620
Loved people I never would have
known if I'd just stayed where I was.

511
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,940
And I wouldn't change
that for the world.

512
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,330
What did he tell you?

513
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,520
What happens to me?

514
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,830
They send you back to France.

515
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,920
Then what?

516
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,330
Do they find my body?

517
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,310
That's something.

518
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,570
It's time.

519
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,580
You know we can't be
here when it happens.

520
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,900
Come on.

521
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,120
We're safe for now.

522
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,700
Are you all right?

523
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,510
Tommy!

524
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,390
Where is she?

525
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,840
In1918?

526
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,430
'Tommy, Ithink you'd better come with us.

527
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,790
'Don't worry.

528
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,900
I'm Gerald, this is Harriet.

529
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,230
'We'll look after y0u.

530
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,180
' Torchwood took me.

531
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,770
'Tommy!

532
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,520
' Tommy!

533
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,490
Stay here.

534
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,390
I won't do it.

535
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,090
I can't go back.

536
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,810
- You've got to.
- No!

537
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,690
I know what'll happen.

538
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,540
They'll send me back to the
Front, I'll be back in the trenches.

539
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,930
Help me.

540
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,270
You've got to go.

541
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,920
Why me?

542
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,370
You're no better than the generals.

543
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,570
Sitting safely behind the
lines, sending us over the top.

544
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,260
Any one of you could
go, but you're sending me.

545
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,470
We belong here.

546
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,530
I'm sorry.

547
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,940
I've been shoved from pillar to post
all my life by the Army, by Torchwood.

548
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,640
All this time I've had, it means nothing.

549
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,050
- Tommy.
- Get off.

550
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,110
- Tommy, get up.
- No!

551
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,780
Leave us alone. Please.

552
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,240
You've got two minutes.

553
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,080
Listen, you're a hero.

554
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,440
Do you know that?

555
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,410
Because you stop the
time-shift and save everyone.

556
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,940
You save us all.

557
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,350
I can't do it.

558
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,540
We need you.

559
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,610
I don't want to be a hero.

560
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,320
I want to stay here with you.

561
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,470
Hello?

562
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,730
Tell them.

563
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,110
Tell us what?

564
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,210
Tell them what to do.

565
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,230
You're the only one who can stop this.

566
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,950
If you don't, if you don't, it's
the end of everything.

567
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,800
Tommy!

568
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,930
Take me.

569
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,300
I'm in there in the ward in 1918.

570
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,200
You have to take me
so I can be here now.

571
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,340
just take me!

572
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,090
I'll be gone soon.

573
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,650
Remember...

574
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,020
the rift key. Use it.

575
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,010
You've got to get back into bed.

576
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,460
Like y0u've never been away.

577
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,940
Then use the key.

578
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,130
Tommy?

579
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,120
Remember.

580
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,710
It's nearly time.

581
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,430
What are you doing?

582
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,800
You shouldn't be in here.

583
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,050
Go, go!

584
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,390
Come on!

585
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,100
- Tommy, Ithink you'd better come with us.
- Why?

586
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,150
Don't worry. I'm Gerald, this is Harriet.

587
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,910
We'll look after you.

588
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,910
Who are you?

589
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,070
We're Torchwood.

590
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:19,600
Where are we going?

591
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,110
Somewhere safe. Trust me.

592
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,490
Keep going.

593
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,540
Don't look back.

594
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,730
You should be in bed.

595
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,510
Still warm, at least.

596
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,230
Not been gone long.

597
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,790
What's happening?

598
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't know.

599
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,380
The time-shift hasn't stopped.

600
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Toshiko, show me the city, now!

601
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,220
It's spreading out from the hospital.

602
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,270
What the hell are they?

603
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,930
- the past, erupting into the present.

604
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,460
They're everywhere.

605
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,620
What about the rift key?

606
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,530
Tommy isn't using it.

607
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,470
Why not?

608
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,020
I don't know.

609
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,680
Because he'sjust gone back to 90
years ago, because he's shell-shocked?

610
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,450
One of us will have to go back.

611
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,320
jack, wait!

612
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,770
You'll get stuck in 1918.

613
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,440
I've got an idea.

614
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,870
The time-shift's forcing the rift open.

615
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,690
We can use it to our advantage.

616
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,860
A tiny amount should do.

617
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,500
We know Tommy's exact location in time.

618
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,630
If we send an image of
you through to him...

619
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,910
I can go into Tommy's mind.

620
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,740
As a psychic projection, if we're lucky.

621
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,970
And Tommy will be able to see you.

622
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,950
I can make him use the key.

623
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,190
Let me do it.

624
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,250
He trusts me.

625
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,910
OK.

626
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,810
How long have I got?

627
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,660
Minutes.

628
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,300
You've got one shot, Tosh.

629
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,990
That's all.

630
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,190
All right?

631
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,990
Tommy.

632
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,710
Tommy. Tommy.

633
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,330
She's found him.

634
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,490
It's me.

635
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,210
Toshiko.

636
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,000
Who?

637
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,940
I'm hereto help you.

638
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,710
Is this yours?

639
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,000
No.

640
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,540
Do you know what it is?

641
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,970
Tommy, it's a key.

642
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,950
You have to use it.

643
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm scared.

644
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,930
It's all right.

645
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,390
That's why I'm here.

646
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,420
I'm a coward.

647
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,450
No, you are not.

648
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,410
What am I fighting for?

649
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,130
For the future, for me.

650
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,110
Because you're my brave, handsome hero.

651
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,160
Tommy, use the key.

652
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,840
Thank you.

653
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,520
Goodbye.

654
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,860
It's all right.

655
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,170
He did it.

656
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,270
Thank you.

657
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,660
He trusted me right to the end.

658
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,700
Because you were strong.

659
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,050
All of this.

660
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,600
is still here because of you.

661
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,360
Because of Tommy.

662
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,380
Let's hope we're worth it.
