6
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:18,832
Please, don't go.

7
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:21,553
Come on. Aaargh!

8
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,153
I didn't want saving.

It's my grandfather's
88th birthday today.

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,159
I thought you'd done this for me.

14
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,480
88 is a joyous year
for the Japanese.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm off to London
to watch men throw rice.

You get that in the Balti
after stop-tap.

17
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:02,962
OK, down to business.
What have we got?

18
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,762
The Ritz Dancehall.

19
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:09,963
It's been derelict since 1989
but someone's complained about
hearing music...

20
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,164
music from the 1940s.

21
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,644
Shhh!

22
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,485

Look at the chandelier.

28
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:33,169
No neon lights back then.

29
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:37,330
Just dashing young soldiers
and pretty young ladies.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,571
And as they danced, the girls
would look into their partners'
eyes, smile softly and say...

31
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,491
Jack! Mind my laptop.

32
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:48,892
I was thinking more along
the lines of, "How long

They're not ghosts.
It's a simple temporal shift.

39
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:34,703
And it's beautiful!

40
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:39,304
We should get out.

41
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,627
Do call again. I would love to.

42
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,268
It's night!

43
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,989
Where's the SUV?

44
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,030
Has it been stolen?

45
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,111
No.

46
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:13,831

Tosh's rift monitor programme.

50
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:42,278
She set it to alert me if there
were any further movements.

51
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:47,319
The rift's been opening
more and more recently.

52
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, well, I've noticed that.
Doesn't take a genius.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,441
Tosh reckons the equations
are forming a pattern.

54
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,361
I should call her.

55
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,842
She may have readings her end
and this is over my head.

56
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:03,163
Um, why wasn't I told about this?

57
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,363
Well, you've been off, haven't you?

58
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,204
The line's dead.

59
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,645
It's no use. It's dead.
I can't get through to the Hub.

60
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,166
Let's get back inside.

61
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,086
That's where we were
when we crossed.

62
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,647
'Gwen, can you get down
to Sage Street?'

63
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,288
Yep. What's up? 'We need Tosh.'

64
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,769
The rift monitor sounded. She's
with Jack but their phones are dead
and we can't access her files.

65
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,289
'OK, I'll get down there now'.

66
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,930
We really are in 1941.

67
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,291
What if we can't get back?

68
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:44,092
Flotsam and jetsam slips through
all the time. We'll get back.
Look on the bright side.

69
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:48,413
Gives you one hell of an excuse for
your party. I have a life there.

70
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,654
And they can't help us because
I have the latest readings in here.

71
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:55,294
People are staring at us.

72
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,895
We need to try to blend in.

73
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,056
It's easy for you to say.

74
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:04,897
I'm the only Asian here. Don't worry.
You're with the Captain.

75
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:10,818
Hey. I've got into Tosh's files,
all her reports.

76
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,459
See there, December 24th.

77
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,259
That's when Diane
flew through the rift.

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,300
I had to let her go.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,541
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

80
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,382
If Tosh knows a way
of opening the rift,

81
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,142
maybe we can get Diane back.

82
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:34,383
Jack would never allow it. Opening
the rift could devastate the city.

83
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,144
# My love is true

84
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:40,225
# And just for you

85
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:43,545
# I would do most anything
at any time... #

86
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:52,107
Water, please, and a brandy.
I haven't seen you in here before.

87
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,868
Three and six, please, sir.

88
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:58,629
I'll, er...

89
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,349
get them.

90
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,390
Thank you. On one condition. What?

91
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:16,793
# Come to me,
my melancholy baby... #

92
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:21,074
Why's George dancing with a Jap?

93
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,236
The SUV's here.

94
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,477
They must be here somewhere.

95
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,518
Jack?

96
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,399

# Come to me, my melancholy... #
Do you mind?

100
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:18,527
I'm only borrowing her, mate. Maybe
she doesn't want to be borrowed.
You want to make something of it?

101
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,127
You can always dance with me.

102
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:25,328
OK, I'll lead. You follow.

103
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,849
Come on, Tosh.

106
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,051
Jack, we're meant to be blending in.
Cut it out, kiddo.

107
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,572
Sorry about that.

108
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:43,813
The men are a bit lively tonight.
It's last day of OTU tomorrow.

109
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:47,933
Apologise to the gentleman, George.
I was only dancing.

110
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,054
I think it was your fist
he didn't like, not your foxtrot.

111
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:56,815
I'm sorry.
It's OK. You barely got me.

112
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,457
I think the lady also deserves
an apology.

113
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,097
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:07,298
Apology accepted.

115
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,738
Let's get a drink, George.

116
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,699
Hey, are you a volunteer too? Yeah.

117
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,660
BOTH SPEAK AT ONCE: I'm Captain...

118
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,341
You go first. I'm Captain
Jack Harkness. 133rd Squadron.

119
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:24,342
Look this way, please.

120
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:32,704
Right, the Ritz Dancehall,
opened in 1932, shut down in 1989.

121
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:35,584
Due to be demolished in one week.

122
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:38,665
Now, the reported music
is from the 1940s.

123
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:43,226
Why is a ghost job taking them this
long? All those young soldiers...

124
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,187
Owen, look.

125
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:50,228
There.

126
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,589
One more for the record, sir.

127
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,350
I insist.

128
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,631
Thank you, gentlemen.

129
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,272
I should be heading off..
Hey, I didn't catch your names.

130
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,112
Toshiko Sato.

131
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:14,473
I'm Captain James Harper. 71st.

132
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:17,914
71st, that's where I'm hoping
to be posted. What's your poison?

133
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:21,755
Maybe later. My friend and I were
in the middle of something. Sure.

134
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,036
Why does that man have your name?

135
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:33,637
I'm lost enough here
without you holding back on me!

136
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:39,039
It's not my name.

137
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,319
It's his.

138
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,319
I took his.

139
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,960
But I didn't realise he was...
so hot!

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,561
Jack!

141
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,601
I know too much.

142
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:52,642
Then...share.

143
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:55,202
You wouldn't want that. Trust me.

144
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,843
We have to get back.

145
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,763
What's in here?

146
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:05,245
I've got half the equation in here.
The other half's back at the Hub.

147
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:08,365
If I can find some way of getting
these figures back to base,

148
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:12,606
they can combine them, open the rift
and bring us back through. Come on.

149
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,847
I heard music earlier.

150
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:21,248
If I can hear them,
maybe they can hear me.

151
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,889
They've got to come back.

152
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,849
WINGS FLAP OVERHEAD
Jack!

153
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,450
Tosh!

154
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:38,252
What?

155
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:39,932
I thought I heard my name.

156
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:47,494
OK, so we use Tosh's information
to open the rift

157
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,455
and bring them back.

158
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:51,015
We can't.

159
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,615
Half the equation's missing.

160
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:56,416
It can't be. It must be somewhere
else. Let me try. It's not there.

161
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,817
It might be in her laptop. Which
she never goes anywhere without.

162
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,097
Shit. Shit!

163
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:07,499
No-one here. Come on, quick.

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,581
It works! LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is running low'.

165
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:20,341
Just take down everything,
in case it dies.

166
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:29,223
I'm not used to writing with these
things! Don't press so hard.

167
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,945
Oh, no. LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is low.' Can you read that?

168
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:38,266
Plus one over five a...

169
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:42,066
sine two eight X.
LAPTOP: 'Your battery...'

170
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,907
You got everything you need? I just
need the coordinates of the hall,

171
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,188
so I can integrate them
into the equation.

172
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:50,708
Then we need to get the information
back to the Hub.

173
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,469
What are you doing in here?

174
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,550
Who are you?

175
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,510
Captain...James Harper.

176
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,431
And this is Toshiko Sato,
friend and mathematician.

177
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,632
I'm Bilis, the manager.

178
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:12,913
You're not in full uniform, Captain.
On leave.

179
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,634
48 hours.

180
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,475
That's an interesting camera.

181
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:23,756
It takes photographs instantly. I
didn't know they could do that yet.

182
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:28,957
And I didn't know they made
an attache case out of metal.

183
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,758
CLOCK CHIMES

184
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:34,158
Where did you get it?

185
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,159
London. I'm from there.

186
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,400
I should go back, dear.
They're coming for us now.

187
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,683
I've had a good look around
but the doors were locked.

188
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,364
MUSIC RESUMES INSIDE

189
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,244
Can I help you?

190
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,245
I'm the caretaker.

191
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:06,325
Bilis Manger, at your service.

192
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:11,727
Hello. Could you open it all up
for me? I think some of my friends
got locked in. Follow me.

193
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,407
Thank you.

194
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,568
Pearl Harbour, Jack. Doesn't happen
till the end of the year.

195
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:22,129
Granddad stayed in London
but he was persecuted.

196
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,049
If I stay here,
what will happen?

197
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,930
I'll take care of you.

198
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:33,051
This period,
you look like you fit in.

199
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,732
Have you been here before?

200
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,653
Yeah.

201
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:42,054
I can't explain
but I served in the war in 1941.

202
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,094
I was undercover.

203
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:50,615
I needed a false identity,
so I took...his name.

204
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,016
Who were you
before you took his name?

205
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:59,417
Why him? It was convenient.

206
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:03,978
But if you chose his identity
to steal, then he...?

207
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,819
Dies, in battle.

208
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,179
When?

209
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Tomorrow.

210
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,421
And I say, "Look, love,
it's raining bombs and fire,
so get down that cellar."

211
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:20,622
And she says, "I can't,
there's rats down there!"

212
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:23,903
So, who's the best navigator here?

213
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:28,504
Tim. He can't fly for toffee,
but at least when he goes down,
he'll know exactly where he is.

214
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:32,825
Why don't we chat over here?

215
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,866
HE WOLF-WHISTLES

216
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:40,907
I give the public schoolboy
a fortnight.

217
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:43,467
That boy's come a long way
in five weeks.

218
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,108
As long as you boys remember
your training, you'll be all right.

219
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,509
Glad you came. Shall we sit down?

220
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:07,673
Why were your friends in here,
anyway? Just a silly dare.

221
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,313
Someone said it was haunted.

222
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:11,634
You look worried, dear.

223
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,875
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

224
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:24,917
The sun rose this morning at 08.12,

225
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,957
21 by 7 degrees.

226
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:30,238
I note it down every day.

227
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,998
It's a bit silly, I suppose.

228
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,679
It's fantastic.

229
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,560
You must have seen some action.

230
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,880
Let's just say the enemy comes
in many guises.

231
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,281
Yeah, I can't wait
to give Jerry what for.

232
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:47,362
How many did you kill in the Battle
of Britain, sir? 26, wasn't it?

233
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,722
You've read that story
countless times.

234
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:52,283
No-one's as fast as him.
Hasn't lost a man yet.

235
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:58,004
Care for a drink, Captain?
I'll just have water, thanks.

236
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,485
All right.

237
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:06,566
Hello, Jack. I know you're having
a night with the men

238
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,127
but I thought I'd look in,
if that's all right.

239
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,167
Yeah.

240
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,888
Good to see you.

241
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,651
Is anyone expecting you?

242
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,891
Yes.

243
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:32,492
Perhaps you should call them,
otherwise they may think
you've disappeared too.

244
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,013
I'll put the kettle on.

245
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:38,653
CLOCK CHIMES

246
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,374
Anything your end?

247
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:46,615
There are no more photographs
of Jack and Tosh after that night.

248
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,456
That's encouraging.
Yeah, unless the bombs got 'em.

249
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:53,377
The manager, Bilis Manger,

250
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,337
kept them for posterity.

251
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,458
Bilis Manger?

252
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,258
That's the name of the caretaker.

253
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:02,019
Can't be the same guy, can it?
Not old enough.

254
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,820
But he does look a bit
out of his time. He wears a cravat.

255
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,222
Gwen, he's in the photo
with Jack and Tosh.

256
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:20,863
He's the answer. He came through
the rift. Find out what he's doing.

257
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:25,424
No. Get out, Gwen. Wait for backup.
We can't lose him. Nor Gwen!
Maybe this is a trap.

258
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:29,145
He could be sucking us
back through time one by one.

259
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:32,866
Get out of there, Gwen. I'm sorry
but who put you in charge?

260
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:43,548
I've got what I need.
Now all I have to do

261
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:48,429
is find a way to leave a message
for the team on something
that will last across time. OK.

262
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,950
I haven't seen you two here before.

263
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,071
Is she with you?
Nah, she's after Tim.

264
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:58,632
Why else would she let him
bore her to death about navigation?

265
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:03,073
Maybe she's a spy. The Chinese are on
our side, aren't they? I'm Japanese.

266
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:06,273
You're hardly an ally, then.
Leave it, Audrey.

267
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:09,354
So whose side are you on?
What's in the bag? Nothing.

268
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,395
If you've got nothing to hide,
open the bag! She can't.

269
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:16,716
Her work is top secret.
She's a decoder for the Brits.

270
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:20,837
Without her, we'd have no way of
defending the country. To Toshiko.

271
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,917
Toshiko!

272
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:28,038
I need Bilis's camera.
Photographs last, don't they?

273
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:33,479
Sure you don't want me to come with
you? Oh, you can't run out on me.
I've just got you a drink.

274
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,040
I'm fine. You carry on.

275
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,121
To a fellow captain.

276
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:43,802
So, what brings you down here?
I had to rest up.

277
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:48,443
Injured my back bailing over Kent.
That's his excuse for not dancing.

278
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,843
Mind if I join you?

279
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,284
Sure. Why not?

280
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,086
Starting to be a habit.

281
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:07,047
I just wanted to try it out.

282
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:12,608
This little beauty is very unusual
and rare, not unlike yourself.

283
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,529
Don't go without this.

284
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,011
I could think of better things
to photograph than numbers, my dear.

285
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:29,652
Do call again.

286
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:40,535
What are you doing?

287
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,455
Owen!

288
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:47,016
We haven't got the missing numbers.
We'll improvise with
the Rift Manipulator. We can't.

289
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,177
It's risky enough with the equation.

290
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:52,817
If we don't do it properly, anything
can happen. Bombs are falling.

291
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,418
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz.

292
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,058
It's our duty to get 'em out.

293
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:10,501
JACK'S LAUGHTER ECHOES
Jack?

294
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:24,905
Open the rift and the world could
suffer. We could all get sucked in.

295
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,585
Who knows what will come out?

296
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:30,906
This is about Diane! When will you
accept she chose to leave you?

297
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:38,748
Whereas your cyber-girlfriend
stuck around. Not that she had
a choice, wired in the cellar.

298
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:42,869
That was different. Yeah. Mainly
because Diane didn't try and kill us

299
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:42,909
and she also happened
to be a human being. Stop it.

300
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,429
Not some monster. I thought
she was still Lisa. I loved her.

301
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:55,311
You only knew Diane for a week.
And it wasn't enough.

302
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:59,032
Maybe the Manipulator
can calculate the missing figures.

303
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,756
It isn't working. Good.

304
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,917
Jack would never have wanted us
to use it this way.

305
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,637
There's a piece missing.

306
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,558
We've got to find it.

307
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:31,280
Maybe you should go home.
You don't have any power over me.

308
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:40,802
OK, Ianto, we'll play it your way -
safe and boring.

309
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:45,643
BUG BAND TUNE FINISHES

310
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:48,804
PEOPLE APPLAUD

311
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:55,245
So, what's your next mission?
Careless talk costs lives.

312
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:58,486
I should go anyway. No, I didn't
mean that to... It's all right.

313
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,406
I can get a lift if I leave now.

314
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,167
I'd better stay here.

315
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:07,448
Aren't you leaving tomorrow night?

316
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,289
You sick of us Welsh already?

317
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,690
Yeah, that's why I'm still
fighting for you.

318
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,411
I'll be in touch
when I'm next on leave.

319
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,253
Nancy...

320
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:32,093
it's been a good few weeks.

321
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,976
Was that it?

322
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:52,258
She's a sweet kid, but I need
to look after my men tonight.
It's their last day tomorrow.

323
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:54,338
Go after her.

324
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,539
Kiss her goodbye.

325
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,099
Anything can happen tomorrow.

326
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:02,660
It's just a routine training
exercise. I'm hardly gonna die.

327
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,661
That's when they catch you,
when you least expect it.

328
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:08,302
You don't know what's ahead.

329
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:13,583
Kiss her...goodbye.

330
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:22,385
Nancy?

331
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,870
I love you.

332
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:05,114
That just made things
20 times worse.

333
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:08,475
Now she thinks
she's in love with me.

334
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:11,236
Hey, her falling for you
is hardly my fault.

335
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:14,837
Play it coo in front of your men,
but not me. It's OK to be scared.

336
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:17,157
A captain has to keep his head.

337
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:20,518
A captain needs to explain risks,
tell his men what to expect.

338
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:22,838
So what do I do?

339
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,999
Tell 'em I saw a young boy
get shot in the eyes mid-flight?

340
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,319
I understand.

341
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,280
Do you? Did you hear him on the
radio, yelling for his mom,

342
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,441
while the Messerschmitts shot him
blew his plane apart?

343
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,122
All I can hear on the radio...
Is screams.

344
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:40,922
I went to war when I was a boy.
I was with my best friend.

345
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:46,484
We got caught crossing the border
over enemy lines. They tortured him
because he was weaker.

346
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:52,285
They made me watch him die.
And they let me go.

347
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:53,605
Who were they?

348
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,846
The worst possible creatures
you can imagine.

349
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:00,047
I persuaded him to join up.

350
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:02,327
I said it would be an adventure.

351
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:04,368
He hadn't lived.

352
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:06,848
Have any of us?

353
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:42,736
OK, team...
I hope you like treasure hunts.

354
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:47,017
No sign of Bilis leaving the area.

355
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:54,859
Er, where are you off to?
The dancehall.

356
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,460
Bilis's office.

357
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,220
He must know how the rift works.
Maybe we'll find a clue there.

358
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:13,904
What would Jack and Tosh do?
How would they try and help us?

359
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,225
Bilis!

360
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,750
I need more equations, Gwen.

361
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:47,871
What happened here, Tosh?

362
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,312
No.

363
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:04,915
AIR RAID SIREN WAILS

364
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,799
BOMB WHISTLES THROUGH AIR

365
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,439
THEY SCREAM

366
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,640
Toshiko!

367
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,081
Toshiko! Jack!

368
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,642
This way!

369
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:38,003
I didn't get the first part
in the photo. The rest is outside.

370
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:41,283
If they find it, they'll
keep looking, won't they? Yeah.

371
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:46,404
IANTO: 'Be careful, Gwen.
Bilis is still around'.

372
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:48,045
Owen, where are you? 'I'm in the
building. Where's Bilis's office?'

373
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:53,446
It's at the far end of the corridor.
I'll keep looking out here.

374
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,814
Yes!

375
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:33,735
BOMBS BOOM OVERHEAD

376
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:41,017
Thing is, you could be
the last girl I ever kiss.

377
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,219
I've got to finish the message.

378
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,140
Pencil will fade.
I need to find something else.

379
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,945
Airtight. This'll do.

380
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:54,513
# There'll be bluebirds over

381
00:29:54,513 --> 00:30:00,635
# The white cliffs of Dover

382
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:04,516
# Tomorrow

383
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:08,637
# Just you wait and see... #

384
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:14,038
OK.

385
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,201
Shit!

386
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:30,482
CLOCK CHIMES

387
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:36,523
ALARM CLOCK BEEPS

388
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:39,964
Timepieces.

389
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,890
I didn't find any equations.
Um, I'll get back to the Hub.

390
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,531
I'll keep looking here, then.
Yeah, you do that.

391
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:23,253
Yes.

392
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,935
Of course I'm scared.

393
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:53,100
I'm going to check everywhere
for the other figures.
I'm not going to leave Jack now.

394
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:59,742
# There'll be bluebirds over... #

395
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:03,022
SONG FADES

396
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:17,946
ALL-CLEAR SIGNAL WAILS

397
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:21,427
Let the dancing continue!

398
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:24,747
ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD

399
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:31,909
I've finished.
The rest of the equation is hidden.

400
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,709
What happened?

401
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,150
I slipped. I've got a first-aid kit
in the van.

402
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,991
Scotch, Captain?

403
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:45,552
I'd like some time in private
with Captain Harper.

404
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:38,204
Ianto? Yeah, it's me.
I've found it.

405
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:41,685
It's written in blood.

406
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:48,406
Gwen's found the rest
of Tosh's readings.

407
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,407
What's she got for us?

408
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:56,248
Cos sine squared, axcx = x over 2.

409
00:33:56,248 --> 00:34:01,889
No, I need at
least three more numbers, Gwen.
They must be somewhere else.

410
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,850
'No, they're not'.
Well, how do you know?

411
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,411
Somebody scraped out
the final numbers.

412
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:14,852
Tosh has written
a message at the end.

413
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,053
It says,
"Tell my family I love them."

414
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,856
Why did you make me
kiss her goodbye?

415
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:37,857
I just think you should live
every night like it's your last.

416
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:40,898
Make tonight
the best night of your life.

417
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:45,819
You're alive -
right here, right now.

418
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,300
Your men are fine.

419
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,141
What are you trying to say?

420
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,183
Go to her.

421
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:07,264
Go to your woman
and lose yourself in her.

422
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,825
Maybe I should.

423
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,666
Yeah.

424
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:18,147
Is Toshiko your woman? No.

425
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,628
There's no-one.

426
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:28,709
Go to her.

427
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:45,873
It still won't work. There's a piece
missing. Bilis had it all along.

428
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:48,273
We still don't have
all the equation.

429
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,434
Maybe the machine can work it out.

430
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,834
MACHINE BURSTS INTO LIFE
Owen!

431
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,515
MACHINE ENGINE SPLUTTERS OUT

432
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:08,958
There must be something in the safe.
We need better instructions.
You can't open it. You've no right.

433
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,039
I'm second in command.
I have got every fucking right.

434
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,600
There's stuff we don't know about.
That's how Jack likes it.
I won't play with his toys, Ianto!

435
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:26,882
"Rhea Silva,
the god of war's missus."

436
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:30,003
And a nine-digit number.
Not so clever, Jack.

437
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:12,252
Blueprints for the Rift machine.

438
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,535
I thought you'd gone.

439
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:29,816
This could be your last chance.

440
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:32,817
That's why I came back.

441
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:41,259
I might have to leave
before the night is over.

442
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:46,060
Well, then make the most of now.

443
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,583
WOMAN LAUGHS

444
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:01,463
We need lovers' corner,
if you don't mind, boys.

445
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:05,744
Of course. I was just discussing
strategies with the captain.

446
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,745
We'll go somewhere else.

447
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,425
No.

448
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,666
You've told me all I need to know.

449
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,668
There's instructions in here.
This isn't a random act of madness.

450
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:26,189
It's a trap!
Bilis wanted you to find it. Why?

451
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:29,910
To provoke the rift. To incite
total chaos and destruction.

452
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,031
All the reports of the haunted
dancehall were anonymous.

453
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,151
What if it was him?

454
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:39,072
Please, listen to me! I'm tired
of being in awe of the rift.

455
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:45,313
I'm tired of living with Jack's
secrets. We don't even know who he
is. He's our leader. Not any more.

456
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:48,154
Get out of my way.

457
00:38:51,355 --> 00:38:52,995
Ianto! Ugh!

458
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,920
Tomorrow is their last
training exercise,

459
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,840
just another day.

460
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,481
They go out on a sortie

461
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,521
and are surprised
by two formations of Messerschmitts.

462
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:24,042
He destroys three of the enemy.

463
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:28,403
His men listen to his whoops of joy
over the radio.

464
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:32,444
Then it all goes quiet.

465
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,446
He can't bail out
because his whole plane is on fire.

466
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:44,127
But his men
all make it back to safety.

467
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,090
Put the key down.

468
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:04,971
Or I'll shoot.

469
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:06,412
Who were you?

470
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,413
A conman.

471
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:12,293
That's why I took his name,

472
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:16,174
falsified his records
so it seemed he was still alive.

473
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:18,895
How did you end up in Torchwood?

474
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:23,576
Someone saved my life.

475
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,176
Brought me back from death.

476
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:30,697
And ever since then, it's been like
they're keeping me for something
and I don't know what it is.

477
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,739
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.

478
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,419
It was my choice.

479
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:42,060
I'll look after you.

480
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,822
But there's nothing I can do
for him.

481
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:05,105
You have to let Diane go.
Like I did with Lisa.

482
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:07,386
Don't compare yourself to me.

483
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:11,426
You're just a tea boy.
I'm much more than that.

484
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:13,947
Jack needs me.

485
00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:16,628
In your dreams, Ianto.

486
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:21,589
In your sad wet dreams when
you're his part-time shag, maybe.

487
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:27,150
That rift took my lover
and my captain.

488
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:34,592
So if I die trying to beat it, then
it will all be in the line of duty.

489
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:44,634
Aaargh!

490
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,796
MACHINE STARTS UP

491
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,838
You don't know what you've done.

492
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,679
# That certain night

493
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,880
# The night we met

494
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,402
# There was magic abroad in the air

495
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:26,043
# There were angels dancing
at the Ritz

496
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:36,286
# And a nightingale sang
in Berkeley Square... #

497
00:42:39,446 --> 00:42:42,007
# ..I may be right

498
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:45,688
# I may be wrong... #

499
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,208
What's he doing?

500
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:52,649
# ..But I'm perfectly willing
to swear... #

501
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,540
RIFT BLASTS OPEN
Jack!

502
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:45,181
Jack, we need to get out!

503
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:51,223
Jack, you have to!

504
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:53,583
We need you!

505
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,223
I have to go.

506
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:00,785
It's my duty.

507
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:26,924
Oh, you made it! You made it!

508
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,045
You made it.

509
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:35,206
Oh, Tosh, come here, come here,
come here! I'm fine!

510
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:37,807
GWEN LAUGHS

511
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,849
I knew we did the right thing,

512
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:51,610
opening the rift.

513
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,690
Still no sign of Bilis.

514
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,811
World didn't end after all, did it?

515
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:03,412
Good job you're a crap shot.
I was aiming for your shoulder.

516
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:10,254
It was wartime, I know,
but it was beautiful.

517
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:12,535
There were angels dancing
at the Ritz.

518
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:17,616
- Jack...
- Let me.

519
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,979
He would have been so proud
that you took his name.

520
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:38,100
Because here you are,
saving the world.

521
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:41,981
To Captain Jack.

522
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:47,022
To Captain Jack.
