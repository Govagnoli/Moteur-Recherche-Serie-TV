00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,300
Torchwood 

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,100
outside the government, beyond the police

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,261
fighting for the future on behalf of the human race.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,300
The 21st century is when everything changes...

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
and Torchwood is ready.

6
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:29,100
* So who can you trust to transport your goods? *

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,700
* Harwood's! *

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,800
* You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry! *

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,444
Good morning. Today sees an improvement on the weather we've been having recently. 

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,900
Yeah, Ruth. Did you hear it?

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,200
I wrote the last bit.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,700
What sort of accident?

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,400
Yeah, I know it.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,100
Yeah, I'll get over there now.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,600
Stay back, please.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,700
You'll have to move your car.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm Rhys Williams, manager of Harwood's Haulage.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,514
You can check on the vehicle later.

19
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,800
Bollocks! I know the driver.
Is he...?

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
Didn't make it. Sorry.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Can you give me some details, sir?

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
It's Leighton.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
Er. . . Leighton Reynolds.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,500
- Next of kin?
- Yeah, he's got a wife.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
Jen.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,379
Just had a baby, man.

27
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:40,200
- Do you know the address?
- Yeah. 

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,530
54 Keppoch Street, Roath.

29
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,000
I give him a lift to football.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, sir.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,300
Er, right. I'm gonna need to
arrange to move the lorry.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,800
Not yet. There's something suspicious in the back.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
It's just meat.

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Leighton was taking it to the abattoir.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, well, Torchwood want to look at it first.

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Argh, it stinks!

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,500
No bones. just dense flesh.

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,100
It's not like any flesh I've ever seen.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
What is it?

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,500
Well, as there haven't been any giant cow sightings,

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,528
I suggest we take a sample back to the Hub.

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,671
We need to confiscate the contents of the van 

46
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,700
till we've done further investigations.

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,800
Do you know where it came from?

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
No, but it's a Harwood's lorry so they should...

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh, that's Rhys's firm.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,900
- Right, done.
- Let's go.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Sorry, sir, you can't come this way now.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,360
There's evidence of a vertebral column


53
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,456
but its genetic make-up isn't compatible with any known animal.

54
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,500
- Any idea what it is?
- I have to scan it.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,700
But whoever's farming this meat knows it's dodgy. See this?

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,678
Official vet stamp fit for human consumption'. It's fake.

57
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:00,900
It's good, but it's fake.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Tosh, get onto the haulage firm.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,416
Find out where the meat is from
and where it's heading.

60
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:05,869
Why did it have to be Rhys's firm?

61
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,200
It's too close to home.

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Want to stand down?

63
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,500
No, to find out what's going on.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,297
Thank you, Ianto.

65
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,700
* Harwood's! *

66
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,043
* You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry! *

67
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,800
Catchy.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Do you think the haulage firm are in on it? 

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,300
Rhys? No.

70
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
He just hires the vans out.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,500
- Driver must have seen it loaded.
- That doesn't implicate Rhys.

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
He's the most honest man I know.

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,837
Have you got his direct line?

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,200
Harwood's Haulage. How may I help you?

75
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,100
It's the police.

76
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,900
Hello?

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,200
Yeah, speaking.

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Yes, I'm aware ofthe accident.

79
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,300
'It's a firm is called Harries and Harries.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,700
They came to us two months back. It's a weekly contract.'

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
- 'Are they licensed?'
- 0f course they're licensed!

82
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Could you give me their address?

83
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,800
There's no address here.
There's a pick-up point.

84
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
They said it was hard to find.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,900
'Hello, sorry. All I've got is a service station on the Al?70,'

86
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,400
15 miles from Cardiff.

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,217
Do you have a contact number?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,300
No, there's no contact number, either.

89
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,510
Can you tell me where your driver took the meat?

90
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:29,100
Yes,he was taking it to Caerwen Abattoir.

91
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,300
'It's a processing plant.'just general meat suppliers.

92
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,500
What time did the driver leave base?

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
'Signed out at ten to one.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Can I ask what this is about?'

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,100
I can't release that information, sir.
'Thanks for your cooperation'

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, but I'm the manager...

97
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:47,500
Brilliant!

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Leighton was their regular.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
Apart from that first booking, they just went through him.

100
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,100
Yes, but now it looks like I'm hiding something.

101
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,700
Got him!

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
There he is, coming back 40 minutes later.

103
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,700
Let's say it takes 20 minutes to load...

104
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
We are talking a ten-mile radius.

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,724
- Jack!
- Yeah?

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
The scan shows it's definitely alien meat.

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Where would they get it from?

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,635
If it's going into the processing plant

109
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:20,300
that means it'll be going into pies, burgers, pasties - everything.

110
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,898
That means people have been eating it for months.

111
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,900
Well, the DNA traces are stable.

112
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,500
There are signs of animal sedative but no diseases or residues.

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,100
My guess is it's good to eat.

114
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,000
Would YOU eat it?

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,300
Pizza's arrived.

116
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,600
I presumed it would be a late one.

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,100
- What did you get me?
- Usual. Meat Feast.

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,596
Lovely

119
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,900
I've narrowed it down to three potential areas.

120
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,100
Only one warehouse is unoccupied, just outside Merthyr.

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Makes sense.Who knows what goes on there?

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,800
We have to shut the operation down,

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,500
neutralise whoever's doing this and identify the alien meat.

124
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Tosh, you co-ordinate.

125
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
I have to slip home and check on Rhys.

126
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,400
Good idea. Find out how much he knows.

127
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
That's not what I meant.

128
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,501
Hiya

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
I got your message.Are you all right?

130
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,600
Er. ..bit of a tough day.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Had an accident at work.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,024
One of our lorries crashed.

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,100
- Anyone hurt?
- Leighton.

134
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,400
One of my drivers died.

135
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Oh, no!

136
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,300
Only 24.

137
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,900
Were you close?

138
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,700
For God's sake, Gwen, you met him!

139
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,968
Small, dark hair,played five-a-side with me.

140
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Sorry. I can't place him.

141
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,873
Well, then I hear that the, er...

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,500
that the police have taken the meat out the back of the van.

143
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,700
You any idea why?

144
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,881
How would I know?

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,905
You work for them.

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,333
I don't deal in traffic accidents, so. ..

147
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,150
Well, they phoned the office and...

148
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,000
they asked loads of questions.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
Thing is, all I do is hire out the lorries, so I. ..

150
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,246
Then there's nothing for you to worry about, is there?

151
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,600
Must be something dodgy going on,though.

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,100
If there was, you weren't to know, were you?

153
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,277
- No, of course not.
- No.

154
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,900
I wish I didn't have to go back to work now.

155
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Hardly worth you coming home.

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,999
Yes, it was.

157
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,118
To see you.

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,784
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll see you later.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,483
Go and have a pint. Call Daf.

161
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah.

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
Yeah, maybe I will.

163
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,400
Like I thought.

164
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,000
He has no idea what's going on.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,482
Would you care to accompany me to the slaughterhouse?

166
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
Have you ever eaten alien meat?

167
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
Yeah.

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
What was it like?

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,276
He seemed to enjoy it.

170
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
'Ianto,Owen, we're on our way.

171
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
'How are things looking at the slaughterhouse?
Are you in position?'

172
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,617
'It's all quiet.There's a deserted access road.
We won't get noticed.

173
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll direct you in.'

174
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,100
Ianto, nearly there.

175
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
Take the second turning.

176
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,800
Park on the left. No-one will see the car there.

177
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
There's a main entrance at the front.

178
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,775
It's the only one open.
The rest are padlocked and alarmed.

179
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,400
How many are in there?

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,600
It's difficult to tell, there are no windows.

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,529
I have blueprints of the warehouse.

182
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,909
The stock has to be in the central area. 

183
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,700
Having fun?

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,800
You don't know what you're missing.

185
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,400
According to the sensor, there's a heat signature across the entire building.

186
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,227
That's a lot of meat.

187
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Answer the phone, Gwen!

188
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
'You two take the sides,
Gwen and I will go in the front.'

189
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,300
We don't want any casualties.

190
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,100
We stun-gun whoever's in there
and put a stop to what they're doing.

191
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,400
Let's go.

192
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:41,600
There's someone there.

193
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
It's Rhys.

194
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,300
It's Rh... What's he doing?

195
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,800
Did you bring the alarm de-activator?

196
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,917
Well, that's one way of doing it.

197
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,472
He must be in on it.

198
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:05,020
Don't bother running, mate.

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
Never. No.

200
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,700
Greg? We've got a bit of a problem, bruv.

201
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,067
How else do you explain that?

202
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,600
Ianto, Owen...

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,575
'Stand down. Repeat, stand down.'

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,837
He told me he didn't know what was going on.

205
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,300
He wouldn't lie to me.

206
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
He also said he didn't know where they were based.

207
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,500
But he did.

208
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
There's something wrong.
There has to be.  

209
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,630
Gwen! No. No!

210
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,500
No!

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,654
Come with me.

212
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,600
- I just have to get him out.
- By charging in there? 

213
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,000
What then?

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,805
You gonna knock them out?

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,700
Look, lads...

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,162
I don't mean any harm, honestly.

217
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,384
You can't just go in there.

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,170
You have to do as I say.

219
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,500
We wait until he comes out.

220
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,749
Boys, you should've waited for the ketamine injection
before doing that.

221
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,700
What about the hoses?

222
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,820
That's lidocaine. It's not strong enough.

223
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,200
If you care so much, go and work for the RSPCA.

224
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,399
Or don't they pay as good? Oi, you.Through here.

225
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Shift!

226
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,002
I want you and one of those with me, now!

227
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,169
- Who sent you?
- Come on. Don't waste our time.

228
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:43,800
No-one sent me.

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,050
I came on my own.

230
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,700
- I'm looking for the boss.
- You're looking at him.

231
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,558
Ignore my little brother.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm, er...

233
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,058
I'm from Harwood's.

234
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,581
Harwood's Haulage.

235
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,280
Leighton... Er, Leighton, your driver. ..um. ..

236
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,422
He sort of told me what was going on, like.

237
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,018
Mouthy git!
He was paid to keep quiet. Ssh!

238
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,637
Yeah, well, he's dead.

239
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,500
- Lorry crashed.
- With the goods inside?

240
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,970
What happened to the meat?Did anyone see the meat?

241
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,700
No, no, no.

242
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,200
I. . .er. ..I picked it all up and   

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,621
took it all to be incinerated.

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,700
You see, um...

245
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,000
I was hoping maybe I could

246
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,462
pick up from where he left off, boys.

247
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,600
How do we know you won't report us?

248
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,962
I'm here, aren't I?

249
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,390
So what exactly did he tell you?

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,400
Everything.

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,800
You know, that you were...

252
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,700
cleaning up old meat.

253
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,900
0h, it's a lot bigger than that.

254
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:15,485
What's that noise?

255
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,600
What is it, boys?

256
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,334
No idea.

257
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:57,318
But the beauty of it is,

258
00:15:57,365 --> 00:16:00,000
it just keeps growing.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
No matter how much we cut it.

260
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,476
He'll get used to it.

261
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,900
I don't get it.

262
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,400
Come on.

263
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,300
Let's go.

264
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,500
- What were you doing at that warehouse?  
- You lied to me!

265
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,600
You were at the crash.

266
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
What are you talking about?
Stop pissing me around,Gwen!

267
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,188
You're so used to lying and fobbing me off 

268
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,600
like the idiot I obviously am!

269
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,904
Those blokes paying you?Why you were there?

270
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:10,618
No. I'm asking the questions, all right!

271
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,451
I followed you, OK?

272
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So that bloke, the tall bloke in the coat.

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,100
You fucking him or what?

275
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,721
All I ever asked was you trust me.

276
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,400
What?Like you trust me?

277
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
It's a two-way street, Gwen!

278
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
There's stuff you don't understand,Rhyes.

279
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,300
Oh, I'm just a big, dumb animal,aren't I?

280
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I mean, what's so secret you can't even tell your own fiance? ???

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,800
Why ARE you marrying me, Gweny?

282
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
What am I, a habit you can't be arsed to break?No.

283
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,700
- Then tell the truth!
- No. All right!

284
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
All right. My job...

285
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,419
the special ops thing...

286
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:41,900
it's a lie - a cover story.

287
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Thank you! At last!

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,355
God, what's that taken?About a year? 

289
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:47,700
That's one lie down.How many more?

290
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,689
Is there anything in your life based on truth?

291
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,300
- Us.
- Us?!

292
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Us?

293
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,577
Us is crumbling, Gwen!
Us is falling to shit!

294
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,800
You think I enjoy keeping this stuff to myself?

295
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,900
Then why did you?

296
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,400
Because I'm trying to protect you!

297
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,101
Have you ever stopped to think about that?No!

298
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,300
No. Because you prefer to blunder in without thinking or looking.

299
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,180
Good old ham-fisted Rhys. His heart is in the right place but  

300
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,966
but his brain is a million miles fucking back.

301
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:16,300
Come on, let's have it all.
What exactly do I need protecting from?

302
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,200
I catch aliens.

303
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,045
- Piss off!
- You piss off...

304
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,200
If you won't take it seriously...

305
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
This is why I couldn't tell you.

306
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,900
I hunt aliens and I scavenge the stuff they leave behind.

307
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,688
- Sometimes I don't believe it.
- jesus Christ!

308
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:32,021
What's getting into you?
Have you been brainwashed?

309
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,300
Is that what's happened? Cos you are talking high-grade shit here.

310
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,529
Every word is the truth.

311
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Rhys...

312
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,862
The things I have seen...

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
The times I have wanted to tell you. ..

314
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,100
Aliens.

315
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,800
In Cardiff.

316
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,140
Have you never seen something so mad, so. . extraordinary. ..

317
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,800
..that, just for one second, you think there might be more out there?

318
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:25,100
Prove it.

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, this is unprecedented -

320
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
the fiance finding out.

321
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,726
Mainly because we're all sad and single. 

322
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,200
Speak for yourself.

323
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,100
I am better off without all that kind of hassle.

324
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,600
Maybe the answer is to go out with someone who knows what you do.

325
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Look around you, Tosh.

326
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,996
Only we know what we do.

327
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,200
I saw you here earlier.

328
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
With him -  

329
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,400
that bloke.

330
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,900
He appeared out of nowhere.

331
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,700
It's an invisible lift.

332
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,956
Oh, it's too complicated to explain.

333
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:11,504
Come on. Trust me.

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,107
- Ready?
- Yeah.

335
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,329
Who'd have thought this was here?

336
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:39,091
- That looked so real.
- It was real.

337
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,789
- They're extinct, Gwen.
- No, boy.

338
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:44,289
In your time line,yes.

339
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,122
Captain Jack Harkness.

340
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,000
Thanks for dropping in, Rhys.

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
This is the rest of the team.

342
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Owen and Toshiko. Ianto.

343
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
Pleased to meet you.

344
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,940
Welcome to our headquarters.

345
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,273
It's a bit bigger than mine.

346
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
So, Gwen tells me you catch aliens.

347
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,500
That's right.

348
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,708
A rift through space and time runs through Cardiff

349
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,542
 and stuff slips in from other time lines and planets.

350
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:14,400
It's our job to monitor it.

351
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,300
Are you sure they're not some kind of weird cult?

352
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,900
You saw that alien in the warehouse.  

353
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,500
Come on.

354
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,050
What did you see? 

355
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,100
It was this huge, shapeless beast, filling the space.

356
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,200
Like a mound of flesh.

357
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,500
So it's one entity as opposed to several organisms.

358
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,693
The tests reveal high levels of chloride, so it probably lives in the water.

359
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,900
I reckon it came through the rift,into the sea and beached itself.

360
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,400
Like a giant alien manatee.

361
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,900
But how did they get it there?

362
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,034
That warehouse must be 50 metres long.

363
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,600
Maybe it was smaller when they found it. They said it's growing.

364
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,100
It's not dead?

365
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,000
No. It's breathing. Its eye opened.

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,994
So the protein chains regenerate despite the mutilation.

367
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,231
Not only is it replenishing its own flesh 

368
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,000
but it's increasing it, giving them a brand-new meat supply.

369
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
It will last for years.

370
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
If we knew how it worked, we could feed the world.

371
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
We could release a single.

372
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,478
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
we're talking about dodgy pies in Merthyr, OK?

373
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,600
And the fact that they're cutting it up alive,

374
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,026
which we could have put a stop to if it wasn't for you.

375
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,264
I thought my fiancee was in danger.

376
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:14,700
Well, Mr Caveman, she wasn't.

377
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,669
- She can handle herself.
- Jack...

378
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:19,000
All you did was mess things up.

379
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,129
Now we have to think of a way to get back in and, 

380
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:23,367
thanks to you, they'll have tightened security.

381
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:26,541
Well, what if you stopped and asked me what I saw in there, 

382
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,160
instead of showing off around the place...

383
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,300
- Do I show off?
- Just a bit.

384
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,000
..you'd know I got out by saying I wanted a job as a deliveryboy.

385
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,994
So rather than cock things up, I've found you a way to get in.

386
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,500
But if you can't handle that, big boy, then you can stuff it!

387
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,400
- This is quite homo-erotic.
- No, no, no. jack, he is not getting us in.

388
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,144
Team meeting. You,too.

389
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,858
Jack

390
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
That's where the thing is.

391
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
That's the sedatives room.

392
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,247
That's where they pack the meat.

393
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:58,676
- That's good to know.
- Yeah, that is good to know.

394
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
but he's not driving us in.

395
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
They're expecting me.

396
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,300
You lot can hide in the back of the van.

397
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,889
What is this? Scooby-Doo?!

398
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,009
Absolutely no way is he getting involved.

399
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,866
When it was you to decided to get involved,
did you give me a thought?

400
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:09,819
0h, joy A domestic. 

401
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,500
Rhys is right. He is our best way in. Stun guns only.

402
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,422
We've handled bigger than this.Why don't we
storm in, guns in the air, and arrest them?

403
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,000
Those men aren't organised criminals.

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,279
If we go in, guns blazing, they'll kill the evidence and run.

405
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:22,255
I wasn't suggesting blazing,just waving.

406
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,279
The last thing we need is a bloodbath. 

407
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:25,300
- Point taken.
- I know that. ..

408
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,700
Once Rhys has loaded up, he can clear.

409
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,200
You don't have to come. You can stand down.

410
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,382
It might be better. You love him.

411
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,400
Makes you vulnerable.

412
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,300
He's not going in there without me.

413
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,699
- That's your decision.
- Yes, it is.

414
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:46,389
You both have to live by it.

415
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,461
Come on. You and me - a team!

416
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,580
Damn it, Rhys!

417
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,500
This is for real. Do you understand?

418
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,600
This is for real!

419
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,873
And if you mess up, I will kill you!

420
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,500
So...after we've stun-gunned the workers,
we put the creature out of its misery.

421
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,000
No. We're gonna save it.

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,300
Stabilise it, wait for the rift to open and. . .

423
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,333
send it back.

424
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,881
Guess who'll have to look after it in the meantime.

425
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,800
Tell me how are we going to use it to arm ourselves against the future?

426
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,793
 Hide behind it.

427
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,200
Why shouldn't we save it?

428
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,400
Because it's an alien?

429
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,700
It needs our protection.

430
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,674
You didn't hear its cry. Heart-breaking.

431
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:30,400
Listen to Ahab.

432
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,100
- Jack, it's growing.
- Well, we'll find a way to stop it mutating.

433
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,000
We are doing this. That's an order!

434
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
- Fine.
- I'll stock up on plankton.

435
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,900
So you do have a heart.

436
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,500
We see enough death.

437
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,400
What's that?

438
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,300
0h, it's just an idea of what it looks like.

439
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
I had it made up from the genetic make-up.

440
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,031
It looks lovely.

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,293
You're just a big softie, really, aren't you?

442
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,900
I'd better get on with that report.

443
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,300
I brought you some sandwiches.

444
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,277
- Thanks, Tosh.
- It's OK, just cheese and pickle.

445
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,200
I can keep you company.I'm not tired.

446
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,200
In that case, maybe you can do it.I'm knackered.

447
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,784
That's another big lump out of its habitat.

448
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,244
Makes you realise, maybe it is possible to do this job and have a relationship.

449
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,530
Do you fancy a game of pool sometime?

450
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:54,500
We're always in here, slaving away.

451
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,847
It might be nice to, I don't know, kick back and have some fun.

452
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:59,500
Yeah, why not?

453
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,600
- When?  
- I'll check with the others.

454
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,000
We could have a Torchwood tournament.

455
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,538
Thanks for the sandwiches,Tosh.

456
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,500
I thought you were anti-terrorism.

457
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,000
That was bad enough, but knowing you're in this much danger...

458
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,784
Yeah, you'd feel like I do now.

459
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,900
Worried sick.

460
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,006
You don't have to do this to prove anything to me.

461
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,800
I'm not leaving you with all these sexy young men.

462
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,625
There's only one from where I'm sitting.

463
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.

464
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,800
Cos once they ring, there's no turning back.

465
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:55,378
Moring.

466
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,600
- You just missed the advert.
- Yeah?

467
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,200
just popped in for my jacket and to sign for a van.

468
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,100
Here's your tea. And I got you a Danish, your favourite.

469
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm in the wrong job.

470
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,900
We have got job vacancies.

471
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,886
Maybe you could fit me in.

472
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,000
I'd be delighted to.

473
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,500
Would I need a licence for trucking?

474
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,100
Yes. Takes four weeks, and then you can go long distance.

475
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,700
That wouldn't be a problem.

476
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,370
It's them.

477
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,300
OK. Yeah, hello?

478
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,369
Why her? 0f all the women you could have chosen... 

479
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,600
She chose us.

480
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,068
- Kinda stumbled upon us.
- So did I.

481
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:36,700
Doubt you'll be asking me to join.

482
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,400
We needed someone with police skills.

483
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Could have chosen anyone.

484
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,900
Did you ever think about us?

485
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,800
You know, me, her parents, people who love her, who want her safe?

486
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,266
No, I'm sorry.We needed her.

487
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,646
0n her first day of work,

488
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:56,900
 she told me off for being too clinical.

489
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,300
She doesn't hold back, mind.

490
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,100
- Stubborn as hell.
- Tell me about it.

491
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,400
Yeah, she's an amazing girl.

492
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm a lucky man, Jack.

493
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,100
Yeah, you said it.

494
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,655
I just wish you were a bit uglier.

495
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:12,107
Not gay, by any chance, are you?

496
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,300
Brought you a Danish, your favourite.

497
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,234
I know what you're like on an empty stomach.

498
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,447
Cheers.

499
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:33,242
- Get out as soon as you can, remember?
- Yes, yes, yes.

500
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:41,194
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

501
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:45,900
Now, stop fussing, and get in the back of the van.

502
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,177
I'll prepare a ketamine antidote so we can start weaning it off.

503
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,800
Gwen, Tosh and I will take the main area.

504
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,100
Owen,Ianto, cover the corridors and the small rooms. You OK?

505
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,600
- What do you think?
- He'll be fine.

506
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,630
He's a good bloke.

507
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:32,249
Let's go.

508
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,898
Yeah.I just need your boss to sign this, mate.

509
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,423
 I don't want any questions asked.

510
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:52,000
You couldn't get us a cup of tea, could you?

511
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,100
Yes.

512
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:15,600
Where do you want my autograph?

513
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,137
Er...just on there, mate.

514
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:24,708
Here's a oner for your trouble.

515
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,700
Count it,if you like.

516
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,018
No, it's fine, mate. I trust you.

517
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:31,400
When you get to the abattoir, ask for Graham.

518
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,334
Him and the boys clean it up and process it.

519
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:34,621
 All right.

520
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,930
Oh, my God!

521
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:14,168
It's amazing!

522
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,100
How did it get here?

523
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:32,500
Imprisoned, chained and drugged.

524
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,833
Welcome to planet Earth.

525
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,100
It heard you.

526
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,738
It's sentient.

527
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,228
Oh, that's disgusting.

528
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,690
What have they done to you?

529
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,292
What have they done to you, my poor friend?

530
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,919
Everyone...they're armed.

531
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,600
Rhys.

532
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,800
Gwen.  

533
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,847
Stay here.

534
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,712
Where have you been? That injection was due ten minutes ago.

535
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,100
I needed more ketamine. I've had to up the dose.

536
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
The thing's in agony.

537
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,800
It's meat. It can't feel anything.

538
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
You going soft, or what?

539
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,401
Get inside and play nurse, if you're so bothered. 

540
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:51,700
We've got work to do.

541
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

542
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,339
There's only 12 bags in here.

543
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,500
He's supposed to have three more.

544
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,648
Come on, hurry up!

545
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:15,727
Hello. I have a...thingy here somewhere...Hell of a day.

546
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,989
I should be getting off, mate.

547
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,200
I've got jobs backing up, you see?

548
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,259
Well, they'll have to wait.

549
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:29,500
Dale,we've got a problem.There are people in the building.

550
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,267
You want to answer me?!

551
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,124
- Ianto, did Rhys get away?
- I'll check now.

552
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:48,012
Hey, hey, hey! 

553
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:52,203
You looking for someone? How many more of you?!

554
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
Just us.

555
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,100
You thought the two of you could take us out?

556
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,068
Nah, you're not that stupid.

557
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:04,200
Dave, get some ropes, tie their hands.

558
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,500
I want every door locked, inside and out.

559
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,996
Nobody leaves the building till this is sorted.

560
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,695
- Move it!
- They've got Rhys and Ianto.

561
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,909
Gwen!

562
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,647
Gwen. Listen. Hey! It will be OK.

563
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:24,218
- Locked.
- They must know we're here.

564
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,861
This way.

565
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,226
What is it?

566
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,800
The lads call it the Cash Cow.

567
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Dale, what are you doing?

568
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,200
They couldn't bear to see us making money.

569
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,100
Fancied some for yourselves, eh?

570
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,400
Thought we'd be a pushover?

571
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,300
Mate, you're so out of your depth.

572
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,700
Funny, I was just thinking the same about you.

573
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,200
Dale, don't be an idiot!

574
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,313
Show yourselves or I shoot the delivery boy!

575
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,194
OK!

576
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:02,500
There's no need to make any threats.

577
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,051
Just the two of you, is it?

578
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,000
Gun down.Kick it over.  

579
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,297
- I don't have a gun.
- He had one, so you must have!

580
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,725
OK!OK.

581
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,600
Any more of you?

582
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,800
And before you answer, have a proper think,

583
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,352
cos if you lie, I will shoot you.

584
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,598
It's just me.

585
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:39,146
Get against the drum.

586
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,600
We can help you, Dale.

587
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, help yourselves, more like.

588
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Stand next to her. You, too!

589
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,400
Dale! Two more. Far corner.

590
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,582
They can't get out. It's locked.

591
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,487
Kick out your weapons, stand where I can see you!

592
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:58,296
Drop your weapons.

593
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
Do you know what you've got here, Dale?

594
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:04,600
- Shut up now!
- It's an alien.

595
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
A creature from another galaxy.

596
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,400
It came through a rift in time and space,  

597
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,600
and it was unlucky enough to find you.

598
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,042
No. No way.

599
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,500
Did you really think it originated on this planet?

600
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,200
Have you ever seen anything like it before?

601
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,100
It can't be. Can it?

602
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,812
Look at it.

603
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,669
Look at it.

604
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:35,500
- It's just meat, that's all.
- You're carving up a sentient creature,

605
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,500
- and you've got to stop!
- And then what have I got?

606
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,100
I'm making money here! This is my business.

607
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,300
For the first time in my life, I've actually got something for myself!

608
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,279
Dale, stop. You can still walk away from this.

609
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,200
No.

610
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,900
You lied to me.

611
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,311
No!

612
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,168
No!

613
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:34,977
Die!

614
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:37,144
Shit!

615
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,000
Ianto! Go! After them!

616
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,700
Owen! Rhys has been shot!

617
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,001
The creature's coming loose.
We need that sedative now!

618
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,501
Open your eyes. Come on.You can do this.
Open your eyes now.OK?

619
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:52,263
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

620
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,300
Owen, we need you!

621
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,413
The creature's breaking free. If we try and get past, we'll be crushed.

622
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,008
Come on.

623
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,223
It wasn't me!

624
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,700
I never wanted to be a part of this!

625
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,500
Sedatives won't work now.

626
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,200
If it's got loose, you're never gonna stop it!

627
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,897
We've gotta help them.

628
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:14,802
It's out of control.

629
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,778
Change of plan.

630
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,400
You went and shot him, bruv.

631
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,900
Come on! Go, go! Fill the other one.

632
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,381
I'm going as fast as I can.

633
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,762
Pray they survive.

634
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Bloody hell!

635
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,396
I'm sorry.

636
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:02,396
He's OK.

637
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,800
Owen, you're making it worse!

638
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:40,808
Open your eyes!

639
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,023
You can do it.Come on.

640
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,427
It's working.Yeah, it's working.

641
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,300
What did you do?

642
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,880
Mercy killing.

643
00:41:55,142 --> 00:41:59,102
Rhys, Rhys, listen to me, listen to me.

644
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,054
That's it, you're with me, OK?

645
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,500
I've got you tight.

646
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,000
Keep your eyes nice and open.

647
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:11,443
Gwen, let me look at him.

648
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,086
OK.

649
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,100
Soft, soft, soft.

650
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,000
OK.

651
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,013
I'm going to rip this.
I want you to keep the pressure on, OK?

652
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:24,331
OK.

653
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,339
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

654
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,577
Here he is.

655
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,553
Hero of the hour.

656
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

657
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,100
Are you all right?

658
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,386
???

659
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:32,300
Sorry.

660
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,584
Next time, let her take the bullet.

661
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,775
Never.

662
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,000
What happened to the blokes?

663
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,500
We gave them amnesia pills.

664
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,894
They'll remember who they are but not what they did over the past few months.

665
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:46,100
So they got away with it?

666
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
It would never stand up in court of law.

667
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,700
And the creature?

668
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,877
Incinerated.

669
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,219
So there's nothing left.

670
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:09,800
It was never there.

671
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,695
Gwen, I need a word.

672
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:18,846
Sure.

673
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,631
Rhys has to forget too, you know?

674
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,600
At least let me give it to him at home.

675
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,488
Let's not go home just yet.

676
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,200
Rhys, you've just been shot.

677
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,300
I know.

678
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,200
Come on,

679
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,300
Let's go for an ice cream.

680
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,948
Look around us.

681
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,700
Nobody else knows what we've been through.

682
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,400
Or what else is out there.

683
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,100
The sky won't be the same to me any more.

684
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,050
I used to look up and think, 

685
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:36,400
'Ah, looks like rain, man.'

686
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,900
But now,  

687
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,500
oh, now I'll...

688
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,034
I'll look and I'll think of all the other worlds and the planets

689
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,900
 and stuff spinning around out there.

690
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,273
And I got to be a part of it all!

691
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,900
Fantastic!

692
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,000
Which puts worrying about unsigned dockets into perspective, I can tell you.

693
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,495
You've got some ice cream on your chin.

694
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,661
Have I? Gone?

695
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,455
I want to know about all of it,
about every alien you've ever seen.

696
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:06,883
You could take photos.

697
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,400
I'll keep a scrap book.

698
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,900
Wouldn't show no-one, no way.

699
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,836
No,because you won't be keeping one. 

700
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:14,383
And you know...

701
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,582
I'm even cool about Jack.

702
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:21,300
All right, he's handsome, enigmatic,saves the world and all that.

703
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,605
But it's me you come home to at the end of it all.

704
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,201
And I always will.

705
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:34,923
Hey. Daf! All right?

706
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,500
0h, nothing much.

707
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,900
Same old, same old.

708
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,300
Yeah!

709
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,800
What?

710
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,978
No way!

711
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:12,100
I'm not doing it.

712
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,600
- I won't drug him.
- You have to.

713
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,600
You can't allow him to remember.

714
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,327
It's the rules. But none of you have any partners outside of this.

715
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:19,517
But we understand how you feel.

716
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:21,900
No, you don't.

717
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
No, you don't, Jack!

718
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,700
You all think it's cold and lonely out there.

719
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,400
But it isn't for me because I have him. He matters.

720
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,100
And I've lied to him for long enough.

721
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,214
What he did today was so brave, 

722
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:35,477
braver than any of us   

723
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:37,500
because we signed up for this. But he didn't!

724
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,246
He did it because he loves me, 

725
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,800
and I won't take that away from him!

726
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,700
I won't!

727
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,317
And if that means I have to quit 

728
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,112
or you retcon me or whatever, then fine,

729
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:51,100
fine.

730
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,183
You really think you could go back to your old life before Torchwood?

731
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,900
I wouldn't know anything different.

732
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,016
I would.

733
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,476
Give Rhys my love, and I will see you tomorrow.

734
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,991
If he comes after me again,
I'll kill him.

735
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:14,063
I love me.

736
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,253
Oh god. Say something.

737
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,230
- You OK with that?
- I've been for the last three years.

738
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:19,372
I killed three girls.

739
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,400
And it felt so good.

740
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,230
- Would you die for me?
- Yes.

741
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,253
How did you come here?

742
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:26,200
I'm the one you can confide it, remember?

743
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,730
I bury the memory of 150 years ago.

744
00:49:28,777 --> 00:49:30,015
- Great.
- My little brother.

745
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,500
I can't afford to remember.

746
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,400
Drop the gun Jack.

747
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,300
And you always remember what you killed.

748
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,856
- Don't you, Jack?
- I let go of his hand.

749
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,200
It was the worst day of my life.
