1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,639
This programme contains
some strong language.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,360
Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the police.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,719
Tracking down
Alien life on earth and arming
the human race against the future.

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,880
The 21st century
is when everything changes

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,639
and you've got to be ready.
Diane Holmes.

6
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,880
How have you done this to me?
Love, you're always at its mercy.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,880
Hate to break it to you,
but you're not my first.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,600
Anti-Weevil spray.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,439
Handclamps.

10
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,399
Come on,
let's make this easy for both of us.

11
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,599
This always happens
when I give them the night off.

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,480
It's not even really medium, let
alone well done. French places, see.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,159
Remember that weekend in Paris,
the place with the wood panelling -

14
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,079
they'd barely even waved the steak
under the grill and you said...

15
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,040
Why are you looking at me like that?
Sorry, like what?

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,560
Like you'd rather be somewhere else!

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,760
It's becoming the norm, in't it?
I'm chopsing away and I look up
and you're just absent.

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,160
What's happening to us, Gwen?
I know. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,760
Is it something I've done?

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,160
Or not done?

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,519
What the hell was that?

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Oh, God, what's happened to you?
Rhys, is it? Nice to meet you!

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,879
Sorry, it's an emergency, I'll
have her back for dessert. Come on...

24
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,720
Hold on, that's my girlfriend.
Rhys, this is Jack. Sit down, Gwen.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,999
He's my boss. Sit the fuck down!

26
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,760
Don't ever speak to me like that.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,439
Come on, Gwen. Let's go.

28
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,759
Hey, she's with me tonight.
One night off. You promised.

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,200
Don't you dare.

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,319
If you go now, Gwen...!

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,760
Sorry for cutting in, but I've
been having trouble with this one.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,200
Rhys will get over it.
He always does.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,079
You promised
you'd keep hold of your life.

34
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,360
Don't let it drift.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,320
WATCH BEEPS

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,239
300 metres on the right, car park!

37
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,600
Jack! Over there!

38
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,719
Get him in, get him in!!

39
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,160
They're fucking mad! Hey!

40
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,480
Who the hell were they?!

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,399
One - since when did other
people know about Weevils?

42
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,800
Two - have they done this before and
if so why didn't we know about it?

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,159
Three -
what do they want with them anyway?

44
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,760
Might not be connected, but we've
noticed a surge of unusual injuries
being reported at the A&E unit.

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,079
Chunks taken out of legs and arms,
deep wounds to backs and stomachs.

46
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,520
So we have a wave of Weevil
attacks to add to our problems.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,159
And by the way, that spray
we've used on them previously?

48
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,119
They're becoming immune to it.
They're mutating? Or evolving.

49
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,519
So any sign of the one
we lost earlier?

50
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,880
I've run a trace on the van's
number plate... it's fake.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,200
2,500 vans of that type
registered in the Cardiff area.

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,839
Widen that to a forty mile
radius and the number doubles.

53
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,399
So, run a trace on the vehicle.
Route via traffic cameras?

54
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,199
This is Owen's voice mail, leave a
message if you must. Processing now.

55
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
Leave a message for Gwen and Rhys,
and we'll call you back...

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,799
if we remember... oi!

57
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:45,480
Hi, it's me.
I've left three messages now.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,200
Look, I've got dozens
of excuses, em...

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,280
..hundreds. Thousands!

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
But none of them good enough.

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
Things have got away
from me a bit lately.

62
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,879
It's this job - it never lets up.

63
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,400
Look, I'll see you later.
I'm not sure what time yet.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,080
I've got some work
to finish off first.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,080
Call me.

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,520
Message deleted.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,279
Are you going to answer that?
Ninth missed call - work.

69
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,079
Do you enjoy your job then?

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,799
Look, if you don't mind...
I came out to be alone.

71
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,520
Ah, the old Greta Garbo.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,399
Something like that.

73
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,280
Little bit of advice -
next time you feel like this,

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,639
you should stay in.

75
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,919
Trust me, the bigger the crowd,
the more alone I feel.

76
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,760
I said - no chatting up the punters.

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,799
Tommy, I work in a bar.
It's my job to speak to them.

78
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:54,240
You're never happier than when you're
flashing your tits at a dickhead.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,039
Don't talk to her like that. You
what? We were having a conversation.

80
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,560
When you grown up, you'll realise
that's what human beings do.

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,520
Tommy, stop. You'll get me the sack!

82
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,359
It's about using your opponent's
aggression to your own ends.

83
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:15,759
Now, I'd suggest you don't
pick fights with strangers.

84
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,239
And you should really
upgrade your boyfriend.

85
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,880
What does a man have to do
to get some peace in this city?

87
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,440
Owen's still not answering
his phone. he's been even more

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,160
erratic than usual since that
thing with Diane. Since the what?

89
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
It's none of my business.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,960
What thing?

91
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,480
What thing, Tosh?

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,560
Owen and Diane.

93
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Before she took the plane,
they had a...thing.

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,879
You knew that, right? Oh, yeah,
of course I knew that.

95
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,360
I just didn't know
they had a thing...

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
thing.

97
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,719
It started ten minutes ago.

98
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,840
WEEVIL HOWLS

99
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
What d'you think it's doing?

100
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,120
I think it's weeping. Why?

101
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,639
Owen's been studying this one,

102
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,840
thinks they have a low
level of telepathic ability
to share emotion across distance.

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,319
You mean it might be feeling
the pain of another Weevil?

104
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,239
I kinda hope we're wrong, though.

105
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,239
Why?

106
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,559
Because that would mean somebody's
not only kidnapping Weevils,

107
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,439
they're causing them pain.

108
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
What can you feel?

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
What do you know?

110
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:24,480
I've tracked the van's route.
It went straight from the
car park out to the docks.

111
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,199
This was two hours ago.

112
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,240
What happened?

113
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
The CCTV cameras went down.
D'you think it was deliberate?

114
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
I think these guys really
don't like to be watched.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,520
See, and I know it's
a character flaw...

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,040
that makes me all the more
determined to find out
what it is they're hiding.

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Looks like we missed them.

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, but if you quit places in
a hurry, you tend to be forgetful.

119
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,520
Y'know what they used these
warehouses for during World War Two?

120
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,120
Storing the bodies of dead GIs.

121
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,440
Sometimes, you can know
too much history.

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,559

There's nothing here.

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
So what were they doing here?

126
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,799
Why come all this way out?

127
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
What is it? Looks human.

128
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,439
Male. Is he alive? Hello?

129
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
You OK there?

130
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,440
We're looking for the people
who were here last night!

131
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,399
If you saw anything, now's
a good time to speak up.

132
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,400
Jack, he's bleeding!

133
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,640
Oh, my God! Weevil marks.

134
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,600
You don't think it's still here?

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,640
No. We'd hear it.

136
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,039
Now help me with the body.
FUNNY RING TONE

137
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,639
Is that his?

138
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,080
You don't think
I'd choose that ring tone?

139
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,319
Don't answer it.

140
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,599
Hello? 'I don't know who you are.

141
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,559
'Stay out of what
doesn't concern you.'

142
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,199
Who killed this man?
'Did you hear what I just said?'

143
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:55,320
I have this selective deafness when
I'm talking to cowards or murderers.

144
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,240
'Don't interfere in things
you don't understand.'

145
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,280
Oh, I understand
this better than you.

146
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,680
Cos I know how this is going to end
- we're going to hunt you down.

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,360
We're going to ensure that you're
punished for what happened here.

148
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,479
And we're going to make you surrender
that creature that you kidnapped.
Is that clear enough?

149
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:22,039
Ianto? I need you to trace
all calls to and from this number
in the last 24 hours.

150
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,319
Fast as you can.
We're on our way back.

This is Owen's voicemail.
Don't leave a message.

Nice try, Owen. I want you
back at the Hub immediately.

154
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,039
We've got a Weevil murder, so get
your boney little ass over here now.

155
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:43,080
Dan Hodges, date of birth,
21st of January 1979.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,680
Salesman for web
publishing software.

157
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,559
Looks like he was
married with a kid.

158
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,479
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

159
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:56,199
Right, definitely death by Weevil,
but he took a right kicking
before the throat was punctured.

160
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,520
Weevils go for the kill,
straight for the jugular.

161
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,719
Look at his face - black eye,
bruises to the cheekbones.

162
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,920
Same across the back and the ribs.

163
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,599
Could he have been tortured? Maybe.

164
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:10,840
But I reckon these wounds
were inflicted by humans.

165
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,919
But why smack somebody about
and then set the Weevil on them?

166
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,440
Why not get the Weevil
do all the work for you?
Any joy with the phone records?

167
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,119
The last incoming number was
blocked. The phone's call history
has been erased.

168
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,239
God, they move fast.

169
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,680
You ask me, these guys are
using Weevils to carry
out the perfect murder.

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,560
No fingerprints, no traces
of recognisable DNA,...

171
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,000
a quick, guaranteed death.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
Nothing to connect anyone
to the murder.

173
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Right. Should be a piece
of piss to find the killer, then.

174
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,600
What about this guy?
Someone's got to break it
to his wife that he's dead.

175
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,880
The shittiest part about
being a police officer
and I can't get away from it.

176
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,919
Thanks for your kind words
of support.

177
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,559
What d'you want me to say?
She'll be all right in the end?

178
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,079
You can always count on Owen
to make you feel better.

179
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,479
Tosh mentioned you and Diane...

180
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,800
Did you...

181
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,720
I didn't want her to go. She went.

182
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,559
Why are we still
doing this, me and you?

183
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:49,160
Fine. Let's not. I was getting
bored of your fuck-tricks, anyway.

184
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,760
You can be such a wanker
sometimes, Owen, d'you know that?

185
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
I do, as a matter of fact!

186
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
Where the hell have you been?

187
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
Walking.

188
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,240
Well, in your absence,
Toshiko's had a great idea.

189
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,399
Well, it had to happen sooner
or later. Ignore him, Tosh.

190
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,360
Yeah, just ignore me, Tosh.

191
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I can be such a wanker. Apparently.

192
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
The van went with the Weevil
straight to the warehouse.

193
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,800
They must've known it was empty.

194
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
Either they own it or had previous
contact with the estate agents.

195
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,679
Owen Harper,
you're going into property.

196
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,360
Toshiko's in the middle of fixing
you a cover story. Hang on, why me?

197
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,999
Jack and Gwen were in the car park,
I was in the warehouse.

198
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,599
If they've got access to CCTV,
they'll recognise us.

199
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,760
We have to get under their guard,
find out what's going on.

200
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,639
Yeah, all right.

201
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,080
I could do with being
someone else right now.

202
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Mr Harper? Yeah. Mark Lynch.

203
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,640
You're looking to relocate
your business to Cardiff? Yeah.

204
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,359
And you export jellied eels. Really?

205
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,079
Huge growth market.

206
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,319
China, South America,
I'm having a nightmare trying to
keep up with demand. I'll er...

207
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,360
get you a batch if you find me
the right gaff.

208
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,439
I think I'll pass on that.

209
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,040
Any family to relocate?

210
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
Just me. It's better that way.

211
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:27,199
And you're looking for premises
out by the docks?

212
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,920
Mmm, nice big warehouse,
that's what I need.

213
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,080
I've got a couple
that should be perfect.

214
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,759
Hang on while I print. Thanks.

215
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,559
We're in! This'll give us
everything on his hard drive,
including encrypted files.

216
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,559
If I can establish a routing
protocol, whatever he does on

217
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,760
this computer from now on,
we'll know about it.

218
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,520
Owen, you're clear.

219
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,959
These have got the square
footage you're looking for,
good access, competitively priced...

220
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,840
Except...

221
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,439
these all look like shitholes to me.

222
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah.

223
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,440
They are a bit.

224
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Didn't I see your sign outside a big
place in the Q section of the docks?

225
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,360
We've accepted an offer on it.
Pretty much signed and sealed.

226
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,559
He's lying.
According to their records, it only
went on the market last week.

227
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,639
Bummer. What about a unit
on an industrial estate?

228
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,920
Save a ton on rent, even
after transport costs.

229
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
And you just happen to have
a list of suitable premises? Nah.

230
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,159
There are other possibilities. You
free at the end of the day? Yeah.

231
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,799
Go for a drink?

232
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,120
On your own in a strange city.
I remember that feeling.

233
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,440
And look at you now.

234
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,160
Couple of gorgeous birds answering
your phones for you. If that's
not success, I dunno what is!

235
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,120
It's all bollocks, really.

236
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,879
But, if you wanted me
to put in a good word... No.

237
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:22,119
Thanks.

238
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,399
Good to meet you, Mark.

239
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,840
Yeah. I'll give you a bell.

240
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:39,720
First, he'll go for the weblink
at the top of the page...

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Then he'll want to know what
other people say about the business.

242
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,400
Now he'll see what
Owen has to say about himself.

243
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,840
Welcome to the number one supplier
of jellied eels to Britain
and Northern Europe.

244
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,400
With a client base of more than 150
resellers, we're constantly looking
to expand into new territories.

245
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,680
If you're interested in
becoming an affiliate

246
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,840
or Harper's franchise holder,
please contact our Sales Director

247
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,360
on the number below.

248
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,080
Harper's sales. Jenny Long speaking.

249
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,599
I'm sorry, wrong number.

250
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,360
Job done.

251
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,799
I've found another set of
suspicious injuries at the hospital.

252
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
They sound pretty bad.

253
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,159
Tosh, stay here and monitor
Mark Lynch's movements.

254
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,440
Ianto with me.. I'll come with you.
Go home. But... It's not a request.

255
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,719
Remember - don't let it drift.

256
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,519
What you doing?

257
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,560
You here now, are you?
That's your pulling top.

258
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,439
No, it's not. It is!

259
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:15,480
That's what you call it,
since I said you looked sexy in it.

260
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,720
You off out? Aye, Daf's stag do.

261
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,760
All day job. Since when
is Daf getting married?

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,240
He's not. But he thinks
he's missing out on a piss-up.

263
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,479
He's having a Staying Single Stag.
Few beers, see what transpires.

264
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:39,720
Strip club, that sort of thing.

265
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,679
What time will you be back?

266
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,560
Not sure.

267
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,759
But...I'm in tonight.
Well, I'm not.

268
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,559
I've already made
my statement to the police.

269
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,640
According to your chart,
you nearly had your heart
torn from your ribcage.

270
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,999
Ten-hour operation
to repair chest wounds.

271
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,879
Why should I talk to you?

272
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,080
Let me tell you what did this to you.

273
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,399
Six feet high,
teeth like a shark, rippled skin

274
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,879
and the rage of a wild animal.

275
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,319
Am I close?

276
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,719
I was mugged.

277
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,720
There was three of them,

278
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,239
they had knives.
So why were your wounds described by
paramedics as bite marks?

279
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,480
Look, I can't help it
if they got mixed up.

280
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,559
They're overworked. There are
lots of ways I can get

281
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,240
you to talk, but the easiest would
be if you consider the consequences
should you not tell me the truth.

282
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,439
And that is,

283
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,679
this creature will attack again.

284
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,279
Somebody will die.

285
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,600
And it will be on your conscience.

286
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,039
Now tell us the truth. I can't.

287
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,280
They'd kill me.

288
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,440
Who'd kill you? Everyone.

289
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,960
What did he mean, "everyone"?

290
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,040
That was all he'd say.
Couldn't get any more out of him.
That leaves us one option.

291
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,920
OK, Janet. Time for a trip out.

292
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,000
You call it Janet?
Barbara just never seemed right.

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,359
You want to release a Weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!

294
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,119
Not exactly in the middle.
A little to the side.

295
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,199
We placed a tracker in its boiler
suit, so when they capture it,
we'll know where they are.

296
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,839
It could kill any number of people
before then! I'm with Tosh.

297
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,359
We set it loose in the same place
where they took the other one.

298
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,679
It's deserted this

299
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,240
time of night. We'll be with it
every step of the way.

300
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
Tracker working? Yeah.

301
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,600
Go Janet!

302
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,919
Second right. 200 metres ahead.

303
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,720
Shit! Stop the car!
She's taken a left.

304
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,800
Pedestrian access only! Ahh!

305
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,080
Ianto, take over!

306
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,719
Now that's what I call service.

307
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,799
Cheers.

308
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,240
Yeah. Cheers.

309
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,839
Shit.

310
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,240
We got a problem here, boys?
Not with you.

311
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,520
Come on then,
let's get it over with.

312
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,879
No need for you to get
involved, sweetheart.

313
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,639
Get up!

314
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,119
Thanks.

315
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,520
The Weevil has landed.

316
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,639
Got a signal?
Yeah.

317
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,120
Just so I know where we stand?

318
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,360
We would never deliberately
put a human being through that.

319
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,640
But Weevils are fair game.
Is that right?

320
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,400
We need to follow them.

321
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,319
This is your gaff?

322
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:36,519
Make yourself at home.
I'm in the wrong business.

323
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:42,639
So, what's your outlet?

324
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:47,200
Er, for what?

325
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,759
The anger.

326
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,600
Who said I was angry?

327
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,759
You're not even living here yet and
you've got people coming after you!
Yeah, well.

328
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,880
some people need teaching a lesson.

329
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,639
I'm not criticising. You're not
the only pissed off bloke out there.

330
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,719
It's what the world does to us.
Fancy a beer?

331
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,479
Yeah, why not.
You work yourself stupid.

332
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,080
Get a house, a car, plasma screen...

333
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,639
You end up with a workforce,
people there specifically
to look after your every whim.

334
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:20,719
You're officially successful.

335
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,559
And what does it bring?

336
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,199
Nothing. Success has
no worth other than itself.

337
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:37,199
Seriously, I could live without
all this. It doesn't define me.

338
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:40,279
Yeah, nice to have it, though, yeah?

339
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,040
Ask yourself,

340
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,240
what's the point of your life?

341
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,200
Mark, mate,...

342
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,999
I only came here for a beer.

343
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,720
There's so much more.

344
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,239
If you know where to look.

345
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,000
Is that right?

346
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,040
It's closer than you think.

347
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,760
Something's coming.

348
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,160
Out there

349
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,160
in the darkness, something

350
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,759
is coming.

351
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,960
You drunk?
Two pints was all I could get down.

352
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,920
They've gone on without me.

353
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:09,840
Look, Gwen...
I need to tell you something.

354
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,400
What sort of thing?
I've been sleeping... I've been
having sex with someone else.

355
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
From work.

356
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,960
His name's Owen.

357
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,559
He's a tosser and it's all gonna
stop but... Shut up. I'm sorry.

358
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,359
I'm really sorry.

359
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,280
You wouldn't do that! But I have.

360
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,959
The.. then why are you telling me?
Because I'm ashamed. And I'm angry.

361
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:38,239
And I want...I need...

362
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,719
I need you to forgive me.

363
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,560
And because I've drugged you.

364
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,359
You've done what?! Just sit down.
It's nothing, it's just an
amnesia pill. Dash of sedative.

365
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,559
You'll wake up tomorrow, and you'll
forget everything. Rhys?

366
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,559
God, you selfish bitch! I know,

367
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,640
I just thought it would give us a
chance, a chance to get everything
out in the open, you know?

368
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,040
Get everything out.

369
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,120
Rhys! Stay with me, Rhys!

370
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,639
Say you forgive me,
say, "It's all right, Gwen.

371
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,040
"Gwen, it's all right."

372
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,279
Say it, please, Rhys.
Rhys, just say it once,
say it once, "I forgive you."

373
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,399
Rhys, please say it!
Say you forgive me!

374
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,520
Say you forgive me, say it.

375
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,159
Say it, please, say it.

376
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,280
Say it, please.

377
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,399
You found the bathroom yet?
Yeah, cheers!

378
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,960
GROWLS

379
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Told you there was more to see.
Mark, mate, I'm really sorry.
I couldn't resist a padlock...

380
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,000
What do you think? What is it?

381
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
No idea.

382
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,440
Don't get too close, though.

383
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,119
Vicious bastard.

384
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,439
Where did you get it from?
I found one on the streets.

385
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:15,240
It took five of us to bring it in.

386
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,319
Other than that, haven't got a clue.

387
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:21,240
Scientific experiment gone wrong?

388
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,800
Nuclear victim?

389
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,439
One of the lads even
reckons it's an alien.

390
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,599
Want to know what I think?
Yeah, go on.

391
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,200
I think it's us, Owen. You and me.
In a thousand years' time.

392
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,640
This is what we become, when
all we have left is our rage.

393
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,600
Not exactly a comforting thought.

394
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,800
Give it a smack. You what? Punch it.

395
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,840
Why? That's what it's there for.

396
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,359
Or d'you want me to do it for you?

397
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,520
It just feels a bit weird,
that's all.

398
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,199
All right, that's enough!

399
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:09,159
It's not exactly putting up a fight.

400
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,920
We all need a punchbag.

401
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,440
So, who are you, Owen? Sorry?

402
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,319
It'd be pretty stupid not to
assume that you're not connected
to those two in the black SUV.

403
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,640
I dunno what you mean. Bloke in the
big coat, cute little Asian girl?

404
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,879
I was watching. Nice website by
the way, kudos to whoever did
that, although jellied eels...

405
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,799
That wasn't your greatest idea.

406
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,320
I wasn't that bad!
Pretty much, you were.

407
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,600
Whoever you are, you've royally
fucked up my plans.

408
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,639
Didn't want this getting out.
What about Dan Hodges,
what about his wife and kid?

409
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,119
I'm not responsible
for people's life choices.

410
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,239
Now why did you lot take the body?

411
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,679
Why didn't you go to the cops?

412
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,999
Because, Mark, they are parochial
pigshits whose minds would implode

413
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:02,040
if they saw this.
Who are you, Owen Harper?

414
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,079
Is that who you are?

415
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,799
A little kid hiding behind a gun.

416
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,839
If you want to know what
happens, you won't find
out because of a weapon.

417
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,440
Good boy,
we're finally getting somewhere.

418
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,479
Now you're just you. Stripping
things back to the core, Owen.

419
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,520
Now, we're just two blokes.

420
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,479
Equal.
Why did you murder Dan Hodges?

421
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,760
I didn't.

422
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,720
All right, not technically.

423
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,840
Did you do it here?

424
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,640
I mean, you let that thing
loose on him.

425
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,480
The perfect murder. Nothing
to link you back to the crime.

426
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,600
God, you haven't
got a clue, have you?

427
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,080
Dan wasn't murdered. He was one
of us. Tell me what happened.

428
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,199
I can do better than that.

429
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:56,719
Come on!

430
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,599
Hello?

431
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,679
Anyone?

432
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:33,520
So where is it, Tosh?

433
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,680
So what have we got now? Nothing.

434
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,879
We have no clue where they are
or what they're doing.

435
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,480
So, what am I
supposed to be looking at?

436
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,920
Wait and see.

437
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,760
All this lot with you?
What's going on?

438
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,719
You'll find out.

439
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,360
I've never been that keen
on surprises.

440
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,959
Jack, I...

441
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,559
'Jack, can you hear me?'

442
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,080
What the hell are you doing there? I
told you to go home.

443
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,799
There's a text message that's just
come through on Dan Hodges' phone.

444
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:34,279
'Charlie Foxtrot One
Zero Six Bravo Yankee.'

445
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:38,400
Seems to be a postcode for
a building. One that's gonna have
a Lynch Frost sign outside.

446
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,239
OK, I've got the location.
Gwen, we'll pick you up on the way.

447
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,040
People get a text message
and they head to a property?

448
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,720
An empty property.

449
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,319
So the question is -
what happens when they get there?

450
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,839
What the hell's going on here?

451
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,600
Warm-up. Warm-up?

452
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Who are these blokes? Same as us.

453
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,479
Ordinary blokes trying
to find meaning in a world
that doesn't have any.

454
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:14,560
You don't really believe that?
We're the dispossessed now, Owen.

455
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,239
All the certainties
our fathers had are gone.

456
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,679
We're a generation of no faith.

457
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,000
In society,

458
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
in religion... or in life.

459
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
All we can do

460
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,199
is reduce ourselves to the basics.

461
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,240
This is only the warm-up. Come on.

462
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,959
Coming or staying?

463
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:51,040
Five, four, three, two, one!

464
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,759
Get me out!

465
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,639
Nice one, mate.
Costs a grand to enter the cage.

466
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,040
Whoever stays in the longest takes
home all the money. You're next!

467
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,999
So these guys are paying
to put their lives at risk?

468
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:42,159
The ultimate extreme sport.
Too much disposable income,
not enough meaning. That's us.

469
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,800
So what about Dan Hodges, Mark?

470
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800
He wouldn't come out.

471
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Just stood in the middle
of the cage and let it maul him.

472
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,760
I think he got in there
and he realised...

473
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,759
he didn't want to live enough.

474
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:59,439
He surrendered. None of us
could get to him in time.

475
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:03,040
Yeah. And still you all come back.

476
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Well, what else is there?
This has to stop.

477
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,800
More people are gonna die.

478
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,560
How long are we going to keep
playing this game, Owen?

479
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,800
You lie,

480
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,159
you bullshit and sweet talk.

481
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,360
But you are hiding, Owen.

482
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:38,639
Get in the cage.

483
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:44,160
Not if you're gonna
point a gun at me.

484
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,600
Do you want me to shoot you?

485
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,439
Lower the gun.

486
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:52,960
And then I will get into the cage.

487
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,999
Good boy.

488
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,640
What's the longest anyone's been
in there? That'd be Dan Hodges.

489
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,159
when you're up close with it, take
a look into its eyes. Open the door!

490
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,839
It's like looking into the
darkest recesses of your own soul.

491
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,799
Open the door!

492
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,120
Owen!

493
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,320
I said open the door!

494
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,239
Jack!

495
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,560
Open it!

496
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,999
Owen? Get off me!

497
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:21,039
That's enough!
Help me, Jack, help me get him out!

498
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,839
Owen, come on... Get a stretcher!

499
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,999
You did this to him. He did it
to himself, he had no fear.

500
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,599
It's over now.
These creatures are to be left alone.

501
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,680
Go back to your lives. Jack!

502
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,560
What're you doing? It's over.

503
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,200
THE MAN WRITHES IN AGONY

504
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,159
You shouldn't have.

505
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,040
No, really you shouldn't.
I hate grapes.

506
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:37,519
Doctors reckon you can go home.

507
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,640
Doctors. What do they know, eh?

508
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,919
I didn't want saving.

509
00:44:50,919 --> 00:44:52,879
You want us to apologise?

510
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:56,160
For a few seconds in that cage,

511
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,600
I felt totally at peace.

512
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,560
And then you blunder in.

513
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,920
Do you always know best, Jack?

514
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,799
Is that what you believe?

515
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:18,120
Want you back in work tomorrow.

516
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,000
You sure you'll be all right?
Give us a moment alone, yeah?

517
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,439
Where's the SUV?
Has it been stolen?

518
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:41,760
No, we have.

519
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,240
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz! Toshiko!

520
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,200
It's our duty to get them out.

521
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,799
Open the rift now and the
whole world could suffer.
Or who knows what will come out?

522
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:52,399
I love you.

523
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:55,759
It's a trap to
incite total chaos and destruction!

524
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:59,880
You don't even know who he is!
He's our leader. Not any more!

525
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,520
Captain Jack Harkness,
133rd Squadron.
