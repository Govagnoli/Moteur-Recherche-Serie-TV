1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,880
Torchwood. Outside the Government,
beyond the Police.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,240
Tracking down alien life
on Earth and arming the
human race against the future.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,160
The 21st century is when
everything changes,

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,800
and you've got to be ready.

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,439
Nearly there.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,559
We've been right busy since
you lot were billeted here.

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
This your first time?

8
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,200
The others been
teasing you, is that it?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,599
My name's Mary.

10
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,519
Mary, like the virgin.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,439
Religious man, are ya?

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,639
I'm not your bloody hound.

13
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,919
Whore!

14
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,879
METALLIC WHOOSHING

15
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,119
Do whores have prayers?

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
Once, just once, I'd like
to walk into one of these tents

17
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,639
and find it's a party.

18
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,520
You know, food, drink, people
dancing, girl crying in the corner.

19
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,879
Is it alien? And how.

20
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,359
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite,
pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.

21
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,639
Any idea what it is? Not a clue.

22
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,160
Could be a weapon,
or a really big stapler.

23
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,000
How's our friend there? She's dead.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah, thanks, Quincy(!) She?

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?

26
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,800
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,519
The earth's been disturbed so I'm
afraid I can't be more accurate.

28
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,599
What killed her? The stapler?

29
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,879
Nah. See those shattered ribs?

30
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,040
I reckon she was shot.

31
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,079
Well, let's get her back
to the Hub and find out.

32
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,520
You're so light! You're like a girl.

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,120
But I guess I don't need
to tell you that.

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,159
I'm really sorry, I think
your computer might be dead.

36
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,439
You're kidding. What happened?

37
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,920
OK, so she said I was no
good at sport... Hello?!

38
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,719
So I said,
"Throw something to me and..."

39
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,880
What happened to the computer? Oh.

40
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,479
I kicked out the plug.

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,399
What? It was running a
translation programme I'd written.

42
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,319
I'd collated every scrap of alien
language we've got,

43
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,399
and broken it
down into binary threads to see
if there was a common derivation.

44
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,439
That's a bit of a mouthful.

45
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,279
Sorry. Private joke. Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.

46
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,160
We've got a job to do. She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.

47
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,319
Do you know what, Tosh? Sometimes I
think even that stick up your arse

48
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,080
has got a stick up its arse.

49
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,040
The guy over there's been staring at
me all evening, and I told him he's
wasting his time but he won't listen,

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,200
so I've come over to talk to
you because I know how this ends -

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,879
he gets a punch in the neck
and I get barred, and I've already
been barred from about 20 pubs.

52
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,120
And I don't want to get barred
from this one because they do
these nice olives on the tables.

53
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Right. OK, then.

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,320
Cool. Let me get you a drink.

55
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,480
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah. That was the other thing.

57
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,920
I kind of know who you are. I think
you're mistaken. Toshiko Sato.

58
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,520
Born in London, 1975,
moved to Osaka when you were two,
then back to the UK in 1986.

59
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,920
Parents in the RAF,
grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.

60
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,719
Very impressive.

61
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,279
University...blah-blah,
snapped up to Government science
think tank when you were 20,

62
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,039
recruited to Torchwood
three years ago.

63
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,280
I saw you at the
building site this morning.

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,280
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?

65
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,479
There's stuff on the internet,
but you have to dig really deep.

66
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,239
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from
police radio scanners, we also... We?

67
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,680
Scavengers.

68
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,360
Collectors. Just like you.

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,679
How many of there are you?

70
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:49,440
Oh, listen, don't think
it's in any way organised.

71
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
It's really just a disparate bunch of
IT guys who live with their mothers.

72
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,719
I shouldn't talk to you.

73
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,679
So go.

74
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,719
What's most amazing are the
similarities with our own culture.

75
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,599
But that can be horrible,
because we find lots of weapons,

76
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,480
and it just makes you think,
"My God, everything wages war."

77
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,959
It's not just a trait of
ours, but a trait of existence.

78
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,080
It makes you feel so hopeless.

79
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,840
But then there are times...

80
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,799
We found this thing,
it was about A4 size,
and it had all these symbols on it.

81
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:36,039
And it took me about three months
to translate, and it was a letter
someone had written to his family,

82
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,080
to his children,
to say how much he was missing them.

83
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,600
And it just made me cry,

84
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,640
because I thought, even across
these unimaginable distances,

85
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,039
there are fundamentals that
stay exactly the same.

86
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,719
And there's no-one
to talk to about this. I mean,
the guys at work, they're great,

87
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,920
but they don't...
see it the way I do.

88
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,800
I could be fired...just
for telling you that.

89
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,000
I want to show you something.

90
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,799
It's a pendant. Put it on.

91
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:22,119
VOICES ECHO: I'll drink one more,
then just drive slowly. Does coffee
count as food if you take sugar?

92
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,519
If he tugs his groin one more time,
I'll smack him in the face...

93
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,240
I should have said it
was Hammer Time when she
asked what the time was.

94
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,079
I can hear voices.

96
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,200
Bloody Sudoku...

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,199
Did I send that email?

98
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:41,319
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.

99
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,919
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.

100
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,919
'I wish I'd shagged
that single dad I met.'

101
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,120
'What's that Asian girl doing -
having a fit or something?'

102
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,439
It's... They're so loud.

103
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,679
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?

104
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,039
'Marcus reckons he's done it
with two lesbians, lucky sod.

105
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,680
'How would it work?'
That man over there with...

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,600
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.

107
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,399
I can hear all of them.

108
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,999
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.'

109
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,199
It's so... 'Just me. There's
no-one else but me. Can you hear me?

110
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,679
'Can you hear me now?

111
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,760
'OK, I want you to home
in on just MY thoughts.

112
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,719
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much...'

113
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:29,199
'You can do it. It takes practice,
but this is what you have to learn.

114
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,719
'Now, what am I thinking?

115
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,919
'This is so hard...

116
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,240
'Follow my voice. What am I thinking?

117
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you...'

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...

119
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,559
Sometimes you can't control...

120
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,320
I know, it's fine.

121
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,399
Where did you get it?

122
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,480
It's been in the family a long time.

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,839
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.

124
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,880
It's more than incredible. With this,
you can read people's minds. It
levels the pitch between man and God.

125
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,719
Is it alien? I guess.

126
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,160
No, I want you to keep it.

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,720
What? I can't, Mary. Please.

128
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,560
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...

129
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
You hear too much.

130
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,440
It changes how you...see people.

131
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,359
I'll have to show it to the others.

132
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,200
What?

133
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,399
Nothing. Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding
my CV on the internet?

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,760
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.

135
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,360
Because I will. Yeah. But you won't.

136
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,559
Good morning.

137
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,240
Yeah, hi...

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,679
Ianto.

139
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,200
'What the hell would produce
such a perfect circular puncture?

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,960
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.

141
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,399
'She'd better not go into one
about the computer again.' Morning.

142
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,879
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie
has deigned to call her old mates."

143
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,000
'Should put a weevil
in his bathroom.'
I've got something to show you.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit
through another slideshow about
the Incas or whatever it was.

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
'I want a biscuit.'

146
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing
has really kind of had its day.'

147
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,920
I...I found this thing...
'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.

148
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,199
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.' OK.

149
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,200
Um, I don't know if this comes under
actual technology.

150
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,559
'I can smell Owen on me from that
shag in his car this morning.

151
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,840
'That's twice now - does that
make it an arrangement? Has to
be more than two times surely...

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,560
'Long as we keep it to just
the two times we're fine. What's
Tosh looking at?' You OK, Tosh?

down till this subsides a bit.'

00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,879
Yeah. No. Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?

'I wonder if I could get Owen to come
down to the vault. No, couldn't

Trevor Kendall's cat.' Forget it.

It's... I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

159

No worries. 'But thanks for that
rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.'

'Pain so constant,
like my stomach's full of rats.

162
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,559
'Feels like this is all I am now.

163
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,799
'There isn't an inch of
me that doesn't hurt.'

164
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm about to brew some of
Jack's industrial strength coffee.

165
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,039
Would you like a cup?

166
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks, Ianto.

167
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,199
Might have known you'd
have my address as well.

168
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,440
Did you tell them? No. I didn't.

169
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,879
What made you change your mind?

170
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,480
You listened to them, didn't you?

171
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,399
See, I told you! Isn't it incredible?

172
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,599
Some of the stuff you hear...

173
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,079
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?

174
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,160
I told you. The things I heard.

175
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,879
What they thought of me, what they
really thought. God, these are
people that are supposed to like me!

176
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,519
They do like you.

177
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,919
People are complicated, they...

178
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,439
OK, I should have
warned you about this.

179
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,520
It isn't like reading
someone's diary.

180
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,359
The stuff you've been hearing, it's
so deep, so personal - stuff they're
not even aware they're thinking.

181
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,200
You think you know someone, then
suddenly you see them for real,

182
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
and they're...bastard little kids.

183
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,640
Not everything. Not everyone.

184
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,439
I wouldn't say
your thoughts were exactly pure.

185
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,680
At least they're consistent.

186
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,880
No agenda. No resentment.

187
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,319
They pity me.

188
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,560
You don't pity me.

189
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,679
Why would I?

190
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,719
What you're thinking now, that's
pretty graphic.

191
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:26,520
That wasn't my thought. What?
I wasn't thinking anything,
that wasn't my thought.

192
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,119
It must have been yours.

193
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,399
That one! There! That's yours.

194
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,879
Yeah, that was mine. I, um,

195
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,880
certainly seem to be
enjoying myself.

196
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,159
You would. You will.

197
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,759
You have no ashtrays in
your whole house, not one.

198
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,120
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.

199
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,840
You OK?

200
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,120
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?

201
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,999
You're the expert.

202
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,080
Isn't it a little late to
still have your cards up?

203
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,799
What? "Lots of love, Owen."

204
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,639
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.

205
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,639
Owen from the building
site yesterday morning.

206
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,120
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
All I'm saying is, I don't want
to get in the way of anything.

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,280
There's nothing to
get in the way of.

209
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,480
I see.

210
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,479
You want to talk about it?
Not really. It's OK.

211
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,719
Wouldn't be the first time
I'd been a rebound shag.

212
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,519
You weren't, OK?

213
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,920
Nothing's happened,

214
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,039
nothing will ever happen.

215
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,160
Just one of the delightful
things I found out,
thanks to your bloody pendant.

216
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,480
It's not all bad,

217
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,040
the pendant.

218
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,839
Some of the things it
can do are extraordinary.

219
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,920
What good could ever come of that?

220
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,479
You need to work that out for
yourself.

221
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,360
You need to go somewhere public,
somewhere crowded.

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,880
What am I looking for?

223
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,040
It will find you.

224
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I'm sick of these riddles.

225
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,359
What's going on?
Where did you get this? I told you.

226
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,480
Who are you, Mary?

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,360
Is that even your real name?

228
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,840
OK.

229
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,160
Here's another name.

230
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,360
Philoctetes.

231
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm Philoctetes.

232
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
MULTIPLE VOICES

233
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,080
'Bandage my hand, say I shut it
in the car door, that'll explain
why the signatures don't match.'

234
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,240
'Gives me an hour before
Lisa gets back to dress up.

235
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,040
'I've got to be careful.

236
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,119
'She's started to notice her
tights are baggy at the crotch.'

237
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,079
'All giggly, and I'm sat there with
my boobs like something out of the
National Geographic.

238
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,840
'Six cigarettes today, and all of
them post-coital glorious.

239
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,479
'Ah, Mr Bond,
I've been expecting you.

240
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,960
'Some people should be
prohibited from wearing a thong.

241
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,840
'What's that girl looking at?

242
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,240
'I'm gonna kill them.

243
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,879
'I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.

244
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:18,120
'Lay their bodies out
afterwards, and lie next to them.

245
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,240
'I'll have to do myself lying down.
I should have practised that.'

246
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,959
Sorry.

247
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:30,440
'I'll wear my glasses cos it makes
me look more sensitive.'

248
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,959
'If Lawrence come in and finds us,
he'll know it's right, and what he's
been doing is trespassing.'

249
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,359
'I won't miss anything.

250
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,919
'I won't miss this city, miss
this body, I won't miss anything.'

251
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,080
All right, Danny?

252
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,920
I want him back at six.

253
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,640
And I mean six this time.

254
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,919
Kelly's given me 90 minutes
after-hours at the tanning
salon as a wedding present.

255
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,839
Besides, you're breaking the
law bringing him home late.

256
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,439
My dad reckons I could have
you arrested, so think on.

257
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:23,880
Hey. Get your shoes on and go
to the toilet. What's that face?

258
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
I don't wanna go. Well, you have to.

259
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,239
Lawrence will be here in a minute,
and we're looking at napkins.

260
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,999
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.

261
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,200
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,079
Mind, that's Lawrence all over -
dead thoughtful. Not like some.

263
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,240
Oh, and no cola. I don't want
him coming home all excited.

264
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.

265
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,679
Oh, my God, Neil,
what are you doing?!

266
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,039
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?

267
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,120
We had that chalet...around
when Danny was walking,

268
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,279
and the chalet was just full of
spiders and you called me your hero,

269
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,399
because I wasn't scared - I'd just
pick them up and throw them out.

270
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:07,279
Oh, my God, Neil!

271
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,560
No, you're scaring me! And it
was this perfect little memory.

272
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,840
We were happy because
we were together.

273
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,600
And all this nonsense
with Lawrence, it's fine,

274
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,440
I forgive you.

275
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,799
Because I'm looking at
the bigger picture now.

276
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
Oh, my God!

277
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,439
Oh, Christ! Oh, no, don't! Please!

278
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,919
It's OK, it's just like
falling asleep. Really.

279
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,719
Don't do this, to Danny, please!

280
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,399
And then we will
be together forever.

281
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,200
It's OK. You're OK now.

282
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,800
Plodders.

283
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,439
# The leg bone's connected
to the hip bone... #

284
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:54,559
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!

285
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,719
I don't know what
you're laughing at!

286
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:59,599
Stop singing, please don't
sing, please don't sing.

287
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
What's going on?

288
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,999
You know the skeleton we
found at the site?

289
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:12,760
Well, Amanda Burton here has just
completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.

290
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,199
As you may remember, at the building
site, Owen said this was a woman
killed by a single gunshot.

291
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:23,520
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak
some of his initial conclusions.

292
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,639
The first being that this isn't, in
fact, a woman, but a man.

293
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,999
A young man. A very girly man.

294
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:33,240
But still ultimately a man.

295
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,599
Then there was the cause of death.

296
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,240
Owen said GSW. Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...

297
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,799
Unidentified trauma.
But... Unidentified trauma?

298
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,640
You see it in RTAs, when something
like a steering column or a post goes
into a body at great velocity.

299
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,160
But the one thing that could be
ruled out was... Gunshot wound.

300
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,119
Gunshot wound.

301
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,240
Was there, in fact, any part of
your prognosis that was right?

302
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,720
I got that it was a...skeleton.

303
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,640
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...

304
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,199
Where did you train? Where did
you train? DID you train?

305
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,039
Jack, um, do you know
anything about Greek mythology?

306
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,800
Security visa 45895.

307
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,119
Harkness. A little, why?

308
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,879
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.

309
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,840
You went to a pub quiz?

310
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,959
Yeah. No, I love pub quizzes.

311
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:33,439
Down at the Prince of...Tides.

312
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:36,559
Philoctetes was an archer recruited
to fight in the Trojan War.

313
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,920
He got into an argument and was
marooned on the island of Lemnos for
about ten years. Just left there?

314
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,840
Hey! What's happening
with that list for UNIT?

315
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,360
Hmm?

316
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,600
Oh, yeah. I'm still working on it.

317
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...

318
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Prime Minister, is
this a secure line?

319
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,079
Can you tell me why Torchwood
operations have become part

320
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,039
of your security briefings
to the leader of the Opposition?

321
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,640
This is incredible.

322
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,479
This is THE most incredible
thing I ever heard. They should
make an action figure of you.

323
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:15,040
You were right, about the pendant.

324
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
I see it now -
it can be used for good.

325
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,040
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?

326
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,640
I didn't tell them.

327
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,039
I think that's wise.

328
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,759
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to kiss you now.

329
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,959
Mary, no. Listen!

330
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:34,319
You do something
unbelievably brave and sexy,
I have to kiss you.

331
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,640
I don't make the rules.

332
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,999
So...

333
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,240
What's happening with the thing
you found on the building site?

334
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,119
Don't know, my boss
is dealing with that.

335
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,960
I thought you did all
the technological stuff.

336
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,160
I do, but sometimes
our jobs overlap a bit.

337
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,080
I'm doing... There's an admin
thing he's asked me to do.

338
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,800
Don't you have a secretary for that?

339
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,519
It's actually quite complicated.

340
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,319
So, what's he found out?

341
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,360
I don't know. He's not said
anything. That's kind of strange.

342
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,559
It isn't, it's fine. No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from
you, there's bound to be a reason.

343
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,400
You're not still worrying
about that, are you?

344
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,640
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't
a gunshot or a musket shot,

345
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,799
or whatever they had then,

346
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,760
maybe it was some kind of ritual.

347
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,399
You are gorgeous!

348
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,879
I start looking into devil-worship
and stuff from that era,

349
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:05,440
see if there's anything
about plucking out hearts, and would
you believe it? There's nothing.

350
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,760
They ate eyeballs, they drank
blood, they had sex with animals,

351
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,359
but they did not pluck out
each other's hearts. Cos obviously
that would have been weird(!)

352
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:20,359
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat
to society any more. Yeah, I know.

353
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,479
It's just, there's something...

354
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,400
Does that remind you of anything?

355
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,399
Um..

356
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,640
That bit in Alien where that
thing bursts out of John Hurt?

357
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,760
I'm sorry - I should
have been more specific.

358
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,040
Does that remind
you of anything helpful?

359
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
No. Sorry. Right.

360
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,640
Erm, just go over there,
do your computer stuff and
think about shoes, eh?

361
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,120
Thank you.

362
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,199
Has Jack said anything to
you about the hardware we
found with the skeleton?

363
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,920
No, why?

364
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,120
'Check there were
any hospitals nearby.

365
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,520
'Could have been someone died in an
operation. This has sugar in it.'

366
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,119
No worries. Just asking.

367
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,080
Hello. 'Keep looking at the
skeleton, don't look at her.'

368
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,360
'You're grinning...' Hey, Tosh. That
coffee going begging? 'What's the
matter? Why isn't he looking at me?'

369
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
There's copies of that Michael
Hamilton statement on your desk.

370
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,720
He's still seeing Cybermen
outside his mother's house.

371
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,479
'Don't think about her palm
on the bottom of my spine,
her hand in my hair.'

372
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,239
I think I'll just go over there.

373
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:34,200
OK. I'll phone Social Services,
see if there's a history of mental
illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.

374
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,959
'It can't go on. This is a good
thing. Why the hell isn't he looking
at me?' I think my desk is on fire.

375
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,759
So I've just come from a really
interesting conversation

376
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,120
with a Detective Inspector
Henderson. Right.

377
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,559
Interesting because, firstly,

378
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,959
the man had the biggest
hands I've ever seen,

379
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,600
and secondly...

380
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,560
because of the story he told me
about you saving a woman and her kid

381
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,840
from being murdered
by her ex-husband.

382
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,080
Yeah, no, I was going to tell
you about that. So why didn't you?

383
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,279
I don't know, it wasn't a work
thing, just a...thing thing.

384
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,320
Stuff happens all the time
that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?

385
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,879
So you secretly fight crime,
is that it, Tosh?

386
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:36,120
I didn't want it
to look like I was showing off.

387
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,560
The guy they arrested, Henderson,
said you heard him muttering

388
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,000
to himself as he was walking along,
and that's what tipped you off.

389
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,719
Mm. I couldn't really work out
what he was saying at first,
and then it was like, "Jesus!"

390
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:51,759
That's weird because when
I'm about to murder someone,

391
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,639
I'm careful not to talk to myself
about it while I'm in the street.

392
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:59,080
No, sure. I mean, that's lesson one.

393
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,919
I was wondering how you
were getting on with this.

394
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,839
It's ongoing.

395
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,559
Are you going to dismantle it?

396
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,160
Like I said, it's ongoing.

397
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,680
What? Have I got something
on my face? Is it food?

398
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,440
No. Sorry.

399
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,240
I zoned out. Well, listen, that
was a good save, Tosh. Well done.

400
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,680
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got
coffee - real coffee - wine...

401
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm giving them the pendant.

402
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,480
Right, let's... You're right,

403
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,839
it's not like
reading someone's diary.

404
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,480
It's so much worse, and it makes me
feel dirty and ashamed...

405
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,080
And now,
I've been spying on my friends.

406
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,480
Some friends. What's that supposed
to mean? They pity you,

407
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,560
they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!

408
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,599
So? No. I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.

409
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,960
So they'll probably want to
talk to you - why do you care?

410
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,680
It's the pendant they're interested
in, they don't care about you.

411
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,439
I go in that place,
I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?

412
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:32,160
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.

413
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,279
DISTORTED: Put the phone down.

414
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,760
OK.

415
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,079
I'll show you.

416
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
This is why you can't tell them.

417
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
You're cold.

418
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
Who are you?

419
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
Still the person you kissed.

420
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,760
The person you caressed.

421
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,719
Say something. So...

422
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.

423
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,519
Which is worse? Well, I know
which one my parents would say.

424
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,359
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.

425
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,720
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be
anything bigger than this?

426
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,079
The freedom you have.

427
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:12,680
When I first got here, I found it
almost obscene. My world was savage.

428
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,999
Enforced worship in temples
the size of cities,
execution squads roaming the streets.

429
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,919
Dissent of any kind meant death...

430
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,680
or transportation,
to what they'd call a feral outpost.

431
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,640
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.

432
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,680
It's how we've
communicated for centuries.

433
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,039
Speaking orally,

434
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,919
using a pre-arranged and finite
number of words, it's so archaic.

435
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,680
And kind of gross to look at.

436
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,559
The machine you found
is a transporter.

437
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,639
It brought me here, it can
get me home again. I need it
back before you dismantle it.

438
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:59,720
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.

439
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,519
There'll be a new government.

440
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,879
There'll have been 20 new governments
by now.

441
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:08,199
Then why hasn't someone come back
for you? I've been forgotten.

442
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,039
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.

443
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,720
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you,

444
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,520
fix the transporter,
get you back home. You won't!

445
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,799
You'll examine me, assess whether
or not I'm useful, whether I'm
a danger, then lock me in a cell.

446
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,840
You're not interested in
understanding alien cultures.

447
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,200
It's just as well you haven't
got the technology to
reach other planets yet.

448
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,520
Yours is a culture of invasion.

449
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,039
Do you really think
I'm going to walk,

450
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,600
hands raised in surrender, into that?

451
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,919
'Silence when the door opens. Can't
do another night of the silence...'

452
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,719
'His hands were cold.

453
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:57,199
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social
Services," over a few bruises?!'

454
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:02,400
'The whole inheritance is going
on sheltered accommodation...

455
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,080
'Calling it
Grandad's little secret...'

456
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
'I can't stand it any more.

457
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
'The weight of it. The depravity.'

458
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,599
The fear... It fills me up.

459
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,760
It's in my mouth,

460
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,799
and my hair,

461
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:22,039
and my eyes. Marmer...

462
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:27,360
Like I'm drowning in ink.

463
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,160
What am I doing...?

464
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,680
"Heart removed.

465
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,480
"Records and post-mortem passed to
Operation Lowry." Operation Lowry...

466
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:44,360
And even when I don't
have the pendant on,

467
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,879
even when there's nothing, I can't
forget the things I've seen, the
things I've heard.

468
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,800
Heart removed.

469
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,760
Heart removed. Removed...

470
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,879
How far back does it go?

471
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:06,240
It's like a curse,

472
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,119
something the gods send
to drive someone mad.

473
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,039
I had hope.

474
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,599
I'd see something,
some little random act of kindness,

475
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,959
and it made me think we were safe,
there was some essential good in us.

476
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:25,280
This is impossible. But there isn't.

477
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
It's like one of the weevils.

478
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,480
You look inside, and there's
just this great yawning scream.

479
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,840
This is completely impossible.

480
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,520
You were right.
Everything you said about us.

481
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,760
We're frightened and
we're callous.
Owen. You need to see this.

482
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,039
And I can't be part of it
any longer. I don't know what to do.

483
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,320
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.

484
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:17,240
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan
a stately pleasure-dome decree...

485
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,000
"Where Alph the sacred river ran
through caverns measureless to man,

486
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,839
"down to a sunless sea."

487
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,920
So, where is it, lover? Stay here.

488
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,960
Jack, my boss, has got it.

489
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,799
Be quick.

490
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,640
I've a long journey ahead of me.

491
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,400
I might need something to eat before
I go. This what you're looking for?

492
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,159
Jack! Friend of mine -

493
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,919
let's call him Vincent.

494
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:53,239
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend,
likes his sport, likes a beer.

495
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,199
He starts acting a little...strange,

496
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,599
a little distracted.

497
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,120
Suddenly he disappears
for a couple of months.

498
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,000
He comes back,

499
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,640
and we've gotta start
calling him Vanessa.

500
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,280
Since then I've always been
a little nervous when a
friend behaves out of character.

501
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.

502
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,279
Jack Harkness.

503
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:23,640
My guess is you're not from
around these parts. Now this...

504
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:31,960
This is incredible. You
know what it is? It's a transporter.

505
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,919
Mary was a political prisoner -
she was exiled here. Look, Jack...

506
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:39,840
You've got half of it right.
Mary... It is Mary, isn't it?

507
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,600
You want to tell her the
really interesting bit? No?

508
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,999
Chatty, isn't she? I don't know how
you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.

509
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:53,440
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.

510
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,320
You might be squids, for all I know.

511
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,520
A two-squid transporter.

512
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,320
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what
happened to the guard, Mary?

513
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
I killed him.

514
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,760
But I was disturbed.

515
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,839
Then another came - a soldier.

516
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,160
He tried to shoot me.

517
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:05,199
Do whores have prayers?

518
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:11,760
So I plunged my new human hand into
his chest and plucked out his heart.

519
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,479
And that's what you've
been doing ever since.

520
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:23,800
This form needs to be fed. All the
punctures were all about the size of
a fist. My God, all those people.

521
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,920
You killed all those people.

522
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,039
I fled before any more soldiers came.

523
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,000
I had so much to explore!

524
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,679
And how I loved this body.

525
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,800
So soft.

526
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,480
So wicked. The power such
a body has in this world.

527
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,520
Within a few years the forest had
gone, transporter was safely buried
under the spread of the city.

528
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,200
I didn't care, I wasn't
exactly in a hurry to get home.

529
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,000
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when
my situation here became complicated,

530
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,599
but I was safe, as long as I
knew where the transporter was.

531
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,999
'The way she looks at you with
those eyes - she's like an animal.'

532
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:02,280
'When they brought that girl
into the hospital, I had only
been qualified six months.

533
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,520
'I wanted to throw up.'
And then the machine was uncovered.

534
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,320
As soon as the air touched
its surface, I could feel it.

535
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,519
'She's just talking,
she's not even frightened of
us, she's just talking.'

536
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,919
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.

537
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:20,879
'Gonna go for it now.'
Owen, NO! Let her go, Mary!

538
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:24,519
Let her go! Toshiko,
tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.

539
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:30,079
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed,
we're just shouting at her.
Not again. Please, God, not again.'

540
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,239
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.'

541
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,840
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.

542
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,080
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen.'

543
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Just put the knife down. Did you
hear him? He didn't want to, did he?

544
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,800
'She read my thoughts,
she actually read my thoughts.'

545
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,360
'What happened? What did he say?'

546
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,920
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.

547
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,080
That's who you've been working
with for all these years.

548
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,160
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.

549
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,519
But not me. Whatever I've done,
it doesn't change the way
I feel about you.

550
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,640
We have a connection, Toshiko,
something real.

551
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,719
'Toshiko... Don't move.

552
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,560
'Don't do anything until I say.'

553
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,119
OK, you want the transporter,
we want Toshiko.

554
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,439
'I've been trained
for this hostage situation...

555
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:17,119
'For God's sake, think!'

556
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,400
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give
you the transporter myself.

557
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,960
'He's just going to let her go.'

558
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,479
It's a bluff,
but I think it's going to work.

559
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,239
You smell...

560
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,359
different to them. That's nothing.

561
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,760
It's when you compare
teeth with a British guy,
that's when it's really scary.

562
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,879
What are you? I don't know.

563
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:47,080
And you would have put me in a cage?

564
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:52,000
What's happening? Oh, that.

565
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,640
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.

566
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,439
Sort of now. What did she...?

567
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:15,439
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.

568
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,199
Where to? To the centre of the sun.

569
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,799
It shouldn't be hot.

570
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,520
I mean, we sent her there at night
and everything. You killed her.

571
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,560
Yes.

572
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,359
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.

573
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,720
Say something to her. What do want
me to do? She's been through enough.

574
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,400
It's really creeping me out.
All right!

575
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,480
Owen, don't be selfish about this.

576
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,160
All right!

577
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,319
When did you have this...
I don't know...ability?

578
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,640
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?

579
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,039
A lot of it was noise. Emotions.

580
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,599
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?

581
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,919
The rest was none of my business.
No. It wasn't.

582
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,600
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.

583
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,999
We can't really take the
moral high ground over this.

584
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:25,519
This thing between me and Owen, it...

585
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,600
No, Gwen.

586
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,040
What I did was an invasion.

587
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,079
I wasn't in control, I realise
that now. But even so, I can't...

588
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,640
I have to live with this.

589
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,119
Not what I heard,
but what I did to you.

590
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,400
And my betrayal? What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.

591
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,039
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop. But I won't.
What does that say about me?

592
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,560
I'm not really in a
position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.

593
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,999
Neither am I.

594
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,799
Don't let this...

595
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:09,159
It doesn't matter. Sorry, forget it.
What?

596
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:14,600
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days,
you've had a look about you.

597
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,560
Love suited you.

598
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,719
It's funny.

599
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,479
Such a small thing.

600
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:37,600
It could be the most powerful piece
of technology we've ever found.

601
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,920
It could tear down governments,
wipe out armies.

602
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:51,240
What do we do with it?

603
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:53,999
Your call.

604
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:00,319
It's a curse.

605
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:14,400
Why couldn't I read your mind?

606
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,360
I don't know.

607
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,559
Though I could feel you
scrabbling around in there.

608
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,280
I got nothing.

609
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,040
It's like you were...

610
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,159
I don't know...dead.

611
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,039
I want that list for UNIT
on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...

612
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,119
What do bosses do in
situations like these?

613
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,160
Y'know, regular bosses.

614
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,360
Can I get to beat people?

615
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,399
We've got rules for that!

616
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:52,839
Red tape.

617
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:56,879
Jack...

618
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,279
Something Mary said...

619
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,399
Probably the only honest
thing she ever did say.

620
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,760
I asked her why she gave it to me.

621
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,399
And she said,
"After a while it gets to you.

622
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,160
"It changes how you see people."

623
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:24,960
How can I live with it?

624
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,359
There are some things we're
not supposed to know.

625
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,159
You got a snapshot -

626
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,800
nothing more.

627
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,280
I don't mean
about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.

628
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,879
I mean... The whole world...

629
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:48,999
It doesn't matter.

630
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:46,840
Now these people are paying the
price, ripped apart

631
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,159
with your name written
in their own blood.

632
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,519
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.

633
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:57,520
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.

634
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,999
There's got to be a
link between the victims.

635
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:03,600
Find the link, find the killer.

636
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,759
It's time Suzie came back. We've
been talking to the wrong corpse.
