1
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,669
Okay,
so cool ideas.

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,233
We've got
leather jacket.

3
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,767
- That's good for the image.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,439
- Where's yours?
- It's on my chair.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,277
All right, uh...

6
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,806
you could put a cigarette
behind your ear, or a pencil.

7
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,375
No.
What else do you got?

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
Um... you could have
a bit of hay coming out

9
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,181
of your mouth...
a little bit of hay.

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,249
- All the time?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,851
To look cool,
just sort of...

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,295
Hey, how's it going?
Hey, man.

13
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,497
All right, question mark
on that one.

14
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,503
So, good news anyway. We've got a winner
for the fan competition.

15
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
- Mel?
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

16
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,302
'Cause there was probably
only one entry.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,069
- No, there was hundreds, actually.
- Really?

18
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,804
Yep.
They're all from Mel.

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,368
- And one from Jemaine.
- Right.

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,380
- But he was disqualified.
- Disqualified?

21
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,109
- Yep.
- Why was I disqualified?

22
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,878
Because you can't
be a fan of the band.

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,943
- Why?
- It's not a good look.

24
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,977
- But I'm a fan.
- Yeah, but people look at the fan list

25
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,513
and they say "Oh, hang on, that guy's
in the band, isn't he?

26
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,219
Well, he likes himself."

27
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,193
It's not a good look.
You don't see Bret on the fan list.

28
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,560
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
I'm not a fan of the band.

29
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,861
I'm more a fan
of popular bands

30
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,491
like the Bee Gees,
Pearl Jam.

31
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,059
All right. That's what we're
trying to do is become popular.

32
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,833
That's why I've got
this competition, you know?

33
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,397
- All right, what did Mel win?
- First prize...

34
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,568
the chance to cook
for you two tomorrow night.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,841
That's a terrible prize.
I'm glad I didn't win that.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,940
It's a good prize.
And you're excited about it.

37
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,042
I've already e-mailed her
pretending to be you

38
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,916
saying you're excited.

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,478
Were you pretending
to be me as well?

40
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,854
Yes, that's what I do.
It's... it's easier.

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,291
All right? Actually,
next time you see Mel,

42
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,420
you might want to apologize
for your last e-mail.

43
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
Okay. Why?

44
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,958
It's just, I think
she was quite insulted.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,524
- All right?
- What did you say?

46
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,559
We'd better go, okay?

47
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,071
We've got a gig, guys.
Come on.

48
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,404
Hey, watch your step there.

49
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,240
Stick together.
It's really busy here tonight.

50
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,745
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Mel.

51
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,713
Oh my God, I'm so
excited about dinner.

52
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,376
Whoo! Yes!
Hey, Bret, that e-mail...

53
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,442
Bonjour,
lay ho, salaam, nabadeey,

54
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,478
konnichiwa, and hola.

55
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,186
Welcome to
Tuesday World Music Jam.

56
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,818
My baby, come on,
let's hear it!

57
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,058
World Music Jam?
We don't play world music. Do we?

58
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,793
Yes. Where's
New Zealand from

59
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,494
if it's not from the world?

60
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,526
- Come on.
- But before Wu-Ta,

61
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,232
let's bring on
Lisa Valenzuela from Mexico.

62
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,764
Let's hear it for Lisa.

63
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,401
There's a lot
of hot women here.

64
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,969
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,073
Look at those two.

66
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,584
Whoa.
Whew.

67
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,587
I just want to...
I just want to...

68
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,488
# Just want to do
something special #

69
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,287
# For all the ladies #

70
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,850
# In the world #

71
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,089
# Oh, yes #

72
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,994
- # Just want to do something special #
- # Ah! #

73
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,469
# For all the ladies
in the world #

74
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,994
# Is that possible? #

75
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,802
# And the girl #

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,331
- # Don't forget that girl #
- # Caribbean #

77
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,867
- # Lady #

78
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,039
- # Lady #

79
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,879
- # Lady #

00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,322
- # Lady #

85
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,957

00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,524
- # Hard workin' lady #

87
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,128

88
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,695
# Lady-man lady #

89
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,539
# All you sexy hermaphrodite
lady-man ladies #

90
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,544
# Your sexy lady bits #

91
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,273
# And your sexy
man bits too #

92
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,510
# Even you must be
into you-ooh-ooh #

93
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,075
# All the ladies
in the world #

94
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,643
# I want to get
next to you #

95
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,053
# Show you
some gratitude #

96
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,617
- # By making love to you #
- # It's the least we can do #

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,151
# If every soldier
in the world #

98
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,597
# Put down his weapon
and picked up a woman #

99
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,364
# What a peaceful world
this world would be #

100
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,432
# Redheads not warheads #

101
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,999
# Blondes not bombs #

102
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,412
# We're talking about
brunettes not fighter jets #

103
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,142
# Oh-ho-ho,
it's got to be #

104
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,707
# Sweet 16s
not M-16s #

105
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,186
# When will
the governments realize #

106
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,190
# It's got to be
funky sexy ladies? #

107
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,556
# I have a vision
and all I can see #

108
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,720
# Is all of you
with all of me #

109
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,356
# In a world
of peace and harmony #

110
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,593
# Where every lady gets
a little piece of Bretty #

111
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,101
# I've been to Paris,
Wellington and Amsterdam #

112
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,661
# And a wham-bam, merci, danke,
thank you, ma'am #

113
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,299
# I don't care if you're ugly or
you're skanky or you're small #

114
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,571
# Just want to do a little
something special for you all #

115
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,135
# All the ladies #

116
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,046
# In the world #

117
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,277
# You deserve it #

118
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,344
# Girls. #

119
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,162
That's Inca Son.
Inca Son!

120
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,727
All right, there they are.

121
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,238
There they are.

122
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,264
Wow, okay, now let's see.

123
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,832
Something completely
different here.

124
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,571
They're from New Zealand.

125
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,908
We have...

126
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,675
The Flute of the Commodores.
Come on up, guys.

127
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,275
Come on up.

128
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,554
# A, B... #

129
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,223
- # A #
- # A #

130
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,459
# D, G, G, G #

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,866
- # G, G, G #
- # G... #

132
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,103
- # Who likes to rock the party? #
- # I like to rock the party #

133
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,477
- # Who likes to rock the party? #
- # I like to rock the party #

134
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,709
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

135
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,741
# Um-tss, um-tss #

136
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,252
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

137
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,186
# I like to rock
the party #

138
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,417
- # Who likes to rock the party? #
- # I like to rock... #

139
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,187
Okay! Flight of the Conchords.
Flight of the Conchords.

140
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,695
Thank you very much.
We're Flight of the Conchords.

141
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,560
It's been a delightful night.
Thank you very much.

142
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,824
Hey, guys.
Really good.

143
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,098
Different start to the song.

144
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,162
- What were you doing there?
- No, it's the same.

145
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,368
Oh, okay. So... # Ding ding ding
dong dong ding... #

146
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,933
- Well, we were tuning.
- Oh, okay.

147
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,172
That was good.
Okay, so here you are.

148
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,544
- I bought you guys a beer.
- I don't even drink beer.

149
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,674
- I don't drink it either.
- Just drink it, will you?

150
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,981
- It's good for the rock 'n' roll image.
- No, I prefer water.

151
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,486
- Hey, guys.
- Hang on, Mel.

152
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,386
Bret, I know you don't
like it, but we need it...

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,687
- It tastes disgusting.
- Just drink it. Good for the image.

154
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,023
I do things for my image...
make it more rock 'n' roll

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,687
with the goatee
and everything.

156
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,822
I don't like this goatee.
I hate it.

157
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,855
Makes you look like
a goat, doesn't it?

158
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,063
Yeah, exactly. But you've gotta make
sacrifices for success.

159
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,762
Okay? Go on,
just have a sip.

160
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,434
All right.

161
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,901
There we go.
You look cool!

162
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,674
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah.

163
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,782
That's it. Yeah.
See, Jemaine's got it.

164
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,342
Think about
something happy.

165
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,149
I need to go
to the toilet.

166
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,989
What if I go like...
what if I do

167
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,719
- some sort of thing like this?
- I like that.

168
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,693
That's over the top.

169
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,194
- Is it?
- Yeah.

170
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,925
Hey, Jemaine, those girls
are looking over at us.

171
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,935
Do you think they
might be looking at me?

172
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,368
They're looking
at all of us!

173
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,429
Tell you what, maybe if I pretend
to go to the toilet,

174
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,168
you guys see if
they're looking at me.

175
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,005
- Okay?
- Yep.

176
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,711
No, they're not
looking at me!

177
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,774
I might actually go to the toilet now
that I'm over here!

178
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,786
- Okay. Okay
- Okay, cool.

179
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,253
For the dinner that I won,
I was wondering

180
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,347
if you liked
arugula or romaine lettuce.

181
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,086
Hey. Hey, we were
at your show earlier.

182
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,321
- Hey.
- I really like that one you did

183
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,354
- about how you liked to rock the party.
- Oh, yes.

184
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,423
- I like to rock the party.
- Oh!

185
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,992
You must have been really
wasted when you wrote that.

186
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,901
- No.
- Do you mean on drugs?

187
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,634
Oh, yes, we were tripping

188
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,266
- when we wrote that one, that's right.
- Oh.

189
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,174
We were totally
whacked off.

190
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,543
- What?
- Whacked off?

191
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,777
Uh, that's just a drug term
we use back in New Zealand

192
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,684
when we're out of it. We say "Oh, man,
I was whacked off...

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,312
- Cool.
...last night."

194
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,550
Hello.
I'm Murray Hewitt.

195
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,114
I manage the guys.

196
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,821
Well, it was really
great to talk to you guys!

197
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,626
- Whoa.
- A fan of ours.

198
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,257
Hey, do you want
to join the fan list?

199
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,825
Here we are. Here's a card
with our website on.

200
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,894
And you can get online
and e-mail the guys

201
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,462
and they'll
reply to you.

202
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,474
- All right, see you guys later.
- Okay, see you.

203
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,739
- All right.
- You are a real rock 'n' roll band.

204
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,811
- Good night.
- Bye.

205
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,577
Well, how about that, eh?

206
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,917
A real rock 'n' roll band.

207
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,549
- That'll be the beer, you see?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,218
Yeah, my goatee probably
would've helped as well.

209
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,126
- I think it was more the beer.
- They weren't looking at your goatee.

210
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,754
Yes they were.
One of them was.

211
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,662
It's all part of the image.
This is working well.

212
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,223
Just need to
build on it now.

213
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,603
Dave, we need to borrow
some of your cool clothes.

214
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,532
You want to
borrow my clothes?

215
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,169
Yeah, I need
something that's cool

216
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,803
but also sexy.

217
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,644
Oh, I got just the thing.
I got a shirt that's got a mouse

218
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,210
having sex with another
mouse in a mousetrap.

219
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,585
I score chicks in this
shirt all the time.

220
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,522
Let me find it.

221
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,821
It must be
in here somewhere.

222
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,520
Here it is.

223
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,586
There you go.

224
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,222
Huh?

225
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,994
- Yeah...
- No no, I guarantee you,

226
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,593
I was just pumping away
in this thing the other night.

227
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,763
- Okay.
- Will that definitely work?

228
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,773
Oh, for sure.

229
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,331
- Really?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,309
Uh, I was hoping to dress
something like Prince.

231
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,335
Kind of erogenous, huh?

232
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,903
Yeah, but toned
down a bit, like,

233
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,415
Prince if he was just going to the zoo
or the supermarket.

234
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,384
- Casual Prince?
- Casual Prince.

235
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,976
Hang on a sec.

236
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,954
Shh!

237
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,126
Jesus!

238
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,360
Sorry guys.
My roommate's...

239
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,061
being kind of a jerk.

240
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,694
But look,
I got you this.

241
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,261
Is that
a woman's blouse?

242
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,239
- No.
- Looks like a blouse.

243
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,002
No no no. This is what you're
looking for, man.

244
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,566
That's totally Prince.

245
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,271
And if you accessorize
with these belts...

246
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,075
I brought two, depending
on what shoes you wear.

247
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,638
Okay, man, thanks.

248
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,877
Yeah, no problem.
And maybe hide that

249
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,714
on your way out 'cause...

250
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,948
if my roommate sees...
I mean, she is crazy.

251
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,013
She thinks she's my mom.

252
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,048
That is your mom.

253
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,492
Dude, you think
I live with my parents?

254
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,553
- Oh, is that your dad, though?
- No.

255
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,293
That's just some old,
crotchety Indian couple

256
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,198
that I sublet to.

257
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,260
The weird thing is
they look like me.

258
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,100
They've got
photos of themselves

259
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,606
with you as a kid.

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,665
I know.

261
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,404
It's creepy.

262
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,469
I think they make them
on the computer.

263
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,245
See? Now I just
reply as you, Bret.

264
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,017
"That sounds great."

265
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,128
And she'll just reply
in a couple of minutes.

266
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,722
And look at this.

267
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,790
That's... that's our bedroom.

268
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,428
Yep. That's a live
webcam from your bedroom.

269
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,098
- What?
- Fan base loves it.

270
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,300
Actually, Jemaine,
I've had a really good response

271
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,502
from something that happened with you
when you were alone with the webcam.

272
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,136
Do you know what
that would be?

273
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,113
I didn't know
we had a webcam.

274
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,206
Okay, well, whatever you're doing,
just be careful, all right?

275
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,343
- What are you implying?
- Well, if I had a webcam above my bed,

276
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,183
sometimes I might, you know,
forget it's turned on.

277
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,688
I didn't know
we had a webcam.

278
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,817
I think I might sleep
in the lounge from now on.

279
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,056
Oh, okay. Well, here we go.
There's the lounge.

280
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,725
All right?
Now item three...

281
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,961
the new fans.
We've tripled the fan base.

282
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,730
So we need two new
t-shirts made up.

283
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,500
Who wants to
take care of that?

284
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,063
You?

285
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,736
Okay, good.
I was hoping for that.

286
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,575
Murray, t-shirts.

287
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,103
All right,
that's everything.

288
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,878
Oh, and you've got dinner with
Mel tonight, so don't forget.

289
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,441
We can't go tonight.

290
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,010
What do you mean
you can't go, Jemaine?

291
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,352
We've got a double date with those
new fans... Summer and Rain.

292
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,380
You can't cancel it.
It's the competition.

293
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,290
She's cooking
your favorites.

294
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,022
Scrambled eggs
for you, Bret.

295
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,962
- And anything for you, Jemaine.
- Really?

296
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,022
- Hmm.
- Yes!

297
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,261
You can't just neglect
your old fans like that.

298
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,769
What happens when
the new fans fly the coop?

299
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,431
You'll end up like
ZZ Top.

300
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,440
- What are you talking about?
- You know, ZZ Top.

301
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,169
- Yeah?
- They sang the song about the... the...

302
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,404
the woman with the legs.

303
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,276
Anyway, they grew big beards,

304
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,837
their old fans
didn't like it.

305
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,679
The new fans didn't
like them without the beards,

306
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,880
and then they had a do-we-have-a-beard-
or-not situation.

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,717
- Is this relevant?
- Yes!

308
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,484
You have to go
to the dinner, Jemaine.

309
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,828
Mmm.

310
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,456
Mel, these scrambled eggs
are terrific.

311
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,830
Thank you, Bret.

312
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,768
Yeah, thanks for the food.
It's really nice.

313
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,362
Thank you.

314
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,872
Um, what was
your name again?

315
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,307
- It's Rain.
- Oh.

316
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,311
That's nice, like...
kind of like bad weather.

317
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,313
I remember your name
from the fan list.

318
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,975
I check it regularly.
Do you check it regularly?

319
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,541
- No.
- No.

320
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,416
Do you not have
a computer, or...

321
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,353
- No, I do have a computer.
- Oh, you can't read.

322
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,653
Isn't it great having
all the fans together?

323
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,283
- Yes.
- Isn't this...

324
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,159
isn't this good, and...
scrambled eggs.

325
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,221
Yeah.
Hey, by the way,

326
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,129
it was really great
to win the prize

327
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,726
to have dinner with just
the two of you tonight.

328
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,203
- Mmm.
- Con... congratulations.

329
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,933
Mmm. Well done.

330
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,804
So, who's the old dude
in the photo with you?

331
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,203
That's my husband Doug.

332
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,477
Oh, I thought
he was your dad.

333
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,110
He's a little bit
older than me.

334
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,915
- Yeah.
- He was my college professor.

335
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,445
I remember seeing him
on the first day of college.

336
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,116
He was so dapper

337
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,921
and so knowledgeable.

338
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,622
And I just had
to have him.

339
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,256
He resisted for a while
and there were some legal...

340
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,822
boundaries, you know,

341
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,496
keeping me from
being near him or...

342
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,869
his family, but...

343
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,238
in the end,
love overcame.

344
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,970
And I got what I wanted.

345
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,470
I always get what I want.

346
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,483
Hey, Mel, do you
have any beer?

347
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,986
- Oh, yeah, I'd like a beer.
- Yeah.

348
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,818
Mmm, that would be great.

349
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,290
- But you don't drink beer, Bret.
- I drink it all the time.

350
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,792
I could drink
a whole glass of beer.

351
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,591
I thought it always
made you go to the toilet.

352
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,660
No. Nope.

353
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,294
I'll have a big,
delicious beer.

354
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,531
Excuse me.
I'll get your beers.

355
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,905
Have a gallon...
have a gallon of it.

356
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,274
- Hey, guys, watch this.
- Oh, yeah.

357
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,618
- Great.
- Thanks, Mel.

358
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,527
- Thank you, Mel.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,589
- There's your beer.
- Yum!

360
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,760
Yum!
That's good. Wow.

361
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,797
I just need to go to
the toilet. Excuse me.

362
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,749
Oh. Oh, hi, Doug.

363
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,380
Oh, hey, Bret.

364
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,186
Are you gonna
come up for dinner?

365
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,921
Uh, no. This is
Mel's special day.

366
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,657
Besides, I'm...
I'm happy down here.

367
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,222
- You sure you don't want to come up...
- Yeah yeah.

368
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,996
Yeah, I got
a lot of work to do.

369
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,299
- You know, so...
- Okay.

370
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,238
- See you, Doug.
- Uh, Bret,

371
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,571
don't mention
that you saw me here.

372
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,405
Okay.

373
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,647
Bret! Hey, Bret, can I have a quick
word with you?

374
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,379
Those girls, I don't
trust them, Bret.

375
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,616
They have no interest
in you as musicians.

376
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,180
- They just want to...
- Just want to what?

377
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,590
They want to do it
with you, Bret.

378
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,925
- Sex?
- Yes.

379
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,160
And I know your policy
on sexual relations with fans, Bret.

380
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,792
I've got to go
to the bathroom, Mel.

381
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,963
Bret, I know...

382
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,174
It's just that, Bret,

383
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,409
I just hope that you'll make sure
that they respect your boundaries.

384
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,313
- Thank you, Mel. Okay.
- Yeah.

385
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,942
- Yeah.
- Okay.

386
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,953
Are you okay?
Do you need any help with...

387
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,478
- Uh, can you please leave?
- Oh, you don't need any help?

388
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,856
- L... I'm going to the toilet, yeah.
- Everything's fine with you?

389
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,793
Okay, great.

390
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,808
Jemaine, Mel thinks they're
not interested in the band,

391
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,470
they're interested in sex.

392
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,406
- Sorry we have to run off, Mel.
- That was delicious!

393
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,645
Congratulations on the prize.

394
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,051
Okay, well,
I wish you'd stay.

395
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,218
I made a lot of dessert.

396
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,249
- I made tapioca pudding.
- Bye!

397
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,659
Angel food cake!

398
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,063
So, uh, you guys
want to get whacked off?

399
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,972
- What?
- Yeah.

400
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,771
Whacked off, you know,
do some drugs.

401
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,244
- Mmm.
- Oh.

402
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,474
Yeah, do you guys
want to do some acid?

403
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,379
Um, I have a cold.

404
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,043
- So I won't.
- Yeah.

405
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,916
I've also got the same cold.
It's airborne.

406
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,887
You could just have
a half if you want.

407
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,790
- Yeah...
- I'll just have a half as well.

408
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,522
- Oh, give Jemaine that big half.
- I couldn't have all that.

409
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,086
Uh, no.

410
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,961
I'm... I've just had
a big pasta salad.

411
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,795
I'm full.

412
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,597
Maybe just half
my half again.

413
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,830
- I'll just have a 16th.
- Okay.

414
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,930
A 16th for you.

415
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,871
A 16th for you.

416
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,605
Oh, thank you.
Is that it?

417
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,943
No, that's a dry piece of skin.
You dropped it.

418
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,142
There you go.
Go on.

419
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,679
Lick it!

420
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,327
- Ready, Bret?
- Yeah.

421
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,636
Oh, flub!

422
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,713
# I'm the pretty

423
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,877

# I'm a funky

# You're a flunky

428
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,497
# You're a picture

429
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,267
# I'm a pitcher

430
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,508
# Oh, pretty prince

431
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,173
- # Where's the party now? #
- # I don't know #

432
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,738
# Oh, pretty
prince of parties #

433
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,841
- # Where does water go? #
- # I let it flow #

434
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,579
# Oh, pretty
prince of parties #

435
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,587
- # Can I come to your party? #
- # No #

436
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,612
# Oh, pretty
prince of parties #

437
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,319
- # Where do you get your clothes? #
- # They're made of snow #

438
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,487
# Pretty party clothes
crocheted of snow #

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,336
# I'm the mickey

446
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,443
I'm just gonna
go to the toilet.

447
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,105
I'll see you later.

448
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,684
- Jemaine.
- Hmm?

449
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,585
I'm really
kind of nervous.

450
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,317
How come?

451
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,587
I'm going to suggest
that we have a threesome.

452
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,029
Oh.

453
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,763
I just have to go
and talk to Bret quickly.

454
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,900
- Bret.
- Get out.

455
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,436
- I'm having an acid reflux.
- Bret, you got to go home.

456
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,812
- Why?
- You got to go home.

457
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,409
Because I've been
offered a threesome.

458
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,147
- What about me?
- No, you're not included.

459
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,621
- Go home. Go home.
- Well, I can't just walk out of here.

460
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,318
Just... just make an excuse.

461
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,349
See you later, man.
See you at home.

462
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,294
This doesn't look like Prince.

463
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,162
Well, thanks very much
for a delightful evening,

464
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,861
but unfortunately I've gotta go
'cause I've got a doctor's appointment.

465
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,598
- At night?
- Yeah.

466
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,731
Bret, do you want
to have a threesome?

467
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,836
Oh. Just one second.

468
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,472
Bret, get out.
What are you doing here?

469
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,678
You got it wrong.
They want me in the threesome.

470
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,085
What? That's not a threesome,
that's a foursome.

471
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,055
I don't know.
I've never had a threesome.

472
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,490
I don't want you in my threesome, you
don't know anything about threesomes.

473
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,188
- You ever had a threesome?
- Nearly.

474
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,991
What you mean, nearly?

475
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,897
- I had a twosome.
- Wow. What was that like?

476
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,401
Great. I've done it
several times, man.

477
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,961
- Just one of you there, then one...
- Yeah.

478
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,529
Oh no, I've had a twosome!

479
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,200
- That's just the normal way.
- Yes.

480
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,675
Yeah, I've done that. I've had a one-way
and a two-way.

481
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,111
- This is my chance to have a three-way.
- No, it's my big chance.

482
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,738
- You've got to go, you took too long.
- What?

483
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,544
You snooze, you lose, man.

484
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,074
You're gonna have to go, make an excuse.
Say you got a driving lesson.

485
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,178
- Get out of here.
- I can't believe you.

486
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,254
Uh, I'm sorry
I have to go.

487
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,819
I have a late-night
driving lesson.

488
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,354
- Summer, where's Rain?
- Oh, Rain went home.

489
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,095
She didn't want to be here while we were
all having a threesome.

490
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:54,071
- You, me...
- And Jemaine.

491
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,301
Jemaine, can I have a word
with you in the bathroom?

492
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,138
Is it impolite not to do it

493
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,939
considering she's offered
and it's her place?

494
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,173
No.
Can't do it. No.

495
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,943
- I won't do it.
- What, you're not doing it?

496
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,007
- No way.
- If you're not doing it, I might do it.

497
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,951
- Are you gonna do it?
- Yeah, why not? I'm gonna go for it.

498
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,216
- Okay, let's do it.
- No, don't do it.

499
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,713
- What? Don't do it. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay, let's do it.

500
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,124
I'm not gonna do it if you do it.
Are you doing it?

501
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,422
- You're not doing it?
- No.

502
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,395
- Okay, I won't do it.
- Well, if you're not doing it,

503
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,228
then I think I'm...
yeah, I'm gonna do it.

504
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,962
Yeah, but if you do it and I'm not
there, you're back to a two-way.

505
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,197
Oh, yes, you're right.

506
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,298
I think we should just go in there
and say thank you and then go home.

507
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,933
No, we'll feel
obliged to do it.

508
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,410
Let's just climb out the window
and go home. Come on.

509
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,211
Oh, hi, Summer.

510
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,312
- Hey.
- Bret, what are you doing?

511
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,880
Um... yeah.

512
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,619
- Um...
- Oh, hey.

513
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,492
Again, just want to say thank you
for a delightful evening.

514
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,191
- Thanks for the acids.
- And the offer of the threesome.

515
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,324
- And, um...
- Really wonderful night.

516
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,603
- Okay, Bret.
- Yes.

517
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,272
- Jemaine.
- Yes.

518
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,076
Murray, present.

519
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,208
Now, what happened last night?

520
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,047
The new fans
gave us illegal drugs and

521
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,815
- wanted to have a threesome with us.
- Whoa, really?

522
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,948
- Mmm.
- That's pretty rock 'n' roll.

523
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,617
No, it was very awkward.

524
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,593
We don't want to have sex
with each other in the...

525
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,687
You can't e-mail the fans and tell them
we're have man-man-lady threesomes.

526
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,198
Yeah, it's not... you can't...
you just can't do that, Murray.

527
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,996
Well, look, just
to let you know, all right,

528
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,969
that sort of behavior
is actually the norm.

529
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,664
- It's standard practice.
- What, for the manager

530
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,333
to e-mail the fans and offer them
man-man-lady threesome?

531
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,842
You'll be offered drugs.
You'll have threesomes,

532
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,401
dinners, you know?

533
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,470
You'll end up going
into town in a taxi,

534
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,244
have a couple of drugs,
have dinner, have a threesome,

535
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,807
go home again.

536
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,615
Have a shower,
go out again,

537
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,280
more drugs,

538
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,756
more threesomes...
happens all the time.

539
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,986
- All right? I mean, I'd do it.
- Yeah, we did...

540
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,494
Okay, now look, you've
lost your fan list now.

541
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,929
The two new fans have
dropped out of the gang.

542
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,229
- We still got Mel.
- Nope, she's gone as well.

543
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,791
- She's off the list.
- Really?

544
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,269
- Yes.
- How many fans have we got now?

545
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,966
None. Empty club.

546
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,271
I've put a note here...
no one.

547
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,574
Oh no, here we go.
Perhaps here, Jemaine,

548
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,672
- would you like to join the list?
- Yes.

549
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,273
Yeah? Okay.

550
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,614
What about you, Bret?
Can you join the fan list?

551
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,950
No way.

552
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,456
No, I'm just not a fan
of the band at all.

553
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,520
Hey, Jemaine.

554
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,794
Hmm?

555
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,823
Last night,
did you... look?

556
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,597
We agreed never
to talk about this.

557
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,696
- Yeah, but did you look?
- I didn't look.

558
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,299
- Did you look?
- I had my eyes shut most of the time.

559
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,104
What do you mean
most of the time?

560
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,475
I opened them a little bit
so I could see what I was doing.

561
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,139
Good night, Bret.
Go to sleep.

562
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,670
What were you doing
with that chair?

563
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,546
Oh, yeah yeah.

564
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,108
I took a rest for a while.

565
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,881
You weren't
in the threesome?

566
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,786
No, I was resting.

567
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,723
Actually, me and her both
took a break for a while.

568
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,226
You were just
up there by yourself.

569
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,919
Hello?

570
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,455
Go to sleep. Stop chatting.

571
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,468
- All right, Murray.
- Good night.

572
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,561
- Good night.
- Say good night for me.

573
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,629
Just wave at him.

574
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,733
- Say goodnight to Mel.
- All right.

575
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,744
Good night, Mel.

576
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,510
Good night.
