1
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,310
Well, needless to say,

2
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,335
people are still talking
about me in Barcelona.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,142
I bet they are.

4
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,706
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,877
Good timing.

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,048
All right,
let's get started.

7
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,148
Band meeting, Jemaine.

8
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,658
- Yes.
- Bret?

9
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,353
- Yeah.
- Murray, present.

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,885
- And Todd.
- Present.

11
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,397
Good, very professional.

12
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,332
Murray, who's this guy?

13
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,530
- Eh?
- Who's this guy that's on my chair?

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,094
I'm getting to that,
Jemaine, all right?

15
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,003
That's in the agenda
under Todd.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,564
All right?
Just stop jumping the gun.

17
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,202
You're always trying
to get ahead of things.

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,543
Item one: Todd.
He's the new band member.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,344
Hi.

20
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,010
Okay, item two,

21
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,747
interview
with "Rolling Stones."

22
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,254
Now I wasn't sure
whether that was

23
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,052
the magazine
or the band.

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,082
I've heard from both,
I've got a no from the band...

25
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,753
Murray, what do you mean
new band member?

26
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,421
Well, that's item one.

27
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,556
What are you talking about, Bret?
We're on to item two now,

28
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,623
"interview confusion."
Do you want me to go back to item one?

29
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,568
- Yeah, go back to item one.
- Yeah? Okay.

30
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,440
Item one: Todd.

31
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,137
- Yeah, he's the new band member.
- Hi.

32
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,975
- Hi.
- Right. Item two...

33
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,742
I didn't know we were looking
for a new band member.

34
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,114
Well, we weren't, Bret.
But then I just found one.

35
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,676
Todd, just show them what you showed
me yesterday at the dentist.

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,847
Sure.

37
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,322
Whoa!

38
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,927
Even better than yesterday.
You could see all the details

39
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,633
when your fingers
bounce off the skins.

40
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,608
Pigskin, is it?
Really good.

41
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,338
I'll just tell you
straight up

42
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,438
that all I'm really interested
in is kicking some grooves,

43
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,278
banging some tunes,

44
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,784
I don't know,
just basically getting it on.

45
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,719
Let me just
get that down.

46
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,381
- Getting down.
- Murray.

47
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,515
Can we have a private
band meeting, please?

48
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,786
Private band meeting?

49
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,488
Yeah, can we go somewhere else
and have a private band meeting?

50
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,326
Okay, all right, sure.

51
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,326
Come on, Todd, we're having
a private band meeting.

52
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,700
No, I mean
without Todd.

53
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,106
Murray, what's this?
We turn up and there's

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,835
some other guy
in the band apparently.

55
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,935
- Yeah, what?
- You know, we've got to discuss it.

56
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,345
This is a decision
I made as a band manager, all right?

57
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,316
You guys have got to
trust me sometimes.

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,215
- Sometimes I have good ideas.
- When?

59
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,312
Like that time I saw you
for the first time onstage.

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,380
I said "Face the front,"
and you did.

61
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,153
We've never looked back
since, have we?

62
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,161
- Still not sure about that.
- You've got to go in there

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,789
and you've got to tell Todd
he's not in the band.

64
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,661
It's too late,
Jemaine, all right?

65
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,223
I think I promised him.

66
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,258
I'd just been given
nitrous oxide.

67
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,635
I was at the dentist.
I didn't know what I was talking about.

68
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,469
I think I'm going
to his brother's wedding.

69
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,203
All I want you guys to do is just give
him a chance, all right?

70
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,212
- He knows his stuff.
- Murray, we don't need a bongo player.

71
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,111
- Have you seen him on the bongos?
- Yes.

72
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,082
Yeah? Is he any good?

73
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,942
Of course he's good.
He's great!

74
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,113
- Isn't he? Is he?
- He's all right.

75
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,089
- He's okay.
- Yeah, well, you can say that again.

76
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,715
And now there's
three of you in a band.

77
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,727
You're like a proper band.
You're like The Policemen.

78
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,093
Yeah, but you can't add members
to our band willy-nilly.

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,655
Look, guys, I had to.
No one else was gonna do it.

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,725
You guys weren't gonna come up with
that idea, were you?

81
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,737
Murray, I'm on a...

82
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,363
call here with
the Secretary of State.

83
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,930
Could you... how much
longer are you gonna be?

84
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,172
Oh, not much longer, Greg.
Sorry. Okay?

85
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,305
Look, all I want you to do
is give Todd a chance.

86
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,640
- Like the song.
- Which song?

87
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,208
The John Lennon one,
you know.

88
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,448
- "Give Peace a Chance."
- Give Pete a Chance.

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,978
Okay?

90
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,253
- Peace.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,073
Good, well...

92
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,578
- Wow.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,876
But, um, not every song

94
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,381
should end
with a bongo solo.

95
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,180
- Sure, no problem.
- Is that cool?

96
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,451
- Maybe he could...
- Maybe just a little solo...

97
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,152
- You could start off with...
...in the middle.

98
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,183
Yeah, and we'll have
a little solo in the middle.

99
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,526
Great.
Hey, you know what?

100
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,155
Can we try a song
that I wrote real quick?

101
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,063
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,398
All you guys'll do,
you'll put your guitars and bass down

103
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,960
and you just
go, "Arf arf!"

104
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,199
In the background,
like dogs.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,105
Like bad dogs.
Arf, arf!

106
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,337
- Mmm, I don't...
- You get to dance and go "Arf, arf"

107
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,073
- while I'm playing. Arf arf.
- I'm not sure about one.

108
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,013
- You don't like dancing?
- I like dancing, I just...

109
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,880
You don't...
you don't like dancing.

110
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,407
- I dance all the time.
- Really?

111
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,386
Yeah, I dance at parties.

112
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,412
I dance when I'm angry.
I dance...

113
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,947
When you're angry?
Who dances when they're angry?

114
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,084
I guess that's about it.

115
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,616
I've never seen you dance
when you're angry.

116
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,788
Guys! Focus, guys.

117
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,798
Well, I dance often.

118
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,663
Let's kick into this one.
Am I right?

119
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,168
Arf, arf!

120
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,931
Uh, the thing is,

121
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,666
uh, we've been
practicing for 56 minutes and...

122
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,698
that's how long
we practice for.

123
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,007
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Mel.

124
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,139
Whoa-ho!
What are the chances?

125
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,649
We're always
bumping into each other.

126
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,378
About one in one.

127
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,318
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

128
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,480
My name's Mel.
I don't think we've met.

129
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,716
- I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.
- Todd's a new band member.

130
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,191
- What?
- I'm the third Conchord.

131
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,693
- Yeah.
- But...

132
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,719
- why would you even have that...
- Oh!

133
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,754
- You're the fan, right?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,130
Murray told me
all about you.

135
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,795
Actually, he, um, neglected to tell me
what a hottie you are.

136
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,532
Stop it.

137
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,063
Looks like the race is on.

138
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,202
Gentlemen, start
your engines.

139
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,734
Vroom!

140
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,576
- Vroom!
- Oh my God.

141
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,548
Am I right?

142
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,752
What do you play, Todd?

143
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,310
I'll give you a clue.

144
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,587
- The bongos.
- Oh!

145
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,216
Rhythmic.

146
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,988
- Yeah, tribal.
- Powerful.

147
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,518
Very physical,
if you know what I mean.

148
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,258
Oh, I know what
you mean, Todd.

149
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,391
We got to go.
Good to see you.

150
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,231
- Oh, all right, bye.
- See you later, Mel.

151
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,793
Bye, guys.

152
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,032
Sweet dreams, baby.

153
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,174
So what's she like?

154
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,147
She's a maniac.

155
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,945
In the sack?
Really?

156
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,281
No. What?

157
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,751
You guys have both
done her, right?

158
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,947
Oh, no.

159
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,785
Oh, I thought you had
a threesome with her.

160
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,552
No, she's just a fan.

161
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,115
Never had
a threesome with her.

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,355
Well, if you two homo sapiens
aren't gonna make the move,

163
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,090
guess what?
I'm gonna.

164
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,654
I'm definitely
gonna do it with her.

165
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,393
Oh no,
she's married.

166
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,028
Who cares?
I'm a bongo player in a band.

167
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,730
She's hot to trot.

168
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,762
I'm gonna make it happen.
I'm gonna give it to her.

169
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,741
Am I right? Damn.

170
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,868
Hey, am I right?

171
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,572
- I don't know.
- Am I right?

172
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,479
- Possibly.
- Possibly? I'm right.

173
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,269
- Well, he did all right.
- Was like a 10-minute solo.

174
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,213
- I know!
- He's the new guy in the band.

175
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,772
Wow, amazing.

176
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,910
What a gig. I declare this
the best Conchords gig ever.

177
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,580
Murray, you have to fire Todd.

178
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,714
Fire Todd?! Keep your voice down.
What do you mean?

179
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,554
He might hear you. He's the best thing
that's happened to this band.

180
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,653
- Why do you want to get rid of him?
- Bret, tell him.

181
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,926
- He's not cool.
- Yes, Bret's right.

182
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,399
He's not cool like us.
We're cool.

183
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,901
He's way cool!

184
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,596
He's cooler than
both of you put together.

185
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,629
Go! Go! Go! Go!

186
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,198
Look at him with all his friends.
They follow him.

187
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,768
He's like
the Pied Piper of cool.

188
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,871
Pied Piper was a good
musician, wasn't he?

189
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,905
- He was cool
- He wasn't cool.

190
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,646
- Yes, he was.
- He took all those kids into a cave.

191
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,551
No, before that phase,
when just the rats followed him...

192
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,284
Listen, the Pied Piper's
not cool and Todd's not cool.

193
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,554
- Hey, guys.
- What's up?

194
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,060
I thought that went
pretty well, huh?

195
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,790
Yeah, went... went okay.

196
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,354
There was maybe
one problem though.

197
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,889
- And that is, uh...
- Your solos were too long?

198
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,595
No no no,
the band name is too long.

199
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,596
You have the too long
part right,

200
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,231
but it's not my solo.
It's the band name.

201
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,242
What is it?
Flight of the Con...

202
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,870
- Con... Conchords...
- Blah blah blah.

203
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,937
Too long, too boring.

204
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,675
We need something
that'll stick.

205
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,182
I think I got it.

206
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,685
Get ready...
The Crazy Dogggz.

207
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,552
Three Gs and a Z.

208
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,114
I like it. You guys are crazy,
you're like dogs.

209
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,092
We're like,
yeah, crazy dogs.

210
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,220
- We all are. Including you.
- Me?

211
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,786
- Yeah yeah.
- Oh, I don't know, but...

212
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,162
- Yeah, oh, I know.
- Yeah? Awesome.

213
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,463
- Can I get you a drink, Todd?
- I'd love one.

214
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,129
I don't want that drink,
but I'll take a drink.

215
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,637
- Yeah, love a drink.
- Yeah?

216
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,634
Okay, I'm just gonna
go over there and say,

217
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,203
"Dear Todd,
thank you very much,

218
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,942
but you can't be
in the band anymore."

219
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,677
Mmm. I don't think
you should do it, man.

220
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,912
You're too easily offended.

221
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,944
I can't believe
you just said that.

222
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,615
Look, I'm gonna do it.

223
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,555
All right, yeah,
you better do it.

224
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,959
"Dear Todd."
Make sure you say "Dear Todd."

225
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,118
Hey, how'd it go?

226
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,096
Bad. Bad.

227
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,122
I told him he was fired,
he pushed me.

228
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,724
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

229
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,497
Then he said that
you should be fired

230
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,060
because you're the one
holding us back.

231
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,868
- That's what he said.
- What'd you say to that?

232
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,534
Well, I hit him.
You know, he can't say that.

233
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,601
- You hit him?
- Yeah, I hit him. Hit him in the face.

234
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,113
- In the face?
- Yeah, hit... hit him right in the face.

235
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,546
- Wow.
- Yeah,

236
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,174
I'm not gonna let him
talk about you like that.

237
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,844
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,375
Well, we got rid of him.

239
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,114
Mmm.

240
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,818
What do you mean, "Mmm"?

241
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,295
- I mean... no.
- What? Is he fired or not?

242
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,661
Well, you see,
while I had him in a headlock,

243
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,633
he sort of explained why he thought
you shouldn't be in the band.

244
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,659
And after a while
it kind of made sense.

245
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,534
You were only over there
for like 20 seconds.

246
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,698
Yeah, after about 20 seconds
it kind of made sense.

247
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,436
It's hard to fire a guy
who's in a headlock.

248
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,343
It's easy for me to fire you, Bret,
because you're my friend.

249
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,371
- So what are you saying?
- You're fired, Bret.

250
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,680
- I'm fired?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,777
- But you can't do that...
- Listen, we'll talk about it later.

252
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,447
I've gotta go
to band practice now.

253
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,046
Todd's very strict.

254
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,025
Flup!

255
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,288
Okay, man. More enthusiasm
this time, all right?

256
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,295
- It's "The Doggy Bounce."
- Todd, how about you

257
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,162
get down on all fours and wag
your tail like you just can't fail

258
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,133
and I'll just play
bass, huh?

259
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,897
What?
It's "The Doggy Bounce."

260
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,426
You have to do
"The Doggy Bounce" bounce.

261
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,938
It's a phenomena.

262
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,963
Okay? Now, let's
count this shit off.

263
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,171
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

264
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,076
# Arf arf #

265
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,173
- # Do the doggy bounce #
- # Arf arf #

266
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,309
# You know
you want to do it #

267
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,909
- # Arf arf... #
- Don't point at me.

268
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,184
Stop stop stop stop.
Bret, what are you doing?

269
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,123
There is no guitar
in this song, all right?

270
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,058
There's no guitar, okay?

271
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,357
- Not just a little bit, or...
- No, not even a little bit.

272
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,456
None at all.
All right?

273
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,730
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

274
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,966
# Arf arf,
do the doggy bounce #

275
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,996
# Arf arf... #

276
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,975
Hold on, hold on.

277
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,273
Bret, what are you doing?

278
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,075
I'm not Gloria Estefan,
all right?

279
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,808
One percussionist is fine,
all right?

280
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,282
- So don't do that.
- Okay.

281
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,182
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sure.

282
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,887
Todd, I don't like
this kind of music.

283
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,049
Oh, you don't like
this kind of music?

284
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,956
- I didn't know that.
- It's stupid dance music.

285
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,257
It's not about the music.
You know what it's about?

286
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,354
# The pussy! #

287
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,831
- Am I right?
- Yeah, obviously you're right, yeah.

288
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,767
- So why do you care about the music?
- Well...

289
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,394
Do you guys need
to borrow my amp?

290
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,338
Bret, you're pathetic, man.
We don't need a roadie, okay?

291
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,534
- I could carry your bongos.
- My what?

292
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,135
No one's touching my bongos.
You know that.

293
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,408
Do you need someone to carry
your guitar, Jemaine?

294
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,473
Well, I don't really
need you to, Bret.

295
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,677
Okay.

296
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,550
I get it.

297
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,147
Not needed.

298
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,626
You know what? We got to rock out
"The Doggy Bounce" this Saturday night.

299
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,184
- It's not ready.
- It's totally ready.

300
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,889
It's not ready, Todd.

301
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,826
All right, you're right.
Let's get it perfect.

302
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,199
Yeah, let's get it perfect
and then we'll maybe do it another time.

303
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,228
- Yeah, am I right?
- Yes.

304
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,005
Two of you?
But that's going backwards.

305
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,515
I thought we had a proper
three-person band.

306
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,880
That's what you agreed on.

307
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,476
Jemaine and Todd,
they fired me.

308
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,453
So I started a new band.
This is Demetri.

309
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,422
- Hey.
- I met him running.

310
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,617
Look, I don't think
Jemaine can fire you.

311
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,354
They need my authorization,
don't you?

312
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,952
It's too late.

313
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,759
I'm pretty sure you need
my authorization for firing and hiring.

314
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,858
Don't you think?
I mean, what am I doing?

315
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,892
I'll check on that.

316
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,132
"Authorization needed...

317
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,664
Bret kicked out...
question mark."

318
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,136
Okay.

319
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,171
So, Demetri, what exactly
is this thing?

320
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,012
It's a guitboard.

321
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,882
No, man, keytar.
Keytar.

322
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,614
Yeah, he took the wrong
parts of the words.

323
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,485
It's half keyboard
and half guitar.

324
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,388
So is a guitar
or a keyboard?

325
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,588
Exactly.
It's the best of both worlds.

326
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,961
So it starts out as a keyboard
and ends kind of as a guitar.

327
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,829
I don't like it.
It's weird.

328
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,163
It's not the right shape.

329
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,499
- Play him something.
- Sure.

330
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,336
- Could you hold that please?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,370
No, don't like it.

332
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,246
Ugh, no.
Weird.

333
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,051
Oh, that bit's good.

334
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,319
Who's this?

335
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,090
Oh, here we go.
The Fonzies have arrived.

336
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,653
This is Demetri.
This is my new band.

337
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,665
- Good luck.
- Oh great.

338
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,690
Another awkward situation.

339
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,260
So what's your band
going to be called, Bret?

340
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,363
Can't be called Flight of the Conchords,
that's our name.

341
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,034
It's not. It's called the Original
Flight of the Conchords.

342
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,066
You guys can be called
Flight of the Condors, or whatever.

343
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,840
We're gonna be
the Crazy Dogggz.

344
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,278
Shut up, Todd.

345
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,475
Don't tell me to shut up
in front of people.

346
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,111
Well, don't say what out name's gonna
be. We haven't discussed it.

347
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,485
Okay, Jemaine, Bret.
Can I have a quiet word?

348
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,080
Sure.
Come on, Demetri.

349
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,024
No no, private.

350
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,457
I'm just gonna play
some more.

351
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,093
- Stop talking.
- What do you play, the leather jacket?

352
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,433
I play the bongos, man.

353
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,233
What the hell's
going on, guys?

354
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,933
Why did you fire Bret,
Jemaine?

355
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,772
Well, I was trying to fire Todd
but he did a sad face at me.

356
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,801
I don't know if you
can fire Bret.

357
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,370
You're equal band members. It's got
to come from a higher authority.

358
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,110
- Are you sure?
- Ye... no.

359
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,708
I'll have to check,
but it doesn't sound right.

360
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,651
Yeah, I told him
he couldn't fire me.

361
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,517
What do you care for anyway, Bret?
You're always quitting.

362
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,750
Probably just quit
in half an hour anyway.

363
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,919
- So I've got two bands now.
- Just manage us both.

364
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,394
No, I can't. I'm not even suppose
to manage one band.

365
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,796
I'm suppose to be working
at the New Zealand Consulate, Bret.

366
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,096
Murray, do you think you
could find another cubicle?

367
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,193
Oh, sorry, Greg.
Yeah, all right.

368
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,828
Let's just calm down,
all right?

369
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,566
We shouldn't even be arguing
in front of the map.

370
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,097
- It's not right.
- Yeah, you're right.

371
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,736
You'll be okay, Jemaine.
You've got a good band. You've got Todd.

372
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,678
I just don't know
about your guy, Bret.

373
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,943
- Does he play any other instruments?
- No.

374
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,847
Come on, what?
Is that what you want?

375
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,749
I'm gonna break your keytar.
I'm gonna break your keytar.

376
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,720
You think I care?

377
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,225
# The distant future,
the year 2000 #

378
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,321
# The distant future,
the distant future #

379
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,231
# Arf arf
arf arf #

380
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,132
# Arf arf
arf arf... #

381
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,331
# The humans are dead #

382
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,570
- # The humans are dead #
- # Dead #

383
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,309
# We used poisonous gasses #

384
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,250
# And we poisoned
their asses. #

385
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,313
Whoo! Yeah!

386
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,356
How are the Original Flight
of the Conchords going?

387
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,161
It's going pretty good,
except that he copies my moves.

388
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,997
- What moves?
- My dance moves.

389
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,696
You don't have dance moves.

390
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,671
He also started
copying my look.

391
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,731
- What look?
- You know...

392
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,401
Oh yeah.

393
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,140
How's Flight
of the Conchords going?

394
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,171
Not too bad.

395
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,582
I'm not getting on
that well with Todd.

396
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,110
The band's sounding good, though.
The bongos sound tight.

397
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,214
We're doing a lot better
than you and I were doing.

398
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,257
I mean, Demetri and me
are doing pretty well.

399
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,319
It's probably better
than you and me as well.

400
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,887
- Really?
- Yeah.

401
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,660
Hmm.

402
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,297
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

403
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,701
Thank you. We're the Original
Flight of the Conchords.

404
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,001
Thank you. We're the Original
Flight of the Conchords.

405
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,302
Thanks very much.
You've been a great audience.

406
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,638
You've been a great audience.

407
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,440
Oh hey, guys,

408
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,142
band meetings.
Come on.

409
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,708
Leave those girls alone
there and come over.

410
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,812
- Okay, Bret.
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,483
- Demetri.
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,584
- Jemaine.
- Standing right next to you.

413
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,424
- Todd.
- Present.

414
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,054
Nice.
Good one.

415
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,997
And Murray, present.
Okay.

416
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,000
Went really good tonight.
Really good, you two.

417
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,934
- Thank you.
- And good, you two too.

418
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,837
But I think in the future
I won't put you all on the same night

419
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,602
because you're playing
the same songs, okay?

420
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,373
Actually, Jemaine, what about
that song of Todd's?

421
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,710
- You could do the one about the dogs.
- "The Doggy Bounce."

422
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,739
- Bring that one in. I like that one.
- Arf arf.

423
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,013
- Yeah, it's not ready though.
- You know it's ready.

424
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,486
- When it's ready we'll do it.
- It's ready!

425
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,512
Oh, hey hey hey, guys!

426
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,526
- Chill out!
- It's been ready! It's been ready!

427
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,687
Come on, listen.
Look, shake hands.

428
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,924
We're not having this.
All right?

429
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,955
- He's squeezing my hand a little bit.
- Are you?

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,695
Just my regular handshake.

431
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,295
There's no squeeze there.
What a wuss.

432
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,703
Right, I'm glad
you're all here

433
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,265
because I've got a crazy idea.
It could be big.

434
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,539
But what about if we put
the two bands together

435
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,977
to make one superband?

436
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,481
- A four-man supergroup?
- Yeah.

437
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,710
So we've got
bongos, bass,

438
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,719
guitar and...

439
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,221
- the keytar thing.
- Keytar.

440
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,190
- Todd, what do you think?
- Well, actually, Murray,

441
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,989
um, Demetri and I have been
talking and we...

442
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,087
we think it would be better

443
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,995
if we just go it alone.

444
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,363
- What?
- What?

445
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,697
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

446
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,065
Todd and I are going
to start a group...

447
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,161
our own group without
Bret and Jerome.

448
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,138
We're the Crazy Dogggz.

449
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,300
- Arf.
- Arf. See that?

450
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,244
Are you crazy?
What, the bongos and the keytar?

451
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,076
Todd!

452
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,379
Murray, I... I really appreciate
you giving me a shot

453
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,249
and I just...

454
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,254
I just think
we're more compatible.

455
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,381
I'm flabbergasted.

456
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,892
# Oh yeah #

457
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,025
- # Oh yeah #
- # Doggy bounce #

458
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,003
# I know what's happening #

459
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,066

nothing to it #

460

- Bret!

487
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,807
I don't know why you don't like it.
It's a good song.

488
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,369
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, Mel.

489
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,075
- Mel!
- Mel!

490
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,515
Oh!
Oh hey, guys.

491
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,349
- How's it going?
- Good. You know, just really busy.

492
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,947
Just crazy life...

493
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,255
stuff going on.

494
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,090
Hey, you got one
of the Crazy Dogggz t-shirts.

495
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,993
No.

496
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,529
It says Crazy Dogggz on it.

497
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,501
I've got to go, actually.
I'm pretty late.

498
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,130
- Oh.
- Yeah. It was great seeing you.

499
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,868
Oh... uh... okay.

500
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,001
Hey, Mel, you didn't
make it to our gig the other...

501
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,274
- Oh, yeah.
- There was no one there...

502
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,338
without you there.

503
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,284
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Murray.

504
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,520
Hey, Murray.

505
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,724
Well, sorry I haven't
been in touch.

506
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,232
I've just been so busy,
man, you know?

507
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,234
- How are the Crazy Dogggz?
- They're a phenomenon.

508
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,565
Number one in 24 countries.

509
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,730
- They say hi?
- No.

510
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,297
Have you seen
the music video?

511
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,501
- Yeah.
- Yeah, terrible.

512
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,339
- I helped direct it.
- It was good.

513
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,368
- Know the dog? It was my idea.
- Really?

514
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,540
- It's Toby.
- How was South America?

515
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,574
Oh, awesome.
Really good, thanks. Yeah.

516
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,246
We did one gig...
98,000 people.

517
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,754
That was in Rio.

518
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,724
Then the President of Peru
invited us to like a dinner.

519
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,692
We had parfaits.

520
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,060
I got like a big sun lounger.

521
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,928
Do we have any gigs,
Murray?

522
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,797
Yeah.
Yeah, you've got the library.

523
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,859
They want you back
for the bingo night.

524
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,393
That was good the first time, wasn't it?

525
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,735
Yeah.

526
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,104
Actually that's the same night that
the Crazy Dogggz have got a big gig.

527
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:13,008
- Giant Stadium.
- How giant is it?

528
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,070
That's what it's called... Giant.
So I'm guessing pretty big.

529
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,638
So I'm gonna go there first,
set them up,

530
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,741
and then come back to
the library, help you guys out,

531
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,309
and then probably to and fro
between the library and the stadium.

532
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,151
Yeah, Murray, it seems like you're
spending a lot more time

533
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,622
with the Crazy Dogggz than us.

534
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,124
No, equal time.

535
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,853
Check my schedules,
it's equal.

536
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,259
- Really?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,024
I can't discuss it now
'cause I've got to go.

538
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,655
I've got lunch
with Tori Amos.

539
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,325
Yeah yeah.

540
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,399
Keep practicing, okay?

541
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,638
See ya!

542
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,443
# Oh yeah, arf arf #

543
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,042
# Oh yeah #

544
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,849
# I know what's happening. #
