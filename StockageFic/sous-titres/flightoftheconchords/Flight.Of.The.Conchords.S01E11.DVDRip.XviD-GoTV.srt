1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,965
# Are you feeling
the feeling? #

2
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,874
# Feeling the feeling #

3
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,209
# That I'm feeling #

4
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,408
# That we're feeling. #

5
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,349
Yeah!

6
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,545
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Mel.

7
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,848
- Thanks, Mel.
- Thank you, Murray.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,482
Um, we're Flight
of the Conchords

9
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,684
from New Zealand.

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,920
Ha! New Zealand.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,123
And I just want to say thank you
on behalf of Jemaine and myself...

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,358
- Not...
...for coming out...

13
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,922
- Not me.
- Oh.

14
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,298
Well, just on behalf of myself,
thank you for coming along tonight.

15
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,496
- Good night.
- Yes!

16
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,506
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,204
Looks delicious.

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,212
I thought that went
pretty well.

19
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,679
It was terrible.

20
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,511
It was just the wrong
sort of crowd.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,245
You can't
call that a crowd.

22
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,276
Yeah, three's a crowd.

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,714
- Yeah.
- That was definitely a crowd.

24
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,884
Excuse me, Bret?
Jemaine?

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,587
- Hi.
- I was in the audience.

26
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,595
- Uh, you were the guy with the soup?
- Yes, I was.

27
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,755
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh yeah.

28
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,765
- What was the soup like?
- It was good.

29
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,563
We get some free soup
for doing the gig.

30
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,570
Oh. Hey look,
watching you guys out there,

31
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,299
I was blown away, man.

32
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,569
Your act
is sensational.

33
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,075
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,670
Yeah, I love the attention to detail
with your stage characters.

35
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,772
- Yeah.
- The idea of a pair of naive idiots

36
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,784
from New Zealand...
it's so simple, it's genius.

37
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,786
You just pick an obscure
backwards country

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,220
that nobody knows anything about...
very funny.

39
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,520
Very funny.
So where are you guys from?

40
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,526
The Julliard School
of the Performing Arts?

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,686
We're from New Zealand.

42
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,026
Okay, wh...
New Zealand!

43
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,192
I love New Zealand,
it's... that's great!

44
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,600
That's good information
to find out.

45
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,103
L..."Lord of the Rings,"

46
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,333
Frodo.

47
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,897
The ring.

48
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,776
Anyway, don't let me bore you with
my knowledge of New Zealand.

49
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,441
Here, in case you ever
need my services,

50
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,747
I'm gonna give you my card.
I would love to work with you guys.

51
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,309
What do you do?

52
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,447
I am
a semiprofessional actor.

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,116
Wow.

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,126
Brilliant.
I can't say it enough.

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,390
- Brilliant.
- This says "Dry Cleaners."

56
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,328
The other side.
Written in pencil.

57
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,456
Oh, yup.

58
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,094
I thought you guys
did really well.

59
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,661
Yeah, I thought
it was good.

60
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,071
Maybe you could work
on your crowd work, you know?

61
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,235
Get more of a rapport
with the audience,

62
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,767
get them all clapping.

63
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,711
I tried to talk to a guy
but he told me to shut up

64
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,305
'cause he was reading
the paper.

65
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,475
Oh, you don't disturb people reading
the paper, Jemaine.

66
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,077
Could be big news
he was getting into.

67
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,712
We need to get
bigger audiences.

68
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,450
I know, I thought
this one would be big.

69
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,458
What am I doing wrong?

70
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,119
Maybe it's something
we're doing wrong.

71
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,923
Would it help if
our music was better?

72
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
Possibly, yeah.

73
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,793
It doesn't matter
how good your music is

74
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,800
if no one's there
to hear it.

75
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,234
What about if we give out
some free pencils?

76
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,931
No, you're not in
New Zealand now, Bret.

77
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,769
I know, but we gave
them out, remember that?

78
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,775
We got a box
of 20 pencils...

79
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,174
- Yeah.
...and that night...

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,735
- 20 people.
...20... everyone was there.

81
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,303
I know... I know,
all the bands did it.

82
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,008
This is America.
It's different.

83
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,347
Murray, did you manage
to get us a record deal?

84
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,117
- Probably not, I guess.
- Good guess. Nothing.

85
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,716
Not even a "Thanks for the demo.
We're not interested.

86
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,988
But thanks again
for trying...

87
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,018
every day."

88
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,361
- Say it.
- Cheer up, Murray.

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,960
Cheer up.

90
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,904
# Cheer up, Murray,
don't let it get you down #

91
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,237
# Pick yourself up
off the ground #

92
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,369
# It's gonna be
all right #

93
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,935
# Cheer up, Murray #

94
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,777
# You look
a little sad #

95
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,783
# Your life
ain't so bad #

96
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,082
# Just think of all
the good times #

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,645
# Remember your
33rd birthday? #

98
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,648
# You threw
a great big party #

99
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,821
# And all of your friends
were there for you #

100
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,525
# Jemaine, Greg and me #

101
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,763
# We brought you
a cake in the shape #

102
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,599
# Of a four
and a three #

103
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,436
# 'Cause we all thought
you were 43 #

104
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,970
# You've got a dog #

105
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,979
# He loves you,
Murray #

106
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,708
# It's one hell
of a dog #

107
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,444
# It's an English
bulldog #

108
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,942
# You've got a car,
don't you, Murray? #

109
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,717
# It's an '03 Accord #

110
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,884
# Only one
previous owner #

111
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,722
# And you've got
a job #

112
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,285
# You've got all
of your limbs #

113
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,957
# You've got
a sensitive nose #

114
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,091
# And you do
tai kwan do #

115
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,900
# You're good at matching
your ties to your clothes #

116
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:10,307
# You've got a wife,
though she comes and go-o-oes #

117
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,538
# Some people don't
return your calls #

118
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,708
# They don't
return your calls #

119
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,049
# People will call you
"Ginger Balls" #

120
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,488
# They'll call you
"Ginger Balls" #

121
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,687
# But those people don't
know what they see #

122
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,525
# They just see
Ginger Balls #

123
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,623
# Ginger Balls #

124
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,567
# Cheer up, Murray,
it's time to forget #

125
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,866
# Your wife met
someone on the net #

126
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,874
# Let's go and get
an ice cream #

127
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,036
# Cheer up, Murray,
so nothing goes your way #

128
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,308
# It's the same
every day #

129
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:52,842
# Well, tomorrow is
another day-ay. #

130
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,485
Oh, thanks, guys.

131
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,990
And you organized the soup.
That's good management.

132
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,085
Yeah, how'd you manage to
get us some soup? Huh?

133
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,120
Oh, speaking of which.

134
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,960
We need you guys to
clear out of this room.

135
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,193
The janitor needs
to use the mop sink.

136
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,259
Uh, I'm actually
the manager of the band.

137
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,827
I believe we've got
two soups coming.

138
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,169
We ran out of soup
two hours ago, Marty.

139
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,801
Sorry.

140
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,573
I couldn't even
get that right.

141
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,574
So you have to call up
our manager, Murray,

142
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,587
and pretend you work
for a big record label

143
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,146
and just tell him
to keep on trying.

144
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,522
Yeah, give him a rejection call
to cheer him up.

145
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,186
- Okay.
- He's a little bit sad.

146
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,560
Okay, I get it.
So I just say,

147
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,031
"I heard your stuff, it's not for us,
but keep trying."

148
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,226
- Yeah.
- Okay.

149
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,996
- That's perfect.
- Okay, good.

150
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,697
So tell me a bit more about
this character you want me to create.

151
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,571
- Hmm?
- Who is this record-label guy?

152
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,041
What makes him tick?

153
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,237
It's you pretending
to be someone else.

154
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,870
I see. Okay.

155
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,245
Already I'm getting
a feel for this guy.

156
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,307
Uh, listen,

157
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,717
let me demonstrate a few characters.
You'll see.

158
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,551
This is Stefan,
who is like...

159
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,393
Hey, hello.

160
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,395
I'm Stefan.

161
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,226
Then there's
Big Eddie,

162
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,960
who is this tough,
no-nonsense mobster,

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,763
and he is like this...

164
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,238
Hey, what... what's with
all the commotion?

165
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,069
What's this commotion?

166
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,372
Explain to me
what's with the commotion!

167
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,037
Whoa.

168
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,603
- That's very good.
- Flippin' awesome.

169
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,708
P... probably not right
for this... this though.

170
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,843
- Probably.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,113
Okay, well, I...

172
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,451
I have been working on
a character from New Zealand.

173
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,753
- Okay, what's he like?
- Oh.

174
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,318
Hey, watch out,
you flamin' drongo!

175
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,229
Don't be such
a flamin' bloody drongo!

176
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,460
Could... could you do it
in your normal voice, maybe?

177
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,934
No.

178
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,800
That's not acting.

179
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,499
Well, I think
I like the first one.

180
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,336
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,001
Um...

182
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,011
did we mention that
we really can't pay you...

183
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,910
- Can't pay you.
...at all?

184
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,348
Opportunity is
in itself reward.

185
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,045
And so it begins.

186
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,553
Ding.

187
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,493
Could you guys
leave, please?

188
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,137
New Zealand Consulate,
Murray Hewitt speaking.

189
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,238
Is this Murray Hewitt,
the band manager?

190
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,272
Yes. I'm him.

191
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,149
Murray, this is Stefan
from the record company.

192
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,448
Stefan who?

193
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,478
Stefan... Gucci,

194
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,320
you know, from
the record company.

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,223
Okay, well...

196
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,160
which record company
was that?

197
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,425
You know, the...
the big one.

198
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,092
- Sony?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

199
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,363
- Sony.
- Have you got the demo CD then?

200
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,495
Listen, Murray,
all of us here at, uh...

201
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,438
- Sony?
- Exactly.

202
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,306
Uh, we all think you're doing great work
with the Conchords.

203
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,139
Really super stuff.

204
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,372
Thanks, that's nice to hear.
Thanks, Stefan.

205
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,712
Look, the bad news
though is for...

206
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,718
some very
good reasons,

207
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,947
we can't sign your band
in the short term.

208
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,716
So you're not offering us
a record deal?

209
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,691
No. But...
but you are brilliant.

210
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,920
You are great,
and I love the guys.

211
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,589
Well, if you like us so much, why can't
you just offer us a deal, you know?

212
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,224
You're just not what we're
looking for at the moment, okay?

213
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,565
God.

214
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,164
Please offer us
a record contract.

215
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,674
Please?
I'm begging you.

216
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,438
Come on, please.

217
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,877
Please.

218
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,438
Please give us
a record deal.

219
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,417
Oh, come on.

220
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,554
Okay then.

221
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,793
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

222
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,526
Thank you!

223
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,033
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

224
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,468
Look, we won't let you down.
You won't regret this.

225
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,664
I'm sure I won't.

226
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,842
Gentlemen,
welcome to the restaurant!

227
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,508
Thanks for flying in
from L.A., Mr. Gucci.

228
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,177
That was
extremely quick.

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,345
Well, I flew
in a supersonic jet.

230
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,911
Wow, a supersonic jet.

231
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,684
- How about that, guys?
- Hmm.

232
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,387
It is great to meet you guys
for the first time.

233
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,894
Be polite.

234
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,487
Great to meet you,
Mr. Gucci.

235
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,656
- Mmm.
- "Good to meet you."

236
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,188
- A real pleasure.
- Good, nice.

237
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,167
Shall we have
a seat?

238
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,404
Right.

239
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,430
So, the record deal.

240
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,466
Uh yes.
Mr. Gucci,

241
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,944
sorry but my manager here

242
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,970
has appeared
to have made a mistake.

243
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,142
Yeah, he thinks you've
offered us a record deal.

244
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,549
I think you've offered
us a rejection deal.

245
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,453
No no, he's offered us
a record acceptance deal.

246
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,583
- That's not right, is it?
- No, Murray's absolutely right.

247
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,217
Yes, it was
a rejection call,

248
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,058
but then I turned you round,
didn't I? With my managing.

249
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,393
- Yes.
- Yeah.

250
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,898
He started crying.

251
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,059
Ah. Yeah well,
anyway,

252
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,864
we're here to negotiate
the deal now, aren't we?

253
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,461
- All right?
- Exactly.

254
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,735
Now listen, guys, I don't want to blow
smoke up your ass.

255
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,709
No, not gonna...
do that sort of thing.

256
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,506
We're thinking
a $1-million deal

257
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,605
and we are firm on that, okay?
That's our final offer.

258
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,309
No.

259
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,749
No way.

260
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,582
- Yes.
- No.

261
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,453
Okay, two million.

262
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,390
I thought you said one million was
your final offer?

263
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,451
Two million, but I want
a 90/10 split.

264
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,792
Ah. I see.

265
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,388
Ah. Right.

266
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,990
Well, that's
a terrible deal,

267
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,002
so, sorry, we can't do it.
Oh well.

268
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,436
No no no no,
let's negotiate.

269
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,531
Um, Stefan,

270
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,475
please, what about a...
a flip-around?

271
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,638
I mean, if we could go for
the 90 and you have the 10?

272
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,942
Super.

273
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,211
Whoa. See what
I did there?

274
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,548
Huh? Yes!

275
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,383
Where do we sign?

276
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,753
Uh, well, I don't... I don't think
we should be so hasty...

277
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,087
- We got it.
...here.

278
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,422
- Be hasty.
- No.

279
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,325
I don't... this is
a good deal, you know?

280
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,851
- Yes.
- Is it, though?

281
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,056
- Yes.
- Is it?

282
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,656
- Yes.
- But...

283
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,532
- but is it?
- Yes.

284
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,969
Well, what about for you?
Is it a good deal for you?

285
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,235
Oh, quite frankly, this is
a terrible deal for me.

286
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,003
Do we want to do deals
with people

287
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,806
who do such terrible deals
for themselves?

288
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,971
- I think so.
- Why not?

289
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,377
- Yeah.
- Bret!

290
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,507
Uh... no idea.

291
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,107
Yeah, I see.
We need to make sure

292
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,813
that your record label
has the right ideas for us.

293
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,980
Oh, I've got some
great ideas.

294
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,819
- Name one.
- Lunch boxes.

295
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,689
Great.
Put the band's name on it.

296
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,921
- Yeah?
- Yes yes yes yes yes!

297
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,259
That could work too.

298
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,924
Or... how about this?
How about this?

299
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,059
We make a music video
to coincide

300
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,625
with the 10th anniversary

301
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,398
of "The Lord
of the Rings" trilogy.

302
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,429
Yup.

303
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,072
I know Peter Jackson,

304
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,943
and he was very excited
by this idea.

305
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,244
Well, that would have to
be a "no," though.

306
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,709
All right, look.
Time-out there, all right?

307
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,845
Sorry, Stefan. I'm just gonna have
a word with the guys.

308
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,550
All right?
Come on.

309
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,080
What are you doing?

310
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,752
- I got a little carried away.
- Yeah.

311
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,024
You weren't supposed to
offer him a record deal.

312
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,496
I'm sorry about the deal,
but from an actor's standpoint,

313
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,022
- Oh!
- Jemaine!

314
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,591
Stop annoying him.
Come here.

315
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,604
- Emergency band meeting. Jemaine?
- Yes.

316
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,162
- Bret?
- Mmm.

317
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,800
Murray, present. Now this seems like
a really really good deal.

318
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,639
Yeah? I haven't seen
many music deals.

319
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,645
- Any. You haven't seen any.
- I haven't seen any.

320
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,476
But I know a good percentage
when I see one.

321
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,072
It does seem a little
too good to be true.

322
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,378
It is too good
to be true.

323
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,078
That's why we should
go for it.

324
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,282
- Come on.
- I've done the mathematics in my head.

325
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,256
The percentages
are in our favor.

326
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,690
- There you go.
- Yeah.

327
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,693
- I know.
- I think maybe we should take the deal.

328
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,695
Let's put it
to the vote. Yeah?

329
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,697
- All those in favor say "Aye."
- Hey.

330
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,789
- Aye.
- Aye.

331
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,596
- Nay!
- No, two ayes,

332
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,761
one nay, you're gone.
Motion carried.

333
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,100
We've got it!

334
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,164
Stefan, we'd love to take
the $2-million deal!

335
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,005
- Great!
- What are you doing?

336
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,011
I just got a bit
carried away. I was...

337
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,240
just... Stefan's
so good at it.

338
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,738
Ben. He...

339
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,684
Yeah, but, I mean, Murray,
he's having a good time.

340
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,448
I know it's not real,

341
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,182
but lunch boxes...

342
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,393
Congratulations, man.
That's awesome.

343
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,988
- Way to go.
- Thanks, Dave.

344
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,999
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but it's not real.

345
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,591
- Yeah, it's not real.
- You know?

346
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,001
I mean, what do you
think we should do?

347
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,868
I think you've got to
use honesty here.

348
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,170
I mean, you know,
it's always the best policy.

349
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,869
Like, the other day
there was five...

350
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,208
or maybe there was like four,
really hot foreign chicks,

351
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,510
either like Swedish
or Korean in my shop.

352
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,277
- Wow.
- And they were like, "Dave,

353
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,546
we want to have a five-way with you,"
and I just told them,

354
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,485
honestly, "Okay."

355
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,681
Then I just gave it
to them hard.

356
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,350
That's the best way
to go.

357
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,359
And then after that, they're like,
"Hey, will you marry us?"

358
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,361
And I was like, "Excuse me,
but I don't think

359
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,125
monogamy is legal in this country,
I don't know where you're from."

360
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,132
But you've got to
try honesty.

361
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,724
It works the best.

362
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we should tell him the truth.

363
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,704
We've got to tell him
before this gets out of hand.

364
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,571
Okay, guys,
come on.

365
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,076
Look a bit more
afraid, okay?

366
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,808
Don't be scared of the sand...
the dirt on your feet, Bret.

367
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,816
There's condoms around here.
Used condoms.

368
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,841
Put your feet
down properly.

369
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,854
Okay, so you're scared,
you're huddling together.

370
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,879
Ringwraith is coming.

371
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,552
Get your ring out.

372
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,821
And action!

373
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,261
Okay, Mel?

374
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,821
- Yeah.
- Now you're Arwen, all right?

375
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,196
- Liv Tyler.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,633
Okay, so I want you
to command the water

377
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,399
to do your bidding.
Okay?

378
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,104
L... I can't understand
a word you're saying.

379
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,577
- Articulate, all right?
- It's Elvish. That's Elvish.

380
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,580
- Are you chewing something?
- No, it's Elv...

381
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,081
it's... it's my
native tongue.

382
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,582
- Is it?
- Yup.

383
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,050
All right.

384
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,712
Okay, go.

385
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,050
Yes! That's it!

386
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,187
- Was that it?
- Yup, that's it.

387
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,628
Whoo!

388
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,791
Where are the guys?

389
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,897
# Frodo #

390
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,565
# Don't wear the ring #

391
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,574
# I know
it's very tempting #

392
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,668
# Yes, you will appear
to disappear #

393
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,204
# But the Dark Riders,
they'll know you're there #

394
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,615
# Yes, Lord Sauron has
many spies... #

395
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,485
Many spies
have many eyes!

396
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,989
# One ring to bind them,
to find them #

397
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,252
# One ring
to rule them all #

398
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,419
# One ring to bind them,
one to find them #

399
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,895
# One ring
to rule them all #

400
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,761
# Yeah! Little Frodo #

401
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,732
# You've got to
rule them, Frodo #

402
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,792
# Rule them
with the ring! #

403
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,999
# Come on, rule them
with your ring... #

404
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,102
Lord Sauron has many
spies and beasts

405
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,771
and birds.

406
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,838
If you want him,
come and claim him!

407
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,247
Do they, Gandalf?

408
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,252
I'm not a conjurer
of cheap tricks!

409
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,117
I can't carry the ring,

410
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,487
but I can carry you,
Mr. Frodo.

411
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,685
You have my sword.

412
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,284
And my bow.

413
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,125
And my axe.

414
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,590
Mordor.

415
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,124
We'll never make it.

416
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,603
There's thousands of them
and only nine of us.

417
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,868
- Oh.
- We made it.

418
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,603
Hurray!
We made it.

419
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,009
# Yo Frodo, what you doin',
wearing the ring? #

420
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,014
# All-powerful jewelry,
is that your new thing? #

421
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,016
# I know it's hard when you're little
more than 3'4" #

422
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,642
# Your little ass
so close to the floor #

423
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,413
# Tryin' to lead the fellows
to the gates of Mordor #

424
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,943
- # The Fellowship #
- # Yeah, the Fellowship #

425
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,421
# I don't rap
about bitches and hos #

426
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,855
# I rap about witches
and trolls #

427
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,415
# 'Cause I'm passing
on the word to the elf king #

428
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,155
- # Wisdom to all: Frodo #
- # Don't wear the ring #

429
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,356
# Frodo #

430
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,093
- # Don't wear the ring #
- # The magical bling-bling #

431
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,727
# You'll never be
the Lord of the Rings. #

432
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,301
Guys?

433
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,863
- Bye!
- See you guys.

434
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,078
It's been a really
great day, guys.

435
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,380
- Really great.
- Yeah.

436
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,716
I just want
to savor this moment.

437
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,317
Here, have a cigar each.

438
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,018
- Oh.
- Come on.

439
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,050
- I don't smoke.
- Oh yeah, I don't smoke.

440
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,563
Well, neither do I,
but it's a special occasion.

441
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,792
I was gonna
keep this secret, but...

442
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,460
I might as well
tell you.

443
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,935
Tomorrow night,
I've booked a VIP lounge

444
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,700
at a very posh nightclub,
for the wrap party.

445
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,934
- Is it expensive?
- You deserve it.

446
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,101
- No, we don't.
- No.

447
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,270
- Of course you do.
- Yeah, Murray,

448
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,007
um...

449
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,015
there's something
Jemaine wants to tell you.

450
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,108
- What, about the video?
- Yeah.

451
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,619
There's something I've got to
tell you about the video.

452
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,985
I know.
That it's the best thing

453
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,455
I've ever done
in my life, right?

454
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,288
- Yeah.
- It is, yeah.

455
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,557
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's all right. I already know that.

456
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,223
I know it is.
Thank you, though.

457
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,562
I'm gonna put
my hat back on.

458
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,865
Eh?

459
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,379
Here you go, guys.
You want some of this?

460
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,906
Enjoy the party tonight.
I manage the band.

461
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,384
I'm the band manager.

462
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,250
Get into it.

463
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,222
Rock 'n' roll!
Whoo!

464
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,225
There we go.
Whoo!

465
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,159
Cheers,
good times.

466
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,321
I like to rock the party.
Hey, what about a photo?

467
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,298
Hey hey!
I'll keep that one.

468
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,233
I'll get your email
address or... okay!

469
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,736
I'm the manager
of the guys.

470
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,328
There's the band
over there.

471
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,669
You like
"Lord of the Rings"?

472
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,503
You'll love
the video we've made.

473
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm gonna do a speech, I think.
It's time for that.

474
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,637
You can't hear
the clinking.

475
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,676
Can I have the music down,
please, DJ? Please?

476
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,117
- Oh, we don't...
- All right.

477
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,121
Sorry, everyone, I just want to have
a few words.

478
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,679
I'm not gonna
keep you long.

479
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,350
But I just feel like
I should say something

480
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,053
to mark this
historic occasion...

481
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,823
um, about the guys,
Bret and Jemaine.

482
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,524
Get up guys, everyone.

483
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,090
Come on, come up
and stand up here.

484
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,102
- Whoo!
- Just come around, stand beside me

485
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,364
on each side.

486
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,395
Um, I've known these guys
for a while now.

487
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,067
When I first met them, I knew
they had something special,

488
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,042
something I like to
call the "A" factor.

489
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,170
Which is, when you see them,
you go "Eh!"

490
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,272
You know, there's that
something special there.

491
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,681
And I remember when they
first came into my office...

492
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,207
- remember?
- Yes.

493
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,413
- A while ago now, they had
their guitar cases in tow,

494
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,217
and they walked in
and they announced,

495
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,156
"We can't find our passports,"
or something.

496
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,886
- What was it?
- "We've lost our passports."

497
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,053
"We've lost our passports."
I knew at that moment

498
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,722
that these guys were
gonna be huge, you know?

499
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,231
They just... they've got something
about them, an aura.

500
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,700
A... a year and half
of, you know,

501
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,703
not always good times.
There's a lot of struggle.

502
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,466
Wasn't there?
Depressing,

503
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,904
- a lot of it?
- Some depression.

504
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,305
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

505
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,038
But we're here now.
We're here, down the track.

506
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,308
And this is it.
We've passed the point,

507
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,644
it's all been worth it.

508
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,581
Tonight's about
celebrating the success.

509
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,211
So, charge your glasses
and drink up tonight,

510
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,221
- 'cause it's all on us.
- Uh, no, we...

511
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,018
- Yup!
...probably shouldn't.

512
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,217
Don't worry about it, Jemaine.
Here's to Flight of the Conchords!

513
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,888
The drinks are on us!

514
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,397
Well, welcome to
your new life, eh?

515
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,162
- Mmm.
- How's it feel?

516
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,396
More champagne?

517
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,996
Uh, no, I'm just
having water.

518
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,870
Water? Unsuccessful
people have water.

519
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,568
You're on champagne now.

520
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,201
Murray, I think we should
probably go home.

521
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,212
Yeah, I've got
the check here.

522
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,838
Whoa, $600.

523
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,371
How are we
gonna pay for that?

524
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,747
- Eh?
- How are we gonna afford that?

525
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,581
Stefan gave me
a code.

526
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,883
Special industry code,
pays for everything...

527
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,822
drinks,
jet boats, caviar,

528
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,883
everything.
Watch this.

529
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,757
- I think...
- Waiter?

530
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,286
- Yes, sir?
- I'd like to settle the bill, please.

531
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,424
Put on a little bit on for yourself,
100 bucks.

532
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,593
- That's fine.
- Oh, thank you very much, sir.

533
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,398
- It's all right.
- How will you be paying?

534
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,462
Uh, with the code.

535
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,838
- Code?
- Come in, I'll tell you.

536
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,572
5768-745...

537
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,807
2156.

538
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,610
Sir, I don't know
what you're talking about.

539
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,948
- 576...
- Yeah, I heard you the first time, sir.

540
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,046
I just don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

541
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,421
That's weird. I bet Meatloaf never had
this problem, eh?

542
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,551
You know, the music code...
pays for everything.

543
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,620
Sir, we accept
MasterCard, Amex or Visa.

544
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,702
Bret, see if you can get that cork back
in that bottle, will you?

545
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,796
I'm gonna give
Stefan a call.

546
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,014
Murray, um...

547
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,845
we need to
tell you something.

548
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,943
- What?
- Ben isn't actually a record executive.

549
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,510
- Who?
- Stefan.

550
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,683
He... he's not a record executive,
he's a dry cleaner.

551
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,784
What do you mean?
Of course he's an exec.

552
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,193
Good one. What about
the conference call

553
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,220
between him, me,
Peter Jackson,

554
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,289
the guy from the mafia?

555
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,062
- Eddie, from the mafia?
- Yeah, that's him.

556
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,967
- Fat Eddie?
- Fat Eddie, yep.

557
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,698
- "Lot of commotion"?
- That's what he...

558
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,172
how do you know
about that?

559
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,141
That's just one of the characters
that Ben does.

560
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,767
Characters?

561
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,368
One man did all
those characters?

562
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,936
He's semiprofessional.

563
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,141
You're telling me that
this is all a joke?

564
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,308
Not a joke, but...

565
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,079
Organized by a couple
of jesters!

566
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,555
Is this you, is it?
"Oh, let's do a jest,

567
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,784
a great big...
great big lark

568
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,122
in the courtyard
of the king,

569
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,458
and see how he
takes it!" Is it?

570
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,657
- Is that what you're telling me?
- Yes.

571
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,272
Well, that went better
than I thought it would.

572
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,898
Yeah, that cleared it up.

573
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,212
Guys...
hang on, okay?

574
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,980
That was not me.
That was Stefan.

575
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,486
But it was you.

576
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,422
No no no no.
Stefan is his own person.

577
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,482
- It looked like you.
- Sure!

578
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,823
You play Stefan.

579
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,693
Stefan works through me.
He's like a spirit.

580
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,493
Well, it ended
terribly.

581
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,932
We had this big wrap party that
Murray put on

582
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,161
and he paid
for it himself.

583
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,965
Spent a lot of money
on the music video,

584
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,562
the Ringwraith costumes.

585
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,436
And he might have to
move into his office

586
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,101
'cause he can't
afford his rent.

587
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,235
When he lives in his office, he washes
his underpants in the sink

588
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,905
and dries them
in the microwave.

589
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,846
It's very humiliating
for everyone involved.

590
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,940
You guys are
absolutely right.

591
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,917
Okay, I guess, I...

592
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,011
sometimes I just...

593
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,615
underestimate the power
of my own acting skills.

594
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,750
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

595
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,089
Look, I want to
make this right.

596
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,389
How much
did Murray spend?

597
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,056
Oh, he spent
about $700.

598
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,964
No, including the video shoot,
it was more like $750.

599
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,231
I'm gonna say
$1,000,

600
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,797
payable to
Murray Hewitt.

601
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,001
Ah.

602
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,138
All right, I feel good
about this.

603
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,704
- That's very generous.
- Yeah.

604
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,774
Um, this is
a laundry ticket.

605
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,047
Yes.

606
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,613
But I will
send you the money

607
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,625
as soon as
I get to Hollywood.

608
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,253
Mmm, when are you
gonna go to Hollywood?

609
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,729
Didn't I tell you guys?

610
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,298
I'm going to
Hollywood right now.

611
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,166
That big part has
finally come in.

612
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,569
Martin Scorsese
is doing a movie

613
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,437
about a dry cleaner.

614
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,999
- What's it called?
- "Dry Cleaner."

615
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,011
So I'm off
to Hollywood right now.

616
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,910
- It was great knowing you guys.
- Okay.

617
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,211
- Congratulations, Ben.
- Thank you, thank you.

618
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,178
Oh at least that's...
that's good news for Ben.

619
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,122
Bret...

620
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,784
he's acting.

621
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,623
You think that was acting?

622
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,288
He's acting.

623
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,524
- God, he's good.
- He is good. He's very good.

624
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,396
Could you guys
please leave?

625
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,993
- We're waiting on our dry cleaning.
- Fuck.

626
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,297
Thank you, Ben.

627
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,510
- Murray.
- Oh, look who it is.

628
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,810
In you come.

629
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,044
The merry jesters.

630
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,210
Have a seat.

631
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,089
I'm just having
another look

632
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,182
at Stefan's professional credentials.

633
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,217
"To Ben, thanks for keeping
me clean, Art Garfunkel."

634
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,790
I thought that was some
sort of drug rehab thing.

635
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,766
"Your whites are
the whitest."

636
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,167
Well, thought that
was a Beatles album.

637
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,434
"To Ben, thanks for dry-cleaning
my clothes for me,

638
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,065
Debbie Harry."

639
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,473
That makes sense now.

640
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,602
We're sorry, Murray.

641
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,874
For what? Huh?

642
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,847
Making me look
like king of the dicks?

643
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,180
We just thought you needed
some positive reinforcement.

644
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,310
It's all right. It's not
even your fault, really.

645
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,684
I'm the dick.

646
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,348
I should have seen it
at the meeting.

647
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,290
A 90/10 split.
That's ridiculous.

648
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,794
Not even "Crowded House"
gets a 90/10 split.

649
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,352
- Don't they?
- No.

650
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:43,265
80/20, maybe,
but 90/10's unheard of.

651
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,361
I know it's pretend, but I thought
you did really well in that meeting.

652
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

653
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,601
- Eh, Bret?
- Yep.

654
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,733
Well...

655
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,902
I didn't want to
say anything, but...

656
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,639
I was hoping
you'd bring that up.

657
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,237
I kind of
felt that as well.

658
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,976
- Did you?
- Yeah, I did do well, didn't I?

659
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,176
- You did?
- Yeah.

660
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,482
That was my...
my proudest moment,

661
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,114
that meeting.

662
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,749
Oh look, it's my undies.

663
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,058
Ooh, hot.

664
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,907
Excuse me.

665
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,914
So many empty seats

666
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,220
and a story to go
with each of 'em.

667
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,419
You've got
that right, Jim.

668
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,519
Oh, and one more thing:

669
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,464
You know that ticket stub I gave you
from the dead guy's suit pocket?

670
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,298
- Yeah.
- Look at the date.

671
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,894
Seems a little unusual

672
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,905
that a man would go out
to the theater

673
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,568
three days after
he's been reported kidnapped.

674
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,582
You know, Max,

675
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,449
you should have
been a cop.

676
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,352
I should have been
a lot of things, Jim.

677
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,414
I should have
been a lot of things.
