1
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,938
Here you go, thanks.
Next please?

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,170
- Can I grab one of the apples, please?
- Uh, you, sir?

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,872
- And a... and a banana.
- I think he was first.

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,812
No, you were first.
What are you having, sir?

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,078
- Uh, two apples.
- All right.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,083
Don't... don't forget
to get me my, uh, banana.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,316
Thanks.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,325
Excuse me, sir, I'll just, um... get one
of the apples, please.

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,951
- And a banana.
- A banana.

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,189
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,697
Excuse me.

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,494
Look, guys, I don't want
any trouble here, all right?

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,728
- I'm sorry?
- Where are you from?

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,634
- New Zealand.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,570
Why don't you get lost?
I don't serve your kind here.

16
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,268
Um, I'd just like
to buy an apple, please?

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,106
- And... and a banana, Bret.
- That one, thanks.

18
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,635
That apple isn't for sale.

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,874
Neila,

20
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,940
can you go boil this
in disinfectant?

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,576
Thank you.

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,382
I don't want our customers
complaining that our fruit

23
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,218
tastes like New Zealanders.

24
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,957
Hmm.

25
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,483
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

26
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,223
Yeah.
Thanks, guys.

27
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,432
Okay, band meeting.
Jemaine.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,836
- Yes.
- Bret.

29
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,636
What's wrong with
being from New Zealand?

30
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,472
Are you picking
on Bret again, Jemaine?

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,740
No, I... I didn't
pick on him.

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,474
- It was a...
- You're from New Zealand as well.

33
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,981
Yeah, I know that.

34
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,880
Murray... present.
And I'm from New Zealand.

35
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,316
You're insulting me as well.

36
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,217
I didn't... but... but it
wasn't even me that...

37
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,018
You're hurting all of us when you
bring down New Zealand, okay?

38
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,651
- Stop it.
- L... but I didn't pick on him.

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,025
Tension in the band.

40
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,896
Bret upset.
All sorted now.

41
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,127
- Do we have any gigs, Murray or...
- No.

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,863
Any band opportunities?

43
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,928
Actually, Bret,
something from your mom.

44
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,440
Here we are.
You might like this.

45
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,101
I don't know what it is.
It seems empty.

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,475
Oh, great.
This is my favorite box.

47
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,139
And I got this
from my mom.

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,909
Nothing from your mom, Jemaine.

49
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,381
So?

50
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,611
I'm just saying, all right?

51
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,449
I've got a DVD here

52
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,047
that Mom recorded
from TV shows back home.

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,955
I thought you
might wanna watch it.

54
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,857
That's not a DVD,
by the way.

55
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,419
Yes, it is.
Dubbed video dub.

56
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,419
Oh, hello.

57
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,660
- Tech support.
- Uh, sorry to interrupt.

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,395
Um, I got your memo.

59
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,494
You wanted to know when
I'd be installing your new computer?

60
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,733
- Yes.
- Still 2:30.

61
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,435
Okay. Good.
I'm still free then.

62
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,103
Okay. See ya.

63
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,237
Oh, this is my band
I was telling you about.

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,941
- This is, uh, Jemaine.
- How are ya?

65
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,279
- Hi. Hi.
- And this is Bret.

66
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,343
And this is...
tech support advisor.

67
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,254
She's putting all the new
computers in... in the office.

68
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,655
- Ahh.
- Wow.

69
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,387
Upgrading from
the old system now.

70
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,292
25 years and it's
already obsolete, that one.

71
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,388
- They move fast now, don't they?
- Hmm, yes.

72
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,092
Upgrading. Yeah.

73
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,658
We're just having a band meeting...
talking about upcoming gigs,

74
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,192
- that sort of thing.
- Yeah, there's none.

75
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,932
- It's pretty rock and roll...
- Right.

76
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,497
- The sort of thing we talk about...
- Well, I gotta go.

77
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,066
- It was nice to meet you. Bye, guys.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,840
- See you at 2:30.
- Right.

79
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,876
You all right, Murray?

80
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,749
I'm in love.

81
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,414
Who with?

82
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,423
Her... from tech support.

83
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,981
What about your wife?

84
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,856
- I'm separated.
- Are you?

85
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,327
- Are you?
- Yes!

86
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,829
You should have
told us something.

87
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,387
I moved in with
you guys for a month.

88
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,593
- I was upset, remember?
- Oh, is that why you were there?

89
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,158
Oh, come on, guys.

90
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,760
- You talked me down off the roof.
- Ah, yes yes.

91
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,271
- Remember?
- No.

92
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,738
And "The Dog Show"
takes a break next week...

93
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,971
That was a great
episode of "The Dog Show."

94
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,741
That guy was
so rude to me.

95
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,512
- What guy?
- The... the guy at the fruit shop.

96
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,179
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,881
It's unbelievable.
He just insulted me.

98
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,446
He was all right.

99
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,048
No, he was racist.

100
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,184
And the guy
told us to leave,

101
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,526
said he wouldn't
serve our kind.

102
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,089
- Yeah.
- That's racist and a little bit rude.

103
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,125
Yeah. Well who knows
what he could have meant?

104
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,637
Channel 1...
New Zealand's 1.

105
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,367
Coming up
tonight at 8:00

106
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,671
we have an episode of "What Have You
Done to My House?"

107
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,837
And now it's time for everyone's
favorite dragon, "Albi."

108
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,179
- # In the Marmalade Forest #
- # Forest #

109
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,277
# Between
the make-believe trees #

110
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,153
# In a cottage-cheese cottage #

111
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,058
- # Lives Albi #
- # Albi #

112
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,530
- # Albi #
- # Albi #

113
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:04,196
# Albi, the Racist Dragon. #

114
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,330
Part six.

115
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:10,240
And so, all of the villagers
chased Albi the Racist Dragon

116
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,404
into a very cold
and very scary cave.

117
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,313
It was so dark
and so scary in there

118
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,807
that Albi began to cry...
dragon tears,

119
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,479
which, as we all know,

120
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,988
turn into jellybeans!

121
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:27,152
Just then, he felt
a tiny hand on his tail.

122
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,923
And he turned around
and who should it be

123
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,896
but the badly burned
Albanian boy

124
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,956
from the day before.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,800
What are you doing?
I thought I killed you yesterday...

126
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,601
...grumbled Albi
quite racistly.

127
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,472
Nah, no, Albi.

128
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,502
You didn't kill me
with your dragon flames.

129
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,015
I crawled to safety.

130
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,382
But I was left
very badly disfigured...

131
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,478
...laughed the boy.

132
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,546
Why are you crying, Albi?

133
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,785
Well, all of the villagers

134
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,919
chased me into
this scary cave.

135
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,293
I think it's
because I'm so racist.

136
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,493
Get your hand off my tail,
you'll make it dirty.

137
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,832
They didn't chase you here
because of your racism.

138
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,667
They chased me here too

139
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,038
when I became all
disfigured like this.

140
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,702
They just don't like us

141
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,736
because... because
we're different to them.

142
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,445
And at that,
Albi cried a single tear

143
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,077
which turned
into a jellybean

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,088
all the colors
of the rainbow.

145
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,181
And suddenly,

146
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,283
Albi wasn't racist anymore.

147
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,829
- # So they sat in the cave #
- # The cave #

148
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,561
- # And ate bubblegum pie #
- # Yum! #

149
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,695
# Albi, the Racist #

150
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,104
# Albi, the Racist #

151
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,633
# Albi, the Racist... #

152
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,646
Well, not anymore.

153
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,342
#... Dragon #

154
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,510
Goodbye. Goodbye.

155
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,419
Are you crying over
the kids' show?

156
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,355
Yes. So?

157
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,825
- Are you crying?
- Yeah. So what?

158
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,923
So he wouldn't
serve us, basically,

159
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,490
just because we're
from New Zealand.

160
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,332
Is that the norm?

161
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,997
Well, you guys
are in America now

162
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,835
and there's a lot
of "prejudism" here,

163
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,431
especially towards
people like you.

164
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,272
What do you mean
people like us?

165
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,868
You know, the...
the English and whatnot.

166
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,710
- Redcoats... the oppressors.
- We're not English...

167
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,613
Be that as it may, Jemaine,

168
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,141
you're pretty much the most
disliked race in this whole country.

169
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,519
Wh... wh... what
about black people?

170
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,251
They don't like you either.

171
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,124
Neither do the Chinese,
the Asians,

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,025
the Polish, Russian,

173
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,122
Croatians,
even the Indians.

174
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,827
Yeah, but Dave, you're Indian.
You hate us?

175
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah.

176
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,966
Sometimes.

177
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,472
But you're
our best friend.

178
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,170
I know.

179
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,125
You can't sit there,
gotta go to the back.

180
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,803
I'm sorry.
Back of the bus.

181
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,842
Why don't you get an apple from someone
who doesn't hate our country, Bret?

182
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,747
Thanks so much.

183
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,085
Excuse me, I'd like
to buy this apple, please.

184
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,318
New Zealander...

185
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,691
stop touching my fruit!
It's not allowed.

186
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,355
What's wrong
with New Zealanders?

187
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,193
Hey, Neila!
Can we bleach this one up?

188
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,789
It's been infected!

189
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,494
I wanna buy that.
I'll pay for it.

190
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,595
No, not this apple,
New Zealandy.

191
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,230
You can buy apples
from over there...

192
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,900
my special
New Zealand section.

193
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,636
$10 apiece.

194
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,576
There's a dog
in the New Zealand section.

195
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,307
Well, it's
for dogs from America

196
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,178
and people
from New Zealand.

197
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,740
Yeah, you're being racist.

198
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,581
How dare you
call me a racist!

199
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,315
He doesn't mean racist.
He means xenophobic.

200
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,186
Oh. Well, you're
being xenophobic.

201
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,919
You know what?
Just get lost, New Zealanders.

202
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,018
I'm not going anywhere till I get
a Red Delicious and a banana.

203
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,052
You want a brown delicious
to the face?

204
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,121
No.

205
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,099
You wanna make
trouble for me, huh?

206
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,262
I don't. Bret was sort of
driving this situation.

207
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,534
We're not going anywhere
till we get an apple.

208
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,268
I'm gonna count to 10.

209
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,778
You... are you
counting in your head?

210
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,476
- Yeah.
- What are you up to?

211
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,485
- Seven.
- Oh.

212
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,821
Yeah, get your shitty bikes
and get out of here

213
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,584
before I peel
your beard off!

214
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,490
# There's too many
mother... uckers #

215
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,088

# Too many to count,

00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,777
# I pay my mother... ucking

226
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,417
# An amount from my account

227
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,582
# On A.P. #

228
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,524
# Yeah, you know me #

00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,503
# Yeah #

264
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,597
# Too many mother... uckers
- ucking with my shhh! #

265
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,011
- How's it going?
- Pretty bad.

266
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,639
We're in the middle
of a race war, Murray.

267
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,841
What's that?

268
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,975
Bad. We're in the middle of
a race war.

269
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,009
Have you guys
written any songs?

270
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,987
- We've been too busy with the race war.
- We're in a race war.

271
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,455
- All right!
- It's very time consuming.

272
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,025
Oh, excuse me. Uh, Greg told me you need
help with your computer.

273
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,553
Uh, yeah. Um, I just
can't seem to turn it on.

274
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,361
It is on.

275
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,501
Oh! Oh, it just comes on!
That's weird.

276
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,062
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

277
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,972
Sorry.
You're a lifesaver.

278
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,709
Is it hot in here?

279
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,441
Yep.

280
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,774
Hey. Oh, no.

281
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,183
- I've written a love song.
- For us?

282
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,987
No, for her,
the tech support woman.

283
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,516
Mmm. Mmm.

284
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,722
I mean I'm not, you know,
embarrassed to admit this,

285
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,995
but I can't really put my
emotions into... into words.

286
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,557
So I've decided
to use lyrics.

287
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,467
Well, this...
they're also words.

288
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,304
Oh, well can you help me with it
because you're songwriters?

289
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,865
Yeah, well
what have you got?

290
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,706
All right, well, I've got...
this is what I've got so far.

291
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,269
Um...

292
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,974
here we are.

293
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,573
# Hi. #

294
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,352
I like it.

295
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,411
- Yeah?
- "Hi"?

296
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,514
- Yep.
- Is that it?

297
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,081
Yeah.

298
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,752
- No more words?
- No.

299
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,762
- It's better than I expected.
- Really?

300
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,162
- Mmm.
- What do you think?

301
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,428
Have you thought about
adding some more words?

302
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,094
I don't know. I don't want
to make it too convoluted.

303
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,864
You probably want
more than one word.

304
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,371
How about this?

305
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,737
I've got: "I like pie.

306
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,401
I had a budgie
but it died."

307
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,966
I don't know if
you should tell her

308
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,945
about your dead parrot,
should you?

309
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,072
Well, it's just that
it brings up emotions for me.

310
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,413
Um, and then I've just
got some rhymes.

311
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,008
"I'm shy.
I'm a guy.

312
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,850
- I wear ties."
- Mmm.

313
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,480
And then I've put
notes about her.

314
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,047
- She's got great legs.
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,252
- Great... great hair.
- Ooh, are you crazy?

316
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,195
- Wow, smokin' hot. Whew.
- That's what I think.

317
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,130
- Yeah, that's what you think.
- Yeah.

318
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,497
- And, um...
- Well what about:

319
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,058
# Hot leggy blonde chick,
got it going on #

320
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,195
# Wanna see you wearing
that thong thong thong... #

321
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,874
#... Panties on #

322
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,672
Ooh. No, that
whole thing's...

323
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,303
it's inappropriate.

324
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,144
I can't say that
in the workplace, can I?

325
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,706
Too much mumbling.

326
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,082
Yeah, a lot of it
was inaudible.

327
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,283
No, I think I'll just
stick with what I've got.

328
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,382
And that's... it's simple.
It's... it's nice.

329
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,052
# Hi. #

330
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,890
Yeah.

331
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,725
- Greg?
- What's up, Murray?

332
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,230
Ah, yes, Greg,

333
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,598
oh, can you bring in the, um,
tech support woman, please?

334
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,296
My computer again.

335
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,237
- You wanna see Jessica again?
- Yes, thank you.

336
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,071
Ah, Jessica.
That's her name.

337
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,406
Go on, out you go!
Meeting over.

338
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,050
- Hello, Music Library.
- Hello.

339
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,152
Do you have the new
Gipsy Kings cassette?

340
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,753
Let me check.

341
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,068
- Yes, we have it.
- I would like to reserve it.

342
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,730
I'll put it aside for you.

343
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,363
Excellent. Goodbye.

344
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,170
With telephones,
you make the call.

345
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,272
I think I'm gonna
write him a letter,

346
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,874
tell him how I feel.

347
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,450
Yeah.

348
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,012
You know what
you could do?

349
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,957
Inject strychnine
into a piece of his fruit.

350
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,653
Then when a customer dies,

351
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,559
the C.I.A. Will trace it
back to the vendor

352
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,121
and he's going
straight to the big house...

353
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,065
Alcatraz.

354
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,367
Yeah, I don't really wanna
kill anyone though, Dave.

355
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,065
Why not?

356
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,130
Haven't you seen
"Escape From Alcatraz"?

357
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,199
It wasn't easy, bro.

358
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,108
Forget about it.

359
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,443
What about...
oh, no... no, never mind.

360
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,004
- What?
- What was it?

361
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,573
No, it wouldn't work.
It wouldn't work.

362
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,107
No, so?

363
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,848
Well, sometimes what I do

364
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,254
is I think mean thoughts
about the person.

365
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,655
- How do they know?
- They don't know.

366
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,252
I know, that's why
I didn't suggest it.

367
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,961
So what you guys need
is something...

368
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,559
a little more subtle
than framing him for murder,

369
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,796
which I actually think
is still a great idea,

370
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,236
but more obvious

371
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,035
than thinking
mean thoughts about him.

372
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,668
Why don't you
just insult him back?

373
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,473
Hey, New Zealanders!

374
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,005
He's out there.

375
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,074
New Zealanders
are all unhygienic!

376
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,983
That... that's a stereotype!

377
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,217
Hey, what are you guys doing?
You, uh, you bungee jumping up there?

378
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,224
- No.
- No.

379
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,657
No, we're not.

380
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,490
Hey, New Zealanders all have
tartar on their teeth!

381
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,888
Say a comeback to him!

382
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,832
He's shouting stereotypes...
racist stereotypes at us.

383
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,960
You gotta
let him have it, man.

384
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,527
Banana balls!

385
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,630
You look like a... a something...
like a banana balls.

386
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,335
New Zealanders all mumble.
I can't understand you.

387
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,612
- He turned it around back on us.
- Flip him the bird.

388
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,137
- What?
- Flip him the bird.

389
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,547
Damn.

390
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,524
Well, look, if you
just wanna let this guy

391
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,082
know you're not gonna
take his shit anymore,

392
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,651
just flip him the bird.

393
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,424
- Yeah?
- Right.

394
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,454
If you... you need a comeback,
but you can't think of something,

395
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,126
- flip him the bird.
- Yeah, okay.

396
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,691
That's it.
That's all you gotta do.

397
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,202
Okay.

398
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,070
What is the bird?

399
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,074
- What's that?
- That's the bird.

400
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,700
Well, that bird
doesn't have any wings.

401
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,540
- It's only got one leg.
- Have you seen this one, Dave?

402
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,375
No no...

403
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,938
No, that's not the bird,
this is the bird.

404
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,711
- No, that's the bird...
- This is more like a bird.

405
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,775
- No, that's the bird.
- That's not the bird.

406
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,582
This is the bird, Bret.

407
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,919
- That's wha... that's a little bird.
- What about this?

408
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,651
No, that just
looks stupid.

409
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,158
It looks like
you're like...

410
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,627
waving to two people
on either side of you.

411
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,220
Oh, that does too.

412
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,562
Dude, you gotta...
you... you... this is it.

413
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,193
I mean, there's nothing offensive
about that hand gesture.

414
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,499
Yeah, but try putting
some wings on your bird.

415
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,440
- There we go. That's much nicer.
- But you don't wanna be nice.

416
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,444
What if... what if you were doing
that one and then I snuck up behind you

417
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,968
- and then you doing your one...
- Don't ever...

418
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,106
That looks a lot
more like a bird.

419
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,844
It's not a fucking
school play production.

420
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,751
- It's the bird.
- And what's offensive about that?

421
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,618
Because, you Scottish freak,

422
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,352
it's your way of saying, "Hey,
you better not disrespect me, man,

423
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,553
even though I'm gonna
disrespect you."

424
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,324
Can you show me
how to do that?

425
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,162
Yeah. I could show you.

426
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,796
Bird.

427
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,331
Got it?

428
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,468
No, but you don't have to...

429
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,542
Wrong finger. Good!

430
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,280
Around, and up.

431
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,584
Good, Bret.
Around and up.

432
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,749
- How about that?
- Nice.

433
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,256
Exactly.

434
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,563
Nice. One minute,
32 seconds.

435
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,836
Hey hey!
Cool it, man!

436
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,603
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey! Neila!

437
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,167
Cover your eyes!

438
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,803
How dare you come here

439
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,337
and give me those offensive
hand gestures at my fruit stand?

440
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,180
It was either this or getting you
sent into Alcatraz.

441
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,379
How dare you treat us
like secondhand citizens?

442
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,411
It doesn't matter
what country someone's from

443
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,913
or what they look like
or the color of their skin.

444
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,018
It doesn't matter
what they smell like.

445
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,529
Or whether they spell words
slightly differently...

446
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,156
some would say
more correctly.

447
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,099
- Yeah?
- Let me finish.

448
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,795
I'm a person.

449
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,463
- Bret's a person.
- Yep.

450
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,032
You're a person. That person
over there is a person.

451
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,772
And each person deserves to be
treated like a person.

452
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,704
That's a great speech.

453
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,443
Too bad New Zealanders
are a bunch of cocky a-holes

454
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,077
descended from criminals
and retarded monkeys.

455
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,848
No, you're thinking
of Australians.

456
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,651
- Yeah, that's Australians.
- That's Australians.

457
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,157
No no no.
New Zealanders.

458
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,217
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.
Ride around on your kangaroos all day.

459
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,558
- No no no no.
- That's Australians.

460
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,496
You're thinking of Australians,
that's not us.

461
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,591
I've totally confused you
with Australians.

462
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,068
- L... I feel terrible.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

463
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,934
Your accents...
they're just kinda similar.

464
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,872
The accents
are completely different.

465
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,738
Th... they're like,
"Where's the car?"

466
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,504
And we're like,
"Where's the car?"

467
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,205
You know what? Hey, ha...
have some of my fruit.

468
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,873
Please, I feel terrible.

469
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,905
- Do you want that Red Delicious still?
- Oh, I would love

470
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,179
- the Red Delicious, yeah.
- Well, this Red Delicious is on me.

471
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,118
- You still want that banana?
- Thank you.

472
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,678
- I'd love the banana.
- Here. Here you go.

473
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,452
- Oh, that's so crazy.
- I'm Sinjay.

474
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,083
- I'm Jemaine. Good to meet you.
- Bret.

475
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,185
Neila. You can...
you can uncover your eyes.

476
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,389
They're not Australian.
They're New Zealanders.

477
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,897
# Hi, leggy blonde... #

478
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,018
# Hi, leggy blonde... #

479
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,891
Greg, can you
come in here, please?

480
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,819
What is it, Murray?

481
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,298
Yes, um, can you get
Jessica from tech support?

482
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,392
My computer's broken.

483
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,925
Oh, she's no longer here.

484
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,460
Oh, that's fine.
We'll do it in the morning.

485
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,029
No, I mean
she's finished

486
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,540
installing the new
computer system.

487
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,769
- She's not coming back.
- Oh, right.

488
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,539
She's gone.

489
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,816
Oh.

490
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,511
Can I help you, Murray?

491
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,078
No.

492
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,125
# Goodbye #

493
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,009
# Goodbye-ee-eye #

494
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,804
# Leggy blonde #

495
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,145
# Every day I look
across the office floor #

496
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,912
# There you were,
your hair down to your legs #

497
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,919
# And your legs
down to the floor #

498
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,413
# Leggy blonde, goodbye #

499
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,050
# Goodbye #

500
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,560
# Now that you are gone #

501
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,391
# I'll never see you here
for tech repair #

502
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,863
# I wish you knew
how much I loved your legs #

503
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,492
# And your hair #

504
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,968
# Leggy blonde, goodbye #

505
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,630
# Goodbye #

506
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,435
# Leggy leggy
leggy leggy #

507
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,998
