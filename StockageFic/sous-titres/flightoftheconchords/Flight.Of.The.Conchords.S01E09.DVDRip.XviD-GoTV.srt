1
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,330
Okay, band meeting.

2
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,070
- Murray, present. Bret, present.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,975
Jemaine, present.
All right,

4
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,570
I haven't got time
for your time wasting.

5
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,445
Today I've got to
move fast.

6
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,972
We've got some
really good news.

7
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,247
We've got our
biggest gig ever.

8
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,753
Is it
the Grand Canyon one?

9
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,018
No, there's no gigs
at the Grand Canyon.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,991
Wouldn't have to be that big to be our
biggest gig ever.

11
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,858
Okay, enough guesses.
I'm gonna tell you.

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,954
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,262
Ah... Central Park.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,324
- Central Park?
- Yes.

15
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,336
- Really?
- Confirmed this morning.

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,497
- Headlining.
- Headlining at Central Park?

17
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,767
- Yes.
- Us?

18
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,434
- Yes.
- Me and Bret?

19
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,136
- Yes!
- Bret as well?

20
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,439
Yes, the two of you.

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,639
As... as you are,
okay?

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,739
I mean, you've got to be
on the top of your game,

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,047
which is why I've booked
us into a warm-up tour.

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,384
Here's your itineraries.

25
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,753
Murray, you said we couldn't afford
to go on tour.

26
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,056
Well, I've said a lot
of things in my time, Bret.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,087
Not all of it's
worth listening to,

28
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,929
but let's just say
this time around, it is.

29
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,903
I've dipped into the Flight of the
Conchords emergency fund.

30
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,405
What emergency fund?

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,407
Well, I'm not really
at liberty to say,

32
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,806
but...

33
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,640
okay?

34
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,679
- Where'd you get that from, Murray?
- Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,683
- Well, whose money is it?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

36
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,947
Just, don't worry
about it.

37
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,853
Murray, have you
organized a tour before?

38
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,687
Yes, of course I have.
What do you think this is?

39
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,750
Was it a band tour?

40
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,591
A rugby tour...

41
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,187
I've organized.
Same thing.

42
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,028
- Not really.
- Yes.

43
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,035
Players play the game,
you guys play the guitar.

44
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,698
Don't they? They kick the ball,
you kick the... jams.

45
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,173
So we have to get up
at 7:00 in the morning

46
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,039
and do 200 squat-thrusts?

47
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,103
Oh no, some of these
won't, um, apply to you.

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,342
Just look for the ones I've...
I've crossed out there,

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,443
and I've put red pen.
Look for the red pen instructions.

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,650
How big's the bus
gonna be? The tour bus?

51
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,491
This is the tour bus,
Jemaine.

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,589
This isn't a tour bus.

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,497
It says here we're
gonna have a tour bus.

54
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,002
No, that's the rugby
itinerary, isn't it?

55
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,833
All right,
there's only two of you.

56
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,998
You're not a big rugby team,
you don't need a bus.

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,065
Oh, I thought we were
getting a tour bus.

58
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,306
No, that's the rugby itinerary, Bret.
All right?

59
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,609
You can see there I've
crossed out "bus," haven't I?

60
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,242
Yeah, you crossed out "bus,"
and you wrote "bus."

61
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,117
Yeah, I got confused there.
I didn't know what to do.

62
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,212
"Honda Accord" was too big
to fit in the gap there,

63
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,120
so I put "bus" back in.

64
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,593
I knew as soon as I wrote it, there'd be
some sort of controversy.

65
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,325
Let me tell you
a little secret, Bret.

66
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,633
You'll like this.

67
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,766
Sometimes late at night
when I'm driving alone,

68
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,402
I imagine
this is a bus.

69
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,942
Is that... a bit silly,
is it, Bret?

71
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,007
- No, that's cool.
- Is it?

72
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,281
- Mmm.
- I thought you'd like that.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,844
- So you're the bus driver?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,583
That's cool.

75
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,954
Oh.

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,988
- Shelly.
- Oh, how's Shelly?

77
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,860
I thought
you were separated.

78
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,729
No, we're back
together, remember?

79
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,393
You asked me
why I was crying.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,165
I said it was the happiest day
of my life.

81
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,967
You don't remember that?

82
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,837
Mmm, no.

83
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,671
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you?

84
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,938
What?

85
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,038
Uh, no, it was
an emergency.

86
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,744
Look, it's a temporary withdrawal
from the checking fund, all right?

87
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,753
The savings
should be okay.

88
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,551
Right. No, yeah,
okay, so I...

89
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,115
I transferred most of the savings into
the checking account.

90
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,820
But look, it's just
temporary, all right?

91
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,522
We'll get it back.
Don't worry.

92
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,758
We'II... we will.
We will get it back.

93
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,959
We'll get it back, okay?

94
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,764
We will!

95
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,269
Say hi from me.

96
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,803
What? No.

97
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,207
Look, Shelly,

98
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,701
those two effing idiots are good friends
of mine, okay?

99
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,409
And no, they're not... it's nothing to do
with them, okay?

100
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,282
I'm not even
managing them anymore.

101
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,083
Look, I've got to go.
Bret says hi.

102
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,590
I mean, ages ago
when I last saw him.

103
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,354
All right?
All right, bye-bye.

104
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,827
Is everything
all right, Murray?

105
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,762
Absolutely, yeah.

106
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,230
That reminds me...
Jemaine?

107
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,230
Jemaine?

108
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,600
Are your immigration papers
up to date?

109
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,764
Well, that's your job to
check our immigration papers.

110
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,774
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right, well anyway...

111
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,799
I'm just wondering 'cause there's been
a car tailing us

112
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,276
for the last hour.

113
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,338
It's probably Mel
stalking us.

114
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,512
Well, hey, guys!

115
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,576
What a coincidence!

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,952
Ha ha!

117
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,820
Hey, Mel.

118
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,845
What time
do we take off?

119
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,013
- What do you mean?
- What time's our flight?

120
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,285
We're not flying anywhere.

121
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,053
Why are we
at an airport?

122
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,492
That's where
the gig is, Jemaine.

123
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,358
- It's at the airport.
- At the airport?

124
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,762
Yeah, well here,
at the hotel...

125
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,527
in the lounge.

126
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,762
Come on, it's time
for the gig. Let's go.

127
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,770
# Who likes to rock the party? #

128
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,034
# We like to rock
the party #

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,908
Um, well thank you
very much,

130
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,178
um, to the La Guardia
Hotel lobby...

131
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,775
- um...
- Shut up, Bret.

132
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,286
Uh, thank you for having us.
It's been a real treat.

133
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,346
And thank you
just for being <i>here...</i>

134
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,051
Don't... don't do your
embarrassing speeches.

135
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,649
We're Flight
of the Conchords,

136
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,456
and thank you again.

137
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,464
Thank you. CDs and T-shirts are
for sale at the desk there.

138
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,228
- Well?
- Brilliant.

139
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,032
- Yeah?
- Yeah, as always.

140
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,663
Really good.
Good speech too, Bret.

141
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,368
- Thanks, it was all right.
- Yeah. What a night, eh?

142
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,536
Well, it's only the middle
of the afternoon, though.

143
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,705
- So? You know, it's a hot venue.
- Oh, yeah yeah.

144
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,738
Yeah? This is good.
Listen to the crowd.

145
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,548
There's hardly
anyone here.

146
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,053
Yeah, it's subsided now.
A lot of people have...

147
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,521
gone to get their flights,

148
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,854
but it's really good.
Oh, before I forget.

149
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,486
Uh, I've got
your per diems, okay?

150
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,894
So, here we go.

151
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,090
- Jemaine.
- Oh great.

152
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,996
Yeah. Bret.

153
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,092
Okay?
Off you go.

154
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,762
I'll see you in
an hour for dinner.

155
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,897
- Thanks, Murray.
- Have fun.

156
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,508
And the point of a per diem, as I think
I made quite clear,

157
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,446
is that it's to be spent on food
and necessary items, all right?

158
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,382
Not leather suits.
It's a total waste of money.

159
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,044
It's necessary for...

160
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,679
Now you've got
no money for food...

161
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,621
or necessary items.

162
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,591
Perhaps you could give us an advance
on tomorrow's per diem?

163
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,154
You've spent
tomorrow's per diem.

164
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,258
The per diem I gave you
for was for the week.

165
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,292
Could I have some of your chips
please, Murray?

166
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,894
You can have
a few of them.

167
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,769
"Per diem" means
for the day, though. See?

168
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,398
Well, I don't
know Latin.

169
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,102
Well, you should have
said..."per weekem,"

170
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,304
- would be the correct term.
- Regardless, Jemaine.

171
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,973
Per diem, per weekem, you don't go
spending it on bloody leather suits.

172
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,574
- Don't you?
- No.

173
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,075
Can I have some of the chips that
you said Bret could have?

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,918
Bret!

175
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,221
- Oh, do you want some of my chips?
- Oh, forget it now.

176
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,284
They're yours now.

177
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,955
Hey, Murray, do you want
to see what else we got?

178
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,293
No, I don't, Bret,
actually.

179
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,299
I don't want to see anything
you've got there

180
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,130
unless it's food
or necessary items.

181
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,069
I'm so livid
with you turkeys.

182
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,564
You're like a couple
of cool-Iooking idiots.

183
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,707
We'll get it back. We will get it back,
all right?

184
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,716
Just call me tomorrow,
but don't call me at work.

185
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,718
Do not call me
at work, all right?

186
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,915
I don't want them asking silly questions
as to why I'm not at work, okay?

187
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,082
It's just
gonna get like...

188
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,422
hello? Hello?

189
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,322
Okay, love you too!
Bye-bye!

190
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,356
- Hey, Bret.
- That Shelly?

191
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,594
Yeah yeah.

192
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,603
- She good?
- Yeah, it's all good.

193
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,264
Jemaine said you wanted
to have a meeting?

194
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,606
Um, nothing's scheduled.

195
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,271
Is it about
leather suits?

196
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't blame you
for the leather suits, Bret.

197
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,145
- That's a classic rock 'n' roll move.
- Thank you.

198
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,672
- Really good.
- Thanks.

199
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,378
Which is why I know
Jemaine came up with it.

200
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,443
- No.
- Yeah.

201
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,216
You must have
followed him, did you?

202
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,553
What, don't you think I'm capable
of a classic rock 'n' roll move?

203
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,286
No, you're not like that.
That's Jemaine all over it.

204
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,816
That reminds me,

205
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,829
just, you know, keep
an eye on Jemaine, okay?

206
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,832
We're on tour now. Brings out
the crazier side of someone like him.

207
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,993
- Okay.
- Okay, just watch him.

208
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,730
All right, well he's
having a sleep.

209
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,998
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah.

210
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,370
Probably not his bed,
though? Eh?

211
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,034
- Yes, his bed.
- Is it?

212
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,043
- Yeah.
- He'd be lying on top of it, though.

213
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,341
He won't be... won't be in it.
He'll be on top...

214
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,040
No, he's tucked in.
It's boring.

215
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,708
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah.

216
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,513
Probably, uh, he's having a rest.
Getting ready for tonight.

217
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,112
He was watching TV. He wanted to see
what the weather was gonna be like.

218
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,645
Oh, wow.

219
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,158
Probably looking for some thunderstorms
to rock out in.

220
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,592
You watch him,
all right?

221
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,858
Oh, it's hilarious.

222
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,196
Oh, you've got to see this,
Bret, it's so... so funny.

223
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,757
What's happening?

224
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,202
Uh, well the guys with the suits
are putting on this big show now,

225
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,602
and everyone's
just loving it.

226
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,607
No, don't move it,
don't move it.

227
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,871
Gotta be in exactly
the right place.

228
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,572
It's your turn to hold it, man.
My arms are sore.

229
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,410
I can't hold it. I'm in the middle
of a movie.

230
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,075
This is
a critical point.

231
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,107
Aw. You ruined
the reception.

232
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,812
Do you want anything
from the minibar?

233
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,911
- No.
- No?

234
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,854
We're not allowed stuff
from the minibar.

235
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,187
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Do not get anything from the minibar.

236
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,920
- Just getting some nuts...
- Don't get anything.

237
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,952
I'll just get some mixed nuts.
It's all right. I've already taken...

238
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,192
Oh! Oh!

239
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,970
Room fee, check.

240
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,374
Lodging tax, check.

241
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,369
Well, somebody had a bit of fun
last night, didn't they, Jemaine?

242
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,008
- What?
- $8 can of mixed nuts.

243
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,881
They must have
been pretty good.

244
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:56,217
Got so much buzz out of them that you
chucked a television out the window.

245
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,655
- Actually, Murray, that was me.
- Don't cover for him, Bret.

246
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,489
I know how rock 'n' roll he thinks
he is... Mr. Keith Moon.

247
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,290
- It wasn't Jemaine, it was me.
- Really?

248
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,059
- Yes.
- I see what you're doing.

249
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,362
You're watching Jemaine
with his rock 'n' roll moves,

250
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,631
buying the leather suits,
getting the mixed nuts,

251
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,264
jumping on the bed. And you thought,
"Oh, how can I equal this?"

252
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,933
- Is that what it is?
- No.

253
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,912
Would you like
some mixed nuts?

254
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,675
Have you got
any cashews in there?

255
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,309
- No, I picked them out.
- Typical.

256
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,850
One, two, check.

257
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,690
Check.

258
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,448
Hi, I'm Murray Hewitt from
Murray Hewitt Productions.

259
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,643
- Hi, Murray.
- I've got Flight of the Conchords.

260
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,174
We're just on
a warm-up tour.

261
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,585
Really looking forward
to doing a gig here tonight.

262
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,351
These are the guys that destroyed
all that equipment the other night

263
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,518
- in Passaic!
- Yeah.

264
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,528
Yeah, um...

265
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,086
I paid it back!

266
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,893
We reimb...

267
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,396
Guys, I just need
a moment alone, all right?

268
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,610
Hey, has your suit
snugged up a little bit?

269
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,045
In certain areas, yes.

270
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,379
And in other areas,
also yes.

271
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,443
Hey, I was wondering if you guys
could settle a bet for me?

272
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,954
What sort of bet?

273
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,717
Are you guys
in a band?

274
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,987
Yes. Is it that obvious?

275
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,653
I knew it, I totally
knew it. They are!

276
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,720
See? 'Cause the...
the second I saw

277
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,232
the cool leather suits,
I just knew it.

278
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,530
They're a dead giveaway,
aren't they? Just...

279
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,694
- Totally.
- Mmm.

280
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,533
Becky thought you guys
were probably just

281
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,039
a couple of magicians, and Kathy, Lisa,
Tawny and Tracy

282
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,837
thought you were probably
just a couple of gays.

283
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,208
Looks like Becky
and Kathy were wrong.

284
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,907
And Lisa and Tawny
and Tracy... what was it?

285
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,381
You guys want to join us
for some drinks or something?

286
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,782
Uh, we just got
two fresh waters, so...

287
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,047
We'd be delighted.

288
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,647
Hey, why are you all
dressed the same?

289
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,816
- Are you guys a band?
- Are you sexy nurses?

290
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:17,124
What? No, we're the North Jersey
University Women's Water Polo team.

291
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,132
N-J-U-W-W-P-T!

292
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,157
Whoo!

293
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,192
All right,
come on, then.

294
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,645
Do you guys have
water polo in New Zealand?

295
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,707
Do we? Pfft.

296
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,548
- Do we?
- Yeah, it's... everyone plays it.

297
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,554
- It's our national sport.
- Yeah, it's our national sport.

298
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,556
- Every single person plays it, yeah.
- Yeah.

299
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,558
- Bret's mom plays it.
- Really?

300
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,856
- It's a beautiful game.
- That's perfect.

301
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,191
That is perfect.

302
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,129
I am totally
gonna save this autograph

303
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,631
for when
you guys are huge.

304
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,634
Then I will be able
to say that I knew...

305
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,863
- Bret?
- Yeah. Bret.

306
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,872
- Brit? Brit?
- Bret. Bret.

307
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,134
- Brit.
- Bret.

308
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,404
- Bret!
- Yeah yeah.

309
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,604
Sorry. What...
what's your last name?

310
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,634
Bret.

311
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,045
Bret Bret?

312
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,447
No, just joking.
It's McKenzie.

313
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,246
- Oh!
- Just joking.

314
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,617
He's got a great sense of humor.
Don't joke, please.

315
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,588
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- Don't joke, Bret...

316
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,181
- Sorry, I shouldn't have...
...it's confusing when you joke.

317
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,056
- That's my name, that's...
- I love your accent.

318
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,288
- Thank you.
- I have the same.

319
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,388
Say, "Throw another shrimp
on the barbie."

320
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,331
Oh, that's... that's an Australian
saying. New Zealand...

321
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,561
Throw another shrimp
on the barbie.

322
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,627
Crikey! Wha!

323
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,606
What do you guys say
we take this party upstairs?

324
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,304
Ho. I'd say... yes.

325
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,075
Uh well, what room
are you guys in?

326
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,742
- Um, 12...
- 1206.

327
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,751
- 1206.
- 12-zero-6. Write it down, Bret.

328
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,844
- 1206...
- Be... be tidy about it.

329
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,346
I like your "2."
It's nice.

330
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,484
So what is water polo?

331
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,154
It's like polo
but in the water.

332
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,720
On sea horses?

333
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,595
No, just swimming.

334
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,067
Oh, okay. Beautiful
swimming ladies.

335
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,229
Yeah, swimming
in the water,

336
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,569
- beautiful ladies.
- Wow.

337
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,699
Like mermaids.

338
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,371
Yes. Like mermaids.

339
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,116
# Mermaids #

340
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,786
# Mermaid #

341
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,954
# Mermaid #

342
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,556
# Mermaid #

343
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,090
- # Mermaid #
- # Mermaid #

344
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,330
- # Mermaid #
- # Mermaid #

345
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,838
# Mermaid, mermaid #

346
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,364
- # Mermaid #
- # Mermaid #

347
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,036
# Mermaid murmur #

348
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,944
# Into my ear #

349
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,278
# The answers
to questions #

350
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,251
# I'm longing
to hear #

351
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,777
# Does it relax you to hear
the sound of the land? #

352
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,717
# Do you, oh mermaid,
have slightly webbed hands? #

353
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,751
- Eww.
- # Ahh #

354
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,128
# Is it normal for a guy
to wear SCUBA apparatus #

355
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,963
- # When he makes love in the sea? #
- # Make love to me #

356
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,764
# Would it
be weird for you #

357
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,170
# If I touch your fishy half?
I know it would be for me #

358
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,183
# Do you have
mermaid parties #

359
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,778
- # Beneath the sea? #
- # Am I invited? #

360
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,722
# At these mermaid parties,
do you smoke seaweed? #

361
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,918
# If so, then how
do you light it? #

362
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,826
# Are you the answer to a drunken
sailor's Ionely wish? #

363
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,625
# Wish wish wish wish #

364
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,996
# Or are you an optical
illusion caused by #

365
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,560
# A woman sitting on a rock
holding half a fish? #

366
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,298
# Half a sexy fish. #

367
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,009
What's the time?

368
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,421
It's 4:35.

369
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,620
Mmm. You did tell them
room 1206, right?

370
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,560
Yeah, you were there.
I wrote it down.

371
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,359
Ah. Hmm.

372
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,923
Bret, do you
think maybe...

373
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,594
they're not coming,
maybe?

374
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,933
- What?
- Well...

375
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,303
we've been waiting
for five hours.

376
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,503
Hmm, maybe.

377
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,171
Do you feel like
a sparkling water?

378
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,806
Yeah, I'd love one.
I wanted one three hours ago,

379
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,146
but you said
Murray wouldn't let us.

380
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,482
Hang on a minute.

381
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,617
Murray?

382
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,353
- What?
- Are you sleeping?

383
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,920
Oh, I was, Bret.
Trying to, anyway.

384
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,828
- You comfortable?
- No.

385
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,833
- How's your party?
- Mmm, it's all right.

386
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,994
It's just Jemaine and me.
The girls didn't show up.

387
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,163
Aw. Never mind, eh?

388
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,639
Jemaine and I were wondering if we could
have a sparkling water.

389
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,766
- No.
- We really need it.

390
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,071
- No!
- Please?

391
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,236
- Not from the minibar.
- Please.

392
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,677
- No.
- Please.

393
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,873
Look, just pour some tap water
and blow some bubbles in it.

394
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,008
Mmm, it's not the same.

395
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,143
Come on, I want to
come out there.

396
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,916
Mmm, well the girls
still might show up.

397
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,855
Okay.

398
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,192
- Good night.
- Night night.

399
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,336
Okay, hang on a minute, guys.
I haven't settled the bill yet.

400
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,701
Just a few questions.

401
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,763
We didn't have anything
from the minibar.

402
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,641
No, I can see that, Bret.
"Minibar charge, 0.00."

403
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,377
Right here after "Drinks charged
to the room from hotel bar, $352."

404
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,350
How much was that water?

405
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,181
- The water was free.
- Hang on, mates!

406
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,778
Someone wants me
to move my car.

407
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,482
- Band meeting! I'm just...
- Waters were about $175.

408
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,423
I'm doing a...

409
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,949
- Here we are, two waters.
- Is that your signature?

410
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,518
- Mmm?
- Right there?

411
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,086
Oh no,
that's my autograph.

412
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,758
Yup, same... that's what
a signature is.

413
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,198
Okay, and there's
the room number.

414
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,462
- Uh...
- Oh is that...

415
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,470
Hang on, mate!

416
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,994
- Okay.
- Look, do us a favor and move the car.

417
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,300
- Go on, quickly.
- Oh, that's...

418
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,103
Go! Move the car.

419
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,275
This is your doing,
isn't it, Rod Stewart?

420
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,609
- You can tell.
- It wasn't me, actually.

421
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,478
The dead giveaway.
Look at all that money.

422
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,882
It was a women's
water polo team.

423
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,818
Okay, right,
that makes sense.

424
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,650
I'll tell them that.
"Yeah, sorry,

425
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,519
it was polo players."

426
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,115
Must happen
all the time, does it?

427
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,150
Well, I doubt if they're
gonna listen to you.

428
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,422
Is this a joke,
Jemaine?

429
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,693
- No.
- A big joke? $352 water polo joke?

430
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,667
- No.
- Let me just go and fix it, shall I?

431
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,998
Give me the keys.

432
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,936
Oh, they're in the car.

433
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,461
Idiot.

434
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,202
- Um, did you put the hand brake on?
- Is it...

435
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,676
Oh, flub.

436
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,473
I just don't understand
what happened.

437
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,072
I put the hand brake on.

438
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,311
Well that's what happened.
The Amer... on American cars,

439
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,841
the hand brake's
on this side.

440
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,649
Oh, I must have just
adjusted the seat.

441
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,747
Oh, very rock 'n' roll,
Bret.

442
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,348
More rock 'n' roll
than Jemaine.

443
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,360
That's what you were
going for, wasn't it?

444
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,919
Well, well done.
Mission accomplished.

445
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,091
First Jemaine
with the mixed nuts,

446
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,465
then the TV.

447
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,529
And finally, Bret, you drive my Honda
into the pool!

448
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,708
Personally, I prefer
the mixed nuts caper.

449
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,835
- At least that was original.
- Thank you.

450
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,369
Murray, I didn't actually
mean to put your car

451
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,711
into the swimming pool.

452
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,477
I didn't... I didn't mean
to buy those nuts.

453
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,179
Well, I didn't mean
to put all my efforts

454
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,245
into looking after a couple
of leather-clad lunatics

455
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,086
who don't give a damn about anyone
but themselves.

456
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,853
That's my mistake.

457
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,657
Well, we all... we've all
made a mistake each,

458
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,891
so it sort of
evens out.

459
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,831
No!
Okay, guys?

460
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,460
Look, the strategic union
of Flight of the Conchords

461
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,027
and Murray Hewitt Productions
is terminated.

462
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,539
- What are you talking about?
- What?

463
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,904
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm quitting!

464
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,535
You can't quit the band.
Bret usually quits the band.

465
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,067
Well, this is
my turn, okay?

466
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,739
I've had it
with you guys!

467
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,372
I'm so angry
I feel like swearing.

468
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,383
Oh Murray,
you wouldn't swear at us.

469
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,783
Go fuck yourself, Bret!

470
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,123
N-J-U-W-W-P-T!
Whoo!

471
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,353
Whoo!

472
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,894
Do you have
any money for a bus?

473
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,457
No, do you?

474
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,332
No, none.

475
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,765
I guess there's
no choice, really.

476
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,208
So, uh, have you
and Mel been...

477
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,678
following us
through this whole...

478
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,080
during this whole tour...
tour, Doug?

479
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,675
Uh, it seems like it.

480
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,686
Mel's in charge
of the itinerary.

481
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,814
She said she just wanted
to get away on a road trip,

482
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,290
get away from it all.

483
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,849
That him?

484
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,555
Uh, no that's just
some homeless guy.

485
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,463
Oh no, that is him!
Slow down, Doug.

486
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,500
We're very sorry,
Murray.

487
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,061
I'm not talking
to you guys.

488
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,367
Just give this to him.

489
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,398
Bret says just
give this to you.

490
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,307
Oh, what's that?
A bag of stolen clock radios

491
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,936
from the hotels
we stayed at?

492
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,038
- No.
- Tell him to look inside.

493
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,811
Bret says, "Just tell him
to look in it."

494
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,962
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

495
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,093
- Huh?
- It's a little big.

496
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,603
But get it wet and it
snugs up, it'll shrink...

497
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,832
shrink to fit.

498
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,999
Yeah, I can't even
get mine off.

499
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,707
You know, I've...
I've done a lot of thinking

500
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,646
that last 40 minutes when I was
walking along the side of the road

501
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,048
like a bum.
I kind of realized

502
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,485
I'm not a very
good manager.

503
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,954
Ah. So? I mean,
that's not true.

504
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,116
Thanks, Jemaine.

505
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,682
But it is.

506
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,457
There there.

507
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,132
There there there
there there there.

508
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,336
Friends again?
Back in the band?

509
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,636
If you'll have me.

510
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,369
We will.
We do.

511
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,673
What about you, Jemaine?
Will you have me?

512
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,145
Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,340
Yup.

514
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,908
- What's...
- Then you put your...

515
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,215
- Potato?
- You...

516
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,381
- One potato, two...
- No, just leave it.

517
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,789
Come on, we've got a gig.
We've got a gig to get to.

518
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,793
Let's go!

519
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,421
Did you miss me?

520
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,258
- Little bit.
- Little bit, eh?

521
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,425
Yeah.

522
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,695
- Jemaine?
- What?

523
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,464
- Miss me?
- Oh...

524
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,505
This isn't Central Park.

525
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,033
Yes it is.
It's a central park.

526
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,046
It's not
Central Park, though.

527
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,479
But it is
a central park.

528
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,073
But you said Central Park,
New York.

529
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,448
I said a central park
in Newark...

530
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,316
- New Jersey.
- You did?

531
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,551
- No, you didn't. You didn't.
- Yes, I said, "A central park

532
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,491
- in Newark."
- So you were tricking us.

533
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,496
No. Well, look. If I'd have said it was
a central park in Newark,

534
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,124
- you wouldn't have done the gig.
- Yes, we would have.

535
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,963
Well, what are you
worried about, then?

536
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,671
Hello, Shelly? Oh look, I can't
actually talk right now.

537
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,940
Why? Because I'm in
the middle of doing something.

538
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,947
Managing a band, actually,

539
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,643
a little band called
Flight of the Conchords.

540
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,242
Yeah yeah.

541
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,220
'Cause that's what
I do, all right?

542
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,449
Got it? Good.

543
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,263
Sorry, Shel, I didn't mean to...

544
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,232
oh, yes, sir. Yes.

545
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,667
Yes. Listen, um, the reason I haven't
been at work all week

546
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,035
is, uh... well, it's funny really.

547
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,973
I tripped over, and both of my leg...

548
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,273
uh, muscles have...
well, they contracted

549
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,145
and I didn't know what... no. No.

550
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,876
I don't manage a band.

551
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,406
It has nothing to do with a band.

552
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,078
Honestly, it's my legs.

553
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,919
I think I've broken a piece of them.

554
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,084
Yes.

555
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,251
No, there's nothing

556
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,385
going on in the background.

557
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,828
Okay.

558
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,900
Yes. I'll be in first thing.
