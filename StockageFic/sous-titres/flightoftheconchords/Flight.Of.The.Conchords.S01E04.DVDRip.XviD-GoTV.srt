1
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,500
Hey, Murray.
Nice shorts.

2
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,909
Okay, guys, time for the
interesting buildings tour.

3
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,709
This week
it's band rotundas.

4
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,114
Ugh. It should be called
the "boring buildings tour."

5
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,449
- Why?
- Because it's boring.

6
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,716
It's not boring.
There's a real buzz about it.

7
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,246
- Everyone's talking about these tours.
- Who's talking about it?

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,088
Bret, you were talking
about it last week.

9
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,991
- I was saying it's boring.
- Oh, were you?

10
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,427
Well, you were still
talking about it.

11
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,658
Murray, I can't go this week.
I'm going on a date.

12
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,996
- What? A date?
- A date with a girl from work.

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,628
- What are you gonna do?
- I think we're gonna watch a DVD.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,638
Bret, I've had this
organized for ages.

15
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,970
You knew about that.
I was gonna tell you the difference

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,306
between, you know,
gazebos and band shells.

17
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,072
Yeah, Bret,
you've got to come.

18
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,909
Why don't we just postpone the tour,
just go next week?

19
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,915
It's not as easy as that!
I've got the schedule.

20
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,908
Look, it's all time-tabled.
I made those for you.

21
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,855
"Friday, 4:05 P. M: Bret, Jemaine and
Murray leave Dave's shop."

22
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,321
Well, I guess I'll just have to go
with you, Jemaine. Just the two of us.

23
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,330
Ah. Except
I just remembered

24
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,229
that I also can't go.

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,234
Why? I suppose you've
got a date as well, have you?

26
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,667
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah?

27
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,331
- Where'd you meet her?
- At... at the library.

28
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,670
Library?
What library?

29
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,335
- Video library.
- Ha-ha-ha!

30
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,844
Video library.
No such thing.

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,177
Gotcha.
No, that's fine.

32
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,740
I'll go on my own.
That's fine.

33
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,378
Enjoy your date, Bret, and your
pretend date, Jemaine.

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,752
All right? The video library...
that's fine.

35
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,780
I won't say goodbye,
I don't feel like it.

36
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,416
See you, Murray.

37
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,223
- Bye, Murray.
- Bye. You gonna say "bye"?

38
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,288
No!

39
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,132
The carrots
were really nice.

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,139
And the broccoli was
really nice as well.

41
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,300
Yeah.

42
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,139
It did turn out
really nice.

43
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,441
Yeah, really nice.
It was really nice.

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,470
Yeah, it was
really nice.

45
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,785
Like your eyes...

46
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,913
I could look
at them for ages.

47
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,753
The eggs were really nice
like your lips.

48
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,589
So... your lips
look delicious like...

49
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,062
as delicious
as the eggs.

50
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,962
Probably more delicious.

51
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,738
Do... do you want
to kiss me?

52
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,171
Oh yes, please.

53
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,309
Are we gonna watch
a DVD or what?

54
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,506
I think it might be a bit late for
a DVD, man.

55
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,517
No, it's okay. We just have to keep
the volume down

56
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,849
because my roommate
is sleeping.

57
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,184
No, well, we should
probably get home.

58
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,849
It's pretty late.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,222
Well, maybe I'll stay
a little bit longer.

60
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,886
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

61
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,556
Do you wanna... you could stay over
if... if you want?

62
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,565
No, I don't
want to stay over.

63
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,328
No, we should
get going.

64
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,962
I don't know... why don't
I stay and you go?

65
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,131
No, it's okay, I don't mind.
I'll stay here.

66
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,936
Whatever you want.

67
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,028
Hey, Jemaine, I've written this
love song for Coco.

68
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,533
- Oh yeah?
- Would you be able to have a listen?

69
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,127
- Give me a bit of feedback?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,831
It's good,
it's good.

71
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,870
# I'd climb
the highest mountain #

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,610
# I'd swim
the deepest ocean #

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,710
# I'd walk along
the longest path #

74
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,785
# To be with you #

75
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,121
# If you want me to... #

76
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,457
# I'd solve
the hardest puzzle #

77
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,464
# And read
the boringest book #

78
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,661
# I'd hold
the hottest substance #

79
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,935
# Solve
the hardest puzzle #

80
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,604
# And race
the fastest animal #

81
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,807
# Eat the biggest meal #

82
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,475
# To be with you #

83
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,282
# Co... co. #

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,016
It's a bit long.

85
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,854
- Okay.
- It's two hours long.

86
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,417
Yeah.
Anything else?

87
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,986
Um, yeah.

88
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,022
Let's see...

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,401
Okay.

90
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,415
Okay. "I'd climb
the highest mountain."

91
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,475
- Would you actually do that?
- Probably not.

92
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,487
Well, you're sort of
promising that you would.

93
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
- That's a metaphor.
- Oh, is it? Oh okay.

94
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,748
- Yeah.
- What's it a metaphor for?

95
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,817
For... that I'd do
anything for her.

96
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,987
Would you climb the highest
mountain for her?

97
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,156
Oh God.
I see.

98
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,063
No. Pass me that?

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,261
No, I wouldn't do
a lot of this stuff.

100
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,099
Would you swallow
a whole sword?

101
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,334
A sword... okay, I probably wouldn't
do that one either.

102
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,172
Yeah, maybe you should
make it more realistic things you'd do,

103
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,973
- some other things.
- Like what?

104
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,003
Uh, "I would
hang out with you."

105
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,982
- Oh, that's good. That's really...
- That's not bad.

106
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,417
That's a lyric of mine.
You can use that.

107
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,920
Just "hang out
with you."

108
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,512
What about making it
more personal?

109
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,922
Things about her that... what do you
know that's specific to Coco?

110
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,984
She has a rash that she
doesn't tell anyone about.

111
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,495
What... what else?

112
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,861
- She likes food.
- Yeah, okay.

113
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,661
Her flatmate
is called Stuart.

114
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,168
Yeah.
This is all good stuff.

115
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,606
All right, let's
get started, shall we?

116
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,268
Can I just say it's good to have
a lady's touch in the office?

117
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,107
Doesn't happen
very often.

118
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,672
All right, second annual
fan-club meeting.

119
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,910
- President.
- Present.

120
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,920
- Secretary.
- Present.

121
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,718
- Treasurer.
- Present!

122
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,123
- Maybe we should make that one title?
- Sure.

123
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,389
It's all... it's quite convoluted.
You're all three.

124
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,988
- Sure.
- And Murray, present.

125
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,193
All right, item one:
Any more fans?

126
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,532
No. Sorry, Murray.

127
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,470
- Really?
- No.

128
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,871
All right,
let's move on.

129
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,205
Item two:
The new newsletter.

130
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,177
Really good idea.
Like it.

131
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,405
- Thank you.
- Really good.

132
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,073
In fact, I've got
some photos here.

133
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,083
I took some of Bret...
well, actually I found them,

134
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,415
I... when I was
round at his flat.

135
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,216
- Oh-ho!
- That... he's asleep there,

136
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,587
and so you could
put those in the newsletter.

137
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,922
Mm-mm,
mm-mm-mmm! Mmm!

138
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,087
Oh my God.

139
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,466
- What's this one?
- Mmm?

140
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,799
- What's this one?
- God, how did that get in there? Sorry.

141
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,805
It must have slipped
in with the...

142
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,807
- do you want to hold onto that?
- No.

143
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,570
- No. So...
- So...

144
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,076
It's...

145
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
All right.
Item three.

146
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,111
Now if one of the band members was
to have a girlfriend...

147
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,139
Mmm.

148
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,278
...would you find that:
A) very positive;

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,346
- B) positive...
- Why do you... why do you ask?

150
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,791
- No reason.
- Has Bret got a girlfriend?

151
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,227
Yes, he's seeing
a girl from work...

152
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,127
Coco.

153
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,132
Oh.

154
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,125
Wow. Well, that's great
that Bret has a girlfriend.

155
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,263
- That's really great.
- You don't think Bret's

156
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,866
- any less available now that he's?
- Well, no!

157
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,205
No. Is she pretty?

158
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,608
You're still interested
in the band then, even though it's?

159
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,579
Yes, it's nice for Bret to have
a girlfriend.

160
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,808
- Good.
- Yes.

161
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,249
- All right. You sure?
- Yes!

162
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,377
- Is she stupid?
- You've still got Jemaine anyway.

163
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,388
- He's always available, isn't he?
- Yeah.

164
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,515
He's not gonna...
not gonna get a girlfriend anytime soon,

165
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,081
- so...
- Does, um...

166
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,116
- Try your chances with him, can't you?
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,029
Does... does Bret's girlfriend look
anything like me?

168
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,626
- Little bit?
- A little bit... around the eyes.

169
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,762
Oh yeah?
Big eyes, huh?

170
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,500
Well, she's...
she's got eyes.

171
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,735
Yeah.

172
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,908
- You want some more macaroni?
- No, I'm okay.

173
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,208
You sure.

174
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,738
I was gonna have some
fruit salad or something.

175
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,580
- Do you want anything?
- No, I'm fine.

176
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,520
Um, actually, I've...
I've written you a song, Coco.

177
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,955
Really? You didn't
need to do that.

178
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,583
Well, Jemaine helped.

179
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,116
That's so sweet.

180
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,128
It's called
"If You're Into It."

181
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,595
Okay.

182
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,437
# If you want me to #

183
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,669
# I can hang round
with you #

184
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,440
# If I only knew
that's what you're into #

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,641
# You and him,
him and you #

186
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,513
# If that's
what you're into #

187
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,542
# Him hanging round,
around you #

188
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,486
# You're hanging round...
yeah, you're there too #

189
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,979
# And if you want me to, I will
take off all my clothes for you #

190
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,459
# I'll take off all
my clothes for you #

191
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,894
# If that's what
you're into #

192
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,625
# How about him
in the nude? #

193
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,656
# If that's what
you're into #

194
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,668
# In the nude
in front of you #

195
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,693
# Is that what
you'd want to view? #

196
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,170
# If it's cool
with you #

197
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,503
# I'll let you
get naked too #

198
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,406
# It could be
a dream come true #

199
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,502
# Providing that's
what you are into #

200
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,536
# Is that what
you're into? #

201
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,811
# Him and you
in the nude #

202
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,612
# That's what
he's prepared to do #

203
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,812
# Is that the kind of thing that
you think you might be into? #

204
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,311
# And then maybe later we'll get hot by
the refrigerator #

205
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,086
# In the kitchen
next to the pantry #

206
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,423
# You think that might be
what you fancy? #

207
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,759
# In the buff,
being lewd #

208
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,992
# Doing stuff
with the food #

209
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,863
# Gettin' lewd
with his food #

210
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,766
# We heard that's
what you are into #

211
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,430
# Then on our next date #

212
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,439
# Well, you could bring
your roommate #

213
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,338
# I don't know
if Stu is keen to #

214
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,366
# But if you want
we could double-team you #

215
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,674
# How about you
and two dudes? #

216
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,578
# Him you and Stu
in the nude? #

217
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,879
# Bein' lewd with
two dudes with food #

218
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,646
# Well, that's if Stu's
into it too #

219
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,516
# All the things
I'd do #

220
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,681
# Things I'd do
for you #

221
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,384
# If I only knew #

222
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,415
# That's what
your into #

223
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,894
# Ooh. #

224
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,689
Thank you.
That was great.

225
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,464
- Thank you too, Jemaine.
- Oh, it was no problem.

226
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,698
So, what are we
gonna do now?

227
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,206
Well, we were gonna
go cycling.

228
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,209
- Yeah.
- Oh, were we?

229
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,473
Oh, great.

230
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,475
Kiss her, Bret.
Kiss her.

231
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,249
Hey Bret, I've been thinking
about these dates.

232
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,781
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

233
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,693
Yeah, actually, I was gonna say...
I was thinking that maybe...

234
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,594
I've been thinking,
you know, they're a bit...

235
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,826
- they're a bit girlie.
- Well, Coco's a girl.

236
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,131
Yeah, but I'm not, though. It's not just
you and her going on these dates,

237
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,333
I'm there too. So what about thinking
about something I might like to do,

238
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,399
like paintball? We could watch
a kickboxing championship.

239
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,673
- Um, yeah.
- You know, that sort of thing.

240
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,577
- Maybe...
- Or we could go to a strip bar?

241
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,672
She doesn't like... she doesn't
want to go to a strip bar again.

242
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,116
- I was actually wondering...
- We could go to just a topless bar.

243
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,142
There's just
topless bars as well.

244
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,155
But I was thinking
maybe her and I like...

245
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,022
Or she doesn't always have to come
as well. That's another option.

246
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,027
Me and you could go on
one of these date... oh, that'd be weird.

247
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,394
Yeah, I was thinking maybe just her
and I would go on a date without you.

248
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,092
Maybe.

249
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,330
- Why?
- Oh no, don't worry about it.

250
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,360
- No, come on. You brought it up, so...
- Well...

251
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,373
just 'cause I never get to
hang out with just her.

252
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,874
You hang out with her
all the time.

253
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,342
- Yeah, but you're always there.
- Oh, so are you.

254
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,038
You're always there.
I always see you there.

255
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,047
Yeah, I'm always there,
but she's my girlfriend.

256
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,572
Yes. Good point.
Yes, good point.

257
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,642
And, uh...

258
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,416
Coco said that the other night when
I went to the bathroom

259
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,253
that she felt like you...

260
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,419
- like made a move on her.
- Yep. Yep, guilty, I did.

261
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,520
But you weren't doing
anything, so I thought...

262
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,190
Yeah, but that's 'cause
you were there.

263
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,325
- Ah! Of course I was there.
- You can't do that.

264
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,665
You're definitely not coming
on my next date.

265
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,967
Okay. Well, that's fine.
That's all you needed to say.

266
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,666
Okay.

267
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,402
- Good night.
- Good night.

268
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,348
Look at that.

269
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,150
Classic
Robert Moses design.

270
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,919
See the band shell,
Jemaine?

271
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,892
Where's your
fact sheet?

272
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,417
You should be
checking this out.

273
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,929
I don't know,
I left it at home.

274
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,931
"Julius Caesar" was
done here in 1957.

275
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,523
- Really?
- Joseph Papp's.

276
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,057
- Oh.
- Amazing.

277
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,569
- Amazing.
- You think this is good?

278
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,366
You missed some of
the best band shells

279
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,771
and some awesome rotundas
when you were on all those dates.

280
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,298
Where's your
date tonight?

281
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,572
Uh, Bret asked me not to
come on his dates anymore.

282
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,842
- What? You were going on their dates?
- I know. Yeah.

283
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,610
You don't go on
other people's dates.

284
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,174
I thought you had
your own date.

285
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,776
No, I was dating them.

286
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,345
You don't do that.

287
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,483
- That's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

288
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,356
Are you okay?
Are your feelings hurt?

289
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,759
No.

290
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,422
- They must be. Are they?
- No.

291
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,953
- A little bit?
- No.

292
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,091
A little bit, eh?

293
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,102
- A little bit.
- Yeah, a little bit.

294
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,196
I knew it. Bret shouldn't have
a girlfriend. I told him.

295
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,207
- Did he listen?
- No.

296
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,903
No.
He doesn't listen.

297
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,845
I just hope we don't
have a Yoko Ono situation.

298
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

299
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,975
Is she trying to
split up the band?

300
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,884
She hasn't mentioned anything.
I don't think so... she's nice.

301
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,287
- Is she an artist?
- Don't know.

302
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,418
Does she like, you know,
staying in bed a lot?

303
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,195
I haven't
really noticed.

304
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,788
What about peace?
Is she into peace?

305
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,765
I don't know.

306
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,427
Look into that.

307
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,493
Now, Stuart Vaughan was
the director here.

308
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,472
Imagine that!
"Julius Caesar" in 1957.

309
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,599
I mean, the whole place
would have been full.

310
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,803
Come down and
touch it, Jemaine!

311
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,716
Hey, Bret,
is, um...

312
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,618
is Coco into art?

313
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,054
Yeah. Why?

314
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,548
- Uh, no reason.
- Mmm.

315
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,653
# Black-haired
lady queen #

316
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,665
# Dabbling in art #

317
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,599
# I won't let
the she-wolf #

318
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,298
# Tear us apart,
because I... #

319
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,966
- What's that song?
- Nothing, just a new song

320
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,374
called "She-wolf."

321
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,947
# Cold-hearted bitch #

322
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,575
# Diggin' a ditch... #

323
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,049
All I'm saying, Bret, is it could bring
unnecessary tension

324
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,556
to the band's dynamic.

325
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,685
Like this pencil...
Iook.

326
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,958
Jeez, that is a...

327
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,525
That's it... that's
your band. Broken.

328
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,401
It happens to
all the best bands.

329
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,999
All right? Girlfriends and music
just don't mix very well.

330
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,669
Jemaine's nodding
in approval.

331
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,246
By the way,
how is Coco?

332
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,043
- She's great. We're really in love.
- Yeah?

333
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,312
- It's... yeah, it's awesome.
- She seems really nice.

334
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,978
- Yeah, she's amazing.
- Yeah.

335
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,613
Hold onto her.
Okay?

336
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,324
It's a rare thing,
what you've got there.

337
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,260
- Hi, I'm not disturbing you guys, am I?
- Hey, Coco.

338
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,526
- No, come in.
- We're busy at the moment actually.

339
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,227
Oh, okay. I just popped in to
bring you some lunch.

340
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,168
- Oh good.
- Favoritism.

341
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,034
- Here's yours, Jemaine.
- Thank you.

342
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,006
You're welcome.
Murray.

343
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,564
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

344
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,599
- Bret.
- Thanks, Coco.

345
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,703
You didn't need to do that.
That's great.

346
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,873
While I'm here, I thought I would
show you this.

347
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,874
Um, I had some spare time
last night, and...

348
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,319
I thought it might be useful.

349
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,947
Whoa,
that's awesome.

350
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,688
- Well, it's really arty.
- It's cool.

351
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,593
We've already got
a poster that I did.

352
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,261
Oh, okay. Oh, that's... that's all right.

353
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,293
That's cool. That's great,
it's... it's better.

354
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,398
Um, I just thought...
that's no problem.

355
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,341
Um, well, I should
let you guys...

356
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,345
I should go, let you
guys get on with it.

357
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,244
- No you should stay, you should stay.
- Oh no no no...

358
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,440
- Yeah yeah.
- I should go.

359
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,813
- You should stay.
- I insist.

360
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,284
Look, take a seat.
You've brought us lunch.

361
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,412
All right, we'll only be
five minutes, all right?

362
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,081
- At least.
- Yeah, sit down, sit down.

363
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,420
Okay okay okay.

364
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,425
Okay.

365
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,620
Right,
"slight delay."

366
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,498
And also present,
Coco.

367
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,761
Yoko.

368
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,268
What did you...
what did you say?

369
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,827
Oh nothing, just had
a bit of a cough.

370
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,100
Mmm, okay.

371
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,404
No, it wasn't a real cough.
I said "Yoko."

372
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,535
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Oh, I should go.

373
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,977
Why did you say that?
'Cause she's nothing like Yoko.

374
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,674
Oh-no, she isn't.

375
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,013
Jemaine, you're putting
"oh no" together to sound like "Ono."

376
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,416
- Oh-no, I didn't.
- You did it again.

377
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,044
- Oh-no, did I?
- Did you pick that up?

378
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,055
- He's doing it.
- All right, I'm gonna go.

379
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,523
Yeah. I'll throw this sandwich in your
face if you say that again.

380
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,617
Bret, don't you dare.
Not in my office.

381
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,629
Coco, sit down.
Let's resolve this.

382
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,460
Jemaine,
what's the problem?

383
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,661
Well, Yoko's trying
to split up the band.

384
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,168
- Bret?
- Jemaine's upset

385
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,034
because I asked him not
to come on our dates

386
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,905
and he's misinterpreting his feelings
about being left out of the friendship

387
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,034
- as being about the band.
- Oh, as if.

388
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,341
It's the one I said about Yoko trying to
split up the band.

389
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,745
Sorry, guys, I just realized
I'm late for work.

390
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,976
Um, it was
really cool seeing you.

391
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,985
What are you working on?
Splitting up another band?

392
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,544
- Oh! Here!
- A sandwich hit my face.

393
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,715
Yeah, well, I said I'd throw
a sandwich at your face.

394
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,317
I've never seen such bad behavior
at one of my meetings!

395
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,021
- Don't be such a... a dickhead.
- Yeah well, I'm quitting this band.

396
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,223
- Yeah.
- Well, you quit last week.

397
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,494
- Yeah well, I'm quitting again.
- Don't be a quitter! You can't!

398
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,467
- Yeah, you quitter.
- Right, well, go on then.

399
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,367
You've never been interested
in bands anyway, Bret.

400
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,269
You only came to one
of the band rotunda tours.

401
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,830
Yeah, I'll see you later,
dickheads.

402
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,603
You're the dickhead,
Bret!

403
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,974
Sorry, everyone.

404
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,979
It was a visa
application denied.

405
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,174
It took a long time
to try and get resolved.

406
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,650
I think the guy's
a criminal.

407
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,448
Sorry.

408
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,216
Just carry on.

409
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,246
It's looking good.

410
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,752
Good riddance,
eh, Jemaine?

411
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,024
I've got tomato
on my sleeve.

412
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,496
See? I told you.

413
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,625
Girlfriends and bands
just don't mix, Jemaine.

414
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,431
You'll never have
a girlfriend, will you?

415
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,994
No.

416
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,268
All right, let's just
move on. Item two:

417
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,104
Band uniforms.

418
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,634
I want all the band
to wear the same unif...

419
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,578
oh, that's...

420
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,808
Do you miss Bret?

421
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,409
A little bit.
Do you?

422
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,216
Same.
I miss him.

423
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,585
Can you ask him
back in the band?

424
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,289
Okay.

425
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,296
Bret? Bret?

426
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,983
Dear Jemaine,
by the time you read this,

427
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,180
I will be far far away
at Coco's house

428
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,085
and I will no longer
be residing...

429
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,925
and that is just one of the reasons
why I'm moving out.

430
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,689
You didn't seem to
understand that...

431
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,629
And the most important
thing for me to say is that...

432
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,492
Do you remember
the time that seagull...

433
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,699
Yours sincerely,
Bret.

434
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,744
# Lives are like
retractable pencils #

435
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,247
# If you push 'em too hard,
they're gonna break #

436
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,551
# And people are like
paper dolls #

437
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:33,556
# Paper dolls and people,
they're a similar shape #

438
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,931
# Mm-mm, mm-mm #

439
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,960
# Love is like
a roll of tape #

440
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,170
# It's real good for
making two things one #

441
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,638
# But just like
that roll of tape #

442
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,854
# Love sometimes breaks off
before you are done #

443
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,255
# Another way that love
is similar to tape #

444
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,321
# That I've noticed #

445
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,062
# Is sometimes it's
hard to see the end #

446
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,964
- # You search on the roll #
- # You search on the roll #

447
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,906
- # You search on the roll #
- # You're searchin' round the roll #

448
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,001
# You search
with your fingernail #

449
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,980
# Again and again
and again and again #

450
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,884
- # And again #
- # Whoa-oah #

451
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,717
# Brown paper,
white paper #

452
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:35,716
# Stick it together with
the tape... the tape of love #

453
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,924
# The sticky stuff... #

454
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,637
- Bret.
- Hey, man.

455
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,271
What are you doing here?

456
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,250
Murray and I miss you and we want you
to rejoin the band again.

457
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,945
Really?

458
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,250
Yeah.
On one condition.

459
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,256
That you...

460
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,281
I'm not gonna
kill her, man.

461
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,191
No, just leave...
just leave her, not...

462
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,821
Oh no, I'm not gonna leave her.
I told you that.

463
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,297
You know, I like the band,
but no, I'm not leaving Coco.

464
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,527
I wouldn't mind,

465
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,091
- I mean if that's what you really want.
- Shush, baby.

466
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,467
- I don't really see us a long-term...
- Shush.

467
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,870
So what's it
gonna be, Bret?

468
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,341
The girl
or the band?

469
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,344
Well, it's gonna
be Coco.

470
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,506
Oh. Are you sure?

471
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,607
- Yeah.
- Oh, I thought you...

472
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,642
I was sure you were
gonna say the band.

473
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,144
No, I'm staying
with Coco.

474
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,786
I guess you can still
be in the band.

475
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,318
Okay. Great.

476
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,921
- Okay.
- Cool.

477
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,956
- Okay, well I'll see you later.
- I'll see you at band practice.

478
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,162
Actually, I'm gonna wait
till the bus stops,

479
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,264
and then I'll get off.

480
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,571
# Brown paper,
white paper #

481
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:06,516
# Stick it together with
the tape... the tape of love #

482
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,678
- # The sticky stuff #
- # Ooh #

483
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,154
# Ooh-hoo! #

484
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,625
# People people, paper paper,
paper paper, people people #

485
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,024
# People people,

486
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,426
# Pencil pencil,
paper paper #

487
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,952
# Put the pencil
to the paper #

488
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,624
# Give the paper
to the people #

489
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,567
# Let the people read about the
cellotape, oh, baby baby, yeah... #

490
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,731
You know, Jemaine,
I've been thinking about love,

491
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,439
and I guess it's the very strongest
adhesive.

492
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,842
Oh, sorry, Bret, were you talking to me?
I was humming.

493
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,047
- What did you say?
- Oh, doesn't matter.

494
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,318
# Brown paper,
white paper #

495
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,589
# Stick it together with

496
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,654
# Oh, the sticky stuff #

497
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,597
# Yeah!
Oh, brown... #

498
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,796
# Brown paper,

499
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,863
# Stick it together with

500
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,205
- # Stick... stick it together #
- # Ooh-hoo... #

501
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:09,236
# Stick stick stick it
together, yeah. #
