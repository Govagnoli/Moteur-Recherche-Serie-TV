1
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,469
Good news, man.
Got some groceries.

2
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,278
- Really?
- Yeah, I got some good stuff.

3
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,807
Think you'll
like that.

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,047
- A sandwich?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,249
That looks good.

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,453
- Some jam looks good.
- Mmm.

7
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,688
That looks quite
good as well.

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,788
This is great.
How did you afford this?

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,095
Um, oh it was free.

10
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,124
- Free?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,134
- How come it was free?
- Eh?

12
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,970
I found it.

13
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,068
It was on the street.
Someone didn't want it.

14
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,540
What are you doing, man?
That's a good sandwich.

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,212
I was gonna spit it out,
but I think I'll just eat it.

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,721
We're poor, man.

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,348
We are poor, aren't we?

18
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,791
# Inner-city life,
inner-city pressure #

19
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,795
# The concrete world
is starting to get ya #

20
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,956
# The city is alive,
the city is expanding #

21
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,692
# Living in the city
can be demanding #

22
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,962
# You've pawned everything,
everything you own #

23
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,231
# Your toothbrush jar
and a camera phone #

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,135
# You don't know where you're going,
you cross the street #

25
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,265
# You don't know why you did,
you walk back across the street #

26
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,276
# Standing in the sitting
room totally skint #

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,471
# And your favorite jersey
is covered in lint #

28
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,275
# You want to sit down
but you've sold your chair #

29
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,010
# So you...
you just stand there #

30
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,377
# You just stand there #

31
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,617
# Just stand there! #

32
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,093
# Inner...

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,289
# Inner-city pressure #

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,924
# Inner-city pressure #

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,264
# Counting coins on
the counter of the Seven-11 #

36
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,360
# From a quarter past 6:00
to a quarter to 7:00 #

37
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,837
# The manager, Bevan,
starts to abuse me #

38
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,807
# Hey, man,
I just want some muesli #

39
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,934
# Neon signs,
hidden messages #

40
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,877
# Questions, answers,
fetishes #

41
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,903
# You know you're not
in high finance #

42
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,108
# Considering
secondhand underpants #

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,050
# Check your mind,
how'd it get so bad? #

44
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,950
# What happened to those
other underpants you had? #

45
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,251
# Look in your pockets,
haven't found a cent yet #

46
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,314
- # Landlord's on your balls #
- # Have you paid your rent yet? #

47
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,350

53
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,822
# So you think maybe
you'll be a prostitute #

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,055
# Just to pay for your lessons,
you're learning the flute #

55
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,188
# Ladies wouldn't pay you
very much for this #

56
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,358
# Looks like you'll never
be a concert flautist #

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,867
# You don't measure up
to the expectation #

58
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,199
# When you're unemployed
there's no vacation #

59
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,102
# No one cares,
no one sympathizes #

60
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,869

69
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,411
- Murray.
- Oh, guys.

70
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,382
What are you doing here?
This is not a scheduled band meeting.

71
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,576
Are you busy?

72
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,950
I'm just reading about
the old toothbrush fence.

73
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,319
50 brushes now.

74
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,985
Pretty impressive, huh?

75
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,153
Murray,
we need some money.

76
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,925
Okay.
How much?

77
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,558
I got about
$4 in here.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,363
$4?
I thought we had $10?

79
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,960
This box cost $6.

80
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,302
- What was wrong with the bag?
- The bag was useless, Bret.

81
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,863
It had a great
big hole in it.

82
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,137
Must have lost about
$20 out of that bag.

83
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,201
It's the box now.

84
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,338
Do you like it?
I chose it.

85
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,008
Well, can we have
the $4?

86
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,449
Well, there'll be
nothing in the box.

87
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,216
Here's the $4.
I got 27 ¢ here.

88
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,813
Yeah.

89
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,449
That's it.
That's the lot of it.

90
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,517
Actually, I'm owed
12% of that.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,858
Hang on,
let's have a look.

92
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,699
Okay, 51.24 cents.

93
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,326
- We can't even divide...
- Just leave it.

94
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,802
- You take it all.
- Maybe a quarter.

95
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,304
Look, I tell you what,
I feel bad.

96
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,069
I haven't got you paid gigs for a while.
Here you go.

97
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,837
Take this.

98
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,742
$50.

99
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,576
You can't give us
your own money.

100
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,411
Well, yeah, you're right.
It is my last $50.

101
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,576
Till Thursday, I mean,
you know.

102
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,280
- Getting paid again, but...
- Have we sold any T-shirts?

103
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,380
- Two.
- What about mousepads?

104
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,890
- No.
- Haven't sold any mousepads?

105
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,482
I told you...
terrible idea.

106
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,153
I don't know what
to do with them.

107
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,321
I've got so many mousepads at home
because of your bad idea, Bret.

108
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,024
What do you do
with mousepads?

109
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,761
I've lined Toby's kennel with them.
He keeps eating them.

110
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,996
I tried to waterproof
the kitchen.

111
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,765
Well, we need
some cash.

112
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,103
Maybe you guys should think about
supplementing your band income

113
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,836
by getting another job,
like I do with this job.

114
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,436
Murray, the prime
minister's office

115
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,743
wants to talk to you about the World
Trade Expo next week.

116
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,510
Can you tell them I'll
ring them straight back?

117
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,142
I've just got a couple
of businessmen here.

118
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,653
Everybody knows you manage a band
during office hours, Murray.

119
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,917
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Greg.

120
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,924
I wear that T-shirt
all the time.

121
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,519
Greg, we've still got
mousepads, actually.

122
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,052
No thanks, Murray.

123
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,656
See? Hopeless.

124
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,328
The job is you have to hold up this sign

125
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,432
and you have to make sure

126
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,705
it points in
the right direction.

127
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,544
Now, does that sound like
something you can do?

128
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,017
Sounds like something
a lamppost could do.

129
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,382
- That's all.
- You know what?

130
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,752
You're sign material.
This guy overthinks things.

131
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,349
Okay? You can't
overthink in this business.

132
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,882
You cannot.

133
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,484
What if a wind comes

134
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,156
and blows it away?
You ever think of that,

135
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,222
Enrico Fermi?

136
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,131
Oh we can hold it.
It won't be a problem.

137
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,931
You have
the right attitude.

138
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,904
You have what
I like to call...

139
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,337
the wrong attitude.

140
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,766
# All the hotties
at the party #

141
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,778
# Shaking all of
your booties #

142
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,040
# Yeah. #

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,412
Jemaine, I need to
go to sleep now.

144
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,077
Bret, do you think it should be,
"Shake their booties, yeah,"

145
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,608
or "Shake
their boobies, yeah"?

146
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,518
'Cause when I think
of shake your booties,

147
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,750
I think of those little
boots that babies wear.

148
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,759
You know, those little
woolen boots that they wear.

149
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,489
You know, babies wear those
little woolen boots.

150
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,996
- Yeah.
- Like shake your booties.

151
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,657
I don't know, man.
I've got work in the morning.

152
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,165
I need to go to sleep.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,168
I can't believe you got
that job and I didn't.

154
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,635
You need to work
on your people skills.

155
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,103
Yeah, shut up, Bret.

156
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,446
- Hey, man.
- Oh, hey, Bret.

157
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,476
I bought the chairs
back off of Dave.

158
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,249
You're kind of late
for band practice.

159
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,382
Sorry, man, we had
some after work drinks with Eddie.

160
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,824
Yeah, well you could have
told me, so...

161
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,725
Should we do
some more practice?

162
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,560
Bret, it's 7:00. I've been practicing
for four hours.

163
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,293
Well, what are you
doing now?

164
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,062
Well, it's
my free time now.

165
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,092
I'm gonna do some
of my leisure activities.

166
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,264
I'm gonna sit down
over there for a bit

167
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,967
and then I'm gonna do
some light reading.

168
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,998
Well, if it's your free time,
let's do some more practice.

169
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,273
You could have practiced too,
if you were here,

170
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,371
but you weren't,
so sorry.

171
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,750
- What are you doing?
- I'm just, you know,

172
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,616
sitting down.
It's my free time.

173
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,985
I can do whatever I like.
This is what I like to do.

174
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,225
- Hello, Bret.
- What are you guys doing here?

175
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,826
- Emergency band meeting.
- I'm working. This is my work.

176
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,564
You're not working,
you're just holding a sign.

177
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,663
- Public foot path.
- This is my work. Get out of here.

178
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,674
Come on,
band meeting.

179
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,608
- Bret.
- Present.

180
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,304
- Jemaine.
- Present.

181
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,108
Murray, present.

182
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,775
And good news anyway. The Trade
and Migrant Expo, it's been okayed.

183
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,910
New Zealand wants you to
be in their stall.

184
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,715
What's the Trade
and Migrant Expo?

185
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,222
Well, they're stalls from all the
different countries of the world.

186
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,384
And the Australians, as
always, have got their stall

187
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,222
right next to
the New Zealand stall.

188
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,058
But this year,
with you guys playing,

189
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,291
we're gonna blow those Aussies
out of the water. I can't wait.

190
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,696
Bloody showoffs.

191
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,600
- When is that?
- Uh, Thursday 3:00 P.M.

192
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,866
No, I can't go.
I've got work.

193
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,634
- I finish at 2:00. I don't know.
- You got to go, it's a gig.

194
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,164
What's more important?
The band or your job?

195
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,576
Yeah well, I got the job
'cause we didn't have any gigs.

196
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,080
How can I give you a gig
if you've got this job?

197
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,913
Yeah, but that's why I got the job...
'cause there were no gigs.

198
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,181
Well, I can't get you a gig if you're
gonna always go and do a job.

199
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,984
Yeah, but that's... I needed the job
'cause there were no gigs.

200
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,184
Well, I've got you a gig,
so what's with the job?

201
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,693
Yeah, but that's...
that the thing. I got the job

202
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,490
because there were
no gigs, man.

203
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,895
It's a chicken-egg
situation.

204
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,025
What do you mean? What's...
what's he mean, chicken?

205
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,900
Well you know, "What came first,
the chicken or the egg?"

206
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,632
That's irrelevant,
isn't it?

207
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,640
It's stupid.
The chicken, obviously.

208
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,437
Well, where did
the chicken come from?

209
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,466
Well, it came from the...

210
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,173
- Oh.
- You see, the egg.

211
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,011
You're the egg. You're a bad egg,
all right?

212
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,076
You've derailed this meeting
with another obscure comment.

213
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,087
Well, I could just record
my part on tape, I guess,

214
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,748
and Jemaine
could play along.

215
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,883
Tape?
A cassette tape?

216
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,155
No, you can't
do that, Bret.

217
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,458
I'm not happy
with that.

218
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,392
Those hot dogs
any good?

219
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,230
- Yeah, they're good.
- How much?

220
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,736
- $2.
- How many sauces?

221
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,998
Two.

222
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,562
You'd expect three sauces
for that, wouldn't you?

223
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,700
I got to get back
to work, guys.

224
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,510
And folks, please,
I'm sorry about the particles.

225
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,742
Don't breathe 'em in.
We don't know what they are.

226
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,273
I would suggest quick, short breaths.

227
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,786
Now, Georgina, I'm gonna
give you "Jewelry Sale," okay?

228
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,449
I'm gonna put you at
Broadway and Canal.

229
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
Now this is
basic stuff, okay?

230
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,484
You know this.

231
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,291
Bret, I'm gonna give you
something a little harder.

232
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,628
All right?
"Men's Suits."

233
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay?
Now, Matthew,

234
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,364
I want you to hold
the sign just like Bret.

235
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,394
- Bret, how are you holding it?
- I'm just holding it.

236
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,599
Exactly... just holding.
Coco, you're late.

237
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,302
Actually, Bret,
you know what?

238
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,071
I'm gonna give you
"Phones," all right?

239
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,102
I want you to show
Coco the ropes.

240
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,671
Coco, this is Bret.
All right, everybody,

241
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,683
really look alive
out there.

242
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,685
This could be
a launching pad for you.

243
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,017
People who hold
signs go on

244
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,649
to hold many things.

245
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,290
I'm in a band.

246
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,229
Cool.

247
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,959
What's your name again?

248
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,591
- Bret.
- Brit?

249
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,828
Bret.

250
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,928
- Brit?
- Bret.

251
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,462
Brit like...
like Brittany?

252
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,998
Ah, no,
B-R-E-T.

253
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,874
- Oh, Bret.
- Yeah.

254
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,674
It just sounds
like Brit.

255
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,510
I like your
English accent.

256
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,743
- New Zealand.
- Oh, from New Zealand.

257
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,378
- Yeah.
- I hear it's beautiful.

258
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,217
There's Vikings there,
right?

259
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,450
Eh, yeah.

260
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,549
I had a friend who
went there, she loved it.

261
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,857
She's a... she's a big
"Lord of the Rings" fan.

262
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,523
Oh my God.

263
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,191
She's so hot.

264
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,963
She's so flippin' hot.

265
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,267
She's like a curry.

266
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,468
I want to tell her how hot she is
but she'll think I'm being sexist.

267
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,966
She's so hot
she's making me sexist.

268
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,344
Bitch.

269
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,408
I think I need a 1983
Casio DG-20 electric guitar

270
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,784
set to electric mandolin.

271
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,550
Some drums.

272
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,580
Yeah.
Hear me now!

273
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,422
# I see you with the sign, I wanna boom
like it's never been done #

274
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,429
# Bust moves like
the click boom of a gun #

275
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,829
# My feet stay locked
and my eyes are zooming #

276
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,163
# My feet start tweaking
and my body's booming #

277
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,669
# The first day of boom
and the flowers are blooming #

278
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,331
# Bootie-boom bass
and the party is booming #

279
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,897
# Boom-ba-boom like a rocket
taking off to the moon #

280
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,172
# Boom boom like
a bride and a boom-a #

281
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,236
# I see you shaking
that boom boom #

282
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,009
# See you looking at my boom boom #

283
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,449
# See you want some
boom boom #

284
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,885
# It's clear, it's boom time,
boom boom #

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,115
# Let me buy you
a boom boom #

286
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,215
# You order
a fancy boom #

287
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,783
# You like boom
and I like boom #

288
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,455
# Enough small boom,
let's boom the boom-a #

289
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,091
Fast forward selector!

290
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,998
# Now we're rolling on
a boom boom #

291
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,559
# I ride into a more
private boom #

292
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,232
# And we both watch boom
and we both assume #

293
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,741
# We're gonna boom boom boom
till the break of boom-a #

294
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,801
- # Who's the boom king? #
- # Who? #

295
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,244
- # I'm the boom king #
- # What? #

296
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,646
- # Who's the boom king? #
- # Tell me now #

297
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,412
- # I'm the boom king #
- # He's the boom king #

298
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,092
# My phone is beeping,
it's me boom boom #

299
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,894
# He's back from 10 years
doom and gloom #

300
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,833
# He said he had his boom
chopped off in the boom #

301
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,428
# But the crazy boom
still loves to boom-a #

302
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,962
# Unzip the boom
and my legs go zoom #

303
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,339
# And you big boom drops,
ba-doop-a-boom boom #

304
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,901
# We both get freaky
and my boom gets leaky #

305
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,573
# Then we boom boom boom
boom boom boom boom #

306
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,979
# Who's the boom king? #

307
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,484
- # Who? #
- # I'm the boom king #

308
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,782
- # What? #
- # Who's the boom king? #

309
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,119
- # Ha! #
- # I'm the boom king #

310
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,282
# Bret's the boom king. #

311
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,489
Come to New Zealand.
Beautiful scenery.

312
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,927
It's like
"Lord of the Rings."

313
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,624
We've got
interesting attractions...

314
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,098
a toothbrush fence.

315
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,966
Imagine that, a whole fence
made out of toothbrushes.

316
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,629
Over 50 toothbrushes.

317
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,129
Bungee jumping.
You like bungee jumping, sir?

318
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,539
New Zealand.

319
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,374
New Zealand.

320
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,676
Yeah, keep...
hold onto that.

321
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,012
Cheer up, Greg.

322
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,642
Jemaine...

323
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,516
Where's Bret?
Is there any sign of him?

324
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,544
I'm running out of
attractions.

325
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,648
No.

326
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,659
L... I don't know
where he is.

327
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,991
Well, tuck your shirt in.
You look messy.

328
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,622
Try and be proud
of New Zealand.

329
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,894
Oh no.

330
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,992
Hey, Murray.

331
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,333
- How you doing?
- Maxwell, good.

332
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,601
- Stall looks great.
- Thanks.

333
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,132
This fence of toothbrushes
sounds fascinating.

334
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,008
Probably haven't got one
in Australia, have you?

335
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,034
- No.
- No.

336
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,708
Got Ayer's Rock, mate.
Big huge rock.

337
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,216
- Yeah, we've got rocks.
- Massive.

338
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,311
We've got a big...
smaller rocks.

339
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,323
When's this band of yours playing?
Can't wait to hear it.

340
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,655
Pretty soon. We're just waiting
for the rest of the band to turn up.

341
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,286
Right. Just 'cause we've got the
Wet N' Wild Welcome Girls

342
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,228
doing their bikini
barbeque thing

343
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,630
and the music's
gonna be pumping.

344
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,998
I don't want to
drown out your... band.

345
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,060
- Better start soon.
- Check, check one two.

346
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,971
Check one two.
Checking one two, one...

347
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,134
We'd better just start.
Forget Bret.

348
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,006
G'day.
G'day, one two...

349
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,035
I have to rewind it.

350
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,671
Is this your band, Murray?

351
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,705
A guy and a tape?

352
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,183
Classic.

353
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,152
- Press play.
- I'm trying, man.

354
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,212
- Drop the beat.
- One two three four.

355
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,428
# All the hotties at
the party feeling naughty #

356
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,521
# Shake your boobies, yeah #

357
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,759
# Who likes to rock
the party? #

358
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,268
# All the ladies
with the babies #

359
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,897
# Make your babies shake
their booties yeah #

360
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,634
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

361
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,570
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

362
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,378
# Who likes to rock
the party? #

363
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,476
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

364
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,544
# Who likes to
rock the party? #

365
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,579
# Who likes to rock
the party? #

366
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,921
# I like to
rock the party #

367
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,896
# New Zealand likes to
rock the party. #

368
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,397
Yeah! All right.

369
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,832
- Awesome.
- Yes!

370
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,392
- That was awesome, Jemaine.
- Thank you.

371
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,133
Blew the Aussies right out of the water.
The tape was great.

372
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,141
Oh no.
Oh come on!

373
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,644
Guys.

374
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,543
Hey, sorry
I'm late, guys.

375
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,013
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,016
- Have you done the gig?
- Yes, Bret.

377
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,813
Oh, I'm sorry.
It took me ages to get here.

378
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,911
- Well the tape was on time.
- Good. How'd it sound?

379
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,251
- It was all right?
- Good.

380
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,916
- Really good, actually, yeah.
- Okay.

381
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,118
There's very little difference
between you and the tape, I noticed.

382
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,820
- Oh whatever, Murray.
- And it doesn't talk back.

383
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,193
Yeah, but the tape's lifeless, isn't it?
It's a tape.

384
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,358
It's not like having a real musician
up there, is it? Hey, Jemaine?

385
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,095
I didn't really
notice the difference.

386
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,763
The difference is the tape didn't
let us down, all right?

387
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,863
It made it,
it played well.

388
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,101
And the more I think about it,
the more I like it.

389
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,007
I've got a right mind to
actually fire you, Bret,

390
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,841
and just keep Jemaine
and the tape.

391
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,346
- Aw, yeah, you're bluffing, Murray.
- I'm not bluffing.

392
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,712
- Yes you are.
- I'm not!

393
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,182
- Yes you are.
- He is.

394
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,980
He is. He told me he
was going to pretend

395
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,418
to fire you
if you were late.

396
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,920
Good one.
Yeah, I was going to.

397
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,786
- So you were bluffing?
- Yeah, but I'm not now.

398
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,347
This is the whole...
I've turned around.

399
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,860
I'm afraid to say, Bret,
that you are...

400
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,293
you got the...
check the tape?

401
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,626
Yep.

402
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,392
- What, are you serious?
- You're fired.

403
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,533
And both of you...
I'm not giving you a lift home.

404
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,661
- Oh, why me?
- No, 'cause you ruined my bluff.

405
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,571
The whole bluff thing.
Goodbye, Bret.

406
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,906
There's other attractions.
Check out the Indian one.

407
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,042
Thank for giving us a ride,
Mel and Doug.

408
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,575
Anytime.

409
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,316
Hey, Bret, are you...
are you all right?

410
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,120
I noticed you weren't onstage
and there was a tape and...

411
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,127
Yeah, I'm not in
the band anymore, Mel.

412
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,423
Murray just fired me.

413
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,396
What do you mean,
you're not in the band?

414
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,194
Did you hear that, Doug?

415
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,029
Yeah.
It's terrible.

416
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,196
It is terrible, Doug.
It's terrible!

417
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,001
My God.
Can Murray do that?

418
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,837
- No.
- Yeah.

419
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,276
Well, all your fans are
gonna be devastated.

420
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,542
- There's just you, Mel.
- Yeah.

421
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,412
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

422
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,883
What are you
gonna do, Bret?

423
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,545
- What... I mean...
- Well...

424
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,554
I guess just
concentrate on my job...

425
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,556
holding signs.
It's going pretty well.

426
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,251
Oh yeah,
I've seen you.

427
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,816
I've seen you
a lot.

428
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,987
You really know how
to move that sign.

429
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,988
You just manipulate it and caress it
with your skillful hands.

430
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,365
Thank you very much, Mel.
Yeah, thank you.

431
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,165
You're welcome.

432
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,664
You were good
tonight, Jemaine.

433
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,174
Oh thank you, Mel.

434
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,734
Way better than those Australian girls
in their bikinis.

435
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,871
- I didn't like them.
- Oh, I liked them.

436
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,211
- I hated them.
- Mmm.

437
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,911
So is it just gonna be
you and the tape for a bit?

438
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,750
Yeah, actually we've got a...
we've got a gig.

439
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,847
- Oh, you got a gig?
- What, a real gig?

440
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,358
Yeah... yeah, uh...

441
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,622
a guy... a guy saw us

442
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,219
and wants to book us.

443
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,628
Well, I'll be there.

444
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,859
You bet your ass
I'll be there.

445
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,232
I'll be at every one.

446
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,670
Oh, man.

447
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,071
The car could just
burst into flames right now

448
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,302
and this would be the way
to go, huh, guys? Just...

449
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,970
Just here, thanks, Doug.

450
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,273
- What?
- Where?

451
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,643
- Here?
- Anywhere.

452
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,351
This was
a good day, yeah.

453
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,617
Okay, so how else is
the tape better than Bret?

454
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,783
More compact.

455
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,555
Bret's pretty
compact, though.

456
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,824
I can carry the tape.
Just carry it around with me.

457
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,888
You could carry Bret.
How much can you press?

458
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,900
Not to a gig. I couldn't
carry him to a gig.

459
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,629
I can just put this
into my pocket

460
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,569
and just carry it
to a gig.

461
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,128
- More compact.
- Mmm.

462
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,572
That'll save money
on subway fares, too.

463
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,643
- Do you miss Bret, though?
- Not really.

464
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,171
- You don't miss him?
- No.

465
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,979
- No?
- No.

466
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,951
You miss him?

467
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,977
- A little bit.
- A little bit, eh?

468
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,148
I miss him. I might
put that down as a...

469
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,714
- Yeah, put "miss him."
...as a thing.

470
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,282
Yeah.

471
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,157
Well, no matter
which way you look at it,

472
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,565
the tape's still winning.

473
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,570
- Make sure you don't lose it.
- I won't.

474
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,231
Don't stand next to
any big magnets.

475
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,933
Why would I stand next to
big magnets, Murray?

476
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,306
I don't know what you do
in your personal life.

477
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,776
So that's it.

478
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,438
You've got the tape,
haven't you?

479
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,211
- Yeah, I got the tape.
- Let's see it.

480
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,718
I got the tape,
I told you.

481
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,310
- Let's have a look.
- I've got it in my pocket.

482
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,049
I just want to see it.

483
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,893
Oh, careful!
Now look what you've done.

484
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,519
- It's caught on my zipper.
- Yeah, leave it.

485
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,995
- Leave it, careful.
- It's all right.

486
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,759
- It's just caught on my zipper.
- Wait, it's all right.

487
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,732
I've got a trick here...
from the '80s, look.

488
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,033
Mmm.

489
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,835
Does this mean I'm not
in a band anymore?

490
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,808
I'm afraid not, Jemaine.

491
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,076
Greg, could we get a couple
of tissues in here?

492
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,140
Greg?

493
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,210
Chin up, Jemaine.

494
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,051
Actually, don't
worry about it.

495
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,954
You don't want to see
two grown men crying.

496
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,925
Go away, Greg.

497
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,155
Yeah.

498
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,493
Sue them.
Just sue them.

499
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,964
Oh... oh,
I got to go.

500
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,524
Hey, man.

501
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,559
Hey, Bret.

502
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,595
What's that thing
in your ear?

503
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,266
It's my
Bluetooth brand.

504
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,333
Everyone has 'em around here.
It's a business thing.

505
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,843
You don't know
what it is, do you?

506
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,346
- Not really. Do you know what it is?
- No.

507
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,575
I think you use it
with the phone.

508
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,016
Oh right, I see.

509
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,713
Oh yeah yeah,
I see.

510
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,948
- Yeah yeah, that makes sense.
- Hey, Bret?

511
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,479
I'm thinking of getting
the band back together.

512
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,684
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

513
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,659
I thought you were doing
pretty well with the tape.

514
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,389
The tape's no replacement
for you, man.

515
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,987
- Really?
- No, it broke.

516
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,464
What about it?

517
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,333
The original lineup...
you, me...

518
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,869
- You and me.
- I don't know, man.

519
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,468
Look at me.
I've changed.

520
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,479
I've grown up. I've got a job.
I've got a career.

521
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,708
I drink coffee now.

522
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,618
Oh God, yuck.

523
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,316
I just don't... I don't know if I can
do it anymore.

524
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,757
I don't even know what
you're talking about, man.

525
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,851
- Just join the band.
- No, I'm not joining the band.

526
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,691
- Join the band.
- I'm not joining the band.

527
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,823
- Join the band.
- No.

528
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,966
Free phones.

529
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,141
You've given up
the dream, Bret!

530
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,642
I've woken up.

531
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,167
I'll see you
at home.

532
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,407
Okay, man.
Can you grab some milk?

533
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,987
Yeah, well I'll see
what I can do.

534
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,191
Yeah. I've got a 5:00
and a 6:00.

535
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,200
I'll pencil
you in.

536
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,099
Okay, yeah.

537
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,264
7.3. All right.
Bye.

538
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,932
Hey, man.

539
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,067
Hey.
What's that?

540
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,339
Hamburger.

541
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,346
Looks amazing.

542
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,177
Are... are you
finished with that?

543
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,776
- I haven't started.
- Oh.

544
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,083
Do you want to
join the band?

545
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,611
No.

546
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,131
What is that?

547
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,970
How's the band going?

548
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,908
Oh, I'm not in
the band anymore.

549
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,535
- I had to quit.
- Really?

550
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,307
Yeah.
They wanted me back

551
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,042
but I'm just
concentrating on signs

552
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,380
and my career and
everything, you know?

553
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,886
Are you gonna start
another band?

554
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,388
No.
Probably not.

555
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,980
Bigger and
better things.

556
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,423
Signs?

557
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,017
Yeah.

558
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,721
I thought you
loved signs?

559
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,730
- Signs are okay.
- Yeah.

560
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,198
I prefer bands.

561
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,134
- You prefer bands?
- Yeah, I love bands.

562
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,137
Oh you... really?
You just never...

563
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,105
Oh.

564
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,971
I'll see you later, Bret?

565
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,669
Cool, yeah.

566
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,512
I'm back in the band.

567
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,107
I'm back in
the band!

568
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,086
I'm back in the band.
Hey, back in the band!

569
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,588
Back in the band!

570
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,921
Back in the band.

571
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,450
Put the cat down.
We can't afford it.

572
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,157
I'm back in the band.

573
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,222
Back in the band!

574
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,359
Back in the band!

575
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,695
It's been a very
difficult decision,

576
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,297
because many of you are
very talented, all right?

577
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,865
- Some of you are too talented.
- Hey.

578
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,433
Josh, is it?
In the back there.

579
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,877
High scores but a little arrogant,
all right?

580
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,437
But it's not
about talent.

581
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,971
Okay? It's about
the look.

582
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,849
That's why we've decided
to give the job to Brent.

583
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,753
All right, well done.
It's not about talent, as I say.

584
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,278
You're not
the talented one.

585
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,654
But you do look
very similar.

586
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,318
And with one
letter difference,

587
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,851
it's quite easy to just
do the transition there.

588
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,421
Hang on.

589
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,899
Bret, is that you?

590
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,266
What are you doing here?
You have no business here.

591
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,634
I wanted to get
back in the band.

592
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,400
Well, if you'd turned up
half an hour ago

593
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,464
you could have been
at the audition. It's too late.

594
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,999
- Brent's in the band.
- What about your job?

595
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,502
Well, Eddie says I can make the job fit
around the gigs. So...

596
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,244
He wants to support the band as much
as possible, actually.

597
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,751
He made us this sign.

598
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,379
Wow.
"Hot Dogs."

599
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,888
OH, NO THAT ONE.
THAT ONE.

600
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,885
Oh wow,
that's fantastic.

601
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,053
It's really great.

602
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,858
You know, Jemaine
really missed you.

603
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,421
- No I didn't.
- You did.

604
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,625
No I didn't.

605
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,897
- You did.
- You... you did.

606
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,130
- No, you're like...
- He did.

607
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,330
No, a little bit.

608
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,565
You could see
that you were...

609
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,904
Both... we both
missed you.

610
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,137
Oh, um,
sorry everyone.

611
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,576
Ah, bad news, guys.

612
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,012
This is Bret. He's gonna take
the position.

613
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,380
So, yeah,
that's it, I guess.

614
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,544
- What about Brent?
- Yeah, Brent, um...

615
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,612
sorry. Uh, we'll
keep your number on file.

616
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,646
The rest of you,
thanks a lot.

617
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,923
Have a good day.
And yeah, welcome back, Bret!
