1
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,071
Come on, man,
I can't go in there by myself.

2
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,973
I don't like croissants.

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,035
What was all that
about just then?

4
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,411
- What?
- About you not liking croissants?

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,177
What are you
talking about?

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,184
- What are you talking about now?
- I don't like croissants.

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,651
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm not going
in there, man.

9
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,513
You've gotta
come in there with me.

10
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,547
I can't go in there by myself and buy
a croissant, can I?

11
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,582
She'll think I'm weird.
You have to back me up.

12
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,618
You have to be what's
called "my wingman."

13
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,289
Oh, like in "Top Gun"?

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,696
Stop comparing everything
to "Top Gun."

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,793
It's not... this situation's
nothing like "Top Gun."

16
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,667
"Ooh, it's like
'Top Gun."'

17
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,331
Come on, it'll only
take five minutes.

18
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,671
We've been out here
talking about it for two hours now.

19
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,936
What do I have to do?

20
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,103
Just make me
seem popular.

21
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,113
If I say something,
you agree with me.

22
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,106
All right.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

24
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,983
Um, I'd like
a croissant, please.

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,784
Yes, that's true,
he would.

26
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,188
Okay, a croissant, sure.

27
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,782
He's very popular.

28
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,418
Be more subtle
about it.

29
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,723
Mmm, that's true.

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,424
I suppose he didn't
have to say that.

31
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,695
Je voudrais
un croissant.

32
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,428
What?

33
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,867
# Je voudrais
un croissant #

34
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,806

83
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,787

# Ba da bada bo! #

93
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,815
They're having
a nice conversation.

94
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,256
Yep.

95
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,590
Do you like having
nice conversations?

96
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,619
No. Nope.

97
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,955
There's been
a big mix-up, Bret.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,468
A disastrous mix-up.

99
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,470
'Cause I was
talking to Lisa

100
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,369
and then that was
going very well

101
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,897
and then I dropped my wallet,
there was some confusion

102
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,773
and I think I ended up
talking to Felicia,

103
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,404
when I should
be talking to Lisa.

104
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,811
You are talking
to Lisa.

105
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,213
- Am I?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,218
Right, well that's
obviously what's happened.

107
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,277
We should swap.

108
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,589
Oh, look, Bret's feeling
Felicia's breast.

109
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,033
- Uh, I'm Felicia. That's...
- Yes.

110
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,799
...Lisa.
- Feeling Lisa's breast then, probably.

111
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,931
- Yeah.
- That must be nice for her.

112
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,373
Yeah.

113
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,243
Looks like she's responding
to that quite positively.

114
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,081
Bret, how you doing?

115
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,583
Good good.
Ah. Yeah.

116
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,745
It's good.
How you guys doing?

117
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,279
Pretty good.
Pretty good.

118
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,814
I'm actually feeling
a little bit tired though.

119
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,689
- I think maybe we should go.
- No.

120
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,592
Yeah, you know,
I'm feeling pretty tired too,

121
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,494
- so I'm gonna...
- Oh no, we're staying out.

122
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,590
- Yeah, but I have that thing...
- Yeah, we're staying out.

123
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,464
- Good idea, good idea, Felicia.
- We're staying out.

124
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,935
- Mm-hmm.
- That's Lisa, I'm Felicia.

125
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,941
All right, finally,
item two.

126
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,543
Any new business
from any of us?

127
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,048
Any... any news?
Jemaine, have you got any?

128
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,573
Well, we've got
girlfriends now.

129
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,676
Really?
Even both of you?

130
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,278
Yeah, we've met them
and everything.

131
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,380
I've told you
this before, guys.

132
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,584
Okay, I don't want to have to,
you know, backpedal

133
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,388
and repeat myself, but...

134
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,793
It's like I said
when you were with Coco:

135
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,798
"Bands shouldn't
have girlfriends."

136
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,231
Okay?

137
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,291
You'll lose
your female fan base.

138
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,735
What about Wham?
You never saw Wham with girlfriends.

139
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,568
That's how they kept
the women wanting them.

140
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,335
No girlfriends.

141
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,808
Okay.

142
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,242
- Okay?
- Okay.

143
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,271
So how far did you get
with your girlfriend?

144
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,442
Well, I don't want
to talk about that.

145
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,452
I've told you about how
far I've been with...

146
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,454
you know, Shelly,
last Christmas Eve.

147
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,955
Yeah, I don't want
to hear that again.

148
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,651
Yeah? Didn't you
like that story?

149
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,819
- So what'd you do?
- Well, I kissed her.

150
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,193
- Did you?
- And you felt her breast.

151
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,492
- Yeah.
- Hand on her breast.

152
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,590
Oh whoa, Bret,
be careful.

153
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,094
- What about you, Jemaine?
- Hmm?

154
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,731
Come on, you tell me
what you got up to.

155
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,571
Um, I saw Bret feeling
that lady's breast.

156
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,133
No, I mean
with your girlfriend.

157
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,645
Yeah, uh... good.

158
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,340
Yeah, good, was it?

159
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,509
It... pretty good.
It was...

160
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,849
Hmm, good.

161
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,412
You're not the only ones
with good news, actually.

162
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,822
My car broke down
in the ghetto.

163
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,223
That's not the good news,

164
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,251
but do you know
about the ghetto?

165
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,523
- Yes.
- No.

166
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,531
Yeah, well you know
the Elvis song, "In the Ghetto"?

167
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,623
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,497
Well, it's exactly like
he describes it.

169
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,866
It's... whoa.

170
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,768
Anyway, I met
A.J. Jones.

171
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,137
- Who's that?
- He's the brother of Quincy Jones.

172
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,664
- Really?
- Yeah.

173
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,505
- You know, the music producer.
- Yeah yeah yeah, wow.

174
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,671
And so now we... we've done
some business already.

175
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,202
Are you serious?

176
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,715
He said he could sell me a high-end
stereo system for $50.

177
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,617
- That's not band-related.
- You're in a band, you play music,

178
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,917
so does the stereo.
There's your relation,

179
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
all right?
And Quincy Jones,

180
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,057
he's the music producer,
isn't he?

181
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,959
What's some of the albums
that he's produced, Bret?

182
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,327
- Michael Jackson's "Off the Wall."
- Yeah, whoa.

183
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,491
I'll say he is.
He's crazy.

184
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,025
Off the planet.
Isn't he going to freeze himself?

185
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,209
Hey, Bret, Lisa here.

186
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,303
Listen, Felicia and I
had a really good time last night.

187
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,177
- Shut up, would you?
- Anyway,

188
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,183
we were wondering if you'd
like to come out tonight.

189
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,708
7:00-ish?
Hope you like Italian! Call me.

190
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,414
- Did you hear that, Bret?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,219
- Did you hear the message?
- I'm not going out tonight.

192
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,055
What?

193
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,891
What are you talking about?
It's girls and spaghetti.

194
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,658
We love girls
and spaghetti.

195
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,859
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna say we're busy.

196
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,028
No way, man.
You're my wingman, I need you.

197
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,265
We've got it all,
the girls love us.

198
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,670
We're like Wham.

199
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,174
I don't want to
go too fast, you know.

200
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,073
I don't want her to
think that I'm easy.

201
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,702
You want her to think
you're more difficult?

202
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,545
Do you think I dress
too provocatively?

203
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,606
No.

204
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,084
If I may be so bold,

205
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,883
I think you're showing
a little too much arm.

206
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,651
- Am I?
- Mmm.

207
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,351
Yeah, you look
a little cheap.

208
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,690
No, you don't look cheap, Bret.
You look fine.

209
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,424
- May I make a suggestion?
- No. Fix the sink.

210
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,694
Women don't objectify
men in that way, Bret.

211
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,462
Yeah, okay,
maybe I'll come tonight.

212
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,401
Yeah, and wear something
a little sluttier.

213
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,801
Give her something
to look at.

214
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,703
I guess I want to show her
a little bit of arm,

215
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,573
'cause I don't want her
to lose interest entirely.

216
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,510
Yeah, you don't want the bear
to go completely hungry,

217
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,343
you don't want it
to attack,

218
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,474
so give it
a little bait,

219
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,108
keep it interested.

220
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,641
Fix the sink, please.

221
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,452
The sink works.
It just comes out of a different place.

222
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,389
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,227
- How's it going?
- What's up?

224
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,426
- Bit rough, isn't it?
- Eh.

225
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,163
So, well thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedule,

226
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,761
you know, to meet
with me, Mr. Jones.

227
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,272
Eh, call me
A.J., man.

228
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,798
Right. Oh, with regards
to your proposal,

229
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,434
I've spoken
to the guys, A.J.,

230
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,174
and they said they're keen.
We want the stereo, so...

231
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,841
Good, 80 bucks.

232
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,248
Okay.

233
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,514
I haven't got any with me now...
some shit went down.

234
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,353
Oh really? Okay, sorry to hear
about shit going down.

235
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,085
You need
any hot pants?

236
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,559
- Pardon?
- I got a shitload of hot pants.

237
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,654
You talk to anyone who's
looking for hot pants, send them my way.

238
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,756
All right,
I will. Okay.

239
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,767
Good. I've got to go,
I've got a meeting.

240
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,701
Oh, A. J? Um...

241
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,533
I was just wondering
if you'd do us a favor.

242
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,266
You know, I manage
a rock band.

243
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,968
What... what are
the chances of me playing

244
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,375
a demo of theirs
to your brother?

245
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,969
- My brother?
- Yeah.

246
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,878
Quincy, you know.

247
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,179
Oh, my older brother.

248
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,482
Yeah yeah, Quincy.
Uh, let me hear the track.

249
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,681
Just um...

250
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,157
- Listen to that.
- # Who likes to rock the party? #

251
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,127
# He likes to rock the party. #

252
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,254
Can I tell you
my honest opinion?

253
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,628
- Yep.
- I love it.

254
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,565
- You do?
- I'll tell you what:

255
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,192
I can help you
with a single,

256
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,863
because I'm also in the CD-single-
manufacturing business.

257
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,965
If you're interested,
I could talk to my people... Quincy...

258
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,499
- Oh.
...and the gang,

259
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,170
and we could
put something together.

260
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,339
Very interested.
We'd definitely go for that.

261
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,076
- All right. Good good.
- All right! Thanks a lot.

262
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,640
You're still getting
that sound system, right?

263
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,083
Oh yeah, of course.

264
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,053
I don't want you to think
we're pulling one over on you.

265
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

266
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,018
Thank you.

267
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,117
- You warm?
- Mmm.

268
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,757
Hey, I think I might
head off now.

269
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,284
Oh yeah yeah,
that's a great idea.

270
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,057
Let's leave the two lovebirds.
Come on.

271
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,587
Oh.

272
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,099
- Bye.
- See you guys.

273
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,101
Felicia, you'll get
a cab, right?

274
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,228
Yeah, I guess.

275
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,669
A little muscley.

276
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,009
Well, this is
my place, so...

277
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,016
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you for walking me home,

278
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,018
and... it was
a lovely evening.

279
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,020
It was a great evening.
I had a really good time.

280
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,284
- Good night.
- Good night.

281
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,186
Can... can I come up
for some tea?

282
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh, you don't want to come up,
it's a really small flat.

283
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,294
Bret, how long do you wait until you
let a girl come upstairs?

284
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,130
Three years.

285
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh, you're serious.

286
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,567
What... what do you think
I am, dangerous?

287
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,069
Well, you can...
you can have a cup of tea

288
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,343
but then
you've got to go home.

289
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,939
It's getting kind of late.

290
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,452
L... um, I've got to go
jogging in the morning.

291
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,148
- Oh yeah.
- So...

292
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,951
It is late,
isn't it?

293
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,685
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

294
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,818
Um...

295
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,987
Oh well, I mean I'm...

296
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:50,297
I'm not gonna be able to get a cab back
to Brooklyn this time of night, so...

297
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,702
Uh, I could give you
directions to the F train.

298
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,865
Oh the... that... that's
a really dangerous stop.

299
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,842
I mean, I... I've heard
there's maniacs down there.

300
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,811
- Maniacs?
- Yeah.

301
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,608
Mmm. Well,
maybe you should stay.

302
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,208
Yeah no, I think I should. And I...
I mean, I'll be fine on the couch

303
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,186
or I could stay
in your bed...

304
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,847
- with you.
- Yeah.

305
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,584
Probably best
just the couch.

306
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,889
Well, I'll sleep on the couch,
and you can sleep on my bed.

307
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,054
- How's that?
- You'll be comfortable out here?

308
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,529
Yeah yeah, that's...
that's good.

309
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,691
Okay, great.

310
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,564
I'll be in your bed.

311
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

312
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,567
- Good night.
- Good night.

313
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,311
Bret?
Bretty?

314
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,111
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

315
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,675
Well, you're not gonna
sleep any better up there.

316
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,584
Could I just...
could I just sleep next to you?

317
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,088
I promise
I won't do anything.

318
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,251
- No.
- Come on, just give me a little sugar.

319
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,851
Definitely no sugar.

320
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,589
You've been kissing me
all night, Bret.

321
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,358
It's been
driving me crazy.

322
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,923
You have to give me just a little
somethin' somethin'.

323
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,162
It's... it's kind of
an unspoken rule.

324
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,104
# A kiss is not
a contract #

325
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,505
# But it's very nice #

326
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,907
# Mmm, very nice #

327
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,742
# Just because you've been
exploring my mouth #

328
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,443
# Doesn't mean you get
to take an expedition further south #

329
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,745
# No #

330
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,912
# A kiss is not
a contract #

331
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,388
# But it's very nice #

332
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,721
# It's very
very nice #

333
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,454
# Just because we've been
playing tonsil hockey #

334
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,894
# Doesn't mean you get
to score the goal #

335
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,922
# That's in my jockey #

336
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,528
# Just because I'm in
a two-man novelty band #

337
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,506
# Doesn't mean
it's all about poontang #

338
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,136
# I can't go round
loving everyone #

339
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,638
# I just wouldn't get
anything done #

340
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,446
# You can take me out
to dinner #

341
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,646
# That might be
quite nice #

342
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,123
# You could buy me a burrito
and some beans and rice #

343
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:56,423
# But that won't get you
into pants paradise #

344
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,530
# They call it a fly
because it takes you up to heaven #

345
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,228
# Oh whoa #

346
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,670
# A kiss is not
a contract #

347
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,339
# But it's very nice #

348
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,713
# It's very
very nice #

349
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,446
# I'm only one man #

350
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,152
# Baby #

351
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,019
# Pretty baby #

352
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,458
# We're only two men, ladies #

353
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,397
# Babies,
pretty babies. #

354
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,776
Something very disturbing happened
to me last night, Jemaine.

355
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,180
- What?
- Well, you know Lisa.

356
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,149
Well, it turns out
she's very aggressive.

357
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,655
Did she hit you?

358
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,022
- No, she wanted to go all the way.
- Mmm.

359
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,050
I thought you already
did go all the way.

360
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,324
No, now she wants
to have sex.

361
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,398
What gave you
that impression?

362
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,560
She jumped on top of me
and then touched me on the penis.

363
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,125
Oh I see.
You're lying.

364
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,762
No, she was all over me.

365
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,397
It's like that scene
from "Top Gun."

366
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,340
You know your favorite
scene in "Top Gun"?

367
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,536
- I don't know that movie.
- Yeah, it's your favorite scene.

368
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,908
I don't know
the movie.

369
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,379
Yeah, well, it was full-on.
I'm not ready for it.

370
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,075
How did you get her
to start it?

371
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,845
I don't know,
I was asleep.

372
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,011
Really? Hmm.

373
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,850
And then what
did you do?

374
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,186
Well, I just said,
"I'm not ready to have sex."

375
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,852
- And that worked?
- No, that didn't work at all,

376
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,724
'cause then she wanted
to have sex.

377
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,093
Oh.

378
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,995
It worked then, good.

379
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,523
I think Felicia's
pretty keen too.

380
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,435
She gave me this free
day-old croissant.

381
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,007
Conchord CDs.

382
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,109
Original music
from New Zealand.

383
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,585
Out of my area.

384
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,114
Hey, Mel,
you want one of these?

385
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,529
Thanks, George.

386
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,229
Hey, Dave, can I ask you a question
about women's sexuality?

387
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,238
Sure, you came to
the right place for that.

388
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,570
I'm going out with this American girl
who wants to, you know,

389
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,441
- go... you know, like, do the whole...
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,446
She wants to go the whole way.
That means sex, right?

391
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,244
Yeah and... I'm not
really ready for that.

392
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,614
Bret's not ready
for it.

393
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,744
- Yeah.
- Hot bod, gross face.

394
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,779
I get it. Just hit that shit
from behind.

395
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,281
No no no, I just always imagined that
when I did finally make the move,

396
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,226
it would be
more special, you know?

397
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,322
It would be flowers,
violins, I'd be in a nice suit.

398
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,333
Everything would
just be perfect.

399
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,392
I don't know how you guys
do things in Europe...

400
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,870
- New Zealand.
- Yeah, probably.

401
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,373
But in America, if you want to spend
some time with the ladies,

402
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,103
you got to show 'em some sausage.
Am I right, Jemaine?

403
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,667
What are you
talking about?

404
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,679
I'm talking about in the U.S.,
if you want something,

405
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,647
you've got to be prepared
to put out for it.

406
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,150
How do you think I eat
so well every lunchtime?

407
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,246
Hey, Mrs. Chang.
Thanks for the egg rolls, huh.

408
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,053
What?

409
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,332
Hey, Lisa, do you think
we can maybe just talk for a little bit?

410
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,530
Yeah.

411
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,767
Don't... don't... do you
care about me at all?

412
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,138
Yes.

413
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,507
I mean, don't you know
that if a girl gets aroused

414
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,513
and doesn't climax, that she can really
damage herself?

415
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,515
Bret, I might not
be able to have a baby.

416
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,915
- I didn't know that.
- It's kinda common knowledge.

417
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,783
- Well...
- I'm not...

418
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,219
I don't want
to make you feel bad,

419
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,383
but it's just everybody
kind of knows that.

420
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,223
I just think it might
be a bit too soon.

421
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,059
Well, guess what?

422
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,725
Tomorrow it's not gonna matter
if you're ready or not.

423
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,530
Mmm... why's that?

424
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,402
Because tomorrow, Bret,
I ship out to Iraq.

425
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,031
Iraq?

426
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,803
Yeah, I'm in
Delta Force, Bret.

427
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,174
You're in Delta Force?

428
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,838
What's that?

429
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,905
I gotta take one
for my country,

430
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,974
so the least I could do
is take one from you.

431
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,515
Felicia, hey.

432
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,785
- Oh hey, Jemaine.
- I just wanted to tell you

433
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,349
that I don't want
to have sex with you.

434
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,827
Good, I don't
want to either.

435
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,420
Oh.

436
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,489
Oh... ooh ooh!

437
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,966
Felicia, I just
wanted to check.

438
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,027
So who was it that
wanted to and who didn't want to?

439
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,630
Oh, it was both of us
that didn't want to.

440
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,641
Yeah, you don't want to,
I don't want to.

441
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah, don't want to.
You said you didn't want to...

442
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,178
Mmm, oh yuck, no way.
But we could.

443
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,874
Can we?

444
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,543
Oh, so you do want to?

445
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,076
No, I'm just... I'm not interested
at all, Jemaine.

446
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,113
- It's not gonna happen.
- Is it because I'm too dangerous?

447
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,352
'Cause you think
I'm just gonna ride out of this town

448
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,452
the same way I rode in,
and when I go,

449
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,258
I'll take
your heart with me?

450
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,060
No?

451
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,929
Slight concern about that,
though, maybe?

452
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,195
Mmm.

453
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,203
Thought it was
gonna be that one.

454
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,070
Look, Jemaine, I, um...

455
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,199
I only went out with you
in the first place

456
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,268
because Lisa kind of
like insisted that I be her wingman.

457
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,506
You're her wingman?

458
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,741
'Cause Bret was supposed
to be my wingman.

459
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,382
- Look.
- That's why you don't want to.

460
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,410
- No, it's not way.
- Might be one of the reasons.

461
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,945
Not any
of the reasons, but...

462
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,288
Iook. It's raining.
I've got to get going 'cause...

463
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,260
Okay, there was,
"don't want to," "don't want to."

464
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,262
- Do not want to.
- Okay.

465
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,992
- Me too, don't want to.
- "Don't want to" and "don't want to."

466
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,624
- Okay, let's not then.
- Okay.

467
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,658
I mean, that seems
to work out best for both of us.

468
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,568
- Okay, Jemaine, good night.
- Okay.

469
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,799
Good night.

470
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,772
- Okay, move.
- Yeah.

471
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,247
You can... you can move
a little more.

472
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,773
- Come on.
- Yeah.

473
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,689
Um, Lisa?

474
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,255
Could I
go home now?

475
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,670
You okay, Bret?

476
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,336
Could you please get out of here?
I'm having a shower.

477
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,176
Okay. I was in here first.
You come in here

478
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,045
with your clothes on,
crying.

479
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,348
It was over
in five minutes.

480
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,411
I mean,
she fell asleep.

481
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,316
Are you and Lisa
gonna get married now?

482
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,658
I wish, but I don't know.
She's got to go to war.

483
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,822
What?

484
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,764
Yeah, Iraq.

485
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,359
- Iraq?
- Yeah.

486
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,131
Lisa?

487
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,298
Yes, she's in Delta Force.
She's been deployed to Fallujah.

488
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,076
But she works in
the croissant shop.

489
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,509
Yeah well,
she's got two jobs.

490
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,571
She's a pastry chef
and a sniper.

491
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,276
Hmm.

492
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,379
Well, if it
makes you feel better,

493
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,856
me and Felicia are probably
gonna have to break up too.

494
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,689
She keeps
pressuring me into sex.

495
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:13,061
"Give me some more sex."
Oh, give me a rest...

496
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,690
for five minutes.

497
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,498
Cheer up, Bret.

498
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,271
Mmm, it's
the talking stove.

499
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,643
Things'll work out.

500
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,671
Yeah?

501
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,581
You love
the talking stove.

502
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,677
Oh, let's make
a cake.

503
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,926
Okay, so to sum up,

504
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:48,365
basically, CD sales
are going okay,

505
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,766
but a little slower
than I would have liked.

506
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,360
How many have you sold?

507
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,201
One.

508
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,367
But I would have liked to have gotten
a few more out than that.

509
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,899
How many have you
got left?

510
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,206
Two and a half thousand.

511
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,644
Can I have one?

512
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,308
You can have a whole box.
There you go.

513
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,476
- Really?
- Yes, take it home.

514
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,316
I can't store them here.
You... Jemaine, you take one.

515
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,914
- I don't want a whole box...
- Take a whole box home with you.

516
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,323
- What am I gonna do with it?
- I can't store them here.

517
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,224
So just take...
take it home.

518
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,058
In fact, if you can
take two boxes each...

519
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,656
Murray, how many of these...
Have you looked in all the boxes?

520
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,827
- Just the one.
- This one's got sawdust in it.

521
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,336
Oh my God.

522
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,338
Did you buy some
sawdust as well?

523
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,738
Open your box, Jemaine.

524
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,640
Look, Murray.
Sawdust.

525
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,906
We've been done.
I didn't tell you this,

526
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,937
but I did the business
underneath an overpass,

527
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,075
you know, and he was dodgy
from the beginning.

528
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,210
What, you had sex
with him?

529
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,347
No, he sold me
the sawdust boxes.

530
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,687
Did you want to buy
sawdust, though?

531
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,023
Bret, no!
I bought the CDs, didn't I?

532
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,153
It's a lot lighter.
Did you pick them up?

533
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,096
Of course
I picked them up.

534
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,726
I should find Quincy Jones and let him
know what his brother's up to.

535
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,668
He needs to know this.

536
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,035
Oh, I haven't got
his number.

537
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,596
You could email him.

538
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,632
I'd love to email him.

539
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,082
Come on, Bret,
you're moping.

540
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,607
Yeah, I just miss Lisa.
I think about her out there

541
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,620
in Operation Sand Freedom.

542
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,781
- Yeah, but you're walking really...
- It's gonna be dangerous.

543
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,791
You're walking
really slow.

544
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,793
I want to send her some croissants
in a care package.

545
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,624
That'd be nice, right?

546
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,130
- Don't... uh.
- What?

547
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,530
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hey, Bret.

548
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,764
- You didn't ship out to Iraq?
- No, actually,

549
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,431
didn't end up
going to Iraq.

550
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,633
Oh really?

551
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,471
Yeah... oh no.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

552
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,874
- Oh you are?
- Yeah.

553
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,810
See, I told you.
She's a sniper.

554
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,074
I'm a sniper.

555
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,808
So then, maybe we should
go out tonight?

556
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,410
Tonight, no... I don't...
I can't tonight.

557
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,976
- What?
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

558
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,386
but... but you guys
should go.

559
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,186
You guys should go out.
It'd be fun.

560
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,820
But you said
you love me and?

561
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,353
- Oh.
- You had sex on me.

562
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,592
No... oh yeah,
that was just physical.

563
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,965
- Just physical.
- It was just... I mean, we were just...

564
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,594
we were just using
each other, weren't we?

565
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,901
- Just using each other.
- Oh, we were just using each other.

566
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,236
- Yeah.
- I see, yeah.

567
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,741
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

568
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,005
But, anyways,
it's... I gotta...

569
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,535
I mean, it's really busy in here
and I got to get back to work but...

570
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,571
I'd love to talk,
but you know.

571
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,848
But it was great...
seeing you guys again.

572
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,084
I know!
You see him?

573
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,184
"I love you."

574
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,797
Your real problem, Bret,
is the kind of girls you go for.

575
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,802
You're attracted
to bastards.

576
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,269
- Bastard girls.
- It's true.

577
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,272
They treat you badly
and you get into a cycle of that.

578
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,070
- Yeah.
- You've gotta break out of that.

579
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,667
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Murray.

580
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,610
Where's
your girlfriends?

581
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,841
- They're not here.
- I knew you didn't have girlfriends.

582
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,473
Yes we...
well, Bret did.

583
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,074
- Yeah.
- He had one.

584
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,211
- This will cheer you up.
- Sort of, she didn't really...

585
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,948
- what?
- Jemaine, I've sold all your CDs,

586
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,785
- every last one of them.
- Really?

587
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,757
- Yep.
- People liked them?

588
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,623
I sold them
to Dave.

589
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,424
Apparently,
they're rewritable.

590
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,454
So he just deletes the music files
and then sells them as blank CDs.

591
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,559
Apparently, it's worth
more that way so...

592
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,593
- It's not ideal.
- It's not ideal,

593
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,696
but yeah, they're still
getting out there, aren't they?

594
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,604
Yeah, well,
they're blank though.

595
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,836
Yeah, but they'll
be out there,

596
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,105
and... you know.

597
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,010
- As blanks.
- Yeah.

598
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,309
- It's good.
- It's...

599
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,043
It's good, I know.

600
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,711
Just gotta find someone that'll buy
this sawdust now,

601
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,277
and I'll be complete.

602
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,256
- See you soon.
- See you, Murray.

603
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,781
- Good managing, Murray.
- Thanks, mate.

604
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,722
Yeah. See...

605
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,958
that girl
wasn't right for you.

606
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,400
Yeah, I guess she wasn't
really good enough for me.

607
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,301
I was thinking
she was too good for you.

608
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,965
She was actually
too good for me.

609
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,530
Yes, a bit too pretty
for you.

610
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,201
- Hmm.
- Too good-Iooking.

611
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,268
Hi. Are you Bret?

612
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,145
- Uh...
- I'm a friend of Lisa's.

613
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,743
I heard you like
to have a good time.

614
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,912
I'm Bret.
