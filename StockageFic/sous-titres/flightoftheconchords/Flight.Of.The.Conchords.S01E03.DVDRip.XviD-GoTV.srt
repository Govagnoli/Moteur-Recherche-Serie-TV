1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,973
What did Hamish do?

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,772
Is he gonna get
a new tractor?

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,300
Yeah, well,
he probably shouldn't.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,176
He lives
in the city.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,875
No, it's not
that dangerous here.

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,008
- I don't need a gun.
- Tell her it is a bit dangerous.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,849
- Not all Americans have guns.
- Tell her Dave's got a paintball gun.

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,287
- Dave has a paintball gun.
- It's not a real gun, though.

9
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,689
- Yeah, it's not real.
- Just shoots paint.

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,488
I'm not gonna get a gun, though.
I'm not getting...

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,858
I've told you that. No.

12
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,692
Tell her I'm thinking
about getting a gun.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,890
That's Bruce Willis,
though.

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,489
Tell her about all
the TV stations here, Bret.

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,297
- He's acting. It's not real.
- Bret, the TV stations.

16
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,429
- Tell her about all the TV stations.
- Jemaine wants me to tell you

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,496
there's a lot
of TV stations.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,871
What'd she say?

19
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,103
- How many?
- I don't know.

20
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,011
There's a lot. Yeah yeah, no.
More than four.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,674
- Yeah.
- What'd she say?

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,683
She says "Wow."
Well, I'll talk to you soon.

23
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,742
- Say bye for...
- Jemaine says "Bye" as well.

24
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,913
She says "Bye."
Do you want to talk to her?

25
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,717
- Nuh-uh.
- No. Okay.

26
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,747
All right, bye. Bye.

27
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,628
- Who was that?
- It's Mom. She's good.

28
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,565
Okay, guys,
band meeting.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,999
- Jemaine?
- Yes.

30
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,468
- Yes?
- Yes.

31
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,130
Bret?

32
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,106
Murray, I was wondering
if you could call me by my rapping name?

33
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,200
- Your rapping name?
- Rhymenoceros.

34
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,609
- Rhinoceros?
- The Rhymenoceros.

35
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,772
Nah, well, that's not
gonna fit in here.

36
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,341
I've got "Bret." Can't you just have
Bret as your rapping name?

37
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,181
No. It's not
a rapping name.

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,847
It's a good
rapping name.

39
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,822
"Hello, everybody,
I am Bret."

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,654
- No.
- Rhymes with "wet" and...

41
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,920
No, "Rhymenoceros."

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,121
Look, if you're gonna have
some sort of rap name,

43
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,891
just be careful you don't
do a drive-by.

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,898
- I won't.
- Well, you'd better not.

45
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,832
You know what
I mean by that?

46
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,336
What about you, Jemaine?
Have you got a rapping name?

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,804
Yeah,
"Hiphopopotamus,"

48
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,966
but you can just call me
Jemaine if you want.

49
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,476
Okay. Well, let's go again.
Jemaine?

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,103
- I just said yes before.
- Yep.

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,513
Okay, and what is it?
"Rhymenoceros."

52
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,016
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,679
And Murray...
present.

54
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,689
"Band agenda:

55
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,055
Item one, haircut."
Bret.

56
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,083
- No, haven't had it done.
- Well, get it cut.

57
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,891
I mean, you don't hear of professional
musicians with long hair.

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,728
- Well, Led Zeppelin?
- I mean a man.

59
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,495
It needs a trim.

60
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,934
Yours is
pretty long, Murray.

61
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,405
"Item 2-A, gig."

62
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,708
Oh, "a gig." I'm gonna get
you guys another gig.

63
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,371
What do you mean,
"another gig"?

64
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,744
- Remember the other one?
- Vaguely.

65
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,181
Well, what about
another one?

66
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,811
Murray, I was thinking
perhaps we could do gigs at night?

67
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,787
- No... no, come on.
- Yes, most bands...

68
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,345
- Most bands play at night.
- Not again.

69
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,085
- We've talked about this.
- Most bands play at night.

70
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,558
It's too dangerous
out there at night.

71
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,925
We go around walking around
at night all the time.

72
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,590
Well, you know, anything could happen.
You could get run over,

73
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,964
pickpocketed,
fall down a manhole,

74
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,196
bump into people,

75
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,070
murdered...
imagine that...

76
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,074
or even
just ridiculed.

77
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,576
- We've never been ridiculed.
- No.

78
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,442
- You haven't?
- No.

79
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,209
Well, that's a surprise.
I get ridiculed all the time.

80
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,682
- Really?
- Yup.

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,948
"Oh hey,
ginger-balls."

82
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,955
You know?

83
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,822
That was Bret.

84
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,758
- He called you that.
- The other night.

85
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,659
Well, it's not
just you, Bret,

86
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,256
it's all the time, and it's not just
ginger-balls, you know?

87
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,198
- I thought that was your nickname?
- No.

88
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,067
I get, "Oh, what are
you on your way to...

89
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,468
a dick meeting?"

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,964
All right, here you are.

91
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,238
You should wear these T-shirts with
"New York" on them.

92
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,609
All right, just so you fit in.
Here's a hat.

93
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,137
Put this on, all right?
"Hey, I'm walkin' here!"

94
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,673
That's what they say when...
people get in the way,

95
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,208
so there's the hats.

96
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,187
You'll need a map.

97
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,950
All right, take one
of those each.

98
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,959
These are just
maps of New York.

99
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,720
Keep them open. Every time you stop
and get lost,

100
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,459
you know where
you are.

101
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,832
And these are the safety reflective
belts. All right, they light up.

102
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,996
I'm not gonna
wear that.

103
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,166
- Yeah, you should.
- No, I'm not wearing it.

104
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,869
Don't give it to me,
I'm not gonna wear it.

105
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,433
Would you rather
get murdered?

106
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,610
Come on.

107
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,923
...'cause he's down
in the hole doing nothing.

108
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,949
- Whoa.
- All right, go.

109
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,824
Did they
get him out or?

110
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,796
- Yeah, they got him out.
- Yeah.

111
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,526
- Yeah, Justin found him.
- You got a cigarette?

112
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,898
- Sorry, we don't smoke.
- Oh, that's too bad.

113
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,994
Because my man Mickey here
wants a cigarette,

114
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,165
so now you're gonna have
to give him some money.

115
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,231
Oh... we don't
have any money, man.

116
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,903
Listen, you don't want to mess with him,
because he's crazy, man,

117
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,741
all right?
He's a psycho-killer.

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,647
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Give me some money.

119
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,674
- Well, I've got $15.
- Okay, hand it over.

120
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,879
No, but it's in the bank. We'd have
to go to the bank to get it out.

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,047
No, we don't have time
to go to the bank, dipshit.

122
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,522
We might just
have time.

123
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,184
Empty your pockets,
let's go.

124
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,090
Give me what
you got.

125
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,618
"Go to a bank."
Give me this.

126
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,927
No... no keys.
What is this?

127
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,227
What the hell?

128
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,497
Why... why does the phone
have a camera glued to it?

129
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,232
It's a camera phone.
Jemaine wanted one for his birthday.

130
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,206
Look at this.

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,674
- Oh yeah? Where'd you get it?
- I made it. It's homemade.

132
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,177
Yeah, it's a piece
of shit.

133
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,008
Well, how come Jemaine
likes it so much?

134
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,139
- You can have it.
- No no, he doesn't want it.

135
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,979
Yeah yeah, I'll keep it.
It's kind of interesting.

136
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,678
- You like it?
- Yeah.

137
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,778
- Give us the bike.
- Oh you don't need the bike, man.

138
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,846
- You got the camera phone.
- You'd better be careful,

139
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,858
- because Bret knows karate.
- Yeah, I got a book on karate.

140
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,224
I haven't actually read
it yet, but I've got...

141
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,991
Shut up, you English faggots,
and give me the bike!

142
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,625
You'd better watch out. You don't really
know who you're dealing with.

143
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,966
Oh really? And who exactly
are we dealing with?

144
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,528
# I'm the mother-flippin'
Rhymenoceros #

145
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,098
# My beats are phat and the birds are
on my back and I'm horny #

146
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,009
# I'm horny, if you choose to proceed,
you will indeed concede #

147
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,479
# 'Cause I hit you with my flow,
the wild rhyme stampede #

148
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,039
# I'm not just wild,
I'm trained, domesticated #

149
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,074
# I was raised by a rapper
and writer... they dated #

150
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,780
# And subsequently
procreated #

151
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,879
# That's how it goes,
here's the Hiphopopotamus #

152
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,584
- # The hip-hop hippo #
- # They call me the Hiphopopotamus #

153
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,217
# My lyrics
are bottomless... #

154
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,962
Uh.

155
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,639
# They call me
the Hiphopopotamus #

156
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,008
# Flows, they glow
like phosphorus #

157
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,945
# Poppin' off the top
of the esophagus #

158
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,415
# Rockin' this metropolis,
I'm not a large water-dwelling mammal #

159
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,441
# Where did you get that
preposterous hypothesis? #

160
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,510
# Did Steve tell you that,
perchance? #

161
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,146
# Mmm, Steve #

162
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,954
# My rhymes and records,
they don't get played #

163
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,461
# Because my records and
rhymes, they don't get made #

164
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,759
# And if you rap like me,
you don't get paid #

165
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,289
# And if you roll like me,
you don't get laid #

166
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,858
# My rhymes are so potent
that in this small segment #

167
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,531
# I made all of the ladies
in the area pregnant #

168
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,597
# Yes, sometimes
my lyrics are sexist #

169
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,269
# But you lovely bitches now should know
I'm trying to correct this #

170
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,505
# Other rappers
diss me #

171
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,014
# They say my rhymes
are sissy #

172
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,572
- # Why? #
- # Why? #

173
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,709
- # Why? #
- # Why exactly? #

174
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,878
# What... why? #

175
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,717
# Be more constructive
with your feedback #

176
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,519
- # Please, why? #
- # Why? #

177
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,719
# Why? 'Cause I rap
about reality #

178
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,955
# Like me and my grandma
drinking a cup of tea #

179
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,021
# There ain't no party
like my nana's tea party #

180
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,260
# Hi-ho #

181
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,101
# I'm the mother-flippin' #

182
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,537
# I'm the mother-flippin' #

183
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,803
# I'm the
mother-flippin' #

184
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,140
# Who's the
mother-flippin'? #

185
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,372
# I'm the
mother-flippin' #

186
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,007
# I'm the
mother-flippin' #

187
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,314
# I'm the
mother-flippin' #

188
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,013
# Mother-flippin'. #

189
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,589
You guys dancing
a little bit?

190
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,922
- No.
- I told you to give us the bikes,

191
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,587
you didn't listen,
so now this is happening.

192
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,755
Mickey, show them
the knife.

193
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,190
- That's not a knife.
- Yeah, that's a knife.

194
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,226
Oh, it is a knife.

195
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,170
Get 'em, get 'em.

196
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,268
Get 'em!

197
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,058
Uh, Bret, my sleeve just...
help me,

198
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,569
my sleeve's just caught
on the fence.

199
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm too scared, man.

200
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,600
Bret, the corduroy's caught
on the fence, Bret.

201
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,946
Oh, flip.

202
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,321
We'd locked our bikes up,
and then the...

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,419
the gang just
surrounded us.

204
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,396
And suddenly, yeah,
they everywhere...

205
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,956
- We were around here somewhere.
- Well, how many were there?

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,764
- There was two of them.
- Two? That's not a gang.

207
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,668
- It was a two-man gang.
- Two-man gang.

208
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,037
- Can you have that, David?
- Well that's a pretty small gang.

209
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,269
I mean, technically,
the smallest gang possible.

210
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,369
- Can you put that gun down?
- Murray,

211
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,744
it's a paint-pellet gun.

212
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,545
- Well, what happened after that?
- Well, then we ran down here,

213
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,178
they chased us and Jemaine got...
got caught on the fence.

214
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,346
- What did Jemaine do then?
- Well, he was stuck on a...

215
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,448
And then just going, "Bret, help me,
help me. I'm stuck on the fence."

216
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,186
- What happened after that?
- Um...

217
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,626
- I ran away.
- You just left him there

218
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,129
to fight them himself?

219
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,995
Well, I left him on the...
he was on the fence.

220
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,626
- Bret!
- Well, I was... I was very scared.

221
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,397
- We were being mugged.
- Well, for a start,

222
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,598
you could have told me this two days ago
when it happened.

223
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,834
Well, I just thought he would have
come home by now.

224
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,001
Who knows what could have happened
to him? He could be in hospital.

225
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,068
A lot of New Zealanders
come over here

226
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,545
and they come
into my office,

227
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,548
and I give them the vest,
a map, and I tell them

228
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,176
to stay clear of crowds by going
through back alleys.

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,379
Yet almost every day
a New Zealander is mugged.

230
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,184
You just don't know. You hear
a lot of terrible things happening.

231
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,317
- He may be dead.
- He maybe did what?

232
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,921
- He may be dead.
- I know, but what did he maybe do?

233
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,396
He may be dead.

234
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
Yeah, maybe he did,
maybe he didn't.

235
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,892
- What did he maybe do?
- No, he may be dead.

236
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,198
Are you guys
fucking with me?

237
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,364
- What?
- Not alive.

238
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,533
You know... dead.

239
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,668
Oh. Oh.

240
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,211
I can't believe that
he just ran off like that

241
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,581
when the cops came
and left me there.

242
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,253
Can you... can you believe that he would
just abandon me like that?

243
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,089
That kind of thing,
it defines character.

244
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,461
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

245
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,591
Yeah, you know, 'cause
you were deserted too.

246
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,601
Huh? Anything could
have happened to you.

247
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,125
I know.
You could have killed me.

248
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,831
Could have
totally killed you.

249
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,603
Is that what you...

250
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,541
is that the kind
of thing you do?

251
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,942
You... kill people?

252
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,412
Maybe.

253
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,915
Why, you ever
kill somebody?

254
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,215
- Not really.
- No?

255
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,915
Yeah, me neither.

256
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,652
Killed a monkey once.

257
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,626
Mmm. Uh-huh.

258
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,565
Don't tell anybody
about that, okay?

259
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,931
'Cause I'm not
proud of it.

260
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,936
- Oh, I won't tell anyone.
- You'd better not.

261
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,961
I won't.

262
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,440
Definitely not.

263
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,740
Hey guys, remember that time he got his
hand caught in that jar?

264
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,245
What a dick.

265
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,771
I mean, who gets
their hand caught in a jar?

266
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,910
What a big
fucking asshole he was.

267
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,011
- That was... that was actually me.
- That was Bret.

268
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,887
- Are you sure? 'Cause I thought...
- It was Bret, David.

269
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,516
Jemaine was the one
who helped you out.

270
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,551
And he helped you when you got your
head stuck in the chair.

271
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,222
- Remember?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,855
You were there
for hours.

273
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,526
He was just a helpful guy,
you know?

274
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,763
- Loyal.
- Yeah.

275
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,800
Just hope
he's not dead.

276
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,009
There's still a chance
he's not dead.

277
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,015
Hey, what was that
one thing he used to say?

278
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,381
I mean, that always cracked me up.
He'd be like...

279
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,942
- he'd be like...
- What?

280
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,147
Yeah, that's it.
He'd be like, "What?

281
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,782
What? What?"

282
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,759
You know, I never understood
a fucking word that guy said.

283
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,887
- He did say "what" a lot.
- He did, he did, yeah.

284
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,624
- "What? What?"
- "What's going on?"

285
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,154
- Yeah.
- "What."

286
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,133
He listened, he was just
always questioning.

287
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,658
- "When? When?"
- "When, when?"

288
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,831
"When are we
getting a gig?"

289
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,841
I mean, so you can picture
the situation, right?

290
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,706
I got Mickey's cousin
tied up in a chair,

291
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,506
supposed to shoot him
in the kneecap,

292
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,604
teach him some lesson,
you know?

293
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,774
- About something.
- What... what sort of thing?

294
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,374
I don't know,
some family shit, you know?

295
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,009
- Yeah.
- It's between them. I don't ask.

296
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,213
So anyway...
I shoot him.

297
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,224
Then I get a text...
this is 45 minutes later.

298
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,885
Yeah, a text, mind you,
all right?

299
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,451
Not a phone call...
"Oh, hey,

300
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,520
by the way, John,
call it off."

301
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,532
- That's terrible.
- Call the thing off.

302
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,193
- After I... after I did it.
- A text.

303
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,964
Worst part, he had known for two days
before he texted me.

304
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,437
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,030
So I got to untie
the guy, right?

306
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,371
I got to apologize.
He's bleeding all over the place,

307
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,071
I got to help him. It was very awkward
shit. I was very upset about it.

308
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,602
I can imagine, John.
That sounds so...

309
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,308
- that sounds terrible.
- It was horrible.

310
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,340
- Bret did exactly that same thing.
- Really?

311
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,546
Yeah, one time we were
supposed to go to the movies,

312
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,556
- and... uh, "March of the Penguins."
- Oh, I love that movie.

313
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,217
And, he... I had
bought the tickets,

314
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,249
and he didn't turn up.
He texted me,

315
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,955
said, "I'm not coming."

316
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,667
Well, that's... that's not really
the same thing,

317
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,829
is it?
I mean...

318
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,896
I... I shot a guy,

319
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,168
you know?

320
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,733
Yours is worse.

321
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,384
Excuse me, gentlemen?

322
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,718
Your friend you reported dead, we think
we might have found him.

323
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,484
Now is he a guy
who wears glasses?

324
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,219
- No.
- Yeah.

325
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,057
- Yes.
- About 6'1, 6'2, Caucasian?

326
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,063
He's from
New Zealand.

327
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,066
Yeah, kind of talks in a monotone,
sounds like a robot?

328
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,692
Well, that's
the New Zealand accent.

329
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,364
Right. Kind of sounds like,
"What? What, what?

330
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,373
Don't poot me
in there weeth him.

331
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,272
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent"?

332
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,140
- Yes, that's definitely him.
- That's him.

333
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,544
It's a little bit more
sort of South African.

334
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,605
Think we might need
to see him visually.

335
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,139
Sure.

336
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,722
Is she gonna
bring the body out here?

337
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,893
- You okay?
- Yes.

338
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,804
- You're acting a little bit weird.
- No, I'm not.

339
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,274
- You are.
- No, I'm not. This is what I'm like.

340
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,833
You're annoyed.

341
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,277
No.

342
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,338
Is it 'cause I ate
the last of your muesli?

343
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,612
No.

344
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,516
Because they took
your camera phone?

345
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,612
No, it's not 'cause
they took the camera phone.

346
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,681
'Cause I rented your half
of the apartment out to Rueben?

347
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,692
Does he have to
stay here still?

348
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,159
Well, he's paid
two weeks' rent,

349
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,025
'cause I didn't think
you were coming back.

350
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,361
No, he's okay.

351
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,993
Is it because I ran away
when we were being mugged

352
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,263
and left you with
guys with a knife?

353
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,464
- Yes, actually. Yes.
- Oh, okay.

354
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,268
I knew it, yeah.

355
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,508
Well, it was a high-
pressure situation, man.

356
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,705
I had to... you know,
I had to make a decision.

357
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,407
You would have
done the same thing.

358
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,110
I wouldn't have. You abandoned me.
You left me to die.

359
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,381
I wouldn't have done it if I'd known you
were gonna hassle me about it.

360
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,819
You shouldn't have
done it anyway.

361
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,412
- Hassling me.
- I'm not hassling you.

362
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,424
- You are hassling me.
- I'm just pointing out

363
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,858
that when you're in a situation where
you're being mugged, you shouldn't

364
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,953
- leave your friend to die.
- Hassling me.

365
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,022
- Height of rudeness.
- Okay, David Hassle-hoff.

366
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,172
Oh my God.
Jemaine, are you okay?

367
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,698
- Yeah.
- You're out?

368
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,405
- Mm-hmm.
- Did the cops try to strip search you?

369
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,971
- No.
- Did they find anything?

370
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,142
No, they didn't
strip search me.

371
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,015
Oh, I... I thought
you said they did.

372
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,178
- No.
- Oh.

373
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,620
Well, did any
of your cellmates, you know,

374
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,385
- rape you in the a...
- No. No no no.

375
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh good, good. 'Cause if...
if I was a convict,

376
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,158
you know, and I was in a cell
with a pretty boy like you,

377
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,428
I would definitely wait till lights out,
put my hand over your mouth...

378
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,866
I've gotta...
I've gotta go.

379
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,392
Oh, you're kind of
like a convict now.

380
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,371
Makes you seem
so dangerous,

381
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,397
like you could
just do anything.

382
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,874
He was only in there
for two days.

383
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,901
Bret, I know
what you did. Mmm?

384
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,780
Being in jail just
makes you seem so sexy.

385
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,115
I guess it's
the danger aspect.

386
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,178
What are you
gonna do to me?

387
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,349
Do it!
No, don't, don't.

388
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,120
- See you guys later.
- See ya.

389
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,219
Oh, yeah, just run, Bret.
Just run.

390
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,958
It's like Bonnie and Clyde, you know.
They would rob banks,

391
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,625
and then they
would do each other.

392
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,258
Actually, I've...
I've got to go too.

393
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,394
I've got to go to
the same meeting as Bret.

394
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,962
Oh, okay.
They'd get off on it.

395
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,339
- Jemaine?
- Yes.

396
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,344
- Bret?
- Um, Rhymenoceros.

397
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,141
- Rhymenoceros, yep.
- Yep, present.

398
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,239
- That's not a real gangster name.
- What?

399
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,807
- And Murray.
- Well, I've been on the inside,

400
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,978
I know what sort
of names gangsters have.

401
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,612
Like John.

402
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,247
There was another guy
there... Ralph.

403
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,258
Well, you were only
in there for two days, man.

404
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,590
Hey, guys,
what's going on here?

405
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,186
Well, Jemaine just
keeps on hassling me

406
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,254
about how I abandoned him
when we got mugged.

407
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,129
And why are you
angry with him?

408
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, he left me
to die.

409
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,297
Yeah well, we all know that.
Old news.

410
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,804
No one likes
a moaner.

411
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,069
Yeah well, he just keeps on
going on about it.

412
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,167
And having said that, no one likes
an abandoner either, Bret.

413
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,338
Now you don't abandon each other
in life-threatening situations.

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,404
Okay.

415
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,348
What happens is the guy
who's left behind...

416
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,908
Jemaine... may feel
left behind.

417
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,079
Yeah?
Abandonment issues.

418
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,419
Not only that, but he could
be seriously injured.

419
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,290
- You were just lucky.
- Well, I wasn't that lucky.

420
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,123
Well, they said
you didn't need that.

421
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,822
I don't... I don't
trust him anymore.

422
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,922
- Oh, you don't mean that.
- Yeah? What do I mean?

423
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,557
Calm down, Jemaine!

424
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,261
Sorry, if I can't trust him
on the streets,

425
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,532
I can't trust him
on the stage.

426
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,198
I can't do
another gig with him

427
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,434
without going against
everything I stand for.

428
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,204
Well, what if you
actually had another gig?

429
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,234
- Well, then I would.
- Yeah?

430
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,473
- Mmm.
- I haven't actually got you one,

431
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,345
but that's good to know.

432
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,782
You know, I'm always
trying to get you gigs.

433
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,309
All right?

434
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,515
What's this meeting
about?

435
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,956
Well, one of
my CDs is missing.

436
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,463
So your friend... your best friend
in the whole world

437
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,298
just left you there with a bunch
of crazy-ass muggers?

438
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,804
- Hey. Oh.
- Shh.

439
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,362
Were you scared?

440
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,137
Uh, yeah... yeah, I guess I was
kind of scared, right?

441
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,439
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

442
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,844
But, then again,

443
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,213
- I wasn't scared.
- Oh wow.

444
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,946
I just can't believe a friend would
do that. What a douche bag.

445
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,921
I know.
What a douche bag.

446
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,014
Can't believe what
you did, man.

447
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,752
You leave
your best friend

448
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,317
with a couple of hoodlums who are
about to mug him? That's cold.

449
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,490
But to be fair to Bret, John, you were
one of those hoodlums

450
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,227
- mugging us, you know?
- Yeah.

451
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,167
Yeah, that's true.

452
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,762
I guess I am somewhat
to blame as well, huh?

453
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,466
- But it's still shitty, what he did.
- Yes, I agree with that.

454
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,067
It's still very much
shitty, what you did, Bret.

455
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,408
Okay, because to abandon
someone like that

456
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,380
really sucks, man.
It hurts.

457
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,383
At least I didn't
kill a monkey.

458
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,214
Dawg.

459
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,389
- Okay, this is gonna work.
- Hey.

460
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,419
He's really sorry.

461
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,226
Brought you
a cup of tea, man.

462
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,392
- No, thank you, Bret.
- Please grab it, it's hot.

463
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,425
- It's hot.
- Deal with it yourself.

464
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,403
That's what I've learned
to do the hard way.

465
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,532
Oh, ow ow ow...
oh, fuck! Ow.

466
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,043
Ow ow! Ah ah!

467
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,204
I guess
we're even then.

468
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,841
Jemaine, I made you
some pizza.

469
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,873
I'm not hungry!

470
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,956
Hey, man, I met you the other day when
you mugged me.

471
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,050
Umm, the bike and the camera phone that
you're talking to me...

472
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,254
Yeah yeah.
The one that ran away.

473
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,388
Yeah. Look, I'm wondering if
there's a chance

474
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,955
I could get
the phone back.

475
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,165
Hey, Jemaine,
I'll see you later, maybe.

476
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,501
Bye, Bret.

477
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,972
If I live, that is,
'cause I might get killed.

478
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,942
Okay, let me know
how that goes. C-10.

479
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,069
Hit.

480
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,170
Yes.
What, sorry?

481
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,771
I'm going to get
your camera phone back.

482
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,749
If I die, I want you
to tell my mom.

483
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,479
Okay. Well, write...
write down her address.

484
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,987
Write it down
on that piece of paper.

485
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,787
B-10.

486
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,623
Well, just phone... you can just
phone her and tell her.

487
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,424
Oh, okay,
I'll just phone her.

488
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,431
- It's easier.
- 'Cause I might not come back.

489
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,330
Okay.

490
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,696
So this is it, man. I'm going to get
your camera phone now.

491
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,969
- You don't need to go and do that.
- Yes, I do.

492
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,499
- No, you don't.
- Well, you loved that thing.

493
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,376
Yeah, I didn't really
love that camera phone

494
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,404
as much as you
thought I loved it.

495
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,281
In fact, I kind of think
you ruined my phone

496
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,617
when you made me that camera phone.
And my camera.

497
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,885
I see what you're doing.
No way, man.

498
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,858
I'll get it for you.
I'll get it for you.

499
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:43,029
# There's children on the street
using guns and knives #

500
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,368
# Taking drugs
and each other's lives #

501
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,967
# Killing each other
with knives and forks #

502
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,809
# Calling each other
names like dork #

503
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,007
# There's people
on the street #

504
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,517
# Getting diseases
from monkeys #

505
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,351
# Yeah, that's what I said, they're
getting diseases from monkeys #

506
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,788
# Now there's junkies
with monkey disease #

507
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,314
# Who's touching
these monkeys? #

508
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,554
# P-lease leave these
poor sick monkeys alone #

509
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,789
# They've got problems
enough as it is #

510
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,630
# Man is lying on the street,
some punk's chopped off his head #

511
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,661
# I'm the only one who stops
to see if he's dead #

512
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,703
# Mmm, turns out
he's dead #

513
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,713
# And that's why
I'm singing #

514
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,911
# What... what is wrong
with the world today? #

515
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,509
# What's wrong
with the world today? #

516
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:41,518
# What... what is wrong
with the world today? #

517
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,687
- # Hey hey #
- # You've got to think about it #

518
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,196
# I said think about it #

519
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,891
# Good cops
being framed #

520
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,695
# And put
into a can #

521
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,725
# All the money
that we're making #

522
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,533
# It's going
to the Man #

523
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,267
# What man? Which man?
Who's the man? #

524
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,275
# When's a man a man?
What makes a man a man? #

525
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,402
# Am I a man? Yes #

526
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,809
# Technically, I am #

527
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,280
# They're turning kids
into slaves #

528
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,340
# Just to make
cheaper sneakers #

529
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,352
# But what's
the real cost? #

530
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,049
# 'Cause the sneakers don't
seem that much cheaper #

531
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,387
# Why are we still paying
so much for sneakers #

532
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,258
# When they're made
by little slave kids? #

533
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,761
# What are
your overheads? #

534
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,889
# At the end
of your life #

535
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,764
# You're lucky
if you die #

536
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:26,635
# Sometimes I wonder
why we even try #

537
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,402
# Saw a man lying on
the street half-dead #

538
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,139
# With knives and forks
sticking out of his leg #

539
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,276
# He said, "Ah ah ah,
ow ow ow ow ow ow #

540
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,549
# Can somebody get the knife and fork
out of my leg please?" #

541
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,922
# "Can somebody please remove these
cutleries from my knees?" #

542
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,429
# And then
we break it down #

543
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,829
# This is where
we break it down... ooh #

544
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,197
# This is where we
break it down... ahh #

545
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:00,034
# This is where we do the... whoa whoa,
break it down #

546
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,039
# This is where
we build it up now #

547
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,041
- # We build it up now #
- # We're building it up now #

548
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,475
- # We build it up now #
- # We build it up #

549
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,775
- # Build it up! #
- # And then we stop. #

550
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,944
Hey, you guys.

551
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,680
It's me, one of the guys
who mugged you last week?

552
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,187
The camera phone?
We talked on the phone?

553
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,122
Oh yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah hey, how's it going?

554
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,419
You know, not good.

555
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,324
Um, do you have
the camera phone?

556
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,191
Yeah.
Here it is.

557
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,829
Here are the photos...
I got 'em developed.

558
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,801
From the camera phone.

559
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,701
You guys had
some really good times, huh?

560
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,170
Ah.

561
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,333
I hope you don't mind,
there's some of me in there.

562
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,035
I had to
finish out the roll.

563
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,976
That's me
on a roller coaster.

564
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,138
What's that one?
It's me with a shopkeeper,

565
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,172
pointing... - pointing a gun.
Actually, I should take that.

566
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,082
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

567
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,018
Hey, how's John?

568
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,487
We don't really
talk much anymore.

569
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,149
Oh, yeah.
You don't see him?

570
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,488
Yeah, I've seen him...
he's over there.

571
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,756
We're not really
friends though, anymore.

572
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,922
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, he...

573
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,159
he couldn't really forgive me
for running out on him like that.

574
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,666
You know?

575
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,532
I should have stuck
with him and saw it through.

576
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,968
Yeah.

577
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,801
We had these really
big plans, you know?

578
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,171
We were
gonna go uptown,

579
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,800
kidnap a rich kid,

580
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,903
and ransom him
and... yeah.

581
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,846
None of that's
really gonna happen now.

582
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,010
- That's a real shame.
- Yeah, it is.

583
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,951
- We'll probably see you around, so...
- Yeah.

584
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,182
- Is this where you usually mug?
- Usually, um...

585
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,087
I've been too depressed
to work recently.

586
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,786
I just wish John was big enough
to accept my apology, you know?

587
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,125
Well man, we're gonna
get some pizza.

588
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,688
Do you want to come and get a slice
of pizza or something?

589
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,361
- Yeah? Really? Oh, I'd love to, man.
- Yeah, okay.

590
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,394
Um, I'm going to
a White Supremacist gig.

591
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,339
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Oh yeah?

592
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,809
Well, we'll probably just
get the pizza.

593
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,335
- Mickey?
- Hey, man.

594
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,711
Bret.

595
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,909
Hey, John.

596
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,282
- Jemaine.
- John.

597
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,412
Mickey, uh...

598
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,547
you wanna hang out?

599
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,916
Sure, man.

600
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,332
Man, this whole week's
been terrible.

601
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,732
I haven't felt this bad
since Cheeky died.

602
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,930
Man, I miss that monkey.
