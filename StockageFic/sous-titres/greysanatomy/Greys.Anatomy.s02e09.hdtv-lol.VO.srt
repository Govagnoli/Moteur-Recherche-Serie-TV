1
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:02,257
Gratitude,

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:03,822
Appreciation,

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:06,022
giving thanks

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,296
no matter what words you use,

5
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:10,287
it all means the same thing

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,071
Happy.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,285
We're supposed to be happy,

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,562
grateful for friends,family.

9
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,285
Happy to just be alive.

10
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:25,413
Whether we like it or not.

11
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,329
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,642
Answering the door.

13
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,814
You're going to the hospital?

14
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:32,691
Yes,but
Meredith,

15
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,921
everyone is supposed
to be in the kitchen by 9 a.m.

16
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:35,781
To help me make dinner.

17
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:36,891
It'sThanksgiving.

18
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,691
I'm really not in the mood.

19
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:39,579
But it's like a family

20
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,641
Doorbell.

21
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,250
This where Georgie lives?

22
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:47,795
Georgie?

23
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:48,638
O'malley.

24
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:49,748
Where is he,upstairs?

25
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:50,953
Oh,George.

26
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:54,720
O'malley! O'malley!

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,654
Should I call the police?

28
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,001
O'malley!

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,625
Meredith,
I'm serious!

30
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,084
You need to be back here
for dinner at 6. I mean it!

31
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:08,684
Five,four,three,two

32
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:12,029
Happy Thanksgiving!

33
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,438
So,

34
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,248
I was thinking

35
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:22,917
that we could

36
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:25,903
have sex tonight.

37
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,519
Look,I know we're both
gonna feel weird about it,

38
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:34,729
and it's the first time

39
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:35,801
since Mark.

40
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,433
And Meredith.

41
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:41,473
I have the day off.

42
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,486
Do you have the day off?

43
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:45,263
I have stop by the hospital.

44
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:46,767
I have patients
I need to check on.

45
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:48,686
If you have the day off,

46
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,862
what are you doing here?

47
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:51,270
I was thinking

48
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:52,613
we could have sex tonight.

49
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:53,894
Come on,

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,046
I made a reservation at noon.

51
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:56,814
I figure we could do
The Thanksgiving thing,

52
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,236
you know, and then

53
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,873
I don't know,just rip the stitches.

54
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:01,779
Get it over with.

55
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:02,924
No anesthesia.

56
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,689
Right.
What do you think?

57
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:09,573
Grey

58
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,758
we're working with a
temp attending today.

59
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:12,549
Dr. Kent

60
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:13,971
he's subbing in from Mercy west.

61
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:14,991
We need to get him oriented.

62
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:17,458
And thank you for
volunteering to come in.

63
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,392
Saved me from having to
choose an intern to torture.

64
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:21,867
Happy to be tortured.

65
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:24,537
Not a fan of Thanksgiving?

66
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:27,148
Not a whole hell of a
lot to be thankful for.

67
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,129
I like Thanksgiving.

68
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,865
A day people spend
with their families.

69
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,037
Too much family time
triggers depression,

70
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,915
repressed childhood rage,

71
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,040
bitter disputes over the remote

72
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:39,582
and way too much alcohol.

73
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,912
People get stupid,
people get violent,

74
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:42,896
people get hurt.

75
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,305
And that's a good thing because

76
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,616
surgeries,Grey.

77
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,472
Lots and lots of surgeries.

78
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,059
I never thought of that.

79
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,960
The stupidity of the human race, Grey

80
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,818
be thankful for that.

81
00:02:58,588 --> 00:02:59,510
You're supposed to be at home.

82
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:00,861
So are you.

83
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,082
Best maze procedure
I've ever done.

84
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,086
Under an hour.

85
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,320
I thought you had the day off.

86
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:07,764
I did. I do.
I'm leaving.

87
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,179
I simply like to start my day cutting.

88
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:11,660
It gives me a rush.
Yeah,admit it.

89
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,475
You can't function 10 feet
away from the hospital.

90
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,019
I notice you're both here.

91
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,301
Well,I'm here for an hour.

92
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,364
I'm on my way home.

93
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,432
Say it like you mean it.

94
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,945
I know how to have a
life outside this hospital.

95
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:26,662
Damn right,you do.

96
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:29,729
Dr. Kent.
Yes.

97
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,744
I'm the surgical resident
assisting you today.

98
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,371
I know you're subbing
in from Mercy West,

99
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,631
so if there is anything
I can do to help you

100
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:37,694
look,I'm here for one day.

101
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:38,930
I don't need my ass kissed.

102
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,853
All I need is to tell you

103
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:40,953
what to do and you do it,

104
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,107
and I don't like mistakes.

105
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,477
I don't make mistakes.

106
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:44,319
Whatever.

107
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:46,192
There's only one resident
I want in my o.r.

108
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:47,446
The guy they call the nazi.

109
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,322
Do you know him?

110
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,682
The, the nazi?

111
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,241
He gets great word of mouth,

112
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,182
stellar rep balls
the size of texas.

113
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,211
That big?

114
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:58,680
Sounds like an impressively
talented man this nazi.

115
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,869
Do you know him or not?

116
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,056
Never heard of him.

117
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,132
But I'll be sure to keep an eye out.

118
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,766
For now you can work on smaller cases.

119
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,225
A guy just came in to curtain three.

120
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,930
Page me if you get confused.

121
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,687
I'll be sure to do that.

122
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,521
Like I said,
the stupidity of the human race.

123
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:17,883
Hurry up,Georgie.

124
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,241
There's a turkey out there
with your name on it,huh?

125
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,479
Whoa. Hey.
Where are you going?

126
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,466
Hey! Where are you going?

127
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,107
Every year,my father,
my brothers

128
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:29,945
and I hunt shoot
and kill a helpless,

129
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:30,795
slow-moving turkey.

130
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:31,569
Isn't that great?

131
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:32,967
O'malley!

132
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,403
Okay,but what about dinner?

133
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,006
we'll have him back as soon as

134
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,212
he kills his first bird.

135
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,716
This is the year Georgie
becomes a man,

136
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:39,618
right,Georgie?

137
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:41,094
Come on.

138
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:42,557
Wait,I can't cook dinner by myself!

139
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,367
Who's gonna help me?

140
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,600
Who's gonna help me?

141
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:49,663
Holden Mckee

142
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:51,241
brought in from mayfield
nursing home.

143
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,926
Mayfield?
He's in the garden?

144
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,813
Garden?
Vegetable.

145
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:55,802
Yeah,his chart says

146
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,983
he fell into a persistent vegetative
state 16 years ago.

147
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,270
He was a firefighter

148
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,492
injured by falling debris
in the line of duty.

149
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,115
What brings him here today?

150
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,036
Fell from his bed while being
turned by the orderlies.

151
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:09,166
Insurance says he has
to be checked out.

152
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:13,567
Temporoparietal scalp lac
with associated hematoma.

153
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:14,803
What's your plan?

154
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,286
Irrigate and explore the
wound repair the lac.

155
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,363
He'll need a c.t. To rule out
intracerebral haemorrhage,

156
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:22,269
contusion or cerebral edema.

157
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:24,127
Go to it.
If anybody asks,

158
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,082
I'm off looking for the nazi.

159
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,052
Okay.

160
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,813
It's just me and you.

161
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,789
I'd give anything for
your kind of serenity.

162
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:42,206
Great.

163
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,008
Now I'm jealous of vegetables.

164
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,069
You just look so peaceful.

165
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,067
Dr. Bailey.

166
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,551
This guy's got third-degree
burns over half his body.

167
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,150
Tried to deep-fry a turkey.

168
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,643
Of course,
he got drunk first.

169
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,042
It's gonna be good.
You want in?

170
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:09,212
My p.v.s. Case

171
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,304
he opened his eyes,

172
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,769
and I think he was looking at me.

173
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:15,506
He wasn't looking at you.

174
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,348
No,he was.
Anything good?

175
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,489
Uh,nothing you want
to waste time on.

176
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,190
There are 13 patients
that need sutures.

177
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:25,478
She's the intern.

178
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:26,558
She can do the sutures.

179
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,036
Actually, she's on her way to c.t.

180
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,222
With a v.i.p. Patient

181
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,768
on orders from the nazi.

182
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,335
Tell him I'm looking for him.

183
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:37,601
Okay.
The burn unit is waiting for him.

184
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,882
I'll meet in the o.r.
Grey, get a c.t.

185
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:40,911
Have neuro consult,

186
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,128
but trust me he wasn't
looking at you.

187
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:47,210
Don't mention Shepherd
or Montgomery-Shepherd.

188
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:48,434
Okay.

189
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,491
Or the fact that Shepherd is
with Montgomery-Shepherd.

190
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:51,443
Okay.

191
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,719
Or anything having
to do with syphilis.

192
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,216
I've been in social
situations before.

193
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,471
Yeah,well
not with me.

194
00:06:58,935 --> 00:06:59,969
Well, why are we here?

195
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,967
Just be nice or something.

196
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,894
It's half past 10.
You're late.

197
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,031
I've had to try to do all this

198
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,720
Hi,Dr. Burke.
Hello.

199
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,001
What was I supposed to do,

200
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:20,539
blow off my boyfriend
for Thanksgiving?

201
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,503
I tried to but he wouldn't blow.

202
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,264
He's like something sticky
that won't blow off.

203
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,717
okay,he's gonna ruin Thanksgiving.

204
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,954
What am I supposed to
talk to Dr. Burke about?

205
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,654
People who are shocked
when I show up

206
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,617
uninvited to their homes
call me Preston.

207
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:36,243
Nobody calls you Preston.

208
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,169
You don't call me Preston.

209
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:40,399
Nice house.

210
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,807
Izzie,
why is it so quiet in here?

211
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:44,993
Meredith went to the hospital

212
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,809
and George is off shooting
things with his family.

213
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,023
So it's just me,
you and Preston?

214
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,703
And Alex,
when he shows up.

215
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,542
Oh,great.

216
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,015
Hey,Alex, it's me.
Where are you?

217
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,229
Okay,call me back.

218
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,860
Is something burning?

219
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,144
Oh,god,yes!

220
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,032
Hey,chief.

221
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm on my way home.

222
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,453
Yeah,me too.

223
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:05,879
I was supposed to meet
Addison 20 minutes ago.

224
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,070
Dr. Shepherd,
are you leaving?

225
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,299
I'm also going home.

226
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,299
Then go home.

227
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:13,399
Adele's sister's in town.

228
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,198
I hate that woman.

229
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,101
The o.r. Board needs to be
checked one more time.

230
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,943
It does,doesn't it?
Excuse me.

231
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,318
I didn't think you'd be here today.

232
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:25,406
Yeah,well

233
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,581
I need a neuro consult.

234
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,878
Holden mckee, p.v.s. 16 years.

235
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:31,569
Well,there's no bleed,

236
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,831
there's no mass,no fracture.

237
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,675
He, he can be discharged.

238
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:36,854
Well,he opened his eyes

239
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,346
when I was examining him.

240
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,196
He opened his eyes.
Yeah,that's normal.

241
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,665
Certain reflexes are preserved.

242
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:42,900
There's arousal but no awareness.

243
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:44,721
But he was looking at me.

244
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,620
He wasn't looking at you.
He was.

245
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:48,019
This c.t. Report says he wasn't.

246
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,147
Do you want to argue with
what I know I saw?

247
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:50,800
No,meredith,

248
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,070
I don't want to argue with you anymore

249
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,426
I gotta go.
I'm late.

250
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:57,971
He was looking at you?

251
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,074
65 gto.

252
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,879
'57 bel air convertible,2-door.

253
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:08,596
The gt 500, that was a car.

254
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,459
Georgie,pick a car.
Come on.

255
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:14,729
You do realize that
you can buy a turkey

256
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:16,410
at the market?

257
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,646
They have hundreds of them,

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,460
you know,all wrapped
and ready to go,

259
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,215
no ammo required.

260
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,322
You'll be the one to
shoot the turkey today.

261
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:25,648
I can feel it.

262
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:26,631
That's the thing,

263
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,019
I don't want to shoot a turkey.

264
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,112
You say that every year.

265
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,269
Well,and every year,

266
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:34,910
I don't shoot the turkey.

267
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:38,731
What is that?

268
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,261
It was supposed to be my marinade.

269
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,287
Alex,it's me again.

270
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,696
Just wondering where you were at.

271
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,370
You've never made a
Thanksgiving dinner before.

272
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,990
You can't cook?

273
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,043
Izzie!

274
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,581
Well, I'm a baker.
I bake.

275
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:54,272
But I've seen my grandmother
cook a million times.

276
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,083
Okay,that's it.

277
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,240
If there's no food,
I'm going home.

278
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,707
Cristina,Cristina
I have this.

279
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,412
What are you using
as a reference text?

280
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:00,353
"The joy of cooking."

281
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,319
I also printed up some
recipes from the internet,

282
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:03,725
but they all seem to
contradict one another.

283
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,807
And I can't figure out
which side of the turkey

284
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:07,092
is the top and which is the bottom.

285
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,692
Okay.

286
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,930
I'm gonna need a basting brush,

287
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,271
a bowl,a clove of garlic and

288
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:22,321
do you have any fennel?

289
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,067
Um,yeah,right here.

290
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,538
Well, let's get this turkey up
and running,Stevens.

291
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:32,777
Garlic.

292
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,523
Garlic.

293
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,019
I'm gonna need liquor
lots and lots of liquor.

294
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,574
There's no sustained visual pursuit.

295
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,786
You know,you might have
just seen him respond

296
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:46,442
to some sort of external stimuli.

297
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,256
He wasn't looking at you.
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,097
I was sure he was.
Look.

299
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:54,148
He just did it again.

300
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,928
Mr. Mckee

301
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,080
Can you follow the light?

302
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,269
Can you hold up two fingers?

303
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,846
Okay,well,I know you're
late for something so.

304
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,429
keep talking.
What?

305
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:14,054
Walk over here.

306
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:15,889
What?
Just keep walking,talk.

307
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,136
Holden.

308
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,181
Holden.

309
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:21,477
Can you hear me?

310
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,273
Holden.

311
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,742
It's you.
He's tracking you.

312
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,182
He's following your voice.

313
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:32,841
well,that's why there's no mention

314
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,554
of brain atrophy in the c.t.
Report.

315
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,974
Because there isn't any.

316
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:37,622
None?

317
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:39,983
He's been p.v.s.
For 16 years.

318
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:41,241
Well,he's not p.v.s.

319
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,810
He's minimally conscious.

320
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,583
He's minimally conscious
and no one noticed?

321
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,531
He was in a regular nursing
home so they just.

322
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:48,682
missed it.

323
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:53,135
He's been frozen,
sleeping,for 16 years,

324
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:54,510
and they missed it.

325
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:57,652
That sucks.

326
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:00,954
There's one thing to be thankful for.

327
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:02,624
What?

328
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,280
We might be able to wake him up.

329
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:06,369
Alex, it's Izzie.

330
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:07,359
If you're not coming,

331
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,792
you could at least
have the decency

332
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,946
to call and tell me.

333
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:15,555
I'm in hell.

334
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:16,716
I'm the one in hell.

335
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,968
Burke's going all "iron chef"
in the kitchen.

336
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,747
Get your ass back
here and save me.

337
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,322
I'm in the woods with shotguns
and liquor and car talk.

338
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,481
It's like "deliverance" out here.

339
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:25,510
Come on.
Let's race.

340
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,044
At least you've got liquor.

341
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,291
Where does Meredith keep the booze?

342
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,214
I don't think she has any.

343
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:34,009
How is that possible?
She's a w.a.s.p.

344
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,467
Liquor's like oxygen to a w.a.s.p.

345
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:37,280
Which is why we're out of liquor.

346
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:38,634
Listen,can you come and get me?

347
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,072
Okay,how am I supposed

348
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:42,075
to get through the holidays
without liquor,George?

349
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,463
Just come and get me.

350
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:46,502
Hello? Cris

351
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,449
selfish!

352
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:51,699
Derek,it's me.

353
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:54,658
Where are you?

354
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,604
Which one do you think she is?

355
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,039
Holden's wife?

356
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,684
It's her.

357
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,449
How do you know?

358
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:17,199
Mrs. Mckee?

359
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:19,716
It's Mrs. Leonard now.

360
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,730
What do you mean,
wake him up?

361
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,300
Over the years,
your husband's brain

362
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,968
has been slowly trying heal itself.

363
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,984
Now we've given him a
course of amphetamine

364
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,000
that should give his
brain the push it needs

365
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,150
to find consciousness.

366
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,264
When?
How long does it take?

367
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:37,625
If we're right,

368
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,675
your father will be
awake in a few hours.

369
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,404
Is he gonna realize
what happened?

370
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,516
Most patients in this situation

371
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:45,886
have no idea how much
time has passed.

372
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:48,671
Oh,my god.
I'm gonna be sick.

373
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,670
I know this is a difficult situation.

374
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:52,797
I just got married.

375
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:54,880
We're having a baby in december.

376
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,140
Coby turned 17 on thursday.

377
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:58,442
Difficult?

378
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,192
This is unimaginable.

379
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:02,328
Mrs. Leonard,
perhaps you should.

380
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,922
I can't be here
when he wakes up.

381
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,473
He can't see me like this or Coby.

382
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,278
Coby,baby,we're leaving.

383
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,231
We'll be in the car.

384
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:10,636
Mrs. Leonard.

385
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,079
holden is going to wake up

386
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:14,139
and find out that
we didn't wait for him.

387
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,400
It took her a long time to move on.

388
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,358
What are you doing up here?

389
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:26,900
Get down to the pit.
We're backed up.

390
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,121
No can do,sir.

391
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,435
The nazi has me on this surgery.

392
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,372
We've got a line out
the door for sutures.

393
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,812
Everybody's an amateur chef

394
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:35,150
until they get a knife in their hands.

395
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,884
Knives can be tricky.

396
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,061
Your wife know you're working today?

397
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,088
I'm going home.

398
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:45,071
I just wanted to watch a little bit.

399
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,081
Don't stay here too long.

400
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,173
You could end up like him.

401
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,153
Wife stabbed him.

402
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:52,484
Said she didn't like the way

403
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,353
he was carving the turkey.

404
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,120
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Joe,thank god.

405
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,375
Hey,this is my boyfriend Walter.

406
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,138
Whatever.

407
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:05,176
Tell me you brought liquor.

408
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,953
I brought pie
Pumpkin.

409
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,032
You're a bartender.

410
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,518
Did you bring scalpels?

411
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,394
Come on.
Pick a car.

412
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,676
I don't want to pick a car.

413
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,382
He doesn't know jack about cars.

414
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,476
I know plenty.

415
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,626
I just don't want to pick one.

416
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:26,932
Georgie's just tired.

417
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,670
They working you too
hard at the hospital?

418
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,012
You know he works
48-hour shifts?

419
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:33,612
- 48 hours,and you enjoy it?
- Yeah,  I enjoy it.

420
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:34,753
Like,what do you do?

421
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,358
You know medical stuff.

422
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,076
Come on.

423
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,298
They're not gonna get it.

424
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:40,566
Make your brothers jealous.

425
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:43,314
Tell them what it's like
to be a big-time surgeon.

426
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,610
Okay,last night,
this was pretty cool,

427
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,129
I assisted on a
truncal vagotomy,

428
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,553
- and we inflated this,
- assisted?
-

429
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:55,255
- What do you mean?
- I helped the surgeon.

430
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:56,905
Anyway,we inflated this
guy's abdomen with a carbon

431
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,184
wait,I thought you
were the surgeon.

432
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:00,407
I'm a surgical intern.

433
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,671
The resident or the attending,

434
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,016
they perform the surgery.

435
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,201
Oh,so you don't actually
cut anybody open?

436
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,547
I mean,
by yourself.

437
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,748
No,like,the point of being an intern

438
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,015
is that you're learning.

439
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,060
We watch the surgeries

440
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:13,955
and the attending
asks us questions

441
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,469
and we have to answer them.

442
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,265
It's not easy.

443
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,044
I have to be on top of
my game 100% of the time.

444
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,812
It's incredibly difficult.

445
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,110
So you don't actually
do anything?

446
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,301
- Yes,I do.
- You just stand there.

447
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,218
- No, l and
- watch the real doctors work.

448
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:31,620
I am a real doctor.

449
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,168
- No,you're not.
- You said you just stand there.

450
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:34,173
You said you don't do anything.

451
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,467
No,I didn't no,
you said I didn't do anything.

452
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:37,997
Real doctors save lives,Georgie.

453
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,669
- I mean,if you're just standing there
-  for god

454
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,025
what?

455
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,103
I want to go home.

456
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,947
Just as soon as you
shoot your turkey.

457
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:57,992
What are you doing here?

458
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,744
Waiting for my patient to wake up.

459
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,855
Why aren't you at
The Thanksgiving?

460
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,834
Why aren't you at Thanksgiving?

461
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,342
What?

462
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,429
I tell you something,
you tell me something.

463
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,611
okay.

464
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:31,647
I feel like one of those people

465
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,286
who's so freaking miserable

466
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,471
they can't be around normal people

467
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,577
like I'll infect the happy people

468
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,595
like I'm some miserable,diseased,

469
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,185
dirty ex-mistress.

470
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:47,846
Your turn.

471
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,063
I failed the medical boards.

472
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,113
If I tell Izzie,
she'll be nice about it,

473
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,640
all supportive and optimistic.

474
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,274
She might as well rip my nads off

475
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:01,713
and turn 'em into earrings.

476
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:04,603
Alex,you should go to Thanksgiving.

477
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,177
I mean,don't tell her
if you don't want to.

478
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,680
But you should go.

479
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:11,692
Otherwise,you're just

480
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,433
me.

481
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,648
A miserable,diseased,
dirty ex-mistress.

482
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,395
That's hot.
That's really hot.

483
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:23,599
I feel better already.

484
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:24,788
See?

485
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,850
Oh. Happy Thanksgiving.

486
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:40,724
hello?

487
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:42,850
Is somebody there?

488
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:48,990
Somebody

489
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,061
yes.

490
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:52,994
Somebody's here.

491
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,632
have suffered deterioration

492
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,259
and your joints will be
painful for awhile,

493
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,464
which is to be expected.

494
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,229
Now the fact that your
communication skills

495
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:05,373
are still intact is remarkable.

496
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,270
Did you reach my wife yet?

497
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,387
Is she coming?

498
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:14,490
I mean have you told her

499
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:18,949
or do you wait until she gets here?

500
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:20,615
Because this is gonna

501
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:22,930
quite a shock.

502
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,573
How long have I been out?

503
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,334
What a year?

504
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:30,974
Would you excuse us?

505
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,447
No,you tell me,please.

506
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:36,630
You found me.

507
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,387
You tell me.

508
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:41,432
I'm only an intern.

509
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,195
I've never really done this before.

510
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:44,432
Me either.

511
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,540
You'll do it quickly.

512
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,820
Rip off the bandage.

513
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:55,525
No anesthesia.

514
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:57,653
Exactly.

515
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,984
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

516
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:14,822
Truth time.

517
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:18,765
Truth time.

518
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:28,963
You have to cut the celery
into finer pieces,Stevens.

519
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,648
like that?

520
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:34,464
It'll do. Put them in
with the onions.

521
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,337
Now what should you
be concerned about?

522
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,513
the turkey,Stevens.

523
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:43,668
I'd expect you to know that.

524
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,119
Right.
I need to check the turkey

525
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,898
to make sure it's cooking at
the correct temperature.

526
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,477
Yeah,and how do we do that?

527
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:50,852
Meat thermometer.

528
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,387
10 bucks says she
dries out the turkey.

529
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:54,683
20 says she pulls it off.

530
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,104
75 says I don't care.

531
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,157
Ooh,okay,Stevens.

532
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,293
Let's see what you can do.

533
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:03,622
More pressure.

534
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,260
Turkey has a tough shell.
Dig in.

535
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:07,152
I'm in.

536
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,227
Damn,she got it in.

537
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,463
Told you she's gonna pull it off.

538
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,152
Not bad.

539
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:11,246
Now all you have to do now

540
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:13,102
is stick the thermometer
deep enough in the bird

541
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,588
to get a temp,
but be careful not to

542
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:17,010
You hit the bone.

543
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,648
The pan is filling with juice
and you're losing moisture.

544
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,398
What do you do?

545
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:22,145
think.

546
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,429
That's it.
I'm out of here.

547
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:27,582
What's the problem?

548
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:29,353
You're operating on a turkey.

549
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:30,821
And

550
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,036
and you're making friends
with my friends.

551
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:36,066
You told me to be nice.

552
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,310
You know,be nice.

553
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,301
You know,I'm just
gonna go to the store

554
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:42,321
and get some liquor.

555
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:43,443
Give me the keys, please.

556
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,932
I'll
I'll be back.

557
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:53,123
Dr. Burke!

558
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,498
Suction.
Use the baster and suction.

559
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:57,885
The gt 500 was a shelby.

560
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,594
He also made the viper.
You know that?

561
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:02,093
Yes,we do know.

562
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:03,838
the shelby 500 is a good car.

563
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,123
And the other car he made

564
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:08,202
Turkey.

565
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:14,070
Jerry.

566
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,881
we came out here so
I could shoot a turkey.

567
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:19,640
Dad said we're not leaving
until I shoot a turkey.

568
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,164
I am shooting this turkey.

569
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,224
when you're sure you've got it,

570
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:28,870
squeeze.

571
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:30,369
no fair.
I called turkey.

572
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,766
don't worry about it.
He's not gonna do it.

573
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:33,493
He's gonna chicken out
and then you can

574
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,290
yahoo!

575
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,995
He got it.
I got it?

576
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,416
Yo got it,Georgie!

577
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:40,758
Let's go home!

578
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:42,727
What's he like?

579
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:44,916
M-my son.

580
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:48,258
You know,I didn't really get
a chance to speak with him.

581
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:50,604
But he seemed nice.

582
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:53,324
He's,uh,tall,like you.

583
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,088
And he's got your eyes.

584
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,476
That

585
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,826
that's good.

586
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:04,955
Holden,we're ready to begin.

587
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:07,347
What does the m.r.i. Do?

588
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:10,098
Just gives us a better
picture of your brain,really.

589
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,068
You're one for the books,
you know?

590
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:13,470
That's nice.

591
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,966
How's he doing?

592
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,877
As well as we could expect.

593
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:34,982
Damn it.

594
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:37,612
An epidural hematoma.

595
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,486
When you fell out of
bed this morning,

596
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:41,297
you hit your temple,hard.

597
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,971
The c.t. Didn't catch it
but the m.r.i. Did.

598
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,688
And you can fix it?

599
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,268
It won't be easy.

600
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,515
Sometimes,it's impossible
to find the vessel

601
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,190
and complications can arise,

602
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,802
but,yes
I can operate.

603
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:57,003
So there is a risk?

604
00:23:57,897 --> 00:23:59,071
A very large risk,yes.

605
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,110
And what happens
if you don't operate?

606
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,738
The best-case scenario is that
the bleeding resolves itself.

607
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:06,332
Or it could continue to bleed

608
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:08,595
and cause the brain to swell.

609
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,161
Which means what?

610
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:12,006
Most likely,

611
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,410
without the operation,you'll die.

612
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,147
But the operation could kill me,too,right?

613
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,661
They're equal risks both ways.

614
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:25,739
What do I do?

615
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,911
What would you do?

616
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,383
I can't answer this for you.

617
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,387
Can I have that spatula,please?

618
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:45,821
Thank you.

619
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:51,319
You want that butter
to melt,not to boil.

620
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:56,118
Dr. Burke,how did you
learn to cook like this?

621
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,620
My mother owns a
restaurant in Alabama.

622
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:00,725
Seriously?

623
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:01,592
Seriously.

624
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:04,134
Does Cristina know that?

625
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:06,916
No. Actually,
she doesn't.

626
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,170
She doesn't ask a lot of
personal questions.

627
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,275
She's kind of hard to get to know.

628
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,413
Yes,she is.

629
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,173
Karev didn't show.

630
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:21,828
No,he didn't.

631
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:24,870
Is that okay?

632
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:27,889
No,it's not.

633
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:30,974
Do you know that there's
absolutely no liquor

634
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,014
in this house?

635
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:33,870
Cristina went to get some.

636
00:25:34,353 --> 00:25:36,181
Over an hour ago.
Where is she?

637
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:37,840
Levi Johnson.

638
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,699
Swallowed a wishbone?

639
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,668
yes.

640
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:43,243
Excellent.
We'll have to take some films.

641
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:45,547
Maybe you ruptured
your esophagus,huh?

642
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:46,978
That means surgery.

643
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,774
Car's loaded.
Guys,coolers,come on.

644
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:52,292
Get up,get up,get up.

645
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:55,983
Dad,come on.

646
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,166
Hold on,Georgie.

647
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:00,386
We gotta blood you.

648
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,515
no.

649
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:04,761
Now there you go.

650
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,748
Now you're officially

651
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,159
an O'malley man.

652
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,299
O'malley!

653
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:11,816
Thank you.

654
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:14,069
I left my hat.
I'll be right back.

655
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,100
O'malley!

656
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,989
Guys,get
just get in the car.

657
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,608
O'malley! O'malley!

658
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,852
21-gun salute for Georgie.

659
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:22,631
Okay,that's not the best idea,guys.

660
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:23,916
I'm serious.

661
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,058
You shot dad in the ass!

662
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,168
Are you happy now?!

663
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:39,903
guys,this is the trauma room.

664
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:40,875
What are you doing?

665
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:42,735
Put it down.

666
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:47,933
Dad,I'm gonna inject
you with something

667
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:48,939
to numb the area.

668
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,560
I'm fine.
I don't need anything.

669
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:51,793
It doesn't even hurt that bad.

670
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,386
Dad,you have bird shot
embedded in your gluteus maximus.

671
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,401
When I start removing it,
believe me,

672
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:01,041
it's gonna hurt veryad.
Hey,'65 gto.

673
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:04,787
That's a v-8 tweaker.
You don't want that.

674
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,813
What you want is the bel air.

675
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,560
But it's gotta be
the 2-tone,right? Nice.

676
00:27:10,222 --> 00:27:11,155
Ah,pick a car,
Georgie.

677
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:12,027
No,thanks.

678
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:13,543
Come on,Georgie.
Pick a car.

679
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,971
I told you he doesn't
know jack about cars.

680
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,393
He doesn't know jack about jack.

681
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,872
Jerry

682
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,544
first you say the gto,

683
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,936
ronny counters with the bel air,

684
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,880
which never fails to make
dad say the gt 500.

685
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,658
The cobra,
the chieftain,

686
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:28,107
then someone names a german car,

687
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:29,113
which invariably starts

688
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:31,311
the american versus foreign debate

689
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,389
that usually ends when one of
you brings up the deville,

690
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:34,612
and that always,always

691
00:27:35,092 --> 00:27:37,610
leads to the unbelievably
long discussion on the merits

692
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:39,329
of the '57 thunderbird.

693
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:40,811
So how about I just jump to the end

694
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:42,201
and name the thunderbird now

695
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:43,477
so that once in our lives,

696
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,218
we can stop picking cars?!

697
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:47,577
And my name is George!

698
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,389
What do you know?
The kid came back.

699
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,112
No,he didn't.

700
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,439
He says we have
the same eyes.

701
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:07,864
Yeah.

702
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:10,546
I don't see it.

703
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,522
He said that he couldn't stay

704
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,140
because of the holiday.

705
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:29,576
But he

706
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:32,553
he said he'll come back
sometime soon.

707
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:33,783
Good.

708
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:38,771
He said she's happy.

709
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,774
that this guy Hal

710
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:45,344
is,really good for her.

711
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,160
She loves him.

712
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:56,222
So I've decided to,
go ahead with the surgery.

713
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,531
You know,
they've moved on.

714
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:01,493
I should,too.

715
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,916
You know,get this thing
out of my head

716
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:10,213
and get on with my life.

717
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,082
Right.

718
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,424
I'll,tell Dr. Shepherd.

719
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:23,948
Dr. Grey.

720
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:30,919
Do you think he really
will come back?

721
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:34,970
I hope so.

722
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,807
Joe and Walter have
got the table set up

723
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:41,352
in the living room.
How's our bird?

724
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:42,761
He needs a few more hours.

725
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:49,101
Why did you plan this big dinner

726
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,477
if you knew you couldn't cook?

727
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,766
I just like Thanksgiving,
Dr. Burke.

728
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:55,013
Preston.

729
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,170
Preston.

730
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,149
You just like Thanksgiving?

731
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,432
We work 18 hours a day,
6 days a week,

732
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:06,965
50 weeks a year.

733
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,973
We don't really have any
time for our families.

734
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:13,855
We don't have friends
that aren't doctors.

735
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,332
But we have this one day,

736
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,814
one day where we get
to be like everybody else.

737
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,501
One day to be normal.

738
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:24,547
A day where.

739
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,059
nobody lives and nobody
dies on our watch.

740
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:32,072
It's like a gift.

741
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,890
So I just thought
we should appreciate it.

742
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,186
That's all.

743
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:38,468
I gotta set the table.

744
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,175
a day without surgery.

745
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,676
Who swallows a
wishbone whole?

746
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,229
Dr. Bailey,why are you
working on Thanksgiving?

747
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,209
You work the extra shifts
and get the extra practice.

748
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,862
And I'm trying to get
in all the practice I can.

749
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,882
before the baby comes

750
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,910
and I have to take time off.

751
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:19,036
My husband isn't thrilled
I'm working Thanksgiving,

752
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,650
but he isn't a surgeon.

753
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:22,851
So he doesn't get it.

754
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:30,413
You and Dr. Burke?

755
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:32,504
Yes.

756
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:39,958
he would've made a good father.

757
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:02,788
You coming?

758
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,663
Not enough interns.
I gotta cover the floor.

759
00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:10,975
what would you have
done if you were him?

760
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,698
Would you have the surgery?

761
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:15,390
You would have the surgery.

762
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:17,255
I would want the future.

763
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,523
Or to be asleep again.

764
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:21,099
One or the other.

765
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:22,959
Nothing in between.

766
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:26,005
I honestly don't know
what I would want.

767
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:29,204
I know you don't.

768
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:35,332
If you get a chance,
you can scrub in later.

769
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,247
I'll probably be at this awhile.

770
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:46,740
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

771
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:47,655
No.

772
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,050
Where are Ronny and Jerry?

773
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:51,685
The nurse told them that
the cafeteria was open.

774
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:02,983
You didn't have fun today.

775
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:04,407
It's not that.

776
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:08,066
No.

777
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:10,894
No,I didn't have fun.

778
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,241
You hurt your brothers' feelings.

779
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,005
Dad you did.

780
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:19,250
They talk to me like I'm stupid.

781
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,031
They call me "Georgie."

782
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:25,322
They've never treated
me like I'm one of them.

783
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:28,255
George,Jerry is dry cleaner.

784
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,006
Ronny works in the post office.

785
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:32,375
I drive a truck.

786
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:34,600
You're a surgeon.
You're not one of us.

787
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:36,725
I know it and they know it.

788
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,865
And you make sure know it.

789
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:42,096
Dad.

790
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:43,533
I'm not.
I'm not blaming you.

791
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,271
It makes me proud you're so smart,

792
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,344
like I did something right.

793
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:52,928
It's just.

794
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,035
we try.

795
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,392
We try to include you,

796
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:02,346
but you don't like the
stuff that we like.

797
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:04,931
And we don't know how
to talk about the stuff

798
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:06,394
you wanna talk about.

799
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:07,651
You're not one of us.

800
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:10,504
But,damn it,we don't treat
you like you're stupid.

801
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:12,932
You treat us like we're stupid.

802
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,031
And maybe we are,

803
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,209
but we're your family.

804
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,996
Give us an inch,Georgie.

805
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:27,361
Every once in awhile pick a car.

806
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,001
I saved a guy's life on
an elevator last month.

807
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,335
I performed open-heart
surgery on him right there.

808
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:46,671
By yourself?

809
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,036
By myself.

810
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:52,535
Just like a real doctor.

811
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,361
Whew.

812
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:57,908
Now that's something.

813
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:02,203
Oh,I mean,that's really something.

814
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:50,751
I'll take care of it.

815
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,898
What are you doing here?

816
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,313
Oh,this is beyond bad.

817
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,354
sorry,Izzie,it's after 8.
I gotta get to the bar.

818
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:19,395
On Thanksgiving?

819
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:20,880
It's one of our busiest
days of the year.

820
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:23,273
People need a safe haven
from the bitterness,loneliness,

821
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,550
quality family time.

822
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,338
I'm their port in the storm.
See you later?

823
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,100
Good night,doc.

824
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,856
Night,Joe.
Bye,walter.

825
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,730
Thanks for coming.

826
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:38,410
You can leave,too,
if you want.

827
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,103
I'not leaving the table
until the hostess does.

828
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:42,630
They're not coming.

829
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:43,800
Even so.

830
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,192
Today,I committed bird murder

831
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,054
and I was forced to
touch my dad's ass.

832
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:01,008
I get extra points for
showing up at all.

833
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:05,136
I brought booze.

834
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:18,335
Let's just eat.

835
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:33,152
You know today in
the waiting room,

836
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,850
how did you know Cheryl
was Holden's wife?

837
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,461
Waiting rooms are full of people

838
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,089
hoping for good news.

839
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,296
She was the on one who looked like

840
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,186
she had completely given up.

841
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:52,358
Do you love her?

842
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,272
I don't know.

843
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,051
It's good that you're trying.

844
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,178
You wouldn't be you

845
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:19,266
if you weren't
the kind of person

846
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,741
who was trying
to make it work.

847
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:23,454
You think so?

848
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,626
It means I wasn't wrong about you.

849
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,056
Thanks.

850
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:43,692
good-bye,Derek.

851
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:47,960
Good-bye,Meredith.

852
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,725
maybe we're not
supposed to be happy.

853
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,118
Maybe gratitude

854
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:02,003
has nothing to do with joy.

855
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,790
You going inside?

856
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,953
No. You go ahead.

857
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:11,800
You sure?

858
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:14,908
Go make her happy.

859
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,175
Maybe being grateful means
recognizing what you have

860
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,235
for what it is.

861
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,175
you're a surgical junkie.
Go home!

862
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,202
Adele's already mad.

863
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:32,901
I'm in trouble no matter what.

864
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:36,480
An there's a whipple
happening in o.r. 2.

865
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,344
Go home right now.

866
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:43,428
This kind of treatment is
why they call you the nazi.

867
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:46,531
Appreciating small victories.

868
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,018
Happy Thanksgiving.

869
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,346
I was nice.

870
00:39:58,156 --> 00:39:59,330
I noticed.

871
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,674
You don't ask a lot of
personal questions.

872
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:05,737
And you're very
hard to get to know.

873
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:09,413
yes.

874
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:14,929
My mother owns a
restaurant in Alabama.

875
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:20,649
I scrubbed in on a foreign
body removal this afternoon.

876
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,258
A guy swallowed
a wishbone whole.

877
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,767
admiring the struggle it takes

878
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:31,274
simply to be human.

879
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:44,869
you didn't show.

880
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:47,971
I waited.

881
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,386
Derek,are you done?

882
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,753
Hurting me back,
I mean.

883
00:40:59,614 --> 00:41:01,532
Cause I need to know
 because if not,I

884
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,615
I got to special order a thicker skin

885
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:07,426
or something.

886
00:41:12,942 --> 00:41:14,718
And maybe
we're thankful for the familiar

887
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:15,981
things we know.

888
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:22,444
no anesthesia guy

889
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,563
here we go

890
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,139
and maybe 
we're thankful for the 

891
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:30,559
 thing we'll never know

892
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,652
is this seat taken?

893
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,855
Do you work at the hospital?

894
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:43,875
No.

895
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:47,381
You're not a brain surgeon
or a doctor of any kind?

896
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:48,796
No.

897
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,904
Then this seat isn't taken.

898
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:58,625
at the end of the day,

899
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:00,625
the fact that we have the courage

900
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,620
to still be standing.

901
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:04,391
do you want to buy me a drink?

902
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,669
Actually,I do.

903
00:42:08,824 --> 00:42:10,903
Is reason enough to celebrate.

904
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,634
Manu2005
