Previously, on Grey's Anatomy

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,400
You and Burke, are you OK ?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,900
We're existing in total silence.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,100
That hand is worth two millions dollars.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,400
I want it fixed.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,500
Mark and I--it wasn't
a one-night stand.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,600
I was in love with him.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,700
At least, I thought it was.

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,600
your sister molly's
just been admitted
for an emergency c-section.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,700
Molly's not my sister.

11
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,100
She is. You have the same father.

12
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,400
Why didn't you stay
and fight for us ?

13
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,800
I did. I-I tried.

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
Why didn't you try harder ?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,100
You are officially
off my service.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,500
But for what it's worth,
I think you're gonna miss me.

17
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,700
(Cristina)
Harold O'Malley, 63,

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,100
diagnosed with esophageal cancer
and severe aortic regurge.

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,800
You think I want to die
and leave my boy in charge ?
You are not gonna die.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,900
Good morning.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,500
Are you watching me sleep ?

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,300
Maybe.

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Are you
some kind of weirdo

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
who watches women sleep ?

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,900
Maybe.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Izzie.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
What ?

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
I just dropped $8.7 million
on the floor.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
And ?

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,400
I shouldn't be able to drop
$8.7 million on the floor.

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
You need to deposit
that check.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,700
George. . .

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
Your father's surgery
is tomorrow.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,300
Any chance you're misplacing
your anxiety

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,400
on me and my check ?

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
No, there is no chance.

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
That check ruins my morning
every morning.

40
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,100
It belongs in the bank.

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,900
Would you just please--
as a favor to me--

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Would you just. . .
put it in the bank ?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Please.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,900
Mm. No.

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,600
But. . . If you're nice to me
for the next seven minutes,

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,100
I <I>will
give you a ride to work.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't deserve
$8.7 million !

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,500
Mm. So true.
So true.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
What's Burke doing ?
I don't know.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
She doesn't know.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
He just had surgery
yesterday,

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
and you don't know
how he's doing ?

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,700
They're not speaking.

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,000
I thought they made up.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They did, sort of.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
But she's still
not speaking to him ?

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
<I>He's not speaking to me.

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
They're not speaking
to each other.
Okay.

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,700
Did you ask Derek
about Burke's hand ?

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,700
I don't want to get
in the middle of it.

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Derek and I are happy.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Could we just keep it
that way for while ?

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,100
You know, u could always
swallow your pride

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,200
and just ask him yourself.

65
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Her gut's not big enough
for that.

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, Alex,
you hurt me.

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,100
Oh, georgie.

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
(harold) Quiet down !

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,600
Everyone, quiet down !

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,500
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.

71
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,700
Uh, who's presenting ?

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,300
Oh, can Georgie do it ?
He's real good.

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,400
Come on, Georgie. Yeah !

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Come on.
Come on.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Um. . . Harold O'Malley, 63,

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,300
status--
post-aortic valve replacement.

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,100
Morning chest x-ray showed
no atelectasis

78
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,500
after aggressive C.P.T.
for the last two days.

79
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,200
Um, scheduled for
a transhiatal esophagectomy

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
That's it.

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,700
Um, for the next few minutes,
I think it would be best

83
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,500
if the extended family could
wait out in the waiting area.

84
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,400
Just a few minutes, guys,

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
and then you can come back.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
How are you feeling,
Mr. O'Malley ?

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
He's feeling great.

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
"better than ever, "
he said.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Which is why we had everybody
come out today,

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,100
because we figured
after today,

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,900
he maybe won't be feeling
so great for a while.

92
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,500
Uh, after the surgery,

93
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,900
uh, then when do we start
chemo and stuff ?

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,700
That protocol depends on
what we find

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,100
when we open you up, Harold.

96
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,500
What do you mean,
what you find ?

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,500
Uh, Grey.

98
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,100
There's only so much

99
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,200
they can tell
from labs and scans,

100
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
so they really need to get
a good look inside

101
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,700
to see if the cancer
has spread.

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,500
If it's spread, that changes
how much chemo he needs ?

103
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,300
That changes a lot
of things.
Like what ?

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll let the oncologist
explain that to you
later today, Harold.

105
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
And Dr. Grey will be
taking you through

106
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,100
a final battery of
preoperative tests before we go.

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,900
So, um--

108
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,600
so it would be best
if the party went home.

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Mm.

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Dr. Shepherd.

111
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,700
Uh, Dr. Burke's hand--
has he had any tremors ?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's confidential.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Uh, but I'm--I'm
one of his doctors.

114
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,600
You're also his girlfriend.
Ask him yourself.

115
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,900
Good morning, everyone.
Who's presenting ? Good morning.

116
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Preston Burke, post-op day one

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
from I and d
of a compressive hematoma
to the brachial exus.

118
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,400
He is afebrile, and vital signs
were stable overnight.

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Incisions are clean
with no signs of infection.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Last morphine was given
at 2:00 this morning.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Ask about the hand.

122
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,200
You ask.
No, it's just one question.
(whispers) Be a friend.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Dr. Yang. . .

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Something you want to share
with the rest of us ?

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
No, ma'am. Sorry.

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,100
Look good, Preston.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Take it easy on the nurses.

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,900
I'll do my best.
O'malley.

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
Your father's surgery
is today ?

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Tomorrow.

131
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
(woman) You okay, honey ?

132
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Yeah.

133
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Can you just help me. . .
Mm-hmm.

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,300
Scoliosis ?

135
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Looks like
a birth defect.

136
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Looks like hell.

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,900
What are you all staring at ?

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Really, if you're expecting me
to be the brave and heartwarming
differently-disabled girl,

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
that isn't gonna happen,
so go ahead and do your thing.

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,900
(Miranda) Okay. Stevens.

142
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Heather douglas, 17,

143
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
past medical history
of vater syndrome.

144
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,300
Which is ?

145
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Vater syndrome
is a genetic condition

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
that affects the vertebrae,
anus, trachea,

147
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,100
esophagus
and renal system.

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
Wow. Give this girl a medal.

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,900
She memorized the whole acronym.

150
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Which I assure you
is a hell of a lot easier

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
than living with it.

152
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Stevens.

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,700
Right. Um, heather is--

154
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,900
is in today for a lithotripsy
to remove kidney stones

155
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,800
and a thoracoplasty

156
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
to alleviate pressure
on her lungs.
Can I ask--

157
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,600
I-I know I'm just supposed to
be here to remove a few ribs,

158
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,000
but I'm wondering if you've ever
tried anything more radical

159
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
to treat the spinal curvature ?

160
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,400
Let's se
if by "more radical, "

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,200
you mean having a steel rod
inserted into my spine,

162
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,200
then, yeah, we've tried.

163
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
The rod just bent.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Removing the kidney stones
may seem minor,

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
but it will really improve
your quality of life.

166
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,700
Really ? So this surgery
is gonna get me laid ?

167
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,500
Heather, stop it.
Mom, I'm sorry,

168
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
but she's talking about
improving my quality of life,

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
and I don't think doctors
should make promises

170
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,000
they can't keep.

171
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
Laura Grey-thompson,

172
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,800
born four days ago
with jejunal atresia.

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Corrected surgically.

174
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,000
Uh, post-op course--

175
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
oh, I'm--I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting ?

176
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,500
Her mom and grandma
ha-have the flu,

177
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,300
and they asked me
to get an update.

178
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh, she's doing
very well, mr. Grey.

179
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
We'll be out of here
in just a minute.

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
Dr. Grey,
you were saying ?

181
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,100
Um. . .

182
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,300
Excuse me, uh. . .

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll just come back
a little later.

184
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,400
Grey ?

185
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Um. . .

186
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,500
Uh, laura Grey-thompson, um,

187
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,700
had some dilation of the bowels
on x-ray this morning.

188
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,200
We need to do a barium enema

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,000
to make sure there's
no intestinal stricture.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,900
Grey's Anatomy S03E11

191
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Dr. Grey, I'd like you to stick
with Mr. O'Malley this week.

192
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,600
Yang, pit. Karev, Sloan.

193
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Stevens, prep heather douglas
for surgery.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,300
O'malley.
Yes.

195
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
You're taking the rest
of this week off ?
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
May as well take today, too,

197
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
spend some time
with your family.
Thank you.

198
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Uh, dr. Bailey, as things
progress with my dad uh. . .

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
You know, sometimes we--
with families--

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,500
we coddle them,
sugarcoat things.

201
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,700
It would help me
if you were straight with me
as things progress.

202
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Okay.

203
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,600
Thank you.

204
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Uh, dr. Bailey.
D-Dr. Bailey.

205
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
I know that I'm supposed
to prep her only,

206
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,000
but any chance I can
scrub in on Heather Douglas ?

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, a vater patient isn't
something you see very often.

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
No.

209
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,400
But I'm ready.
I am ready.

210
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,900
Your psychiatrist has not
given you an all clear.

211
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,500
He's. . . I have done everything
he has asked me to do,

212
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,300
everything,

213
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,300
except deposit
my inheritance check, which--

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,200
wait, you have not deposited
a nearly $9-million check yet ?

215
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
It--it's. . .
Being unreasonable.

216
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,200
That check has nothing to do
with any--

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,400
what's unreasonable
is that you're losing

218
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
thousands of dollars day
in interest.

219
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
That's unreasonable.

220
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,300
You clearly
are not reasonable yet,

221
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,200
which, I think,

222
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
is the point your psychiatrist
is trying to make.

223
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,800
Hey, I need c. B. C.
And a chem-7 on harold O'Malley.

224
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I need these labs asap.

225
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,300
Everybody needs everything
"asap. "

226
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh, yes.

227
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,900
And all throughout
this hospital,

228
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,600
people are dying while you
give me crap about "asap. "

229
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,500
Hey, are you okay ?

230
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Why wouldn't I be ?

231
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
Your father ?
Freezing up on rounds--

232
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,200
oh, god.
That was mortifying.

233
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,800
Thank you. Thanks.

234
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Oh, okay.
It wasn't mortifying ?

235
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,100
I just wish the baby
would get well and go home

236
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
and Thatcher
would go with her.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Is that wrong ?

238
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, wrong would be, uh,

239
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
if you wished
the baby wouldn't get well.

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
Okay, good. Thanks.

241
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
You know, if you want
to thank me,

242
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,200
um, you could ask Derek
if Burke has had any tremors.

243
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,500
Talk to him.
No.

244
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
'Cause then he wins.

245
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
Wins what ?

246
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,700
Forget it.

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Do you have a father ?

248
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,200
I have a stepfather.

249
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
He's nice.
I see him for yom kippur.

250
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,500
Karev, what did I tell you
about how I like my charts ?

251
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
I like to round on pre-op
before post-op.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Do you like wasting my time ?
Is it fun for you ?

253
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
No, sir.
Then get it right.

254
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,400
You <I>like abusing the interns ?

255
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
Is it <I>fun for you ?

256
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,500
Yes, it is,
and in case you've forgotten,

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
you don't get the high horse
this week, Addison.

258
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Not this week.

259
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
He's an ass.

260
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,000
Not this week.

261
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
You know Shepherd
pretty well, yeah ?

262
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
Lots of hair,
too many women,

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
likes elevators
and long walks on the beach.

264
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,700
So, um, what's the best way
to get him to do something ?

265
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
What kind of something ?

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
A consult that
the patient hasn't requested

267
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
but that the friendly
neighborhood ortho resident

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
thinks is worth pursuing.

269
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,800
Shepherd thinks he's busier

270
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
and maybe a little bit more
important than everyone else.

271
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Standard neurosurgeon
breed.
Exactly.

272
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Okay, so ?

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
So he'll say no
until you stare him down.

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,300
"Stare him down" ?

275
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
<I>Stare him down. 

276
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
You're way too hot
to be a doctor.

277
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay.

278
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,700
I mean, aren't people
who look like you
supposed to be dumb ?

279
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm just saying, you're not
gonna be in my surgery, are you ?

280
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,000
'Cause I'm a little
too young to die.

281
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,500
I will not be in
on your surgery.

282
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,400
See ? I knew it.
You're not even a doctor.

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,500
I am a doctor.

284
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,900
It's just that when my,
uh, fiancee dropped dead

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
not too long ago,
I went a little nuts,

286
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
and, uh, no surgeries
for me for a while.

287
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
Well, so much for my theory

288
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,500
that life doesn't suck
for pretty people.

289
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm sorry
I was such a bitch to you.

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Well. . . You're in pain.

291
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
Sometimes I'm a bitch
for no good reason at all.

292
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,900
Oh, um. . .
Dr. Shepherd.
Yes.

293
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
I am so sorry
to bother you.

294
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,300
I know you're very, very busy,
but there's a girl here.

295
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
She'17 years old with severe
scoliosis from vater syndrome.

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
She's here for thoracoplasty
because her ribs are pressing

297
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
against her lungs, and she's
already had two spinal fusions

298
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,800
and a segmental
spinal instrumentation

299
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,100
that didn't work.

300
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,300
She's bent over at 9degrees,
which clearly sucks.

301
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,000
"Clearly sucks, " is that
your professional assessment ?

302
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
My professional assessment
is that we can help her.

303
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,900
My day is impossible.

304
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,100
I'll come by for a consult
in the morning.

305
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm a good starer.

306
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Doctors,
could I get a word ?

307
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,900
Oh, how are you feeling,
harold ?

308
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,700
Feelin' great.
Feelin' fine.

309
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
It's just that
the oncologist. . .

310
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,900
He said that, uh,

311
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,300
if the cancer
is in other organs,

312
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,900
he said that maybe you wouldn't
proceed with the surgery.

313
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,300
That's right, harold.

314
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,600
If the cancer's spread
to your other organs,

315
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,500
it would compromise your ability
to recover from the surgery.

316
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
So if you close me up
and then send me home,

317
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,600
I get, what,
a couple of weeks to live ?

318
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,400
You'd have. . .
Weeks or months, yes.

319
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,000
No. No, you gotta take
the tumor out,

320
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
'cause I can survive this.

321
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I know I can.

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
O'malleys, we're fighters.

323
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Mr. O'malley,

324
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,300
it--it's just not
a good idea to--
you know, my wife. . .

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,300
We've been married
40 years.

326
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,600
I make her crazy,
but. . . 40 years.

327
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,500
She needs me.
My family needs me.

328
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,200
I can't let you close me up
and then tell them

329
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,300
that there's nothing
that can be done
when I know I can fight it.

330
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
So I. . . I'm asking
for your word.

331
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,600
I want you to take
the tumor out.

332
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Mr O'Malley

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,900
My job is to do the best I can
for you medically.

334
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,700
After--

335
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,600
well, closing me up
and sending me home to die

336
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,900
isn't best for me,

337
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
not medically
or any other way.

338
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,000
Please. . .

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
Take the tumor out.

340
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,500
All right.

341
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,300
All right ?

342
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Thanks.

343
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
This falls under
confidentiality ?

344
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,700
If you ask if you can tell this to his son, the response is no.

345
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
You're watching me
sleep again ?

346
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,400
You're cute when you sleep.
What can I say ?

347
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, but don't you sleep ?

348
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,400
Why are you always up
before the alarm ?

349
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
(yawns) I'm a light sleeper.

350
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,100
It's no big deal

351
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,800
so something woke you up.

352
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,700
It's no big deal.

353
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,100
It's just that. . .

354
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
You snore a little.

355
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
What ? I do not.

356
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,800
Yes, you do.
I-I love it.

357
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,600
I find it charming
that such a big noise

358
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
can come from
such a little person.

359
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,800
Do you know
what's not charming ?
What ?

360
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Your morning breath.

361
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm sorry. What ?

362
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,900
I'm just saying,

363
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,800
seeing how you're always up
before me,

364
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,999
you might consider
brushing your teeth.

365
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
I don't--

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,300
okay, this is me
brushing my teeth.

367
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,600
Thank you.

368
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,300
Surgery's today ?

369
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
Yeah. I'm okay.

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
Yeah. I-I have
a really good feeling.

371
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Yeah ?
Yeah.

372
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,500
I didn't even bake anything
for you.

373
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,500
Thank you.

374
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,900
Aha. Bone dry Cappuccino.

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
At least something's dry
around here.

376
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,900
Does it ever stop raining
in this hellhole ?
Not really.

377
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,500
Great. Good to know.

378
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,500
What the hell is this, Karev,
vanilla ?

379
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
Are you trying to poison me

380
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,800
or are you just trying to make my day a little worse
Mark.

381
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
Coffee cart must have
screwed up.
You know,

382
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
if you can't handle coffee, you can't handle plastics.

383
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
Maybe you oughta head back
to the gynie squad

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,700
where life was all squishy
and pink.

385
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Squishy and pink
though it may be,

386
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,800
I have an amazing surgery
today, Karev, if you want in.

387
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Yeah.

388
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,500
(olivia) Good morning,
dr. Burke.

389
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,600
Yes, it is.

390
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Beautiful morning.

391
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
I love watching the rain.

392
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,700
Feeling good ?
Not too much pain ?

393
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Feeling great.

394
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,300
And. . . Your hand--
your right hand--

395
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,400
feelin' good today ?

396
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm sorry, olivia,
you're just--

397
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,700
you're gonna have to tell
dr. Yang

398
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,300
that I'm not ready
to give her that information.

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Right.

400
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
Okay, then. Sorry.

401
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
(whispers) George,
ask him--

402
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,300
uh-huh. Uh-huh.

403
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Ask him--

404
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,500
you know Cristina's
stalking your room ?
I do.

405
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,800
Your father ?

406
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah. Um. . . The surgery
my dad's having. . .

407
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,300
Has a 50% morbidity rate.

408
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Oh, O'Malley. . .

409
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,900
That statistic,
it means 50% of the people

410
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
who undergo the surgery
survive.

411
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,700
If you're gonna hang
your hat on statistics,

412
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,600
then you have to look at them
from both sides.

413
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
(Derek) Heather, I've looked
at your case history,

414
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
and I know you've been through
a lot of very painful

415
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,500
and very unsuccessful
surgeries,

416
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
but if you're up for it, I think
I could significantly help

417
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,300
with the spinal curvature.

418
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,500
By "help, "
you mean what, exactly ?

419
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
I mean, I think I can get you
standing up straight.

420
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Are you messing with me ?

421
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
'Cause it's not nice
to mock crippled kids.

422
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
You see this--
this curved part here ?

423
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,400
I'd remove it.

424
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,900
You--you want to remove

425
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,500
a portion
of my daughter's spine ?

426
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Mm-hmm. And I would replace it
with a titanium mesh cage

427
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,000
that would fill in the space
between the vertebra.

428
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,700
I've seen case studies. There
have been quite a few successes.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
And--and the ones that aren't successful

430
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,800
they result in paralysis
or death.

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,600
But dr. Shepherd
is the best there is.

432
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,900
She's 17.

433
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,000
Mom, I know you still think
death is the worst thing

434
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,300
that can happen
to a person.

435
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
Death is not
the worst thing.

436
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,400
I'm in.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
They're gonna cut out
a piece of her spine--

438
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,400
heather douglas.

439
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
Doctors Shepherd
and Torres, they're--

440
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
they're gonna straighten
her spine.

441
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,000
And ?

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,900
And. . . It's
a once-in-a-lifetime surgery.

443
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,400
Please.
She's my patient.

444
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,500
I've gotten to know her.

445
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,600
I would <I>really like
to scrub in.

446
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Did you deposit the check ?

447
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,700
It's my money.

448
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
I should get to do
what I want with it.

449
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,700
Uh, you get a 5% return
on 6-month cd ?

450
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
In the time we've been
standing here,

451
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
you could've
just made $400.

452
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Dr. Bailey.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,700
It's not reasonable,
Stevens.

454
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,900
Dad, it's you to discard.

455
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm sorry about
running over bucky.

456
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,400
What ?

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,600
Your dog.
That happy dog bucky.

458
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,600
When you were a kid,
I ran over him,

459
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
and I told you he ran away.
I'm sorry about that.

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
You ran over my dog
on purpose ?

461
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,200
Of course not. He was chasing
after the truck like always

462
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,900
and he got caught up
under the tire.

463
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,000
You were so sensitive.

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,300
You were such a soft kid,
I couldn't bear to tell ya.

465
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,100
I wasn't soft.

466
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,700
I mean it good, georgie.

467
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,600
You know, you were kind
and you loved animals.

468
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,100
You were always looking
to help people.

469
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,400
And I couldn't face you

470
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,100
and tell you
that I killed your dog

471
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,800
so I told you a lie.

472
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm saying I'm sorry.

473
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,100
Okay.

474
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
You're a good kid, georgie.

475
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,800
Always been
such a good kid.

476
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,300
I want to tell you--

477
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
dad, stop acting like
you're dying.

478
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
You're not dying, okay ?

479
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,300
I want to tell you
that I think you're crazy

480
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,000
if you let that Callie
get away.

481
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Dad, please !

482
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
No, she gets you.

483
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,300
She gets you in a way
that your family never has.

484
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm sorry about that,

485
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,400
that you grew up feeling
so different all the time.

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,400
That's another thing
I'm sorry about.
Dad, stop it.

487
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,200
Stop apologizing,
stop saying good-bye.

488
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
You can't. . .

489
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
That's no way
to go into surgery.

490
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm gonna die someday,
georgie.

491
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,300
We're all gonna die,

492
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,400
and lying here in this bed
gives me time to think

493
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,300
about all the things
I haven't said is all. Okay.

494
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Well, just discard.

495
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,500
Anything you want
to say to me ?
Dad !

496
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,300
All right.
I'm discarding.

497
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
Dog murderer

498
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Tell me what I want to hear.

499
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
If I die, you'll kill me.

500
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,700
He's a quick study.

501
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,500
Meredith.

502
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
Hello.

503
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Hello.

504
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm. . .
Uh, how are you ?

505
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,100
Good. Uh, busy with work.
We have a patient.

506
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,100
Hello.
Hello.

507
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Hi.
Hi.

508
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,500
Uh, all right, then.

509
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,900
Oh, I'm so--
uh, nice seeing you.

510
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

511
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
That's your ex-boyfriend.

512
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,600
No, that's my ex-father.

513
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,500
You see, Grey ?

514
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,400
Good exposure
to the esopheal hiatus.

515
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,300
Yes, sir.

516
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Now we will inspect
and palpate

517
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,500
the abdominal cavity.

518
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,900
Oh. . .

519
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Those are the mets,
right ?

520
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,700
Throughout the stomach,
the celiac lymph nodes,

521
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
the liver.
It's everywhere.

522
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,700
So that's it ?
We're closing him back up ?

523
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,700
No.

524
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,300
We will proceed.

525
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,200
But I thought--

526
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,500
the patient asked us
to proceed.

527
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
What does that mean exactly ?

528
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,000
This man asked
for a chance to fight.

529
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What it means is. . .

530
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,200
He's gonna have to fight
like hell.

531
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,200
But he can recover ?
There's a chance ?

532
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,900
There's a chance.

533
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Dr. Grey, the request
from the patient. . .

534
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
It was private.

535
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Yes.

536
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Okay.

537
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Preston.

538
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,200
Oh, Addison.

539
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,300
How you feeling ?

540
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,900
Better.

541
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,000
Looking forward
to going home.

542
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, I'm sure dr. Yang
is looking forward

543
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,600
to having you back there
as well.

544
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
Uh, maybe.
I wouldn't know.

545
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,500
Why wouldn't you know ?
What. . .

546
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Is. . .

547
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,600
Is that over ?

548
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,700
No, it's not over.
It's just. . . Silent.

549
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,900
Si--oh, yeah, yes.
I heard something about this.

550
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,300
Um, one of the nurses
was talking.

551
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,200
I just thought it was gossip.

552
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,100
It's not.

553
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,000
So you're not talking to her.
Why not ?

554
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,700
Did you ever play
say "uncle" ?

555
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,300
Say "uncle" ?

556
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,200
Someone bends your arm
behind your back

557
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,500
harder and harder
until you say "uncle. "

558
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,400
And then what happens ?

559
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,700
Then <I>they have all the power.

560
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,100
I see.

561
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,400
So you
are not saying "uncle. "

562
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Yes.

563
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,000
And neither is she.

564
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,500
It seems that way.
That's pathetic.

565
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,500
Well, you may be right.

566
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,400
I am right.
If you did something wrong,

567
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,800
then you apologize.

568
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,400
Well, I didn't do
anything wrong.

569
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,700
Did she ?

570
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
She doesn't seem
to think so.

571
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,900
That's pathetic.

572
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
Hey.

573
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,100
You're all alone.
Where's your family ?

574
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,700
Eating. They like to eat.

575
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Mm. You're pacing.

576
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah.

577
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,600
It's just, he's been
in surgery for a while.

578
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,900
That's good. It means
they're being thorough.

579
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,100
Or it means
there are complications.

580
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,800
Somebody would've told you
if there were complications.
Right.

581
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,600
It's okay to be scared.
I'm not scared.

582
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm just sayin',
if you are. . .

583
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm not scared.
You can talk to me.

584
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
You're sure about that ?

585
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,700
Okay, now I'm scared of you.

586
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Damn it.
I was staring you down.

587
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Staring me down ?

588
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
Yeah, it worked on Shepherd.

589
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,900
Seriously ?

590
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,000
Wait, wait.
Let me try it again.

591
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,100
No, it's not. . .
No ?

592
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm still scared.

593
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,800
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

594
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
Uh, you should
prepare yourself,

595
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
because this is
a much more extensive surgery

596
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
than the heart valve.

597
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,700
There's probably still
a tube in his throat
helping him breathe,

598
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,000
and half his stomach
was cut out

599
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,400
and part of his esophagus,
so there's gonna be a big scar.
Okay.

600
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Just. . . Be prepared.

601
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,100
Welcome back, sweetheart.

602
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Dad looks like something
out of the butcher shop.

603
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,900
That's a cool scar.

604
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
You need to breathe.

605
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
He's my dad.

606
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,200
I know.

607
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,400
He's my dad.

608
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,500
I know.

609
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, you have <I>got
to be kidding me.

610
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
Where is George ?

611
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,600
He spent the night
at the hospital.

612
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,800
And you slept in his bed.
Mm-hmm.

613
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,700
All night ?

614
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,500
No. Just after
you fell asleep.

615
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,600
So you're telling me
that my snoring is so bad--

616
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,900
how did you deal with it
for all those nights

617
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,200
before I found out
about your wife ?

618
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
He usually sleeps on the couch,
sets an alarm,

619
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,800
gets back in bed
before you wake up.

620
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
(Derek) Yeah, I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

621
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,700
Mmm. Oh.

622
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,800
Well, I'm gonna do more
than hurt your feelings.

623
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,100
What are you doing ?
Oh. Stop it.

624
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,200
Aah !

625
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm gonna hurt your feelings
'cause. . .

626
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Can I. . . Help you ?

627
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,500
(sobs) I, um. . .

628
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,000
I-I inherited
$8 million.

629
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry ?

630
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,400
Almost 9, actually.

631
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,500
Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

632
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,500
Thank you.

633
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,700
I'm sorry. Did you say--

634
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,000
here, just take it.

635
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
Just take it, please.

636
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Is that. . .

637
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,700
It's covered in food.

638
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,900
Is this some kind
of joke ?

639
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,300
It is kind of a joke. . .

640
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
A really cruel joke.

641
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,300
I'm sorry.
You want to deposit this ?

642
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,200
If I wanted to deposit it,

643
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,500
do you think that
I would look like this ?

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't understand.

645
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm. . . I'm supposed to do
something good.

646
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I'm supposed
to do something good,

647
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
and--and I didn't. . .

648
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,100
Can--can you just deposit
the damn thing already ? !

649
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm surprised they proceeded
with the surgery.

650
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Me, too. I guess
they think

651
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,600
he has a strong enough constitution
to fight the cancer.

652
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,400
Is he conscious ?

653
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,100
Still intubated,
so they have him sedated.

654
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,800
The main concern
for the next few days

655
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,600
will be multisystem
organ failure.

656
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
That is that the surgery
was too intense

657
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
for his weakened organs
to support.

658
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
You want to watch
the kidneys

659
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,400
because if the kidneys fail,
that's a sign

660
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,500
that everything else
is starting to go.

661
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,000
So we're watching
the kidneys.

662
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
You're watching the kidneys.
Thank you.

663
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, do you mind me asking,
uh, how's your hand ?

664
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
I don't mind if you ask.

665
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,300
I will mind
if you tell Cristina.

666
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,100
You two have
a strange relationship.

667
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,100
Yes, we do.

668
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah.

669
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
And when you go home,

670
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
you're gonna have
your very own room.

671
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes, you do.

672
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,400
And your mom, she got
one of those, um,

673
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,500
you know, uh, those stencils.

674
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,400
Mm-hmm.

675
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
And she made
little butterflies

676
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,200
and flowers.

677
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,800
You need something ?

678
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
No, I'm fine.

679
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,600
Oh, it gets quiet
in here.

680
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,400
You're the one
who paged me ?

681
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
I started my shift
ten minutes ago,

682
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
noticed her stomach looked
a little distended.

683
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,000
Her stomach's distended ?
I-I didn't notice that.

684
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,900
It's hard to see.
Page dr. Montgomery, stat.

685
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,600
Is everything okay ?
Is this bad ?

686
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
Well, let's just wait
for dr. Montgomery.

687
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,200
What's the matter ?

688
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,400
My father's here.

689
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,300
Your father ?

690
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,400
The one I don't talk to
and barely know, he's here.

691
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,500
What, is he here to see you ?

692
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
No. He's here
with his other family.

693
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,900
Oh, sorry.

694
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
Where do you sleep
at the trailer ?

695
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,500
What ?

696
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,100
When we sleep at the trailer,
where do you sleep ?

697
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,300
You know
the hammack outside ?

698
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,100
Sorry.

699
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm a girl
with abandonment issues.

700
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
You have to sleep
with me from now on.

701
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Okay.

702
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,300
Okay.

703
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
A note from my hack
of a shrink.

704
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,100
I get to scrub in.
Not till I say so.

705
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
I deposited
the damn check.

706
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
You cheap
son of a bitch bastards

707
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,600
are going straight to hell--
straight to hell !

708
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Ms. Douglas ?

709
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,200
Insurance bastards.

710
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,200
They say the surgery's
too experimental.

711
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,100
They won't pay.

712
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,300
It's a $200,000 surgery,

713
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,500
plus a hospital stay,
plus rehab.

714
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,800
Even if I get three jobs. . .

715
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
Son of a bitch bastards.

716
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,600
Looks like there won't be
a surgery to scrub in on.

717
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,500
Sorry, Stevens.

718
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,700
Talk to me.
Her abdomen was distended

719
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,600
and she needed increased
ventilatory support,

720
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,000
so I ordered some x-rays.
I'm sorry. I was talking
to her. I didn't notice.

721
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,500
She's got massive free air
trapped beneath her diaphragm.

722
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,100
Mr. Grey, we need to get
laura into surgery.

723
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,100
What ? Another surgery ?
Why ?
Her x-rays indicate there's ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

724
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,400
We need to get in there
right away.
Here's a consent form you need to sign.

725
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,900
I don't--I--
I don't know. . .

726
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,100
Her--her mother
has the flu.

727
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
At, you're not
authorized to sign ?
I am.

728
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
But I--I'd like to
fill her in--

729
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,900
we don't have time
for you to not know, mr. Grey.

730
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Your granddaughter
doesn't have time.

731
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
All right, all right.

732
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Take out more of the bowel.
I need better visualization.

733
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,800
It's so tiny, I'm afraid
I might crush it.

734
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,700
Oh, it's tougher
than you think.

735
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,100
Go ahead and give it
a little squeeze.

736
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,400
Cool. Thanks. Hmm.

737
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Look at that.

738
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,700
The n. G. Tube has eroded
right through the stomach wall.

739
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,300
I may have to resect
an entire portion
of the stomach.

740
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,300
She's hypotensive.
Push 30 ccs of albumin.
Got it.

741
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Whew.

742
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Scary.

743
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,500
You're telling me.

744
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,800
This is
Meredith's Grey's niece.

745
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
If I lost her, people might
think I did it on purpose.

746
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,300
How's it going ?

747
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,800
Okay. They had a scare
a minute ago,

748
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
but she stabilized.

749
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Your, uh, father is pacing
up and down the halls.

750
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,400
He's worried.

751
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,000
Maybe you can give him
an update.

752
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
*Maybe you can give him
an update. *

753
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,400
He's not a big fan
of mine.

754
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,300
He's not a big fan
of mine either.

755
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,700
Oh, I can't imagine
that's true.

756
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Your mother was a force
to be reckoned with.

757
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,600
If she wanted things
a certain way, I. . .

758
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,400
I'm saying your father
was a good man when I knew him.

759
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,900
He may have a side in this that
you don't know anything about.

760
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,700
What, you think he tried
to send me a card every year

761
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
and my mother
has a whole drawer

762
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,600
full of unopened cards ?

763
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,300
Because it's not often

764
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,700
that my life
turns out that way.

765
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,100
I don't know.

766
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,300
You don't know either
until you ask him.

767
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,500
Hey.

768
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,000
How's he doing ?

769
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Uh, georgie is obsessed
with our dad's pee.

770
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,400
Yeah, this is weird,
even for georgie.

771
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Boys, be nice.
It's his kidney function.

772
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,200
I'm obsessed with his
kidney function, not his pee.

773
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,100
And I'm not obsessed.

774
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I'm excited.

775
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,800
You're not gonna drink that,
are you, georgie ?

776
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,500
130 ccs !

777
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,000
130 ccs of shiny,
yellow urine !

778
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
130 ccs in how long ?

779
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,600
Four hours.
No way !

780
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
That is fantastic !

781
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,500
Yeah ! Yeah !
Thank you !

782
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Mm.

783
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,200
Thank you.

784
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,700
Thank you.

785
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,400
Mark.

786
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm sorry you're hurting.

787
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,700
You're sorry I'm hurting
or you're sorry ?

788
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,900
(Addison) Karev.

789
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,500
Oh. Hey.

790
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,500
I was, uh, just checking
the baby's capillary refills--

791
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,100
no, it's good,
it's good.

792
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
We all need
a little human contact

793
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,100
from time to time.

794
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
It sucks.

795
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,700
It's like she hasn't had
a chance to deserve this,

796
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,500
you know ?

797
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Is that why you want
to go into plastics,

798
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
'cause people sign up
for the pain they get ?

799
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,900
Yeah.

800
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,500
For the most part,
they do, yeah.

801
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,100
You're right.

802
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,500
It does suck
watching them struggle.

803
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
And that part
never stops sucking.

804
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,700
But. . . Then when you get
to see a baby heal

805
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,600
and, um. . .
They get to go home

806
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,500
and. . . You just imagine

807
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
this whole life
that they're gonna live,

808
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
there's nothing better
than that.

809
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,900
And that part
never changes.

810
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,900
But. . . If you want
to go back to plastics. . .

811
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,100
Nah.

812
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,800
The vanilla latte ?

813
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,300
I did that on purpose.

814
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Why ?

815
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
'Cause he was rude
to you.

816
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,500
Oh.

817
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm, uh, sorry.

818
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,400
No, I'm sorry.

819
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Sorry.
Gosh, I'm. . . Really sorry.

820
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,700
No, I'm okay.
I'm, uh, I'm just, um. . .

821
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm gonna--

822
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
yeah, okay. Yeah yeah.

823
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh, hey.
You need some help ?

824
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,000
I can walk
to the bathroom myself.

825
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
I've been doing it
my whole life,

826
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
and nothing's changing
any time soon,

827
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,700
so just get out
of my way, okay ?

828
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,100
* And I can't live alone
in this lie *

829
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
* so look up

830
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
