1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,300
human beings

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,700
need a lot of things to feel alive...

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,200
family...

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,300
love...

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,900
sex.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,700
but we only need one thing...

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,800
to actually be alive.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,900
we need a beating heart.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,300
when our heart is threatened...

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
we respond in one of two ways...

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
we either run...

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
or...

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
we attack.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,600
there's a scientific term for this...

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,300
fight...

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,700
or flight.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,700
it's instinct.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,900
we can't control it.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,500
or can we?

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,500
izzie.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,600
his heart's barely beating.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
We need to call a code.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,600
I can't feel a pulse.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Izzie,we need to call a code.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,700
No! I have a plan.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,500
He's crashing.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,100
I need to call the code.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
No! If we call a code,

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,600
they will rush him to surgery

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,900
and replace his lvad,

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
and then he will stabilize.

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,300
He needs to get worse

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
if he's gonna get this heart.

34
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
Izzie,this is crazy.

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
He has to get this heart.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
He will die waiting for another chance.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,100
You know he will.

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,000
We have to call a code!

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,900
No!

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,800
You press that code button,

41
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
I will hurt you.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Not a lot,'cause we're friends,

43
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,100
but enough so that things will break,

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,800
and you lie on the floor out of my way.

45
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Izzie...

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,900
you have a decision to make.

47
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,800
You can stay here

48
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,700
and help me with this,

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,600
or you can go.

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,300
What's it gonna be,george?

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
chief,how bad is it?

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,100
It looks bad.

53
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Um,I'm here. I can help.

54
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,200
Um,if there's anything surgical,I can help.

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,900
Why don't you go run trauma two,
doctor yang?

56
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,100
I get to run trauma two,

57
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,000
all by myself?

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Yes,but find me if you need
help and get consults.

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm on it.

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
how bad is it?

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,900
Uh,G.S.W.

62
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,700
To the right shoulder.

63
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
He's lost a lot of blood.

64
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
All right,get him to trauma one.

65
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
And keep the blinds closed.

66
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,300
Yang is on the floor.

67
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,600
Self-inflicted G.S.W. To the head.

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,700
Pulse is thready.

69
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,500
This guy's the shooter?

70
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,300
Yep,emptied his clip then shot himself.

71
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,900
And blew off half his head.

72
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
Okay,okay.

73
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
push 1 of epi and,

74
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,600
get him on a monito

75
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,900
you're running this?

76
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
Damn right I am.

77
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,100
Wait,wait.

78
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
I'm--I'm fine.

79
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,700
You need to lay down.

80
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
You've lost a lot of blood.

81
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm fine. L-let go.

82
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,500
I'm fine.

83
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,700
I have a patient i have to go check on.

84
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,200
No,no,no.

85
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
You are the patient.

86
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,700
Lay down.

87
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,300
dr. Bailey,

88
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,700
when did you get here?

89
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,900
Page shepherd.

90
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,900
take over compressions.

91
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
You're shot?

92
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,500
Cristina?

93
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,900
-get back to your patient!
-He's shot?

94
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,300
Yang,we got this,okay?

95
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
That guy shot you.

96
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,300
Move.

97
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,000
He's a lost cause.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Move.

99
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
He's circling the drain.

100
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,900
You don't get to kill yourself.

101
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,200
You do not get off that easily.

102
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Push high dose epi.

103
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
-Dr. Yang--
-what?!

104
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,700
I want to be able to tell his family

105
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
that I did everything I could to
save his pathetic,miserable life.

106
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Give him 3 of epi,now.

107
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,900
We should be hearing
from dr. Burke any minute.

108
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,300
that's what you said half an hour ago.

109
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,500
Well,whether or not we hear from him,

110
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,800
we hit that hour mark,

111
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm goin' in to get my heart.

112
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,600
Okay,no.

113
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
No exit wound.

114
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,500
Entry to the upper right shoulder.

115
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,400
Could be lodged in the spine.

116
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
okay,let's roll him over.

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
easy.

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,300
Okay,watch the arm.

119
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,000
Easy.

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,900
Hey,dr. Burke.

121
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,500
The bullet is in dangerous
property here,okay?

122
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,900
We need to check your hand function.

123
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,500
I want you to try and squeeze
my fingers,okay?

124
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
They moved my guy upstairs.

125
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,800
-How is he?
-I need you to wait outside.

126
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm not gonna wait outside.

127
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Burke?

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
Can we have a moment?

129
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,400
only a moment.

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,500
I don't want to waste any time,okay?

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
cristina...

132
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
no,you don'thave to say anything.

133
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
I know you're sorry.

134
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,000
I know you didn't mean to kick
me off the transplant,

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
and I'm not mad.

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
I mean,I was,

137
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,700
but I'm not anymore.

138
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,400
So don't worry about it.

139
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,500
Don't even think about it,okay?

140
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,200
I mean,all that matters is that you get better,

141
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,700
and you get through this.

142
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
And I'm here for you--

143
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,300
whatever you need,anything.

144
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,500
I need...

145
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,300
you to...

146
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,500
to go...

147
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,900
To check on denny duquette.

148
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Okay.

149
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
that was my best supportive girlfriend,

150
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
and you kind of ruined it with medicine.

151
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Okay.

152
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,400
Addison!

153
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you for meeting us.

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
You want to tell me what's so important

155
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
i'm keeping it secret from my chief of surgery?

156
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,100
I was chaperoning a prom for my niece.

157
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
We had a little bit of a situation.

158
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Camille travis,17,

159
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,600
lost consciousness during sexual intercourse?

160
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
Keep it down!

161
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,500
It's okay,aunt adele.

162
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,300
I'm fine.

163
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,800
When your uncle richard finds out
you were cashing in your v-card,

164
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,900
none of us will be fine.

165
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,200
camille?

166
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,800
mrs. Webber?

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,100
Oh,my god. Is she okay?

168
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,200
-She has to be okay,right?

169
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,700
-No one ever died having sex,right?
-It was her first time.

170
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
You're not gonna tell my parents,right?

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,300
Hey,I even used a condom and everything.

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,300
george's page said it was an emergency.

173
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
You paged meredith?

174
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,100
We need help!

175
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,000
What the hell is going on?

176
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,100
Exacy what I said.

177
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
she cut his lvad wires.

178
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,900
What do you mean,

179
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,200
-you cut his lvad wires?
-Are you trying to kill him?

180
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,900
I'm trying to save him.

181
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,800
All I have to do is confirm
that his condition is worse,

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
and then burke can call U.N.O.S.

183
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
And he'll move up on the list,

184
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
and he will get his heart.

185
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,300
-About burke--
-she's gone insane,right?

186
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,000
It's not just me?

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,700
About burke--

188
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,500
everything will be fine!

189
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Izzie.

190
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,900
When burke gets here,

191
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,800
everything will be fine.

192
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
He will know what to do.

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,700
About burke--

194
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,300
what?!

195
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,800
He's been shot.

Greys.Anatomy.
Season 02 Episode 27

199
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,300
burke's not coming?

200
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Cristina,are you okay?

201
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,900
I'm fine,I'm fine.

202
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,400
Burke's not coming?

203
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Why didn't I take the internship
in san diego?

204
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,700
None of this would be happening

205
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,800
if I was in san diego.

206
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
Burke's not coming?

207
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
No,izzie,

208
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
burke is not coming.

209
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,700
I know you're having problems here,

210
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,300
what,with your possible murder charges

211
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,800
and your unbelievably stupid
idea about stealing a heart,

212
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,700
but burke's kinda busy right now.

213
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,900
denny's gonna die.

214
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,500
Denny's gonna die,

215
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,200
and I killed him.

216
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,100
You shouldn't have done it!

217
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,800
geoeorge.

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
We have to tell someone.

219
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
No,denny won't get the heart,

220
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
and izzie will get kicked out of the program.

221
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm leaving.

222
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,400
What?

223
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,900
Cristina!

224
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,000
No,burke could die,too.

225
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Complications arise all the time

226
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
because of gunshot wounds.

227
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,400
You think about that.

228
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,100
Oh,my god.

229
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,900
Oh,god,you know what?

230
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,800
None of this would've happened

231
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,700
if you were thinking with your head.

232
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,400
-I did what I thought was best!
-Did you think about the rules,

233
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,300
izzie,for one second?

234
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
-The rules don't always matter!
-About anyone other than yourself?!

235
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,800
Shut up !

236
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
Shut up!

237
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Shut up !

238
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,700
No one is leaving and no one is dying.

239
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
thank you.

240
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
It was kinda gettin' on my nerves,

241
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,900
all this dying talk.

242
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Denny...

243
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
it's okay.

244
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,500
I think,

245
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,800
maybe we should all listen to meredith.

246
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
It looks like she might have a plan.

247
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
You have a plan?

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,300
Just give me a minute.

249
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
You girls should go back to the prom.

250
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,700
Are you gonna call camille's parents?

251
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,400
Not until I have to.

252
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
You know her mom.

253
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,700
She gets a little hysterical.

254
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
brian,disappear.

255
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,600
What?

256
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,200
Disappear! Go. Get--

257
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
richard.

258
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,700
Richard.

259
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,800
Adele.

260
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,100
what,are you here to see preston?

261
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,700
Preston?

262
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
No.What happened to preston?

263
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,500
Preston was shot.

264
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,300
Preston was shot?

265
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,500
Camille?

266
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,900
What--what happened to camille?

267
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,400
Richard--

268
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,300
why didn't you call ?

269
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,400
She's 17,sweetheart.

270
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,300
She'll be 18 in a few months.

271
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,900
Most girls lose it way before--

272
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,200
Do you think i want to hear that?

273
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,500
You think I want to picture my baby niece...

274
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,300
losing it?

275
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,700
Richard,richard.Take deep breaths.

276
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,800
The bleeding has stopped,

277
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
but her pelvic exam does concern me.

278
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,700
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

279
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,200
Three years ago,

280
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,100
camille was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

281
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,600
They only removed one ovary to try
and preserve fertility.

282
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,100
But her checkups have been clean since then.

283
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,900
okay.

284
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,500
let's not worry until we have to.

285
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,300
you!

286
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,900
You wait right there.

287
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,000
I want to talk to you.

288
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,100
I said wait.

289
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Stop!

290
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,300
I said stop!

291
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
Richard,take deep breaths.

292
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,100
Richard!

293
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,400
that's a stupid plan.

294
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
if burke isn't coming,

295
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
then we have to confirm denny's
condition ourselves.

296
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,500
We get the blood work,

297
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,800
we do the echo,

298
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
and no one even has to know what izzie did.

299
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
But none of us have done an echo
on our own before.

300
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,600
Cristina has.

301
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,900
Burke taught her.

302
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm not involved.

303
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,200
What if this were burke?

304
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,300
What if you were me?

305
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,400
This is bad.

306
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
This is bad and serious

307
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,800
and against a lot of rules.

308
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,500
It's not fun for me.

309
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't want to play.

310
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,100
What if you were me?

311
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
I wouldn't have fallen in love with a patient.

312
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,900
You fell in love with an attending.

313
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,000
so did mer.What's the point?

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
The point is we can't help who
we fall in love with.

315
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,900
hand's cold.

316
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,600
My hands are always cold.

317
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Your hand is cold,preston.

318
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
I have cold hands.

319
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
the bullet could be lodged in the brachial plexus.

320
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's dangerous.

321
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah,it's very dangerous.

322
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
oh,no. Trachea's deviated to the left.

323
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,900
-Absent breath sounds on the right side.
-Give me betadine.

324
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Let's go,let's go,let's go.

325
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,600
14 gage angio.

326
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,700
Let's hurry.

327
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,900
dr. Burke.

328
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,300
Dr. Burke,you gotta stay with me now.

329
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,100
there you go.

330
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,800
That's it.

331
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,200
There you go.You're all right.

332
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Right here,right here.

333
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
Your lung collapsed.

334
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
You're okay.

335
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,900
You're okay now.

336
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,800
He's been shot?

337
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,500
Dude...

338
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,800
we're gonna have to run these tests ourselves.

339
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
U.N.O.S. Gave us an hour.

340
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,700
In a couple of minutes,

341
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,900
our time is up.

342
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,600
M telling you,this chick is hard-core.

343
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
She's not gonna wait.

344
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Okay,well,you just have to stall her.

345
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not getting involved with this.

346
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,900
Look,I don't care if that--

347
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,100
that drawling,bedridden whiner ever gets a heart.

348
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Alex...

349
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,000
do this...

350
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
for izzie.

351
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm not guaranteeing anything.

352
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
so...

353
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
was it totally romantic?

354
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,900
before the pain and the paramedics and everything?

355
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
okay,so...

356
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,900
you know that feeling when you look
into someone's eyes

357
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
and you're totally comfortable,

358
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
and you aren't self-conscious,

359
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
and everything just...

360
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,900
is,like,perfect?

361
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
camille,have you had any symptoms?

362
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
any abdominal pain,

363
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,900
nausea?

364
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Anything?

365
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,900
no,she's been fine.

366
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,900
You haven't been fine,have you?

367
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
o,not for like a month or so.

368
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,700
You've been feeling sick for a month?

369
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,600
wanted to go to prom.

370
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,500
I-I...

371
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,300
I didn't want to be the girl with cancer again.

372
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
ou're not.

373
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
he's not,right?

374
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,800
I was just trying to remember
the night I lost my virginity.

375
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,900
and I can'T.

376
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
I remember who it was with and...

377
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I remember I was 18,but...

378
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
can't remember any of the details.

379
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,800
I can remember all of the details.

380
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
I kinda wish I couldn'T.

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
That bad?

382
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
No.

383
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,500
just not good.

384
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
good came later.

385
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,900
And then really good came.

386
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,100
that little girl in there
is just gettin' started.

387
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,500
She hasn't even seen what good is yet.

388
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,500
Please,addison...

389
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,800
tell me she's going to have a chance

390
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,700
to see what the good stuff is.

391
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,500
I'm so sorry,adele.

392
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
How's his heart looking?

393
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,700
His left ventricle's shot.

394
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,900
It is barely pushing blood out.

395
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm sorry.

396
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
I know that you're worried about burk

397
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
-you know,whatever.
-It's fine.

398
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Cristina,can't you just try to understand?

399
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,900
I love him.

400
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You don't even know him.

401
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,400
I do know him.

402
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,600
No,you've never even seen him outside
the four walls of this hospital.

403
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,500
You don't know him.

404
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
I know him.

405
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,900
And maybe I don't live with him

406
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,500
or work with him like you do with burke,

407
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,000
but I do know him.

408
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,300
And there'S...

409
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,500
there's possibility here.

410
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,200
And--and given the choice of running or staying--

411
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,900
you should run.

412
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,800
A sane person,

413
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,500
a person who values her career

414
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,900
and everything she's worked for,

415
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,800
a person who values her own heart,
for god's sake,

416
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,500
that person would run.

417
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,300
A sane person...

418
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
would marry me.

419
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,900
What?

420
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
What did you say?

421
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
What did he say?

422
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,700
He said,"marry me"?

423
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,300
He said,"marry me",right?

424
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,600
He did.

425
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,700
Denny,wake up.

426
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Denny.

427
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
what's happening?

428
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm pumping harder.

429
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,500
I don't know.

430
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,400
he's ftline.

431
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
No,no,no,he's not flatline.

432
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,100
There's movement in his heart.

433
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,800
Okay,

434
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
let's--let's shock him.

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Uh,charge the fibrillator.

436
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ventilate,george.

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,700
I am.

438
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,500
Charging to 200.

439
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,900
you got it?

440
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Clear.

441
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
is dr. Burke alive?

442
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,400
Yes.

443
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Shame.

444
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
He'd have probably have made a good donor.

445
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,500
Okay,people,

446
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,100
let's get our oans and get outta here.

447
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,400
Hey,that heart is not yours yet.

448
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,100
Seattle grace is still waiting for test results.

449
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm not. Ten blade.

450
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
You can't do that.

451
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
I just did.

452
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
Girls.

453
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
I called jillian.

454
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,600
And I called tessa.

455
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,100
And then they called simon and
bianca and deborah.

456
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,900
Girls--

457
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
it's her prom,dr. Webber.

458
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
She can't miss her whole prom.

459
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,500
So...

460
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
we,like,brought it toer.

461
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
kids...

462
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,200
kids...

463
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,500
listen up.

464
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,300
Look,I know you wanted to see camille.

465
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
Why don't you come back tomorrow,

466
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
during the day,

467
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,900
in smaller groups?

468
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
Look,I'm sorry,girls.

469
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,400
I can't have a bunch of teenagers
running in the hallways.

470
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
People are sick.

471
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,900
People are dy--

472
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
dying?

473
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,300
we know.

474
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
How you doin'?

475
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,500
I'm developing numbness in my...

476
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,600
fourth and fifth fingers.

477
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,900
And there's a pseudoaneurysm in the
subclavian artery.

478
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
You know the drill.

479
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
We'll wait a few days,

480
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
maybe the aneurysm won't grow.

481
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,300
Even if it stays this size,

482
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
there's too much damage.

483
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,300
We'll just go in there and we'll fix it,

484
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,900
relieve the compression on the nerves.

485
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,900
But the operation could cause damage
to the nerves.

486
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Yes.

487
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
And I could...

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,600
lose function of the entire arm.

489
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,300
y-yes.

490
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
you can do this?

491
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,800
Are you good enough to do this?

492
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
I think so.

493
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,900
But you're not sure.

494
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,700
But I'm not sure.

495
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,500
So...

496
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,900
what do I do?

497
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,800
It's not like you to ask those
kind of questions.

498
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,500
It's not like you not to have the answers.

499
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,600
How dare you send those kids away?

500
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Adele,please...

501
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
you're emotional,okay?

502
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,100
I just told my sister her baby's
cancer is back.

503
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,500
You're damn right i'm emotional.

504
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,100
If you don't want to bend your
precious rules for camille,fine.

505
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't do it for her.

506
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,100
Do it for me.

507
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,400
Do it for your wife who never
asks you for anything,

508
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
who says nothing about your long hours,

509
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,900
who looks the other way

510
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
while you have an affair with another woman,

511
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,000
who sobered you up when that woman left you,

512
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
who stayed with you when everyone--

513
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,900
everyone said I would be better off alone.

514
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm not asking you,

515
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm telling you.

516
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,000
You're gonna make this up to camille.

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,800
You're gonna prioritize the needs of your family

518
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,000
above those of your other patients.

519
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,900
Or...

520
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,500
you're gonna find a new place to sleep.

521
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,400
derek.

522
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,500
Not now,addison.

523
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Derek.

524
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,500
Not now.

525
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
there's never a good place
to hide in this hospital.

526
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm trying to get perspective.

527
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,800
Everything feels enormous,like it's all...

528
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
just--

529
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I-I can't get perspective.

530
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
My niece's cancer has come back.

531
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
She's 17 years old,

532
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,500
and she's gonna die.

533
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
Plus...

534
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
25 years ago,

535
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,100
I had a secret affair with...

536
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,700
ellis grey.

537
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,900
And today I find out that my
wife knew the entire time.

538
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,700
There was no...

539
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,900
secret.

540
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,500
And she stayed with me.

541
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,500
I respect him,you know?

542
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,300
Dr. Burke--I...

543
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,100
I respect him.

544
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,900
He's decent. He's honorable.

545
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,900
He's an arrogant ass who just hogs the O.R.

546
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,500
And he thinks he's god,but...

547
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,500
he's decent and he's honorable.

548
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,900
I respect him.

549
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,500
He's one of the foremost cardiothoracic
surgeons in the country,

550
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,900
and I've gotta just...

551
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,490
it's his hand.

552
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
I cannot get perspective.

553
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,800
I can't do this.

554
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,700
I can't be responsible for him.

555
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
Preston's an honorable and decent man,

556
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
but,derek,so are you.

557
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,500
You are honorable and decent.

558
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,900
And you're too honorable and decent to run.

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,900
You don't know how much i wish this was bourbon.

560
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,100
Anything I can get for you,dr. Burke?

561
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,300
No.

562
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm fine.

563
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,400
No,there--there must be something.

564
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,400
Oh,it would be nice to...

565
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,600
have some ice chips and,

566
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,800
a touch of morphine if I'm allowed...and,

567
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,600
cristina.

568
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,800
Comin' right up.

569
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,200
Where is cristina?

570
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Where are--

571
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,000
where are all of the suck ups?

572
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,900
Excuse me?

573
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,800
My interns--

574
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,500
my ass-kissin',surgery hungry,

575
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,200
competitive suck ups,

576
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
where are they?

577
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,700
Why aren't they here fetching you
ice chips and morphine?

578
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Why aren't they here sucking up?

579
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,000
You know something.

580
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,300
I'm a patient.

581
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
Preston xavier burke...

582
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,200
what have you done with my suck ups?

583
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
what do we do?

584
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,100
What do we do?

585
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
I'm starting dopamine and dobutamine drips.

586
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,500
we can use those together,right?

587
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
What about milrinone?

588
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know.

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,600
You know,none of us know.

590
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,500
Just start the dobutamine and--

591
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,700
what about neseritide?That might help.

592
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,100
I feel like my chest is running away.

593
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,400
heart rate 217.

594
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,300
He's in S.V.T.

595
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
No,no,izzie,stop pumping.

596
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Stop.

597
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,800
No,there's no change.

598
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,700
We need that medicine.

599
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,400
What medicine?

600
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I'll know it when I see it.

601
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,900
I-I think--the one that stops the heart.

602
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,700
Here,hold the mask.

603
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,300
No,the whole point is to keep
my heart beating.

604
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
No,no,no,it only stops your heart
for six seconds--

605
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,700
meredith,it's adenosine.

606
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,900
his heart is speeding up,guys.

607
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,700
You guys,we have to do something!

608
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,500
He cannot take this for much longer.

609
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,300
What about shocking him?

610
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,000
-I don't--
-found it.

611
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Cristina,come over here.

612
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay.

613
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Lift up his arm.

614
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,800
The nurses always lift the arm
when they push adenosine.

615
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,500
It gets to the heart faster.

616
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,100
Okay,denny,you're gonna feel,um--

617
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,600
izzie!

618
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,300
No,it's okay.

619
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,900
It's okay.

620
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,700
It just feels like--

621
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm gonna die.

622
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,500
You're not gonna die.I promise.

623
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,400
It's just the meds.

624
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,300
We're heading back to flatline.

625
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
Are you sure we used the right drug?

626
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
the book said it was the right one.

627
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
I used the one I know.

628
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,300
He's not gonna die,right?

629
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,100
Right?

630
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,300
Right ?

631
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,500
You fools better have a good explanation
for this.

632
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
Step away from the patient.

633
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,100
Step away from the patient.

634
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,300
I can'T.

635
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,900
I have to pump his heart.

636
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Olivia...

637
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,000
take over for dr. Stevens.

638
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Izzie,you're done here.

639
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,800
I need you to leave the room.

640
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,500
-Izzie--
no,do not touch me!

641
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,400
Olivia,stay...

642
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
with dr. Stevens.

643
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,900
Help her if she'll let you.

644
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,200
You three,outside.

645
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,300
Now!

646
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,800
where was rational thought?

647
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,900
Where was cognitive thinking?

648
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,500
Where was first do no harm?

649
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,200
The morals,the ethics--

650
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,100
where was sanity when you three
decided to help that girl?

651
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,300
-We didn't--
no,no.

652
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,000
No speaking.

653
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,700
Nobody speaks.

654
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,300
I do not want to have to testify against
any of you in a court of law.

655
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,500
Not one word.

656
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,900
She cut his lvad wire.

657
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,800
look,I said no speaking.

658
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,400
I didn't say anything!

659
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,700
I said no moving.

660
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,800
Cristina,

661
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,300
burke is asking for you.Go.

662
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm assuming you ran labs?

663
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm asking a question.

664
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Answer me!

665
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,400
You said no speak--

666
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,700
I know what I said.

667
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,800
Yes.

668
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,500
O'malley,

669
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,800
get me the lab results.

670
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,900
Do not pass go,

671
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
do not talk to another living soul.

672
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Get the labs,get back here.

673
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,900
Grey...

674
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
come with me.

675
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,500
how are you?

676
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,500
You look good.

677
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
Are those your films?

678
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
burke.

679
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Shepherd,

680
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,100
doesn't know if he can fix my hand.

681
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,800
But maybe I'll wait it out,

682
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
see if this numbness subsides.

683
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,500
Or I could let shepherd operate.

684
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,900
I could lose all hand function.

685
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,900
What if I could never operate again?

686
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,900
Cristina.

687
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,300
Stop saying "yeah."

688
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Okay.

689
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,900
I need...

690
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
I need...

691
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
you said you were here...

692
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,500
for me.

693
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Oh,sorry.

694
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,700
Cristina.

695
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,500
I need you to tell me...

696
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,900
what you think I should do.

697
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,900
I...

698
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,600
I-I told dr. Bailey that I would
be back,okay?

699
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,100
I-I told her that I--

700
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,300
I wouldn't be long,okay?

701
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,000
Cristina.

702
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm--I'm--

703
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm gonna think about it.

704
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I...

705
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm gonna think about it,

706
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
okay?

707
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,200
how you feelin',denny?

708
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
Really,really good,

709
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,800
like an athlete or a superhero

710
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
or some other kind of really healthy person.

711
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,400
You're funny.

712
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,300
You're a funny guy.

713
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
izzie,no speaking.

714
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
I cut my own lvad wires,you know?

715
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,100
I went rogue,

716
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,200
all my myself.

717
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,000
Shush.

718
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
You're weak enough as it is.

719
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,900
Please don't waste energy on lying.

720
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,100
Dr. Bailey.

721
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
I did indeed say no speaking.

722
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I don't care.

723
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
He's gna get the heart,right?

724
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,500
You're gonna sign the charts

725
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,800
and talk to the transplant coordinator?

726
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,900
Here are the labs.

727
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,700
See?

728
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,600
See,his B.U.N.

729
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,100
And creatinine are increasing.

730
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,500
He clearly has pulmonary edema.

731
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,200
He deserves to move up to 1a status
on the transplant list.

732
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,500
U.N.O.S. Will give him the heart.

733
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,200
You just need to call.

734
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
Isobel stevens,

735
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,800
I take my medical advice from doctors.

736
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,700
You are a visitor.

737
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,300
What?

738
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,700
As of now,you are a visitor in this hospital.

739
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,200
You will not be a doctor in this hospital again

740
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,300
until I decide you are.

741
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Olivia,

742
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,900
take over the heart pump.

743
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
He gets the heart,though,right?

744
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Sir

745
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,400
i need to ask you a hypothetical question.

746
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Can't we do this another time?

747
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,400
if someone on the staff deliberately
unhooked a transplant candidate

748
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,300
from his lvad in an attempt to worsen 
his condition

749
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
and get him moved up the donor list,

750
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
hypothetically,sir...

751
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,600
I think you need to tell me exactly
what's going on here,doctor.

752
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,500
Believe me,sir,

753
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
you want this totay a hypothetical,

754
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,400
because I'm thinking if something
like that did happen,

755
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,200
you'd be duty-bound to report it,

756
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,600
and the hospital would be in danger of losing
its accreditation as a transplant site.

757
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,900
So hypothetically...

758
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
hypothetically,

759
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
if the patient got worse,

760
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,200
would it be unethical for him to
receive the heart,

761
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
even tugh,medically,

762
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,100
his worsened condition  now puts
him at the top of the donor list...

763
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,500
hypothetically?

764
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,300
How bad is he?

765
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,000
In the few hours it would take
a new lvad to be delivered,

766
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
he'll be dead.

767
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,200
Our responsibility is to the patient.

768
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,700
If,medically,

769
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,300
he's at the top of the list,

770
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,500
then he should get the heart.

771
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,700
Hypothetically.

772
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
Thank you,sir.

773
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,000
But practically,

774
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,300
whoever removed the patient from the lvad,

775
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,900
I expect to be given names,

776
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,000
and there will be severe,

777
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,900
severe consequences.

778
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,900
Yes,sir.

779
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,400
wait. Hold on.

780
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Dr. Hahn.

781
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Can't stop now,karev.

782
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,900
I only have a few hours to get
this heart into my guy.

783
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Dr. Hahn.

784
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,300
U.N.O.S. Gave the heart to seattle grace.

785
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,900
The transplant coordinator already called

786
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,500
and stopped your guy from being prepped.

787
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
Oh,come on.

788
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,500
He has kids.

789
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,900
They're 4 and 5.

790
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,500
Do you know how long he's been
waiting for this?

791
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,100
He's a good person.

792
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,700
He deserves a heart.

793
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900
I'm sorry.

794
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll bet you are.

795
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,700
No,I am.

796
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Believe me.

797
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,900
Listen...

798
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,900
we have a chopper waiting on the roof.

799
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,900
And?

800
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,800
You could take up fishing.

801
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,600
I don't fish.

802
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,900
Fishing's a lot more fun than surgery.

803
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,900
I have 80% hand function now.

804
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,900
80% is not enough.

805
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,300
Not for you.

806
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,900
Fishing,huh?

807
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,500
You don't fish.

808
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,900
Shepherd.

809
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,500
You don't have to thank me.

810
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,700
I'm sure you'll return the favor one day.

811
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,900
I was going to say please try not to kill me.

812
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll do my best.

813
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Okay.

814
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
Look at that thing.

815
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
The left ventricle's excessively dilated.

816
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,600
He wouldn't have lasted another
hour with this heart.

817
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,500
No,he wouldn't have.

818
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,300
okay,retract that a little bit rht here.

819
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,900
Okay,I am now removing the aneurysm
from the nerve cluster.

820
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
N.A.P.S are dropping.

821
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,300
Arterial pressure's down 50%.

822
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,500
did you cut the nerve root?

823
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I don't see any discontinuity of the nerves.

824
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,600
All right,let's do a,

825
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
reflex test on his hand.

826
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Chief.

827
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,500
Okay.

828
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,300
Nothing.

829
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
Okay. Try it again.

830
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,000
This doesn't make sense.

831
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,900
I would know if I severed a nerve.

832
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,000
Derek,

833
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,900
is the arm paralyzed?

834
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
i'm gonna have to do a wake-up test.

835
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,100
Derek--

836
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,800
there's only one person

837
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,500
who can help me figure out

838
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,000
whether or not I've damaged the relay or not,

839
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,300
and that's burke.

840
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,800
He's been through a lot of trauma today.

841
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,300
I'm trying to prevent the trauma he's gonna feel

842
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,900
if I have to tell him he's paralyzed.

843
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,900
Bailey's treating us like we're children.

844
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,400
We're not children.

845
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,300
We shouldn't have to sit out here

846
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
like we're on a time-out or something.

847
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,400
It is a time-out.

848
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,500
What we did is way in need of a time-out.

849
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,000
You realize we could get kicked
out of the program for this?

850
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,900
Not "we."

851
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,500
I did this.

852
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,700
I did this .

853
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
And you're probably right.

854
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,700
Maybe I should run.

855
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,800
But I'd rather be running towards
somebody than running away.

856
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,400
yang,

857
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,700
shep's asking for you.

858
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,900
Uh,for burke's surgery?

859
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,500
Yes. Hurry up.

860
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
I-I can'T.I'M...

861
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,900
I'm in a time-out.

862
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,000
Time-out's over,

863
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,600
right now.

864
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,100
Yes,sir.

865
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,500
Yang,we need you.

866
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
He said,"marry me," right?

867
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,400
He did?

868
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,000
That really happened?

869
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,700
It really happened.

870
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,500
It really did.

871
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,200
Screw this.

872
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,700
I'm checking on denny.

873
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,200
okay.

874
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,300
How are we doing?

875
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
He's just at the edge of consciousness.

876
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,700
Very light.

877
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
He should be up soon.

878
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,500
Okay.

879
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Yang,you're up.

880
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,700
Oh. What? Sorry.

881
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,600
What do you need me to do?

882
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,100
When he comes to,

883
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
he's gonna be disoriented,

884
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
and he's probably gonna fight the intubation.

885
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
We can't numb the arm

886
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,600
because we need him to move his fingers,

887
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,100
so he's gonna be in a lot of pain.

888
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,000
So we need you to keep him focused,okay?

889
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,900
Okay.

890
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,500
Okay,let's--

891
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,700
let's wake him up.

892
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,500
Burke.

893
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,900
Thank you for calling me about izzie.

894
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,900
I-I didn't do you any favors.

895
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,300
it meant something.

896
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,500
That you called meant something to me.

897
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
It didn't mean anything.

898
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,500
Right.

899
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,200
Okay.

900
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,900
Sorry.

901
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Stop saying that you're sorry!

902
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,900
You wanna know something?

903
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,900
I knew.

904
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,900
I knew you didn't feel that way about me...

905
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,500
even during...

906
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,900
when we were in bed,I knew.

907
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,300
I knew,and I still let it happen because,um...

908
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,900
I figured that...

909
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,800
one night with you was better than never.

910
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,900
So...

911
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,500
you just stop saying that you're sorry,

912
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,700
'cause you didn't know any better.

913
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
But I did.

914
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,900
And...

915
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,900
I'm sorry.

916
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,500
I'm sorry,meredith.

917
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Burke,it's cristina.I--

918
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,300
I'm sorry I...

919
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,700
wake up.

920
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,800
Wake up.

921
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,500
Wake up.

922
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,700
burke.

923
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,600
Baby,wake up.

924
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,300
Do it for me.

925
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,700
Open your eyes.

926
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,300
Hi.

927
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,700
Hi .

928
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,500
get ready,get ready.

929
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
