1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,337
<i>Previously  on "Grey's Anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:03,515
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

3
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:05,985
- I have to.
- Give me my husband back.

4
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:08,111
- Chief resident?
- The one 5th year resident

5
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,397
that rules all residents.

6
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:11,229
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

7
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:13,671
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

8
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,668
What happened
to our small ceremony?

9
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:18,052
What happened to
you and me at city hall?

10
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,642
There's no guarantee the surgery's
gonna bring back your memory.

11
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:23,545
- Is there a man in my house?
- I'm so sorry, Richard.

12
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,132
And I'm finally ready to have a baby,
and I can't.

13
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,944
We're losing her pulse.
She's coding!

14
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,418
We did everything we could.

15
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,438
<i>A surgeon's education never ends.</i>

16
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,380
<i>Every patient, every symptom,
every operation...</i>

17
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,493
<i>is a test.</i>

18
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,665
<i>A chance for us to demonstrate
how much we know...</i>

19
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:54,140
<i>And how much more
we have to learn.</i>

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,328
How do you treat pancreatic divisum?
Izzie?

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,953
Oh, Cristina.
If you're not gonna let us sleep,

22
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:02,104
you at least have to let me
put coffee in my cup.

23
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,831
- Okay, so go. No one's stopping you.
- I'm too tired to go.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,505
- Pancreatic divisum.
- Dorsal duct sphincterotomy.

25
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,129
Not your turn, but correct.
You do me.

26
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:11,575
Can't believe O'Malley's missing this.

27
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:13,497
- How's he gonna be ready?
- You're kidding, right?

28
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,081
- We have Callie's cards but George has-
- George has Callie.

29
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:20,729
What's the most frequent cause
of diarrhea in hospitalized patients?

30
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,456
Is she coming to
this bachelorette thing tonight?

31
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:25,445
Rotavirus. Yes.
No, no, no. Uh, salmonella.

32
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,229
Diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

33
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:31,668
The most frequent cause of diarrhea
in hospitalized patients is C. diff.

34
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:36,316
Which can lead to toxic megacolon,
perforation, sepsis and death.

35
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,631
That's what killed Susan.

36
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:45,361
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

37
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:47,821
- Dude, she's messed up.
- Of course she's messed up.

38
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,746
Susan was basically
her surrogate mother.

39
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:51,990
Yeah, her fake mom
was better than her real mom.

40
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,691
Is she going to the hospital first
or the funeral?

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,992
First to the hospital,
then to the funeral,

42
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,869
then to the test this afternoon.

43
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,081
- Has she even studied?
- Yeah, she studied. She's fine.

44
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,108
She just needs
to be left alone, okay? So...

45
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,175
what's inside the carotid sheath?
Izzie?

46
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,408
<i>The internal carotid artery,</i>

47
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,609
<i>the internal jugular vein
and the vagus nerve.</i>

48
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,201
Ah, that was too easy.
Let's find you a hard one.

49
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:16,481
Uh, what is this?

50
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:18,594
<i>Uh, what is what?</i>

51
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,413
Yeah.
That just came this morning.

52
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:25,999
You got a spot at Mercy West!
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,234
Because it's pending the results
of the intern exam.

54
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,083
Oh, you know what this means,
don't you?

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,763
You, you got,
you got into Mercy West...

56
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,685
I haven't told the chief yet.

57
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,518
You'll tell him today.
He'll understand.

58
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:40,796
It's a smaller program,

59
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,453
fewer residents,
fewer distractions,

60
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,965
more surgeries.

61
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,816
And when I come home
and ask you how your day went,

62
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,289
you can actually tell me
because I won't already know.

63
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,299
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,425
Look, I...

65
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,697
I know this is a...
an impossible day for you.

66
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,985
So...

67
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,887
I'm just want to say one thing.

68
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:32,408
I brought a black suit, just in case.

69
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:34,744
Thank you.

70
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,211
But I think this is something
I need to do by myself.

71
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,099
If you need me, just...

72
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,151
let me know.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,033
- Oh, Cristina.
- What is M.E.N. syndrome?

74
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,132
Don't answer that.

75
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,556
The minister needs to see a copy
of your vows before the wedding.

76
00:03:57,574 --> 00:04:00,147
Multiple endocrine neoplasia. Yes.

77
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,863
Look, I know it's test day,
and I'm not supposed to be

78
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,702
talking about the wedding
on test day.

79
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,556
- But since tomorrow's our wedding day--
- You have five seconds. Go.

80
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,944
Bill Adams can't make it.
I have no best man.

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,053
Oh, no. Baby, I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,991
- And I need your vows by--
- Okay, time's up.

83
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:19,755
Test day.

84
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,485
What am I supposed
to tell the minister?

85
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,081
Test day.

86
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,461
They paged you guys, too?

87
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:30,161
- Well, I think they paged all of us.
- That can't be good.

88
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,283
Sure it can. He could be letting us
know I won the race for chief.

89
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,496
Not today, he isn't.

90
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,721
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

91
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,918
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

92
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:39,968
Why were we all paged?

93
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,203
Oh, because search and rescue
found those lost

94
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,949
climbers who were up
on Mount Rainier.

95
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:46,462
- People, the climbers are on their way.
- Any specifics?

96
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,515
They found only 3 so far.
One's still missing.

97
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:50,566
They're reporting
severe dehydration

98
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,726
with traumatic head
and chest injuries.

99
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,320
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres,
you'll be my trauma team.

100
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,442
- Bad day not to have interns.
- What?

101
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,841
Today's the intern exam.

102
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,189
You'll all have to do your
own heavy lifting today.

103
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,778
And if you see an intern,
which you will,

104
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,388
because they can't help themselves,

105
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,453
turn them away
until after the exam.

106
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,070
The ambulances
are 5 minutes away.

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,936
It's time to do what we do best,
people. Let's roll.

108
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,656
What is a gerota's fascia?

109
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,750
Uh, the fascia surrounding the kidney.

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,194
Which is longer, the left...

111
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:19,278
- or the right renal vein?
- That's right. The left one.

112
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:21,559
- Looks and smarts-- Not bad.
- You think?

113
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:23,569
She's got my dad's nose, though.

114
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,066
Girl's gotta have a big personality
to pull off that nose.

115
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,607
What?

116
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,363
You-- You remember your dad?

117
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,500
No. I don't-- No.

118
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,294
- You just said--
- I know, but I...

119
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,547
I have no idea
where that came from.

120
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,679
That was a memory.
That's what it's like sometimes.

121
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,408
It doesn't always come back all at once.
It can happen in bits and pieces.

122
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,945
- Don't-- Don't get all--
- Dude, your memory's coming back.

123
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:55,584
How you feelin', Preston?
You ready?

124
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,188
I'm always ready for surgery.

125
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,601
I think he's talking
about the wedding.

126
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,084
Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,814
And apart from the fact that
Cristina hasn't written her vows,

128
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:04,213
my best man just canceled,

129
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,081
- and it's still raining...
- He's not ready.

130
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:07,821
You're never ready.

131
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,202
I certainly wasn't.

132
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,550
But then... the minute I saw
Adele coming down that aisle...

133
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:19,348
Well... have you picked
your best man?

134
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,943
- Actually, chief, I--
- You can't be his best man.

135
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,731
- Why not?
- Because it's unethical.

136
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,847
It's a conflict of interest.
The man wants to be chief of surgery.

137
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,683
- Actually, Derek--
- Not that that's why you're asking.

138
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,778
- I was... going to ask you.
- Ask me what?

139
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:42,054
- Really?
- We have been through a lot this year.

140
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,676
And everybody else turned you down.

141
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,152
Oh, what do I have to do?

142
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,016
Well, traditionally the best man
plans the bachelor party.

143
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,361
- Drinks at Joe's after work?
- Yeah.

144
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,145
I knew you were
the man for the job.

145
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:01,747
Dale winick, 32.
B.P. 90 over 50, tachy to 110.

146
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:04,447
Severe frostbite,
but no obvious internal injuries.

147
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,505
Got it.

148
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,763
My god.

149
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,401
Yeah, those aren't gloves.

150
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,930
Please someone tell me
if they heard the others guys are okay.

151
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:22,757
They're right behind you.
We'll let you know.

152
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,907
Get him a tet-tox
and push a gram of cefazolin I.V.

153
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,807
And let's get some warm, circulating
water to start thawing his hands.

154
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,189
I'll get someone on it.
Callie.

155
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,575
We're supposed to be studying.
If Bailey finds out we're down--

156
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:34,369
We are studying.
How do you treat frostbite?

157
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,484
Rewarm, avoid early surgery unless

158
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:40,272
there's a deep infection
due to autoamputation.

159
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,615
See? Studying.

160
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,586
Okay, okay,
Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer,

161
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,586
I'm gonna need you
to save your breath, okay?

162
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,761
We're gonna give you
some pain meds.

163
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,074
You have several broken ribs,

164
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,474
which are compromising your breathing.
You understand?

165
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,624
- Did you see that?
- That is freaky.

166
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,244
I think that was a flail chest.
I've never seen one before.

167
00:07:58,263 --> 00:07:59,553
Come on. Come on.

168
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,445
Why, oh, why does today
have to be test day?

169
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,685
Oh, I know.

170
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:07,930
Look... I bet you
if you talk to the chief,

171
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,671
he'll let you take the test later
with the funeral and everything.

172
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:12,934
I don't need to take the test later.

173
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,615
- Can I get a little help here?
- I can't feel my legs!

174
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,931
Sir, you have a spinal injury.

175
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,696
You need to stop fighting me
and stay calm, okay?

176
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:24,055
You're only making it worse.
Where we going?

177
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,358
- You guys are going to trauma 3.
- All right. Trauma 3.

178
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,963
- You okay?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,451
I got accepted at Mercy West.

180
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,366
Wow that's...
Are you gonna go?

181
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:40,225
Well, I kinda have to now, right?

182
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,744
What are you fools doing here?

183
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:46,938
In a few hours,
you people are taking a test

184
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,637
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers

185
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,942
because the five interns
with the lowest test scores

186
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,284
will be cut from the program.

187
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:56,401
But are you studying for this test?
No, you're not.

188
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:59,755
Are you helping out in the E.R.?
You are most certainly not!

189
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,487
Are you getting the hell out of here
before I throw you out?

190
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,102
I think you are.

191
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,731
- Whoa, Dr. Shepherd.
- Aren't you supposed to be studying?

192
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,809
- Yeah, I just have a quick question.
- Yeah.

193
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,639
Could the craniotomy you performed
on Ava-- On Jane Doe-- Could--

194
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,816
- Could that have affected her memory?
- Uh, it's doubtful.

195
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:16,533
I was mostly working
in the speech center of her brain.

196
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,806
- But you never know. Why?
- I think she remembered something.

197
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,825
Can we test her to see
if anything's changed?

198
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:22,459
Yeah, you can run another W.M.S.R.

199
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,332
But we're gonna have to wait,
see if she remembers anything else.

200
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:25,966
- It's a good sign, though.
- Thanks.

201
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,424
- Nice work, Dr. Montgomery.
- Oh, thanks.

202
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,781
- I was just directing traffic.
- I was being sarcastic.

203
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,922
Oh, like brain surgery
is so impressive.

204
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,692
- It is, actually.
- Addison.

205
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,918
Yes? Oh, Joe, Walter.

206
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,156
What are you guys doing here?
Everything okay?

207
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,513
Yeah, we came to see you, actually.

208
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,511
- We need a consult.
- Don't tell me you're pregnant.

209
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,215
- Uh, no, but--
- Our birth mom is.

210
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,737
The potential birth mom.

211
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,258
She hasn't actually picked us yet.

212
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:52,431
You're adopting?

213
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,473
Well, we filed an application,
but we never thought we'd get picked.

214
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:58,253
You know, bar-owning gays
don't get picked very often.

215
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,629
I guess having a baby
is easier than we thought.

216
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,049
Yes, I guess so.

217
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,824
So I was hoping
you could take a look at her?

218
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,424
You know, kicking the tires,
checking underneath the hood?

219
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:09,964
Car metaphors? No.

220
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,001
I'd be happy to.
Just, uh, give me a call

221
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,240
and we'll set up an appointment.

222
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,739
Well, see, that's the thing, uh...

223
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,232
She lives in Portland,

224
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,409
and she's only gonna be
in Seattle for one day, so...

225
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:20,442
She's kind of here now.

226
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,247
Now, as in...

227
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:26,434
now.

228
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,271
- George, wait. Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

229
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:36,735
You don't have to do this.

230
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,399
You don't have to transfer
to Mercy West.

231
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:39,603
- Yeah, I do.
- No.

232
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,572
Just forget about you and me
for a second, OK?

233
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,938
What about Meredith?

234
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,318
What about Alex and Cristina?

235
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,324
Who's gonna hold us together
if you're not here?

236
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,392
You're the glue. You're George.

237
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,969
- I can't stay here. I can't...
- No one's making you go.

238
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:54,290
stay here
and see you every day...

239
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:57,211
and not...

240
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:01,154
I can't keep kissing you
in elevators.

241
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,929
I know. I know that.

242
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:06,144
I'm married.

243
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,510
I'm a married man.

244
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,338
- You busy?
- Cute. What are you doing here?

245
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:16,867
- Isn't the exam in like--
- I know, I know.

246
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,130
I just want to run
a quick neuro-psych test on you.

247
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,888
No. No! Go take your test.

248
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,644
I-I have a baby to feed.

249
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,782
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

250
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,285
You've been sitting in this bed
for weeks wishing

251
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,031
you could remember who you were
now suddenly you can.

252
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,017
I can't. It was something I said.

253
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:32,627
Well, you remember
your father's face.

254
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:34,411
Why are you acting like
it's no big deal,

255
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,498
- like it happens all the time?
- Alex, come on. I-I--

256
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,794
It-- That's not...

257
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,936
Unless it does happen all the time.

258
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,527
Tell me the truth.
Do you remember?

259
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,434
Do you know who you are?

260
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,540
- What is biloma?
- Cristina, I really don't have time.

261
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,356
A biloma is an intraperitoneal
bile fluid collection.

262
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,074
- Excellent.
- Okay? I'll be fine.

263
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,529
- George, I gotta go.
- Your dad.

264
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,862
Hey.
I was just on my way to--

265
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,801
No, I-I came here to tell you,
you're not wanted.

266
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,139
I don't want you at any funeral,
Meredith.

267
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:16,283
- Thatcher, why don't you come--
- She trusted you!

268
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,962
She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

269
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,521
You did. You killed my wife.
You took her from me.

270
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:23,657
Dad!

271
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,878
So I don't--
I don't want to see you.

272
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,493
I don't want to hear from you,

273
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,368
and I do not want you
anywhere near her funeral.

274
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,282
- Do you understand me?
- Dad, dad, come on.

275
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,958
This-- Lexie's waiting in the car.
We have to go, dad.

276
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:38,575
She was everything to me,
all I had.

277
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,318
She was all I had.

278
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:50,445
She was all I had.

279
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,856
I can sit here all day.

280
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,100
I'll miss my test,
but I will sit here all day.

281
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,791
I don't-- I...

282
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:16,214
It happened a few days ago,
and I-I just...

283
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,467
I just woke up, and...

284
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,904
- it was all there again.
- And you didn't tell me?

285
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,011
Becau-- Because there's...

286
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,734
There's nothing to tell.

287
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,200
Why don't I believe that?

288
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,689
I was a pregnant woman,

289
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,917
in a lousy marriage,

290
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,561
to the nicest guy
anyone's ever met.

291
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:39,886
End of story.

292
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,750
Who-- who is he?
What does he do?

293
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,515
Wh-where--
Where did you meet him?

294
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:50,878
College.

295
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,281
We got married the year
after we graduated.

296
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,385
He...

297
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,385
I wanted--
I wanted to move to New York,

298
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,209
and he wanted to live
on the side of a mountain

299
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,446
and take over his dad's shop.

300
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,799
And he's a woodworker.
He makes beautiful furniture.

301
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:03,217
It's-- It's-- It's...

302
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,723
quiet, and he's quiet and...

303
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,748
- I was going out of my mind.
- So you just...

304
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:10,896
- took off?
- No, I...

305
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,377
No, I need-- I need-- I need--

306
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,942
I needed to think
and to be around other people.

307
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:18,349
So I came to Seattle, and I...

308
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,631
Thought I'd see the sights,
ride the ferry.

309
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:21,974
- Have you even called him?
- No.

310
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:23,646
- Why not?
- I left him, Alex.

311
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,411
So? He's your husband.

312
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,645
You should call him.
You want me to call him?

313
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,392
I mean, what's his name?
What's your name?

314
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:33,471
I'm not telling you that.

315
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,398
- We've got everything taken care of.
- You don't have to worry about a thing.

316
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,519
I've got number 2 pencils
and bottled water.

317
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:43,431
Oh, and-- And powerbars.

318
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:44,923
And you know the material.

319
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,627
You're gonna get a high score--
Not as high as mine--

320
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,102
But everything's gonna be fine.

321
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,375
What are you guys
all standing around for?

322
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,027
Don't we have a test to--

323
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,924
What happened?

324
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,478
You people need to head upstairs.

325
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:58,018
Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.

326
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,806
You're not to blame for Susan Grey's
death, and you know it,

327
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,467
and your father knows it, too.

328
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,159
He's just...

329
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,803
Well, he's never been
the best communicator,

330
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,227
and he just lost his wife.

331
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,539
Stop acting
like my surrogate father.

332
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,978
- Meredith, I've...
- Just Because you slept with my mother,

333
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:25,935
that does not make you my father.

334
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,160
Follow my finger. Up.

335
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:36,002
Okay. Good.

336
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:38,068
Let me know
if you can feel this, okay?

337
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,549
Yeah, I'm not enjoying that.

338
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:44,305
Good. That's a good sign.

339
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:46,216
It means I'm not paralyzed?

340
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,699
Well, the M.R.I. will show us
the full extent of the injuries.

341
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:49,820
But, uh...

342
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,163
can we ask you
what happened up there?

343
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:58,910
It was my fault.

344
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,669
- Dale--
- It wasn't your fault.

345
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:03,434
60 ways to get up Mount Rainier,
and I had to pick Liberty Ridge.

346
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:04,955
It wasn't the route.

347
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,340
It was the storm.

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,564
On a clear day,
you don't think about storms.

349
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,153
A minute later, the wind's pasting you
to the side of the mountain,

350
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:14,989
and you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

351
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:17,017
Is that why you fell,
because of the storm?

352
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,954
All I know is I felt the rope tug,
and...

353
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,602
- I was in midair.
- We all were.

354
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:26,909
We were tied together.

355
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,299
Must have been a 100-foot drop.

356
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,879
And when we came to,
Lonnie wasn't moving.

357
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,236
Lonnie?
He's your friend who's still missing?

358
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,268
Well, this Lonnie,
is that why he didn't make it back,

359
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,573
because he was hurt?

360
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,736
Because he was dead.

361
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:43,365
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,547
We had to leave him.

363
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:49,421
We had to get to the other side of
the mountain, or we'd be dead, too.

364
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,729
We had no choice.

365
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:53,461
You always have a choice.

366
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,436
You never leave a man behind.

367
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,677
Please take your seats,
doctors,

368
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:04,447
and put all study materials away.

369
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:07,435
Okay, if you don't know the answer,
choose "B." It's always "B."

370
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:10,919
And write your name in the upper
right-hand corner of your answer sheets.

371
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,763
You may open your test booklets...

372
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,023
Now.

373
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:26,943
W-we don't have to be here
if you're uncomfortable.

374
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:30,326
Oh, no, it's fine.
Unless you're uncomfortable.

375
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,748
- Actually, uh, I-I--
- He's fine.

376
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,195
So, Rina, how are you feeling?
Any problems?

377
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,442
Just the fact that I'm huge,

378
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,625
and I have, like, the worst heartburn
I've ever had in my life.

379
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:42,418
I can prescribe an antacid for that.

380
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,582
The first thing we're gonna do
is take a look at the baby.

381
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,395
This might be a little cold.

382
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,927
This baby deserves parents
who are gonna make it

383
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,289
their whole world, you know?

384
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,681
You know we're gay, right?

385
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,156
I figured, with you both
being boys and everything.

386
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,839
The other couple I'm considering,

387
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,196
they're, like, oh, 40.

388
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,672
She's been trying
to get pregnant for ten years.

389
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,212
It's so sad.

390
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,202
There's the heartbeat.

391
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,710
Oh, my god.

392
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,991
There's, like,
a person inside of me.

393
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:20,207
Actually... there are two people.

394
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,881
Twins.

395
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:24,097
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

396
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,111
Oh, my god.
I think I'm gonna pass out.

397
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,155
Doctors, we are halfway
through our allotted time.

398
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,248
You only have 60 minutes left
to complete the exam.

399
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,599
She didn't write anything on the test.

400
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,280
She didn't answer a single question.
She just sat there.

401
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,263
Wait, George, just--

402
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:30,498
Just give her a second.

403
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:34,578
I've got an extensive
antero-lateral flail chest.

404
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:36,289
He'll need surgical stabilization.

405
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,061
Dr. Torres, if you're available--

406
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,014
She's not.
My guy has bone fragments

407
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,967
in his spinal cord,
internal fixation.

408
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:43,662
Dr. Torres is gonna scrub in
with me.

409
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:46,342
Uh, we have more than one
orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.

410
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,818
And you'll need 'em,
because Dr. Torres and I are looking

411
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,208
at possible multiple amputations.

412
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,743
Guys, I can be there for all of you.
We just have to figure it out.

413
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:53,898
Dr. Burke asked first.

414
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,945
- Well, I mean, with all due respect--
- okay, you all want Torres. Fine.

415
00:19:58,225 --> 00:19:59,502
Rock, paper, scissors.

416
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,332
One, two, three.

417
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,023
All rocks. Very typical.
Ready?

418
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:05,159
And...

419
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,079
Rock smashes scissors.

420
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,562
- See you in the O.R.
- Best two out of three.

421
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:10,670
Dr. Burke!

422
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:16,312
What?

423
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,312
I just wanted to know
how it feels...

424
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:20,877
to not have to spend
the next 24 hours

425
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,356
wondering if Richard picked you
to be chief resident.

426
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,787
How's it feel to be the chosen one?

427
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,201
Feels just fine.

428
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,015
How'd it go?

429
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,043
Meredith.

430
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,090
Don't worry. I've got it.

431
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:49,741
It's not like
she actually flunked.

432
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,645
She-- She just
didn't write anything.

433
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:53,715
It's kinda like
she actually flunked.

434
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,017
One guy two years ago,

435
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,846
he was on call three nights
before his test.

436
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,607
He slept through the whole thing.
He had to repeat his intern year.

437
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:02,509
She can't repeat her intern year.

438
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,965
It's pathetic.
We have to do something.

439
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,040
Cristina.

440
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:08,084
What? Okay, I don't know.

441
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,516
Mredith and I don't fail things.
This is not in my book.

442
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,730
It's Bailey. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

443
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,171
- We can't just leave her here.
- You got a better idea?

444
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:31,918
Okay, it's showtime, people.

445
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,617
Yang,
you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.

446
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,681
Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.

447
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:41,147
- You paged me, too.
- Mercy West.

448
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:42,483
Callie told you.

449
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,088
You're in the best surgical program
in the country,

450
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:49,354
the toughest, most competitive
most respected.

451
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:51,955
You want to leave
this for Mercy West?

452
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,696
- Mercy west--
- Is not Seattle Grace.

453
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,104
Are you trying to...

454
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:57,964
After all the work
that we've put into you,

455
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,831
are you trying to throw
your career away?

456
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,296
I'm trying to...

457
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,474
do what's best for me right now.
I've had some personal issues.

458
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:07,344
I-I don't know what your personal
problems are, and I don't care.

459
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,212
I do care about your career,
so let me make myself clear.

460
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,213
This is a mistake.

461
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,293
It's like we're on a train
that's going 200 miles an hour,

462
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,657
and it would just be
so nice to get off,

463
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,977
and just...

464
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:51,202
stand on the platform
just for a minute.

465
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,549
Looks like I'm off the train.

466
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,357
Our parents died.

467
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,863
When a parent dies,
it doesn't make any sense.

468
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,884
So you make...

469
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:12,066
a lot of really terrible decisions...

470
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,716
that you're gonna end up having
to live with for a long time.

471
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:24,272
You should go.
You are still on the train.

472
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,607
It's okay.
You have to go.

473
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,341
Go.

474
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:43,782
Go. Go, go.

475
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,011
Addison.

476
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,356
Adele.

477
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,957
What are you doing here?
What happened?

478
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,947
A fender bender. I'm fine.

479
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,604
I told the E.R. resident I'm fine,
but...

480
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,229
All right, I'm gonna page Richard.
I'll let him know you're here.

481
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,255
Oh, you will do no such thing,
Addison.

482
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:13,992
Richard cannot know I'm here.

483
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,181
We're separated.

484
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:17,823
My life is none of his business.

485
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,011
I'm serious.

486
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,702
Uh, all right. Well...

487
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,339
let's get you checked out.

488
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:30,818
Do you have any, um,
any pain, any...

489
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,203
anything?

490
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,466
Well...

491
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,367
there's one thing
I should probably mention.

492
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:39,646
I'm pregnant.

493
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,328
The baby looks fine on the ultrasound
but you are spotting a little.

494
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,650
It's nothing severe,

495
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,851
but I would like to hold you
overnight for observation.

496
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,137
Overnight? Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

497
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,293
- But--
- For just a couple of hours at least.

498
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:01,551
Look, it could be nothing.

499
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,414
But a pregnancy at your age is--

500
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,203
Terrifying? Embarrassing?

501
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:09,228
I was going to say a miracle.

502
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:12,326
I don't know. I resigned myself
to the fact a long time ago

503
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:13,935
that I would never have kids,
and...

504
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:17,703
here I am, 52,
about to be divorced and...

505
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:19,228
pregnant.

506
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,271
May I ask who... the father is?

507
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:25,638
You may ask.

508
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,186
Look, all I'm saying...

509
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:30,481
is that if Richard finds out that
you're walking around this hospital

510
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,554
carrying another man's baby...

511
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,610
Richard is not going to find out

512
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:38,122
because neither one of us
are going to tell him.

513
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,304
- Chief.
- Addison.

514
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:49,653
I just heard the news.

515
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,108
You-- You heard?

516
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:54,069
Who told you?
What-- What did you hear?

517
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,313
That Joe and Walter are adopting.

518
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:58,557
Is the birth mom here?
I'd love to put in a good word.

519
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:01,515
Chief, you don't want to go in there.

520
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:02,658
It's a young girl...

521
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,634
in the stirrups, you know,

522
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,779
her equipment exposed, right?

523
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,315
You don't want to see that.

524
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,940
No, I-I don't want to see that.

525
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,272
Are you going to give me
an inspirational speech, too?

526
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,535
I can't talk.
I have a patient to prep.

527
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,223
This isn't about you and me.
This is about Meredith.

528
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,260
- What are we gonna do?
- There's nothing to do.

529
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,380
What?

530
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,874
I'm not even gonna be
here in a week, so...

531
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,231
So your transferring
to another hospital

532
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,993
means we're not gonna be
friends anymore?

533
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,904
Why are you doing this, George?

534
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:53,597
Didn't you hear a word
of what Bailey said?

535
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:54,940
<i>What were we supposed to do,</i>

536
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:57,227
<i>carry him down the mountain?</i>

537
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,520
<i>He was our friend,
and we left him there.</i>

538
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,274
If we hadn't, we'd be dead, too.

539
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:02,916
You know that.

540
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,619
Dale was right.

541
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:09,378
<i>You don't--
You don't do that.</i>

542
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:11,834
<i>You don't...</i>

543
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,134
<i>climb all the way up there together
just to leave a man behind.</i>

544
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:20,210
I am being stalked by pregnant women.

545
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,365
You're an obstetrician.

546
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:23,947
And barren.
You know, apparently as a healthy,

547
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:26,975
successful woman in her 30s,
I don't deserve to have a baby.

548
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:29,415
Maybe I'd have a fighting chance
if were gay,

549
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,932
or a teenager
or a member of the A.A.R.P.

550
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:35,448
Oh, that sucks.

551
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,298
It really...

552
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:44,100
No, no, not you, too.

553
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,222
Oh, no, no, I'm not. I'm just--
I'm thinking about it.

554
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,678
That's all.

555
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,275
Oh, I don't know.

556
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,260
I don't even know.
It's just that with George...

557
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,613
- going to Mercy West next year...
- He is?

558
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:59,644
Yeah, they have a spot for him,
and we need a fresh start.

559
00:27:59,663 --> 00:28:01,686
We need to get away
from all this crap.

560
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:02,869
It might be a good time.

561
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,364
It's a great time.

562
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,922
Don't let me and my fossilized eggs
discourage you.

563
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:13,424
Are we gonna be friends still
if I get pregnant?

564
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,710
Absolutely not.

565
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,998
- Hi, chief.
- O'Malley.

566
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:29,614
Finally coming to see me
about that letter from Mercy West?

567
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:31,566
No, sir.

568
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:33,551
I'm here about Meredith.

569
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:39,204
I have to say, I don't get it.

570
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,851
Why would anybody
waste their time freezing

571
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,106
and climbing up
the side of a glacier?

572
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:48,285
It's a way to test yourself, you know,
your strength and endurance.

573
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,669
You put yourself through
a situation like that,

574
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:52,622
and you know exactly
who you are,

575
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:54,175
what you made of.

576
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:55,982
Have you done it before,
Dr. Burke?

577
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,251
No. You?

578
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,246
I used to, all the time,
in college.

579
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,608
- Really?
- Really?

580
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,615
Yeah, it's, intense.

581
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,577
I mean, it's painful and hellish,

582
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:08,502
and you think your lungs
are shredding, but...

583
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,567
Man, when you get to the top,
there is nothing like it.

584
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,341
Makes the whole climb worth it.

585
00:29:27,218 --> 00:29:28,260
How's it going?

586
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,157
Worse than I thought.
There's nothing here.

587
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,615
We're gonna amputate both?

588
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,090
You can't amputate
both of his hands.

589
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,573
I-Isn't the left hand less damaged?

590
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:36,692
I don't want to take
the man's hands, Dr. Stevens.

591
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,075
Once the infection gets that deep,

592
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:40,133
the only way to save his life
is to make the cut.

593
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:46,561
The patient's laminotomy happens
at what level, Dr. O'malley?

594
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:49,701
The level of maximal neural
compressions between

595
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,617
the pedicles
of the fractured vertebrae.

596
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:52,790
Very good.

597
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,621
You must have aced
your exam today.

598
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,779
I don't know about aced.

599
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,436
How did Meredith do?

600
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:01,069
Yeah, she was kinda...

601
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:03,492
Don't worry, though.
I talked to the chief.

602
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,288
About what?

603
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:07,640
She didn't tell you?

604
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,247
All right, here's the thing--

605
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:17,810
The Seattle police department's
been on this for weeks.

606
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,785
They've been in contact with
missing persons from all 50 states...

607
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:22,329
Canada, the FBI--

608
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,616
You know how many people
are trying to find you?

609
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:26,268
- Yeah, yes.
- That's right. You do know.

610
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:28,343
You know exactly
how many relatives you have.

611
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,921
You know if your parents
are dead or alive.

612
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,471
You know if you've got a sister
somewhere who cries every day because

613
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,068
- she has no idea what happened to you.
- Stop it!

614
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,431
What do you think
it's like for your husband?

615
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,917
He didn't come looking for me, okay?

616
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,960
He obviously
doesn't want to find me.

617
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:43,604
- Besides,it's my life.
- No, not just yours.

618
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,081
What about your daughter?

619
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,522
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna lie for you.

620
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,964
If you're not gonna tell anybody,
I will.

621
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,119
What are you gonna say?

622
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,281
You don't know my real name.

623
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:53,047
You don't know anything about me.

624
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:55,620
It'll be my word against yours.

625
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,341
You're right. I have absolutely
no idea who you are.

626
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,474
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

627
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,211
I think I figured out
a way to help Meredith.

628
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,332
But I've got shepherd's post-op,
and...

629
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,267
I can't do it without your help.

630
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,729
And I won't leave
the program without...

631
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,297
knowing that she's still in it.

632
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,228
You're not leaving the program.

633
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:30,223
Listen... we made a mistake.

634
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,924
We had sex.

635
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:34,281
But that's all it was.

636
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:37,794
I think we both wanted it
to mean something because...

637
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,322
you didn't want to have to feel like
that guy that cheats on his wife,

638
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,768
I didn't want to have
to feel like that girl

639
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,177
who put you in that position
in the first place.

640
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,522
But the truth is...

641
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,348
It didn't mean anything.

642
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,101
I know you think
I have feelings for you,

643
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,073
but I don't.

644
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,101
So you can stay.

645
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,898
You're not leaving the program.

646
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:35,412
Nice work today Torres...
Three surgeries at the same time.

647
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:38,539
I performed four osteosyntheses,
amputated two hands

648
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:41,742
and stabilized
one spine in two hours.

649
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:42,926
Impressive.

650
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,296
Looks like Bailey's not
a shoo-in for chief resident after all.

651
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:53,504
Uh, you're in the running
for chief resident, too?

652
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:57,739
Why wouldn't I be?

653
00:32:58,152 --> 00:33:00,190
No. Uh, it makes sense.

654
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,678
I just... I hadn't thought about it.
That's all.

655
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:05,995
I'm good at what I do, Bailey.

656
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:08,729
I'm focused,
I'm disciplined, I'm--

657
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,441
I'm more than qualified
to be chief resident.

658
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,666
Look, we all know
that you're the chief's favorite,

659
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:18,340
but that doesn't mean
I can't take a shot.

660
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:23,466
Here she is.

661
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,480
Thank you, Stevens.
You can go now.

662
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,082
We'll be waiting right outside.

663
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:29,837
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

664
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:38,820
If you called me here
to lecture me--

665
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,487
There's a copy of
the intern's exam on the table,

666
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:44,196
some number 2 pencils,
a bottle of water

667
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:45,815
and a sandwich if you get hungry.

668
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,564
I'll send a proctor in,
and I'll come back

669
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:50,019
in a few hours and check on you.

670
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:55,227
You are not my father.

671
00:33:58,112 --> 00:33:59,229
I know that.

672
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,034
I know.

673
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,987
Well, at least test day
is almost over.

674
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:50,921
Speak for yourself.

675
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,020
I'm getting married tomorrow.

676
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:10,743
This is what you invited me to?

677
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:12,589
This is your big bachelor party?

678
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,569
It was last-minute.
I needed some warm bodies.

679
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,507
Which would explain
why I'm here.

680
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,623
Why am I the only girl,
by the way?

681
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,567
What am I, the entertainment?
I am not stripping.

682
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:22,238
That's okay.
We've seen it already.

683
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,928
- True.
- I haven't.

684
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:28,401
Yeah, well, why don't I buy you
a drink instead?

685
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:29,969
First round's on me.

686
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:31,669
I'll give you a hand with those.

687
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:35,898
Cristina write her vows?

688
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:37,890
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

689
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:41,020
How's Meredith doing?

690
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,540
I have no idea.

691
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:46,074
Shouldn't be this difficult,
should it?

692
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,365
Probably not.

693
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:50,768
Then again...

694
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:53,894
when I see Cristina walking down
that aisle tomorrow...

695
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,209
It'll all be worth it?

696
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:10,930
So how was L.A.?

697
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:15,723
L.A. was... different.

698
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,623
Look, Mark...

699
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,393
Things don't have to be
awkward between us.

700
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:28,074
We tried.

701
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:29,912
We tried, and we did our best

702
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:32,785
and just because we failed
as a couple, it doesn't mean--

703
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:33,951
I know.

704
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,275
So we're still friends?

705
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:41,867
With benefits?

706
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,089
Don't push it.

707
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:48,673
Thanks, Joe.

708
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:52,279
So hey, how'd it go with Rina?

709
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,697
Oh, well... Walter took her
to the bus station,

710
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:58,713
and I'm pretty sure he was wishing
it was me he was dropping off.

711
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:00,121
That bad, huh?

712
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:01,971
If I can't even make it
through an ultrasound

713
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,605
without breathing
into a paper bag,

714
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,077
how am I gonna handle a kid?

715
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:06,542
Forget about twins.

716
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:09,705
You two are gonna make
great parents, okay?

717
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,128
Whenever that happens.

718
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,879
You... ever think
about having kids?

719
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:16,829
All the time.

720
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:26,188
Adele?

721
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,370
Oh, come on.
I know you saw me.

722
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:38,430
Now this is just silly.

723
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,345
You don't have to hide.

724
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:43,632
I've moved on.

725
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:46,468
I'm dating now.

726
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,753
Okay, I'm not actually dating,

727
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,481
but I intend to...

728
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:53,988
at some point.

729
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:58,827
What the hell am I supposed to do
about the stupid vows?

730
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:00,160
You still haven't written anything?

731
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,076
- Well, it's stupid crap.
- No, it isn't.

732
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:03,386
Well, what am I supposed to say?

733
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:06,325
I swear to love and cherish you every
moment of every day of my life?

734
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:08,895
I mean, that's not real.
That's not how it works, right?

735
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,763
It does, at first...

736
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:12,885
- but then it...
- It passes.

737
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,200
No, it doesn't.

738
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,048
You guys are just used to it.
That's all. You already have it.

739
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,368
You have that thing
everybody else wants.

740
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:20,933
You can take it for granted.

741
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:22,812
But let me tell you,
if you didn't, if you couldn't...

742
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,042
be with the person
that you love,

743
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,370
I guarantee that...

744
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:28,177
hearing him promise
to love you and...

745
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,135
honor you and cherish you,

746
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:34,472
no matter what, it would be
pretty much all you could think about.

747
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,053
Wait, can you say that again,
just slowly?

748
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,578
You're talking about Denny,
right?

749
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:51,675
Yeah.

750
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:14,779
Hi.

751
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,169
Hi.

752
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,431
Can I buy you a drink?

753
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,612
Wow, you're forward.

754
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,283
Bad day.

755
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:25,832
I get to be forward today.

756
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,142
Yeah, I had a bad day, too.

757
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:32,648
So what do you say, one drink?

758
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,493
I'm with some friends.
It's a bachelor party. So...

759
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:39,991
I'm gonna...

760
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,728
I'm gonna say no.

761
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,660
That's too bad.

762
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,612
Maybe you're right.

763
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,602
Rebecca Pope.

764
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:33,274
That's my name.

765
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,687
Adele, come on.

766
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,481
Now you've got me
in this ladies' room.

767
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:52,760
The least you could do is an--

768
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,628
Oh, my god. Adele.

769
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,936
- What are you doing here?
- Sweetie, get Rina some water.

770
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:05,857
I thought you guys were
going to the bus station.

771
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:07,937
- We were.
- It's this heartburn.

772
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:10,255
It's like it's--
It's ripping through...

773
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:14,349
Call an ambulance.

774
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,575
Tucker, uh, since he's awake,
can you put him on?

775
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,815
Let me call you back.

776
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,394
Nicole, what have you got?

777
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:29,187
We got the fourth climber.
Pressure's 70s, last pulse 135.

778
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:31,984
Severely hypothermic.
Started two large-bore I.V.S.

779
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:34,218
Oh, and, uh, obvious head trauma.

780
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:38,576
Is that an ax in his head?

781
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:42,805
What the hell happened up
on that mountain?

782
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:43,993
Let's go!

783
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:49,842
Somebody help me!
Please!

784
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:56,713
Somebody help!

785
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,393
Please, somebody help me!

786
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:06,126
