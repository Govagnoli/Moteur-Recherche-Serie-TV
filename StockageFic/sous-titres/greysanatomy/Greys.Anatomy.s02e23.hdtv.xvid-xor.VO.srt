you brought the baby to work? i'm covered in mommy.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,600
but that does not mean i will be mommy-tracked.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,000
(alex) you're his doctor, izzie.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
he's your half-dead, possibly soon-to-be all-dead patient.

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
(cristina) you should see them togetr.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,700
they're, like, doing things like running and cooking and talking.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,700
it's like they're bonding.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,200
george o'malley is sweet and kind. you live here?

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,700
i'm not crazy or anything.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,900
i just spend so much time here in the hospital.

we used to be really good at this, didn't we?

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,500
we're gonna do this until we get it right.

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500

yeah. no, i'm here.

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,300

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,000
hey, dr. dan--dr. dandridge... come on.

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,100
we're gonna have to call you back

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,600
'cause we're trying really hard to have some decent sex here.

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
what? what is so funny (derek laughs)

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100

 <i>where everything feels like</i>  <i>a sacrife.</i>

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,000
everything okay?

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
yeah. everything's great.

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,100
hey, doc. you look good.

53
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
he looks good. it may just be a virus,

54
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
but i'd like to wait till we get the blood tests

55
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,400
and the x-ray work back before i say anything for sure.

56
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,800
so he can go home today? 'cause derek says he can pick him up.

57
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,500
he can go home. you hear that, doc?

58
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,900
you can go home. (doc pants)

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
so you and derek, uh...

60
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,100
you're together?

61
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
uh...

62
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,600
uh, derek and i are, um, just friends.

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,500
he's married, and i'm knitting a sweater.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,500
and, uh, well, i guess i'm rambling,

65
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
which i tend to do a lot of lately,

66
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,600
and i wish somebody would just tell me to shut up.

67
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,200
but my point is,

68
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,700
yeah, we're--we're, uh,

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
he's married, and i'm knitting a sweater.

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,600
so you're single? single?

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,200
i ask because i was wondering

72
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
if you would like to go out with me. out, with you?

73
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,400
on a date, tonight?

74
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,800
date, tonight?

75
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,800
and you're repeating everything i say

76
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
so that you can buy yourself some time

77
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,000
and figure out a way to let me down easy.

78
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,399
it's okay. i get it.

79
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
no, no, no. i-i-i, uh...

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
you know, you're very... it's just that, if i were,

81
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,100
you would...

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,500
not dating.

83
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
 <i>and then there are</i>  <i>the sacrifices</i>

84
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,800
 <i>that</i> you <i>can't even</i>  <i>figure out why you're making.</i>

85
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,999
another day...

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,399
and once again, i don't see my name on the board.

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,300
chief, any reason my name isn't on the board?

88
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,100
uh...

89
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
slow day.

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
he just patted me on the back.

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
tell me, when did i become a person

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,900
who gets patted on the back?

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
you think he's mommy-tracking you?

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,900
well, what have you heard?

95
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,600
how about you handle denny duquette for me today?

96
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
absolutely. thank you, dr. burke.

97
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,110
i brought your coffee

98
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,500
oh, thanks. very thoughtful.

99
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,600
what?

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
oh, nothing. i'm just dragging a little.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
i only did 2 miles this morning.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
o'malley and i were up to 6. we pushed each other.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
ah, you're missing george.

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
no. no, of course not. drink your coffee.

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,700
oh, that's all right. actually, i'm waiting on--

106
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,200
oh, cappuccino. hey, o'malley.

107
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,400
big news-- gene foote is here.

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,100
he's having problems with his pacemaker.

109
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,900
eugene foote is here? here in this hospital? uh-huh.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
who is eugene foote?

111
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
genius violinist. burke's hero.

112
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,499
burke flew down to san francisco last year

113
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,599
to put in his pacemaker.

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,499
burke has, like, 40 of his albums. no, 42.

115
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,700
actually 43 because you just got the greatest hits on dvd. oh, right, right.

116
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,100
yeah.

117
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
you want in on foote? yes.

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,999
but i'm on neuro today with dr. shepherd.

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
oh, okay.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,500
eugene... (hums)

121
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
i want in. hello? i want in.

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
hmm. oh, sure. yeah, right.

123
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
(sighs) burke, um,

124
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,399
i laid on top of you naked last night,

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,100
so why don't you wax nostalgic about that?

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
obviously, i can't go out with him, right?

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,900
do i look like a chick to you?

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,399
do i look like i care about

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
yeast cream or tingling feelings?

130
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
i mean, he's not in jail or on drugs

131
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,500
or keeping body rts in his basement.

132
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,100
you want to do him, do him. not "do him," date him.

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,199
i'm not doing anybody. i'm knitting.

134
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and i need eugene foote's chart.

135
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,400
oh. who are we talking about? it's weird, right?

136
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,400
i mean, he's derek's vet, he's doc's vet, he's my vet.

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
he's mcvet.

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,300
it's weird to date him, right?

139
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
wait, did you say "vet"? mm-hmm.

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
like animals?

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,100
oh, you can't date a vet. he's not even a real doctor.

142
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,500
damn it!

143
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
(muttering) sex... hot sex...

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,800
i need that. ha ha, very funny.

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
must not have gone so well this morning

146
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
what?

147
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
just run if she looks at you.

148
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,500
i need an intern, now.

149
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
i'm with bailey. i'm with burke.

150
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,300
(sighs) karev.

151
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,500
i don't do vagina, not as a doctor anyway.

152
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
oh, back talk. you know what?

153
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,900
you just bought yourself a case.

154
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
how you feeling this morning, denny?

155
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,200
great.

156
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
i'd be even greater if you'd get me off this machine.

157
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
denny, you know i would,

158
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
but then your heart would stop beating,

159
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,900
and dr. burke would yell at me, and that would make

160
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,199
for a very bad day for both of us.

161
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
is he a candidate for the portable lvad?

162
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,300
now, see, that's what i'm talkin' about.

163
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,200
half the size, twice the fun.

164
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,900
(miranda) uh, you've been doing your research, huh? i have.h

165
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
i've already told him he's not ready for it yet.

166
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,400
dr. stevens, didn't i assign you to neuro this morning?

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,200
yeah. i was o-- i'm on my way.

168
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,500
but could you tell him about the complications?

169
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,300
you'd be risking air embolus, v-fib.

170
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
yeah, and the tubing could kink inside of your body,

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,800
in which case, we'd have to rush you to emergency surgery.

172
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,100
(miranda) dr. stevens, unless mr. duquette's heart

173
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,400
has suddenly grown a brain,

174
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,000
you are currently  <i>not</i> doing your job.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
i'm going. just don't be stupid, okay?

176
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,700
you're not the boss of me today, woman.

177
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,800
i want you to take it out.

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
take it out?

179
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
but, mr. foote, your heart function

180
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,600
has improved exponentially since we put the pacemaker in.

181
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,100
the setting is working well.

182
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
you know my music, dr. burke.

183
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,700
very well, sir. it anged my life.

184
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
well, your contraption has changed my heartbeat.

185
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
it changed my rhythm. i can't play.

186
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,700
and that's a sacrifice i am unwilling to make.

187
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,000
uh, but you'd be willing to sacrifice your life

188
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,599
for your music?

189
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
they're one and the same.

190
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,300
before we do anything drastic,

191
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,700
just let me try one more setting on the pacemaker.

192
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,000
one more setting, mr. foote.

193
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
please.

194
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
okay, sure.

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,900
hello, wards.

196
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,099
hey.

197
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,599
we're just waiting on your labs.

198
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,700
how are you feeling?

199
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,400
i'm feeling large. large and cow-like.

200
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,300
a cow? mommy is a cow

201
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,800
who needs a quiet talk with the doctor.

202
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,700
hey, guys, who wants ice cream?

203
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,100
(girl) i want chocolate.

204
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,700
(girl) do they have strawberry?

205
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,900
(alex) uh, c.b.c. and chem-7 look fine.

206
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,600
rose?

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
(sighs) sorry.

208
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
i'm so tired.

209
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
oh, rose, 6 kids, 38 weeks pregnant--

210
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,900
a saint would be tired.

211
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,300
well... i'm no saint.

212
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,900
this baby. joseph...

213
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,200
dr. shepherd, i need him to be my last.

214
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,900
and i really seem to be the most fertile woman

215
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,500
on the planet. well, if you're interested

216
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,300
in alternative forms of birth control, i-- no.

217
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,100
what i mean is...

218
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,100
today, during the c-section, i need you to tie my tubes.

219
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,400
and i need you to do it without my husband ever knowing.

220
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,199
www.1000fr.com

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,300
rose, you're an adult.

222
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,400
he's your husband, not your legal guardian

223
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,800
telling him would be entirely up to you.

224
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,000
well, if you charged my insurance, he would see it.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
any bill you sent, he would see it.

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
i've been saving for this, and i can pay you privately.

227
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
so you're saying you want me to do the surgery

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
and leave no record of it?

229
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,000
mrs. ward, if you're being abused,

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
there are people you can talk to.

231
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,600
oh, chris is-- he's the opposite of abusive.

232
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
so if we pull up your medical records,

233
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
we're not gonna find a bunch of old broken bones or--

234
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
if you pull up my medical records,

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
you'll find three natural child births,

236
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,800
three c-sections, two hospital stays for exhaustion

237
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,300
and one for dehydration

238
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,200
because i was so busy chasing my kids around
???????????????????

239
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,300
i think god understands what i'm going through.

240
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
and i think god will forgive me.

241
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,000
but chris--for him,

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
religion isn't like a buffet table,

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
where you get to chose what you want to take and leave the rest.

244
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,700
and the pope says no to birth control.

245
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,900
so... i need your help.

246
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
you don't need our help.

247
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,199
your husband is not abusing you, and you don't get to lie to him

248
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
and blame it on the pope.

249
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
dr. karev-v--

250
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
no offense, but i have no interest in obstetrics

251
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
or gynecology, dr. shepherd,

252
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
so if you want to throw me off the case, feel free.

253
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
dr. karev, i may be a board certified o.b.g.y.n.,

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,200
but i also have fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine

255
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
and medical genetics,

256
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,300
and i am one of the foremost neonatal surgeons

257
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,499
in this country.

258
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,700
when you can top that, you can mouth off.

259
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,999
until then, you will do your job,

260
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and you will do it right, whh at this point in time

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
means you keep your mouth shut

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,300
unless i give you permission to open it.

263
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
understood?

264
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
understood? oh, are you giving me permission now?

265
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
good morning, ms. graber.

266
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,399
oh, really? "good morning"?

267
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
mm-hmm. you haven't let me sleep in three nights.

268
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,299
and this ridiculous hat is destroying my self-esteem,

269
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,700
and i still haven't had a seizure.

270
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,499
but, okay, sure. we'll go with "good morning"

271
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,100
if it makes you feel better about yourself. 
ms. graber is here brain mapping dr stevens?

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,400
brain mapping--it's where you locate the area of the brain

273
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,900
where the seizures originate and surgically remove it

274
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,399
with minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. (derek) excellent.

275
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,900
excellent except for the fact that it's not working,

276
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,100
and i am losing billable hours.

277
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,900
unless any of you are looking to get out of a bad marriage.

278
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,100
no. no.

279
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,700
dr. shepherd? yes. no. i'm fine, thank you.

280
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,999
really? yes.

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
'cause i'm an excellent divorce attorney. i'm sure you are.

282
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and there was a look, you know, between these two.

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
a look?

284
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
no. no.

285
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,700
what is it, you married young

286
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,600
and now you have nothing in common?

287
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
oh, no, don't tell me. i know.

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,300
the conversation is still good, but the sex has gone to pot?

289
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,599
makeher seize? how do we make someone have a seizure?

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,300
do your research, get creative.

291
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
but if all the normal methods have failed,

292
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,699
then what are we supposed to do?

293
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,200
use a strobe light, get her drunk,

294
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,900
hang her from the ceiling upside down and hit her

295
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,699
with a wiffle ball bat for all i care, okay?

296
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,299
just make her seize, because until she seizes,

297
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,849
i don't know where to operate, and if i don't know

298
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,049
where to operate, i can't get this woman out of my life,

299
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,250
and this woman is not how i like to start my mornings.

300
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,250
i'm just curious, george.

301
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,250
curious george. (laughs)

302
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,850
get it?

303
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,250
never mind. all i'm asking ishere you live.

304
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,149
listen to this, there's an old-school arcade game

305
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,750
that's been known to induce seizures

306
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,950
if you reach level 53. our divorce lawyer

307
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,450
is so not playing an arcade game for 53 levels.

308
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,050
oh, george, by the way, um, where do you live?

309
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,550
i'm busy doctoring, dr. stevens. no time for chitchat.

310
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,550
morning, dr. o'malley.

311
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,050
uh, morning, dr. torres.

312
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,350
so guess what.

313
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,250
figures. mm-hmm.

314
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,850
dr. o'malley, how's all that doctoring going?

315
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,050
you tell me.

316
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,750
it's an honor to hear you play.

317
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,650
too good a man to lie.

318
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,550
i'll read your mind.

319
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,050
his timing is off, his rhythm is off.

320
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,650
this man has no business calling himself eugene foote.

321
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,950
you understand, sir, that in the months

322
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,250
since the initial surgery,

323
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,750
scar tissue has formed around the pacemaker?

324
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,000
removing it is not nearly as simple as it sounds.

325
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,950
i picked up the violin at 6 years old.

326
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,950
it was in my grandfather's attic.

327
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,250
i didn't even know what it was.

328
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,450
but i remember picking it up...

329
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,650
that moment.

330
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,650
i remember putting the bow to the strings

331
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,650
and pulling.

332
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,650
just that.

333
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,249
just that screechy little chirp,

334
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,750
and that was it.

335
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,000
i was hooked.

336
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,650
you remember a moment like that in your life?

337
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,950
i know the sgery could kill me.

338
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,450
i also know you're the best,

339
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,450
which makes you my best shot at survival.

340
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,350
i'd like you to be the one to operate, dr. burke.

341
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,850
but if you won't...

342
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,550
i'll find someone who will.

343
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,100
he's right.

344
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,900
what, he can't play?

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,599
he can't play like eugene foote.

346
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,599
okay. so, uh, surgery?

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,599
he says he will go somewhere else if i refuse.

348
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,599
i might let him.

349
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,900
why?

350
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,699
oh, you can't let him go somewhere else.

351
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
what are you...

352
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,799
okay, what if it were you?

353
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
what if yocouldn't be a surgeon anymore?

354
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,000
or you could still be one, but--but not a great one?

355
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,899
just average.

356
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,099
he could get his surgery somewhere else,

357
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
but that surgeon might be average.

358
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,999
e.k.g., echo and nuclear all within normal limits.

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,500
well, denny, in that case,

360
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,009
????????

361
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,699
music to my ears, dr. bailey.

362
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,199
good. uh, so do you have any questions?

363
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,699
no, it's...

364
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,299
we could put it off.

365
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,299
no harm in waiting a few weeks

366
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,899
if you have questions, if you're worried.

367
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,199
i've got 20 tubes comin' out of my body,

368
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,499
one of which goes directly into my you know what.

369
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,399
at some point, i'd like to use that you know what

370
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,499
for something besides peeing into a bag.

371
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,799
like, for instance, peeing into a toilet.

372
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,100
it's just...

373
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,099
izzie gave me medical advice.

374
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,099
you're giving me different advice.

375
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
it just so happe that yours is the advice i want to hear.

376
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,499
well, dr. bailey outranks dr. stevens,

377
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,999
so it's safe to say

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,999
dr. bailey's advice is the one to follow.

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,799
that's not what he's worried about, dr. grey.

380
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,299
he's worried that dr. stevens might get her ego bruised

381
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,799
and her feelings hurt.

382
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,599
am i right?

383
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,899
no, no. definitely no.

384
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,299
because it would concern me

385
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,299
if you were making medical decisions

386
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,299
based on how our dr. stevens might feel about it.

387
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,799
well, in that case, i say we--we do this thing.

388
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,399
screw that dizzy blonde doctor girl.

389
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,299
that's not helping, denny. no?

390
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,899
no. no.

391
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,999
what's goin' on between stevens and denny?

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,999
is it a crush, is it an innocent flirtation,

393
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,399
or is stevens actually crossing the line?

394
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,499
i know she likes him. i can't imagine izzie would do that.

395
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,499
uh-huh. i couldn't imagine you and yang

396
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,199
would be stupid enough to fall for your attendings,

397
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,499
but i was wrong about that, wasn't i?

398
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,899
i'm knitting these days.

399
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,399
plus, i'm thinking about

400
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,399
accepting a date with a veterinarian.

401
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,899
grey, do you actually believe i care?

402
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,599
no.

403
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,500
good. maybe you're not so stupid after all.

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,299
all right, explain to me one more time

405
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,299
exactly what this is supposed to do?

406
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,299
having the tv this close makes the flickering

407
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,299
and flashing bigger and more intense,

408
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,799
which can cause seizures.

409
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
oh, well, normally, i don't have time to watch tv.

410
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,999
but this week i've discovered oprah.

411
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,999
you know, she's famous in my business for never marrying

412
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,099
that boyfriend of hers.

413
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
wise, wise woman.

414
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,999
so first you won't tell me where you live,

415
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,499
and now, i am on the outside

416
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,149
of your inside jokes with callie.

417
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,649
when did i end up on the outside, george? you're not on the outside.

418
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,949
okay, now you're lying to my face. 
you're being paranoid.

419
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,249
well, i'm not seizing,

420
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,249
but i am having an acid flashback.

421
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,450
does that count?

422
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,549
rose... seven kids...

423
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,049
it's a lot.

424
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,949
are you sure that chris isn't feeling the same way?

425
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,049
when we were first married, we were so broke

426
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,349
that i went on the pill for a while,

427
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,149
and chris stopped taking communion.

428
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,149
when he does that, he thinks he's-- he thinks he's going to hell.

429
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,349
he thinks you're both going to hell.

430
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,249
the reason we haven't had a baby in four years,

431
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,749
is because we abstained for three.

432
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,349
i mean, can you imagine nobeing able

433
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,250
to make love to your husband?

434
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,850
um...

435
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,549
the, uh, pill--

436
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,849
i can't hide the pill. he would find out.

437
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,449
if he found out, what, i mean, he won't divorce you,

438
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,949
he doesn't believe in it.

439
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,049
do you see the way he's looking at me right now?

440
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,549
dr. karev was just leaving.

441
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,349
no, no, no, no. just...

442
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,850
just look at him for a minute.

443
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,449
that look he has on his face,

444
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,349
that's how my husband would look at me

445
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,049
if he knew about any of this.

446
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,250
and i can't have my husband look at me like that.

447
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,750
and i can't have any more babies.

448
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,549
for the record...

449
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,849
i am on your side today.

450
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,549
george sucks.

451
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,999
mmm. burke doesn't think so. he's his new best friend.

452
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,799
i wonder if burke knows where he lives.

453
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,299
how's denny doing?

454
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,399
bailey's not caving in on the lvad thing, is she? about that...

455
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,799
?????when he said you dumped him for a heart patient.

456
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,299
did you really dump him for a heart patient? of course not.

457
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,299
'cause denny's a patient. we can't fall for our patients.

458
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,699
you're falling for a <i>vet.</i>

459
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,199
i'm considering the possibility

460
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,599
of maybe having a date with a vet.

461
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,499
that's all i'm saying.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,800
my point is, bailey's on the warpath about you and denny,

463
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,299
so just be careful.

464
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,799
(addison) how's your sponge count, dr. karev?

465
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,799
they're all accounted for, but i see a bleeder here.

466
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,200
it's small. get the bovie and cauterize it.

467
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,199
all right, got it.

468
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,699
that's good.

469
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,599
there's a little bleeding near the tube here.

470
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,300
can you hand me the bovie, dr. karev?

471
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,999
i don't see any abnormal bleeding.

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,899
are you the surgeon here?

473
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,999
no.

474
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,799
then give me the bovie.

475
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
give me the bovie, dr. karev.

476
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,100
hey there, joseph. welcome to the world.

477
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,099
rose, before we bring your family in to see you,

478
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,099
i wanted to let you know

479
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,300
that there was a complication with your surgery.

480
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,500
we had some unexpected bleeding that caused damage

481
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,700
to both fallopian tubes.

482
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,699
so you're saying...

483
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,300
you won't be able to have any more children.

484
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
thank you, dr. shepherd.

485
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,700
as i said, it was... a complication.

486
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,799
i understand.

487
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,699
a complication, that's what you're calling it?

488
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,299
that's what it was. rely?

489
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,299
'cause in that case, it's one of the most bizarre

490
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,200
obstetric complications in history.

491
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,300
she is a patient. our obligation is to her and her only.

492
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,199
hey.

493
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
well, hey.

494
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,599
uh, you picked up doc.

495
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,099
yeah. he's home.

496
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,099
he seems to be doing much better.

497
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
he seems to be doing good.

498
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,099
i'm not laughing at you.

499
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,099
no?

500
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,999
no, it's just, you know,

501
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,200
bad sex isn't really something that wives want announced

502
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,699
to the dirty ex-mistress.

503
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,299
you're not the dirty ex-mistress. you're a friend.

504
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,399
she's your friend. i'm your friend.

505
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,299
we're friends.

506
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
but you didn't tell her.

507
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,199
no.

508
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,699
(sighs) how's your day going?

509
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,699
great.

510
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,999
good.

511
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,399
the vet asked me if we--

512
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,299
what, what did he ask you?

513
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,799
if we were together.

514
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,799
uh-huh.

515
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,300
and i set him straight.

516
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,999
have a good day, meredith.

517
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
you, too, derek.

518
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,399
i am not drinking another shot of espresso.

519
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,399
i-i can't. i can't. you can. you can.

520
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
you're the best divorce attorney in seattle. (izzie) you're the best.

521
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,199
you can kick that espresso shot's ass. you can.

522
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,099
kick it. kick it.

523
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,599
kick it. yeah!

524
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,599
whoa, whoa, whoa! what?

525
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,599
okay, good, so, caffeine's for seizures.

526
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,099
what's the doughnuts for?

527
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,399
they are to absorb some of the coffee

528
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
so it doesn't' burn a hole through your stomach. good. okay. good idea.

529
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,799
oh.

530
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,699
do you know how long it has been

531
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,800
since i have had a doughnut? (laughs)

532
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,099
i really, really, really, really, really like doughnuts.

533
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,099
then why don't you eat them?

534
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,799
got to stay on top of my game.

535
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,899
no time for exercise, no carbs, no sugar.

536
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,799
can't have a sugar crash in court.

537
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,999
stupid court.

538
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
court is stupid because i love doughnuts!

539
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,900
you're making really good progress.

540
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,300
hey there, chief.

541
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,500
you here for my big moment?

542
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,310
?????

543
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,999
is there something i can do for you, chief?

544
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,499
his e.k.g.?

545
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,600
normal, as well as his echo and nuclear study.

546
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,399
mmmm. his perfusion? he's ready, chief.

547
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,499
looking' good. carry on.

548
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
thank you, sir.

549
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,699
die! die!

550
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,600
oh, yeah! next level. i'm at the next level.

551
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,199
god, this is exhilarating.

552
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,699
keep--keep going, keep going.

553
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,699
you only have 12 more levels before you reach

554
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,199
prime seizure potential.

555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,899
oh, this is fun. right? you know?

556
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,799
like fun that we had at home

557
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,199
back when you used to tell me things,

558
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,099
like where do you live?

559
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,399
don't start that again.

560
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,899
i'm not starting anything.

561
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,599
i'm just saying, there's fun to be had.

562
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,399
all the time, with me, your best friend.

563
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,899
it's not like we're in high school.

564
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,299
george, don't do the whispering under your breath thing.

565
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,699
if you've got something to say, just say it.

566
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,399
yeah, last time you gave me that advice,

567
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,499
it went really well. you're seriously pissed at me

568
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,049
because of what happened between you and meredith?

569
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,300
no. yeah.

570
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,499
oh.

571
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,799
(preston) he recorded this at the hollywood bowl

572
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,300
a couple of years ago.

573
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
it's nice.

574
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,300
it's not nice. it's brilliant.

575
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,199
excuse me.

576
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,899
you were one of my wife's doctors, weren't you?

577
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,899
rose ward. yes, sir, i was.

578
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,299
she just told me there was a complication

579
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,999
with her c-section.

580
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,999
i told you to tell her how you feel.

581
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,299
i <i>did not</i> tell you to jump into bed with her. adultery?

582
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,399
why did you send me in there?

583
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,099
was it to humiliate me? no.

584
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,399
i mean, if you knew that she didn't love me,

585
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,099
why? what kind of friend does that?

586
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,499
it's just-- it was shocking.

587
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,799
someone says there's a complication,

588
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,899
and everything changes.

589
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,099
(raspy breathing) i can't breathe.

590
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,999
are those batteries--

591
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,199
yes, they're charged. i checked them myself. he's having runs of v-tach.

592
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,099
(richard) could be an air embolism. (miranda) i got it.

593
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,099
(preston) damn it. we've got a tamponade.

594
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,599
b.p.'s not registering.

595
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,099
keep transfusing p.r.b.c.'s

596
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,099
he has a full ventricular perforation.

597
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,599
hand me a 2-0 prolene.

598
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,700
cristina... replace my hand with yours.

599
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,299
yes. and hold on for dear life.

600
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,199
you didn't want to hear it. yes, yes, i did.

601
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,199
oh, and some denial. i can work with that. you wanted to

602
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,799
you did not want to hear it.

603
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,599
should we intubate?

604
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,599
(richard) we can call respiratory to do it.

605
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,499
rose says it's a blessing.

606
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,899
it's god's will. maybe it is.

607
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,699
maybe it is. a blessing, i mean.

608
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,200
this "complication."

609
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,799
(cristina) his heart's not moving at all.

610
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,399
keep compressing as i was doing it.

611
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,599
there's no signs of life. blood pressure's nonexistent.

612
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,099
the tubing could be kinked.

613
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,499
we need to move him to the o.r., bailey. i've got this.

614
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,499
it doesn't look like you've got this. i've got this!

615
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,899
oh, my god! you knew the risk.

616
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,999
you knew she was in love with someone else. i'm gettin' an aura.

617
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,399
i'm not saying she wasn't wrong.

618
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,299
no! i am not saying that what she did wasn't wrong,

619
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,299
i am just saying you need to take a tiny piece of-- what, responsibility?

620
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,399
you are being ridiculous! she's seizing. go page shepherd!

621
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,999
this complication, it might be god's way of helping you

622
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,999
put your seven kids through college.

623
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
what are you saying? i'm saying get a lawyer.

624
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,500
time of death--1832.

625
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
everything looks good, denny

626
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,300
well, you gotta thank dr. bailey for me.

627
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
i mean, i already anked her once,

628
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,900
but this here deserves a double scoop.

629
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,300
i know i don't know you very well.

630
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
you want to talk to me about izzie.

631
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,200
yeah.

632
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
because you disapprove.

633
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
no.

634
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
this comes from nothing resembling a high horse.

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,800
high horses want nothing to do with me.

636
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,700
you know, this thing with you and izzie,

637
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
it's...

638
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,400
there are strict rules about doctors dating patients.

639
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
you know izzie pretty well, right?

640
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
you think if i went to her and i said,

641
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
"hey, you know, this is gonna be really bad for your career,

642
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
"and you probably shouldn't come around

643
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,900
to see me anymore,"

644
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,600
you--you think that'll have any effect at all?

645
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
the thing is...

646
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,600
i was healthy my whole life till i wasn't.

647
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,600
and for the last year, i've had a lot of time

648
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,300
to lay around in bed and think about my life.

649
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,100
and the things that i remember best...

650
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,100
well, those are the things that i wasn't supposed to do,

651
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,900
and i did 'em anyway.

652
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,800
so the thing is, meredith...

653
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,800
life is too damn short to be following all these rules.

654
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,100
may i ask

655
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,000
what motive you had for underming my authority

656
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,100
in front of my patient and my intern?

657
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,900
i'm not punishing you, dr. bailey. oh, but you are.

658
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,500
i had a baby, and so you are. yes, you had a baby.

659
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,999
and now you're sleep-deprived. every doctor in this hospital is sleep-deprived.

660
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,199
you just came back from maternity leave,

661
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
and i'm not convinced you're back on your game.

662
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,099
this is not a punishment

663
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,199
or a reflection on how highly i value you.

664
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,099
it's just the way it is. i'm sorry to interrupt, chief,

665
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,600
but that man over there is asking to talk to you.

666
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
excuse me.

667
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,200
we're closed.

668
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,500
hey.

669
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,600
i thought you were knitting a sweater.

670
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,100
i am. but i'm also dating.

671
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,100
you. if you still want to.

672
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,700
i should've call. you kno i was going to call--

673
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,200
no, no, uh...

674
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,500
don't call. never call.

675
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,400
always show up.

676
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
okay.

677
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,500
okay. but i can't tonight.

678
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
i've got an errand i have to run.

679
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,900
i run errands.

680
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,400
this shouldn't take too long,

681
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
and we can grab some dinner right after.

682
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,600
after?

683
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,000
after she gives birth.

684
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,699
you're birthing a horse?

685
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
yeah.

686
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,900
that was your errand? you're birthing a horse?

687
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,000
yeah.

688
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,900
i guess i-i could've ntioned it before,

689
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,900
but, you know, i didn't want to scare you back to your knitting.

690
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,900
she's getting anxious.

691
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,400
you can wait back here.

692
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
back here?

693
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,500
if you want. i mean, it's a little messy.

694
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,700
are you kidding? i want to birth a horse.

695
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,100
richard, we have to talk about alex karev.

696
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,300
i know he's talented, but his attitude,

697
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,800
in my opinion, has reached an unacceptable low.

698
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
addison...

699
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,400
you've got a bigger problem today

700
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,600
than alex karev.

701
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,800
mr. ward has been speaking with our attorney

702
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,300
regarding his wife's surgery.

703
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,500
now i read your chart.

704
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,800
i read the nurse's notes.

705
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,300
now can you explain to me what kind of complication

706
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,400
from a c-section leads to the severing

707
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,300
of both fallopian tubes?

708
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,500
well, the bad news is, you had a grand mal seizure.

709
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
the good news is, we mapped it, so now we can operate.

710
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,600
no. i've decided against surgery, dr. shepherd.

711
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,599
i'm sorry?

712
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,999
no offense. the risks of craniotomy--

713
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,900
when you describe them, they're not terribly appealing.

714
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,999
yes, there are risks.

715
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but you have to weigh those risks with the, uh,

716
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,499
detrimental effect your seizure disorder has on your life.

717
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,900
unless my life is having a detrimental effect

718
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,500
on my seizure disorder.

719
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,299
's like with you and your wife--

720
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,999
is the bad sex your biggest problem,

721
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,500
or are all the bigger problems causing the bad sex?

722
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,700
i'm, uh... oh. i'm not gonna answer that.

723
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
all right, my point is, i had more fun today

724
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
than i can remember.

725
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,000
i don't have any friends. i don't have any fun.

726
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
i only have work. work and seizures.

727
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,300
and it's no coincidence that when the work stopped,

728
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
the seizures stopped.

729
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,800
until these two started arguing.

730
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
right. i'm gonna talk to 'em about that. no, no, no.

731
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,300
watching people fight--ugh!

732
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
it's been my whole life for 15 years.

733
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,000
so i'm changing my life.

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
look, and if that doesn't work, i'll come back here

735
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,100
and let you cut open my brain, okay?

736
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,400
all right. fair enough.

737
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,100
it's pretty good, huh?

738
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,700
yeah, it's pretty good.

739
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,800
how are you feeling?

740
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,300
little sore.

741
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,000
well, that's to be expected.

742
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
i'm sorry i told chris abt the complication.

743
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
i just...

744
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,600
i just thought he should know that joseph would be our last

745
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,500
so he could savor it.

746
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,100
i didn't know he was gonna do this.

747
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
rose...

748
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,500
i need you to tell him that you asked me

749
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
to tie your tubes.

750
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,100
for you, it's just insurance,

751
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
and you don't even have to pay.

752
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
for me, it's my marriage.

753
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,400
it's my family.

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,900
it's my career, rose. it's my reputation.

755
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,400
you're the best.

756
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
people come from all over the country to see you.

757
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,700
that won't change.

758
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
i can't tell him.

759
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,500
dr. shepherd, i--

760
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
i'm so sorry

761
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,800
because i am so grateful to you.

762
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
but i can't tell him.

763
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,700
is it coming off?

764
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
not exactly.

765
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,299
i'm sorry.

766
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,200
oh, don't be. it was a great date.

767
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,000
technically, it wasn't the date. it was the errand.

768
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
now we could go up to my place, i could cook for you.

769
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,700
go up to your place?

770
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
do you want to come up to my place?

771
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
yeah. i mean, no.

772
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,600
no, i-i don't.

773
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,500
i-i do, but i don't.

774
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,199
you don't know?

775
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,800
no, i do. i mean, i-i know. no, i don't.

776
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,999
all right, well, here's the deal.

777
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,300
um, you have two options.

778
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,000
you could come up to my place, take off all your clothes,

779
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
shower off the goo, borrow one of my shirts,

780
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,500
and i'll cook you dinner-- that's door number one.

781
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,100
door number two-- you go home.

782
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,299
i-i think you oughta take door number one,

783
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,200
because, you know, it involves you naked in my apartment,

784
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,499
but, you kno that's just me.

785
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,299
i should point out that

786
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
there is absolutely nothing you could say

787
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,100
that would make me go upstairs with you.

788
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,100
i'm kind of offended

789
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,299
that you think that i would go upstairs with you.

790
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,900
and you should know that i... am celibate.

791
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
so-- shut up.

792
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,600
i absolutely cannot have...

793
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,900
sex with you.

794
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
if you choose door number one,

795
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,100
absolutely will not have sex with you.

796
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,900
you won't? i promise i won't.

797
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
i won't even try and kiss you. why not?

798
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,800
meredith. what?

799
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
choose door number one.

800
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600

806
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,900
okay.

807
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
hey, george.

808
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,500
i don't know much, but i do know fighting.

809
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
and people who fight like you and izzie,

810
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,800
those people love each other.

dr. karev...

818
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
you did such a good job today that...

819
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
i'm gonna talk to dr. bailey

820
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,700
and have you assned to my service.

821
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,000
what? for how long?

822
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,700
for as long as i want.

823
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
your ass is mine until i say otherwise.

824
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,600
congratulations.

825
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,600
you got it.

826
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,500
i did, indeed.

827
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
and you're okay?

828
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,500
are you kidding me? i'm great.

829
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,900
i mean, look at this--

830
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,200
some nice-sized batteries, colorful wires.

831
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
it's what your best-dressed lvad patients

832
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,300
are wearing these days, you know?

833
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
really?

834
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,300
'cause it seems so last fall.

835
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,600
you're tall.

836
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,000
i know.

837
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,200
 <i>too often, going after</i>  <i>what feels good</i>

838
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,500
 <i>means letting go</i>  <i>of what you know is right.</i>

839
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,800
you did everything you could.

840
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,700
there was an interview that eugene gave.

841
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,200
i saved it.

842
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,200
i taped it to my bathroom mirror.

843
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,700
he said that he wasn't the most talented student

844
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,200
at music school.

845
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,400
but he said what he lacked in natural ability,

846
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,800
he made up for in discipline.

847
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,400
he practiced...

848
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,450
all the time.

849
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,900
all the time, he practiced.

850
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,100
i wasn't like you.

851
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,100
i wasn't the most talented student in school.

852
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,000
i wasn't the brightest.

853
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
but i was the best.

854
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,600
you practiced.

855
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,100
i practiced.

856
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,000
 <i>and letting someone in</i>  <i>means abandoning the walls</i>

864
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
yeah.

871
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,700

872
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,000
okay, so, uh...

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000

883
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600

884
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,100

885
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,400

894
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
 <i>and not the other way around,</i>

895
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,500
 <i>that's when the sacrifice</i>

896
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,900
 <i>can turn out to be</i>  <i>more than we can bear.</i>
