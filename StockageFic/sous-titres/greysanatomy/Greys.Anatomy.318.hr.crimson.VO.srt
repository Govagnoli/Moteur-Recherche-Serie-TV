1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:02,257
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:04,454
I'm getting married to Burke.

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:08,529
I went to the board this morning
and told them I was retiring.

4
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,014
One of us could be chief.

5
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:12,301
We were here long before
you two started fooling around.

6
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:13,130
He is my husband.

7
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,605
Stop saying that like
it means something.

8
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,116
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant.

9
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:17,346
Found under a pile of rubble.

10
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:20,032
She can't remember anything
from before the accident.

11
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,661
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

12
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,412
My mother's dead, isn't she?

13
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:27,448
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,025
I-I tried.

15
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,283
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.

16
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:43,744
<i>People have scars in all sorts
of unexpected places,</i>

17
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:47,003
<i>like secret road maps
of their personal histories,</i>

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,139
<i>diagrams of all their old wounds.</i>

19
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,930
Alex! God.

20
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,719
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seen it all before.

21
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,597
What the hell are you doing here?

22
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,259
- Moving in.
- What?

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,407
<i>Most of our old wounds heal,
leaving nothing behind, but a scar.</i>

24
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,779
<i>But some of them don't.</i>

25
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,150
Alex is moving in?

26
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:07,464
To this house?

27
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,737
- He's taking George's room.
- Why?

28
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:11,202
I was asleep just a minute ago.

29
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:13,688
And I was naked in the bathroom
when Alex walked in.

30
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:15,610
Lucky I didn't come out
of the shower to find him peeing

31
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,185
- all over the seat.
- And we're up.

32
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:19,217
What's wrong with
where he was living before?

33
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:20,872
I don't know where
he was living before.

34
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,001
Probably a whorehouse.

35
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:25,019
I can't have him living in the room
right next door. It's weird.

36
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,497
People are what matters.

37
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,493
Alex is one of our people.
We can't leave him out of the cold.

38
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,345
"People are what matters"?
You don't like people.

39
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,551
Is this about your mother?

40
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,178
No. I had a near death whatever, and...

41
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:35,856
I was dead.

42
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,527
And now I'm not, so...

43
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,691
I'd like to use this chance
I've been given

44
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:40,856
to be more positive.

45
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,499
People are what matters.

46
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,264
Paint with all the colors of the wind.

47
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,212
You're crazy now.

48
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,541
- I'm alive.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,114
No, no.
Um, I'm not done in there yet.

50
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,393
Oh, don't worry.
Not looking, not interested.

51
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,891
<i>Some wounds we carry
with us everywhere,</i>

52
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:02,938
<i>and though the cut's long gone...</i>

53
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,238
No, she's selfish, is Izzie's problem.

54
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:07,164
<i>The pain still lingers.</i>

55
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,286
She's not selfish.
She's generous. But...

56
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,446
She-She's self-absorbed.

57
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,685
I mean,

58
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,945
her problem is that she doesn't see
other people's perspectives.

59
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:17,579
Hey, give me a bite.

60
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,350
You know, it's weird because

61
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,566
she's so ridiculously compassionate
with her patients.

62
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,681
You'd think she'd roll some
of that out for her friends, but...

63
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,453
How about we not talk
about her anymore?

64
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,433
That's a fine idea.

65
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,599
He is in George's room,

66
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,777
and when George's stupid
marriage crashes and burns,

67
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,200
he's gonna want to move back in,
and he won't be able to.

68
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,270
His life will be in a shambles, he'll
finally notice that his dad is dead

69
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,121
and he made a fool
out of himself by marrying

70
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:50,688
somebody he doesn't really love,
and he'll have no place to go.

71
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,698
Is that what you want?

72
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,225
That's exactly what I want.

73
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,486
Hey, look who found some clothes.

74
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:57,941
- Shut it.
- How you doing?

75
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,673
Okay, everybody, let's do this once.

76
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,448
I'm fine, she's cremated,

77
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:05,666
I picked out a beautiful urn, and she's
hanging out in the back of my closet.

78
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,541
Any more questions about my dead mother,
or can we get back to work?

79
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:11,627
Does anyone know who
the new chief candidate is?

80
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:12,931
The chief's bringing in a ringer

81
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:15,176
in case he doesn't want to give
the job to either of your boyfriends.

82
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,772
O'Malley, you're with Shepherd today.

83
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,438
Yang, Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, to the clinic.

84
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:20,898
Karev, Jane Doe.

85
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:21,996
Grey, scut.

86
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,939
Once again, I am fine.

87
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,054
You can tell everybody you fine
till you're blue in your face.

88
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,312
Your mom died,
and you almost joined her.

89
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,533
You're taking it easy.

90
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,406
Anybody come looking for me yet?

91
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,660
Well, no match on your prints, no.

92
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,492
No hits from missing persons,plus--

93
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:38,892
My face is hard to identify.

94
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,108
Well, the second
they find something out

95
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:43,021
about your identity,
I'm gonna come tell you.

96
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,857
Dr. Sloan says
I need surgery on my eye.

97
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:49,803
He just wants to make sure
you don't lose vision there completely.

98
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:52,820
But Dr. Montgomery says I should wait
a day or two 'cause of the baby.

99
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:55,339
I don't know
what I'm supposed to make of that.

100
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,482
Yeah, well, I mean,
surgery can be hard on a baby,

101
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,693
but you're gonna be on a fetal
monitor the whole time,

102
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,425
so if anything goes wrong,
we'll catch it.

103
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:03,778
Thank you.

104
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:08,399
I really-- I really appreciate
you taking the time to...

105
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,390
I mean, you're-- you're
all I've got in this place.

106
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,315
Does that hurt?

107
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,597
Of course it hurts.
Don't poke it like that.

108
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,156
Has the lump been there a long time?

109
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,883
I got shot 50 years ago.

110
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,733
It's been there a long time.

111
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,449
But it hasn't bothered
you till... recently?

112
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,768
It bothers me
there's a bullet in there.

113
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,284
It'd bother you, too,
but it didn't start hurting

114
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,866
till a couple of months ago.

115
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,043
- You think it's a bullet?
- I don't "think", lady.

116
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,127
I know. I wanted it out.

117
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:38,077
But the army doctors
didn't want to go get it.

118
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,758
So they let me keep it in
for half a lifetime.

119
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:47,187
Let's get some pictures,
see if you're right.

120
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,182
I know I'm right.
Save your film.

121
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,919
Just get me something for the pain.

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,743
Mr. Scofield,
I'm sure you are right,

123
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,311
but we're still gonna
do this my way.

124
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,810
- Derek.
- There she is.

125
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:02,975
How was your flight?

126
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:05,482
They didn't feed me,
which I don't understand.

127
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,127
Dr. O'Malley, Dr. Crawford.

128
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,861
- She's a big pain in the ass.
- Pleasure.

129
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,957
He says that because
we worked together in new york

130
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,252
and I was the only one
who never had a crush on him.

131
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:14,651
No, I-I don't buy that.

132
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:16,473
What do we know, O'Malley?

133
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:18,940
Dr. Crawford has
a parafalcine meningioma

134
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,538
along the superior sagittal sinus.

135
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,779
You've operated three times.
It keeps on coming back.

136
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,145
Yeah, it's in dangerous territory,

137
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:26,393
so we leave a little bit of
the tumor behind each time,

138
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,530
and we go back every couple
of years and tune it up.

139
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:30,089
But this is the last time.

140
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,052
- Sorry?
- This is it, Derek.

141
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,517
I'm done after this.

142
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,184
Helen...

143
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,475
the recovery takes forever,

144
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:43,123
and it's not like
when jake was around.

145
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,189
I go through this by myself now.

146
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,888
Don't throw in the towel.

147
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,696
I'm looking at the situation as it is.

148
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,082
I am going to do this now,

149
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:55,763
then I am going to spend
the next two years of my life

150
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,815
lying on a beach,
enjoying the sun.

151
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,749
Stop looking at me
like I killed your cat.

152
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,555
The decision is made.

153
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,885
You guys seen Bailey?

154
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,699
- What are we doing?
- Checking out the new chief candidate.

155
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,650
Chief's in with the ringer.
We're lurking

156
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:21,615
in a way that was subtle
when it was two of us,

157
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:22,807
but isn't now that it's 12.

158
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,497
I heard it was someone from Stanford.

159
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,312
All the professors there loved me.

160
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:27,532
They loved you?

161
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,047
I was a great student.

162
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,109
- How you doing, Grey?
- I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

163
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,484
- Move, move, move.
- She doesn't like it when people ask.

164
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,972
The ringer's in there with the chief.

165
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,618
And whoever it
is loves Cristina because

166
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:39,379
everyone at Stanford
just loved Cristina.

167
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,412
Shut up.

168
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,831
She's a motivated student.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

169
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,431
- Thank you.
- A bit of a kiss ass,

170
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,642
but that's hard to control.

171
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,694
They're coming out. Look away.

172
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:52,753
That's Colin Marlowe.

173
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:54,377
Like the Marlowe transplant?

174
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:57,811
Like the brightest thing in
cardiothoracic surgery in a generation.

175
00:06:58,943 --> 00:06:59,947
Dr. Marlowe...

176
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,539
I'm, uh, Preston Burke.

177
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,084
I'm a great admirer of your work, sir.

178
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,187
- Uh, particularly the--
- Yes, thank you. I--

179
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,114
Would you excuse me
for just a second?

180
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:15,492
Well...

181
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,698
you gonna give me a hug or what?

182
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,951
So what was that, exactly?

183
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,576
He was my professor.
We were close.

184
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:45,602
"close" appears to be
something of an understatement.

185
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,078
It was a long time ago.

186
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,666
I talk about him all the time.
You never thought to mention it?

187
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,858
Well, um, I didn't think you wanted to
hear about every guy I ever slept with.

188
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,070
I have a hysterectomy to prep.

189
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,108
Are we done with the curiosity?

190
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,948
Great.

191
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,230
What are you doing tonight?

192
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,079
'Cause I don't want to go home and
find Alex, and it's just the two of us,

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,731
You know?
It's weird and awkward, and...

194
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:08,490
And he doesn't know whether
he should talk to me or not talk to me.

195
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,553
It's just such an awkward situation.

196
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,806
I'd rather it be group
awkwardness, you know?

197
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,665
I don't want to just be
standing there staring at him.

198
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,781
- Meredith?
- Have you seen Montgomery?

199
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,816
Hey! What are you doing tonight?
You want to come over?

200
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,327
'Cause you and I never really
get a chance to hang out and...

201
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,384
It might be kind of fun.

202
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,843
Alex just moved in,
which was meredith's brilliant idea.

203
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,620
And he still has a thing for me,
so it's...

204
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,125
- What the hell?
- This is my hiding spot.

205
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,851
My father is out there.
Go somewhere else.

206
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:36,819
- I need this closet, Meredith.
- Colin Marlowe?

207
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,484
Yes, he was my professor.
We were close.

208
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,778
He had his hand on your ass.
I sure hope you were close.

209
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,391
Did you see somebody go in there?

210
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,297
I did. Someone's hiding from me.

211
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,207
Yes, I think
someone's hiding from me, too.

212
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,586
You were that girl, huh?
The girl who slept with the professor.

213
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,290
We had one in my class.
She only got to the radiologist, though.

214
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,088
No one got near the cardio god.

215
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:56,795
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I scored big. You know,

216
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,055
hide in the bathroom.

217
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,844
My awkwardness with my father
is well-established.

218
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,994
You and the cardio god,
on the other hand,

219
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,482
have loads to catch up on.

220
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,688
But I don't want to talk
to the cardio god.

221
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,415
You know we can hear you
in there, right?

222
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:09,576
Loud and clear.

223
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,523
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,368
- Excuse me. May I?
- Yeah.

225
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,013
Oh, I was just leaving, actually.

226
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,365
We heard about your mother.

227
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,543
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,299
There wasn't a funeral or anything?

229
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:29,998
Oh, she didn't want that.

230
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,995
I hope everything's okay with the baby.

231
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,227
We're not here with the baby.

232
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,916
We're here because we wanted
to make sure that you were all right.

233
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,861
That's sweet, but...

234
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,778
We don't have to do this.
I'm not in shock.

235
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,844
I'm not racked with grief.
I'm just moving on.

236
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,241
But you're hiding in a broom closet.

237
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,128
Well, if you could just move my father.

238
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:49,413
I sent him to go get some coffee,

239
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,765
but we'd really like to...

240
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:53,115
You know, make dinner or something...

241
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,512
for you.

242
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,493
He's been really worried about you.

243
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,350
And he's the family you have left,
Meredith.

244
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,443
I-I don't see it that way.

245
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:03,378
When is this gonna stop?

246
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:07,304
Yes, he made some mistakes,
but he's not a monster.

247
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:08,797
He's just...

248
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:11,567
an inarticulate person who spills
food on his shirt, a lot.

249
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,886
Have dinner with us,

250
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:15,719
tonight. I'll make some chili.

251
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:17,416
The whole thing will be over in an hour.

252
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,231
You think you can do that?

253
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,793
I can't believe you hid in a closet
when you saw me coming.

254
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:23,833
If it wasn't just tragic,

255
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,757
it might be the most adorable thing
I've ever seen.

256
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,458
You could've warned me.

257
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:29,306
I thought, Cristina Yang
wouldn't hide in a closet

258
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,611
'cause she doesn't
want to talk to me,

259
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,821
which clearly she doesn't because
she fled like a roach in sunlight

260
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:36,452
- when she saw me coming.
- You know,I did not flee. I was--

261
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:39,234
I have work to do. I'm not
a professional note taker anymore.

262
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,713
- You grew your hair. It's lovely.
- Don't flirt with me.

263
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:42,957
I have a person.

264
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,159
Really? Who?

265
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,804
Preston Burke.

266
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:47,898
You never change.

267
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,588
- Must be adorable.
- No. Shut up.

268
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:51,316
It is a real relationship.

269
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,034
- I bet it is.
- I'm marrying him.

270
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,986
Good.

271
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:58,559
Congratulations.

272
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,014
No, I'm being genuine.

273
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,122
It's wonderful.

274
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,745
Can I give you a congratulatory hug?

275
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,181
Don't touch my ass.

276
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,951
My stomach is growling.

277
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,400
Sorry. We can't let you eat
before the surgery.

278
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,113
That's okay. I stayed
at the archfield last night.

279
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,451
I had them make me
breakfast at midnight.

280
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,198
You should try the French toast.

281
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,883
It'll blow your mind.

282
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,615
Breakfast at the archfield
on an intern's salary?

283
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,478
Yeah, I kinda live
there at the moment.

284
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,103
My wife has a deal there.

285
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:35,225
That's one hell of a deal.

286
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,731
So our room service bill

287
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,554
at the archfield,
is that part of the deal?

288
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,326
Yeah, sure.

289
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:43,781
I mean, breakfast alone is,

290
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,612
what, probably 50 bucks a day?

291
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,494
And they still only charge us
$400 a week?

292
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,361
Sometimes I pay them
more for room service.

293
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:53,274
OK. Then just tell me how much it is,
and we'll split it like we do the rest.

294
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,799
- Don't worry about it.
- No come on.

295
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,607
I'm not gonna have you
pay for all the food.

296
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,659
Just tell me how much
the room service bill is.

297
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,120
We pay about, 800 a week.

298
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,514
Dollars?

299
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,169
I told you not to worry about it.

300
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,361
You can't afford that.

301
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,201
- Yes, I can.
- How?

302
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:10,841
I'm your husband now.
You're supposed to tell me this stuff.

303
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,452
Okay. Just come here.

304
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,631
All right, my parents
have a lot of money...

305
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:15,679
- What?
- And so I...

306
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,416
have more money than I'm making.

307
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:21,175
And we don't... have
a special deal through family friends

308
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:22,877
at the archfield.
I just-- I pay for it.

309
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,034
How much?

310
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,352
$2,500 a week.

311
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:29,717
- You're an heiress.
- Okay.

312
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,176
- See, this is why I don't tell people.
- You're an heiress.

313
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,506
Don't-- just don't,

314
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,229
okay? Stop talking. Stop talking.

315
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,887
I mean it.
I-I didn't tell you because

316
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,668
my parents' money has affected
every single relationship in my life,

317
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,404
and so I've stopped talking
about it and living--

318
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:42,535
No, wait, wait. So wait.

319
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,470
So I've been--
I've been paying you

320
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,864
$200 a week for what, fun?

321
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,739
No. I use it to tip housekeeping.

322
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,225
Great! Oh!

323
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:57,741
Oh, I'm-- you know,
I'm glad I could pitch in.

324
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,445
You know, is there anything else
that I should know about,

325
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,708
that's, I don't know,
huge like this?

326
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,858
Uh, I-I-I used to have
a pet ferret for nine years.

327
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:07,594
George...

328
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:09,518
Great.

329
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,579
Stop distracting the staff.

330
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:14,905
You're pushy.
Anybody ever tell you that?

331
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,632
So what do you think
of a sagittal sinus bypass?

332
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,754
Have you ever scrubbed in on
a sagittal sinus bypass, Dr. O'Malley?

333
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,181
It is what they call
"big balls" surgery.

334
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,032
- Apparently I have a surgeon with--
- It's been very successful.

335
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,299
- When the patient doesn't stroke out.
- If it works,

336
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,514
the tumor's all gone. We never
have to go back in there again.

337
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:35,929
If it doesn't work, I'm dead.

338
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,996
If you refuse to come back
in 2 years, you're dead anyway.

339
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,523
That's a decision I can live with.

340
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,120
That isn't a decision I can live with.

341
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,979
O'Malley, go find her labs.

342
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:50,625
So what do you think, huh?

343
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,197
A few years on a beach,

344
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:54,841
and then what?

345
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,813
After you piss away your savings,

346
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,738
your memory goes,
motor skills deteriorate,

347
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,783
and you're dying a very slow,
miserable,

348
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,467
painful death...
You're gonna call me up

349
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,479
and you're gonna ask me why we didn't do
something when we had the chance.

350
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,390
Now that is not something
I can live with.

351
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:12,366
Not...

352
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,540
when we can do something
right now to prevent it.

353
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:21,140
Well, it looks like the bullet
has damaged your scapula.

354
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,546
No wonder it hurts.

355
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,818
How did you get shot, sir?

356
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,673
Korea. Garden spot.
Makes a nice vacation.

357
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,349
Can I get a damn painkiller?

358
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:32,067
I think we'll do you one better.
We're gonna take it out.

359
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,183
My bullet?

360
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,485
There was no reason to remove it
when you first got hit,

361
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,554
but now it's infected.
It's working its way into your scapula,

362
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:39,662
and we can't have that.

363
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,099
I need to see that bullet.

364
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,728
- You gonna frame it?
- No, smarty-pants.

365
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,277
I was fragged a couple
of weeks before it all ended.

366
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:49,103
- "Fragged"?
- Yeah, shot by one of his own men.

367
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,126
I made a decision,
and they didn't like it.

368
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,552
And then what do you know?
We're facing enemy fire,

369
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:55,994
and I take a hit
from the wrong side of the line.

370
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,552
I could never prove it,

371
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,200
but we can prove it now,

372
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:01,284
when you pull the damn thing out of me.

373
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:02,922
Get me my bullet.

374
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,410
Let's calm down, Mr. Scofield.

375
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:05,611
Do you know what it's like,

376
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:07,715
when your own men turn on you?

377
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:10,568
It's not a good feeling.

378
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:19,299
I just agreed to have dinner
at my father's house, tonight.

379
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,379
And Cristina slept with Colin Marlowe.

380
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,060
"Marlowe transplant" Marlowe?

381
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,755
They had a thing
when she was a student.

382
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,153
How could I have
a meal at my father's house?

383
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:28,299
He slept with Cristina?

384
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:29,360
Derek.

385
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:30,918
Oh, right. Sorry. Okay.

386
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:32,871
Have dinner at your house.

387
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,100
It's your place. I'll come.

388
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,541
I'll be your wingman. It'll be fun.

389
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,850
Okay, it won't be fun.
But it'll be...

390
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:41,004
It'll be fine.

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,356
They're your family.

392
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,698
Why does everyone assume that?

393
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,051
You deserve to have a family,

394
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:46,440
whether you like them or not.

395
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,639
I thought we had a deal.

396
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:52,974
We agreed I wouldn't sleep
with anybody for two months.

397
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,283
We never said I wouldn't look.

398
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,559
- You didn't think I'd hold out.
- No, I didn't.

399
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:57,653
You're worth it.

400
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:58,930
You bet your ass I am.

401
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,239
She's rich, totally rich,

402
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,295
boatloads of money.

403
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:05,351
- George, that's fantastic.
- No,it's...

404
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:07,520
it's not fantastic.

405
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,029
Cristina did Colin Marlowe.

406
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:11,813
Callie's rich.

407
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,615
Don't talk to her about it.

408
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,567
Her? I am sorry,
I don't have a name anymore?

409
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:17,554
Don't tell anyone.
Those were my words.

410
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,656
- So she's rich.
- Just shut up about it.

411
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,944
Do you think that's possible?

412
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:29,883
If you give me the "people is what
matters" thing again, I will kill you.

413
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,308
Colin Marlowe.

414
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,694
Was it good? Was he good?

415
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,400
Did he make you a better lover?

416
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,886
Remember all the other times
I've talked to you about my sex life?

417
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,004
- No.
- Exactly.

418
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:41,764
Did I miss anything
about her doing the old guy?

419
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,498
- She's not talking.
- Oh, she'll talk.

420
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,142
So I was supposed to be
back in the game today,

421
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,910
but instead I'm planning dinner
for my father in my dead mother's house.

422
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:49,612
I don't cook. How am I supposed
to cook for them?

423
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:50,862
I will make your stupid dinner.

424
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,502
So were there any little
blue pills involved,

425
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,075
or is he untouched by time?

426
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:56,844
Dude, that's just wrong.
Don't answer that.

427
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,225
Because I am your friend,

428
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:02,033
I will show up at your house 45 minutes
into the dinner with a fake crisis.

429
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,598
So if it's, uh, unbearable,
you can abort.

430
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:05,668
Oh, thank you.

431
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,499
Come on. He's not a young man.

432
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,557
He wasn't getting a little help?

433
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,523
Poppin' the pill?
Dad's best friend?

434
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,740
Come on. You're gonna give me nothing
after everything we've been through?

435
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,153
Nothing?

436
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:20,985
It's a miracle drug.

437
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,929
And someday, it'll save your life.

438
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,828
Dr. Marlowe? Derek Shepherd.

439
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,893
I'm doing a sagittal sinuspass
today if you'd like to observe.

440
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,234
Really? That's quite a procedure.

441
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,038
It's a good trick,
but if you're really interested

442
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,563
to see what this hospital can do,

443
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:38,427
I'm performing
an arterial switch operation

444
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,972
for a T.G.A. this afternoon.

445
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,411
If you gentlemen are trying
to intimidate the competition,

446
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:43,417
it's working.

447
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:46,259
- Good.
- I'll see both of you in surgery.

448
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,335
Colin Marlowe.

449
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:51,612
The one and only.

450
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:52,880
- He...
- Yes.

451
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:54,241
- With...
- Yes.

452
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,795
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

453
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,605
Suction.

454
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,793
No, not like you're driving a tractor.
Slowly.

455
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:04,719
Better.

456
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,066
What's the chance she wakes up
and remembers everything?

457
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,146
I wouldn't count on it.

458
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,181
Dr. Sloan, the baby's having decels.

459
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:13,212
Are you sure? Sometimes the monitor's
not on right. You get a false read.

460
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,178
She's got vaginal bleeding.
The baby's in distress.

461
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,649
Damn it. Page Dr. Montgomery. Now!

462
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,129
You're making an honest
woman of Cristina Yang.

463
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:23,323
That's-- That's impressive.

464
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,017
I always thought she was collecting us,
like baseball cards.

465
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:27,624
Baseball cards?

466
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:29,864
Well, she likes an authority figure,
someone...

467
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,837
with something to teach her. I never
thought she would actually commit.

468
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,113
She use to say to me
that she thought that marriage

469
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,708
was for the weak and undirected.

470
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,037
I made a number of

471
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,650
marriage proposals.

472
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,790
It seemed the polite thing to do

473
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,107
after such a long time together,
but, uh,

474
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,166
- she wouldn't have it.
- All what time?

475
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,984
You were just having
a fling with a student.

476
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,142
A fling?

477
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,083
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

478
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:00,327
Is the problem
that I slept with my professor,

479
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,857
or that I was committed enough
to keep at it for three years?

480
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,636
You told him that you thought
marriage was an idiotic institution.

481
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:06,999
- It is.
- Then why did you say yes?

482
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,367
- Cause I wanna make you happy.
- "Happy"?

483
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,493
You know, I'll do a lot of things
to make you happy.

484
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:13,593
Do I give a crap about a ceremony
with a dress and a flautist?

485
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,758
No.

486
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,184
But I'm happy to do it
if it'll make you happy.

487
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:19,991
Heartwarming.

488
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:21,554
Thanks.

489
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,156
You couldn't have waited one day?

490
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,704
She was 40% vision compromised
in her right eye.

491
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,146
- It would've been gone tomorrow.
- No, it wouldn't, actually,

492
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:36,086
but there's a snazzy new chief candidate
marching around the hall today,

493
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,597
and you needed to be a hero.
That's what needed to happen today.

494
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,233
The patient was fine, Addison.

495
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,702
The baby's still in her uterus,
and she's not losing an eye.

496
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,515
Every surgery is risky.

497
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:45,905
The patient chose this one.

498
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,554
Karev...
don't just stand there.

499
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,722
The patient's baby was in distress.

500
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,065
Go. Stay with her.

501
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:53,229
Somethin' happen with Jane Doe?

502
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,484
Yeah, she can see,
and Addison's got a problem with it.

503
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,245
He rushed her into surgery,
and she almost lost the baby.

504
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,487
I had to sew  her cervix shut.

505
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,752
The complications had nothing
to do with the surgery.

506
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:04,714
Why? Why do you think
Mark moved so quickly, Derek?

507
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,899
Do you think it's because
a piece of the orbital bone

508
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:08,335
was floating towards the brain?

509
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:10,683
Well, I think it's because
Mark wants a promotion.

510
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:13,347
You're not her husband.
This isn't your patient.

511
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:14,332
Stay out of it!

512
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:16,299
What the hell
do you people think you're doing?

513
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,615
You're supposed to be
the leadership of this hospital.

514
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,602
Screaming about
a patient in the hallway?

515
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,301
Are you out of your minds?

516
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,195
Tough procedure.

517
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:31,698
It's a bold choice.

518
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:33,731
We've been fighting
this one for a while.

519
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:35,725
I'm hoping this will be
the end of it.

520
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:38,032
What happened?

521
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,853
End-tidal CO2 just dropped
from 30 to 16. Bagging manually.

522
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,397
Doppler's showing air
in the left ventricle.

523
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:43,742
0-2 stat's down to 89.

524
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:44,777
Aspirate the central line.

525
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,508
- She's bradycardic.
- Push 1 of atropine.

526
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:47,733
There's no air in the central line.

527
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,421
Level her out.
I'm gonna flood the field.

528
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,730
Asystole.
Push 1 milligram of epi.

529
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,129
Start compressions. Go.

530
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,007
Get in there.
Get in there! Do it!

531
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,099
That things been in there
since the korean war?

532
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,562
He's lucky it didn't travel
down to his aorta.

533
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:03,507
Okay, a little suction there.

534
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,309
Almost...

535
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:06,950
I got it.

536
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,879
Make sure we get that back.
The patient wants it.

537
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,518
He's got a warped sense of nostalgia.

538
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:16,215
I get it. If they pulled a bullet
out of me, I'd want it

539
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,812
cast in gold
and mounted on my wall.

540
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,238
Yeah, well, you can afford it.

541
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,139
Just a little more suction.
Let's get ready to close.

542
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,629
She's not responding.

543
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:32,586
- I'm gonna open her up.
- Open cardiac massage?

544
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,714
You're a neurosurgeon.

545
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,236
You have no privileges in this hospital.
Get the glasses off.

546
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:38,081
- Should we page Dr. Burke?
- No I've got it.

547
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:40,399
Cross clamp the hilum. You don't
want air in the cerebral arteries.

548
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,875
Yeah, I got it.
Give me a 10-blade.

549
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,010
10-blade quickly, please.
O'Malley, get over here.

550
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,675
Let's roll her. Ready?
One, two, three. Go.

551
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,331
Okay, rib spreader.

552
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:58,955
Okay, scissors.

553
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,042
Massage her heart, O'Malley.

554
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:13,830
I need to aspirate.

555
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,451
Any air return?

556
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:18,821
10 cc's.

557
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:26,945
End-tidal CO2 is going back up.

558
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,598
The heart's starting
to beat on its own.

559
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:31,077
Pressure's 60 over 40.
It's low, but it's there.

560
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,594
She's gonna make it.

561
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:41,468
Should I start closing her up?

562
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:44,899
Dr. Shepherd?

563
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:49,183
O'Malley, I just sliced my friend's
chest open. Give me a moment.

564
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,631
That was very well-handled,
Dr. Shepherd.

565
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:55,918
Very impressive, indeed.

566
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,585
Not something I want to do
every day, but thanks.

567
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,692
Doctors, what happened?

568
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,840
Dr. Shepherd's patient
had a venous air embolism.

569
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,586
He had to split her chest open,
massage her heart

570
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:08,690
and manually aspirate right
in the middle of his procedure.

571
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:10,736
Why didn't you call me?

572
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,008
Uh, you were operating.

573
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:14,945
I was next door.
You could've pulled me out.

574
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:16,090
There was no time.
I handled it.

575
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:18,792
You think I crack people's heads open
if you're in the building

576
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,772
just because I think
I can handle a brain bleed?

577
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:22,705
The patient is lucky,
and you were showboating.

578
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:25,007
Showboating?
What, are you out of your mind? I was--

579
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:28,103
We seem to be going out of
our way to impress Dr. Marlowe.

580
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,222
- I'll bet we are.
- Gentlemen...

581
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,431
Good day,

582
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:36,971
doctors.

583
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,739
How you feeling, Mr. Scofield?

584
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,453
Where's my bullet?

585
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,236
That it?

586
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:01,198
Where's the rest of it?

587
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,116
That was it.

588
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,725
Is that a letter?

589
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,875
Can you read that?

590
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,997
I-I don't think it's much of anything.
I-I think it's just a scratch.

591
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,786
It's so small.

592
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,936
It could just be anything.

593
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,438
It's been a long time.

594
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,008
They don't hold up that well.

595
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,886
Could you have your lab,
you know, analyze it?

596
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,088
Tell me if it's one of ours or--

597
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:26,696
We're not set up for that kind
of investigation, Mr. Scofield.

598
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:28,927
You could try to send it
to a forensic lab,

599
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,147
but I don't know
if they'll tell you much either.

600
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,235
I've been stewing for 50 years.

601
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:43,277
Maybe it's time to move on.

602
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:44,669
To what?

603
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:47,260
I lost my whole unit over this.

604
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:49,713
I came home.

605
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,473
My wife, she didn't get it.

606
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,126
I've been blazing mad my whole life.

607
00:24:58,242 --> 00:24:59,679
I got nothing left.

608
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,655
It's not too late
to let it go and start over.

609
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,477
You're a sweet kid,

610
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,028
but you don't know what it's like

611
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,089
to have something
change you in your soul.

612
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:20,772
I do.

613
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,692
I wish I didn't, but I do.

614
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:27,251
Don't let it turn you.

615
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,864
You look like you had a long day.

616
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,606
You know what fragging is?

617
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,094
We've got an epidemic of it today.

618
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:42,141
My esteemed attendings
are gonna be the death of me.

619
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,356
Is there a front-runner?

620
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,563
I don't know.

621
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,788
What I do know is
I don't want my attendings

622
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:49,233
tearing each other's throats out

623
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,111
because of some internal
power struggle.

624
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:53,246
It's too dangerous for the hospital.

625
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,683
Does that mean...

626
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:58,004
is Colin Marlowe gonna be the new chief?

627
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:00,677
Good night, Dr. Bailey.

628
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:10,244
This is ready.

629
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:13,211
Don't slosh it around.
It's all about the presentation.

630
00:26:13,728 --> 00:26:14,775
Come in and eat with us.

631
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,614
You need to bond
with your people, Meredith.

632
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,068
People are what matters.

633
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,481
- I hate people.
- Yeah, well, do your own talking.

634
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:21,457
We talked.

635
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:24,661
We talked hospital, we talked
his research, we talked dead mother.

636
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,210
- I'm out.
- Ask about the baby.

637
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:28,944
Ask if it poos.
People can go on about that for hours.

638
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,022
- The chicken looks delicious.
- Yeah.

639
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,656
It's from the store.

640
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,256
Well, the green beans
look great as well.

641
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:42,327
I... didn't do those either.

642
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:48,076
It's beautifully presented.

643
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,038
Izzie did that.

644
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:52,329
Alex!

645
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:54,947
Come, sit.

646
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,468
Oh. No, go ahead.

647
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,097
Eat. We're eating.

648
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,276
This is Susan, and this is my father.

649
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,243
Hi.

650
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,572
- Here, you can have this plate.
- Cool.

651
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,525
So how are you?
How was your day?

652
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,802
Okay. Hungry.

653
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:11,652
Good.

654
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:17,217
How's the baby?

655
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,456
- Great.
- She's smiling no, sometimes.

656
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:24,785
She looks exactly like
molly wh-when she smiles.

657
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:28,375
I mean, it's amazing. I've got
this old picture of Molly and me

658
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:29,652
When Molly was...

659
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,990
I don't know, 5, and she's,

660
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,690
sitting on this red sled in the snow,
this great, big fir tree...

661
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,817
- You know, I'm not sure that that--
- Yeah.

662
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,428
No, honey, it's a massive douglas fir.

663
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:40,913
And in the picture,

664
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,429
couldn't look more like the baby.
I mean, incredible.

665
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,838
That's me.

666
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,177
The red sled and the big fir tree in the

667
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,435
park at the middle school
in the ugly, yellow,

668
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:57,594
plaid wool coat.

669
00:27:58,561 --> 00:27:59,566
That isn't Molly.

670
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:02,168
It's you and me.

671
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,007
- Oh, great.
- <i>Crap.</i>

672
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:15,321
- Sorry.
- <i>I think I blew a fuse.</i>

673
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:17,147
- I'll get it.
- No, you know, I can get it.

674
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:18,884
- It's--
- Oh, in the laundry room.

675
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,356
- I keep forgetting.
- What?

676
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,074
It's his house.

677
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,131
I'm going home.

678
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:39,086
Are you going home?

679
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,401
How did it end?

680
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:47,252
It ended.
School was ending, I was leaving.

681
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:48,342
You were done.

682
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,786
I came here.
I fell in love with you.

683
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,185
A new mentor,

684
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:56,069
with a host of new things
to teach you.

685
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,189
If you think that I'm
in this for the education--

686
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,049
Do you or do you not find my knowledge
and my skill compelling?

687
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,219
God. You know what?
You are blowing this way out of--

688
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,781
A man three times your age,

689
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,452
believed that he was having
a substantial relationship with you...

690
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:08,697
Well, yeah, he was.

691
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,026
And one day,
you're done just like that?

692
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,393
Yes.

693
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,369
You don't open yourself up...
to anyone.

694
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:19,566
Sometimes...

695
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:23,503
I think it's charming-- She's different,
she's not like other women.

696
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,386
But the simple fact is--
is that you have never let me in.

697
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:29,123
What, you think that
it's gonna make a good marriage?

698
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:30,766
Well, I don't.

699
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,146
I don't want you to marry me
because you're placating me.

700
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,371
That doesn't interest me.

701
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:38,840
It doesn't interest me at all.

702
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:46,763
- Do you think he's okay?
- He'll find it.

703
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:51,120
He probably can't see.
Um, there's a flashlight in the closet.

704
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,293
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

705
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,298
Excuse me.

706
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,012
- I'm sorry.
- It's going fine.

707
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:01,767
I just...

708
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:03,974
I don't know what to say to him.

709
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,683
Well, it's not easy.

710
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,440
That's 'cause he's afraid of you.

711
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:10,495
I shouldn't have bit his head off.

712
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:12,716
I wish I could've just...

713
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,796
Meredith, it's okay to get angry.

714
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:18,556
It's you in the picture.

715
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:22,399
Izzie Stevens?

716
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,301
I share something with you that
I clearly feel uncomfortable about,

717
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,558
and you tell Izzie Stevens?

718
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,262
No, I didn't tell Izzie.
I told Meredith.

719
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:30,103
Oh! Oh, so that's better?

720
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:31,625
No, it was an accident. I--

721
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:33,343
It was an accident.

722
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:34,639
I was pissed off--

723
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,885
Why can't you give me
the benefit of the doubt that--

724
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:38,937
That maybe sometimes
I'm on your side?

725
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,661
Because you choose
your friends over me

726
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,230
- every chance you get.
- No, I don't.

727
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,587
I married you, and I haven't talked
to my best friend in weeks.

728
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:48,337
Meanwhile you lied to me
about where we live and why.

729
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,311
You lied to me about your background.
You lied to me about your family!

730
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,247
And still I'm the dog
who gets whacked on the nose

731
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:54,790
with a newspaper all the time.

732
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:55,778
When is this gonna stop?

733
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,826
- Oh, so this is my problem?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

734
00:30:57,827 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh, oh, so the fact that your best
friend violently disses our marriage

735
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:04,261
every chance she gets,
publicly, repeatedly...

736
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,589
Why do you think she does that?
Have you ever thought about that?

737
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,082
She's having a problem with this.
I understand that.

738
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,587
She has feelings for you.

739
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:14,061
- What?
- She wants you.

740
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:17,713
She wants you.
That's what this is about.

741
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,793
That's why she hates me.

742
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:25,837
George, George, do not laugh at me.
Do not laugh at me.

743
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:28,006
No. No, I'm not. I'm not.

744
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:29,777
Oh, god.

745
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:32,209
I'm not. I--

746
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:35,261
It's just, come on, she's Izzie.
She's--

747
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,955
She's bl-- She's blonde,
she's stacked, she's--

748
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:40,152
She's a supermodel.
I'm George.

749
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:46,470
- So what does that make me?
- No.

750
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,244
No, come on. You are gorgeous...

751
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:50,807
And you're curvy, and I never
thought you'd go for me.

752
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,867
Just shut up.

753
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:57,247
This is my hotel room that
I pay for with my huge piles of money.

754
00:31:58,054 --> 00:31:59,340
Get the hell out of it!

755
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:11,745
I'm sorry about the lights.

756
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:14,340
Eh, whatever. The food was good.

757
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,569
- You want some pie?
- Nah, I gotta go.

758
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:18,645
Oh, big plans. Got a hot date?

759
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,415
Well, good for you.

760
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:30,345
I guess "not interested"
really meant not interested.

761
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,735
Iz...

762
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,885
- You didn't want me.
- Yeah.

763
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:39,520
But that doesn't mean I want
you to want anyone else.

764
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,405
Am I gonna be alone,
pining over a dead guy forever?

765
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:48,091
I hope not.
It's kind of a waste.

766
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,088
Am I supposed to move on now?

767
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,370
Do people look at me and go,

768
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:57,084
"she's gotta get over it already.
It's ruining her life"?

769
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,850
You'll move on when you're ready to.

770
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,933
Why are you sitting in the dark?

771
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,537
- Izzie blew a fuse.
- Okay, I'm having a crisis.

772
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,279
Oh, I don't need rescuing.

773
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,529
Susan is very nice,
and we're getting through it.

774
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:22,307
Limping through, but we'll make it.

775
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:23,933
Okay, no, this isn't a fake crisis.

776
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:28,399
This is a real, "my ex is about to
ruin my impending marriage" crisis.

777
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,435
Hey. Hey. Where's Izzie?

778
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:33,520
Kitchen.

779
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:36,181
Sorry. It's not always like this.

780
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,076
Yeah, it-- it kinda is.

781
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:43,387
They're in the other room.

782
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,861
I need you to get over yourself.

783
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:46,314
I need you to start liking my wife.

784
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,238
I need you to like her
because sometimes I don't,

785
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,898
and I need you to talk me
back into it.

786
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,162
You say you're my friend?
That's the job.

787
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,290
I need to vent,
and I need it to be okay.

788
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,112
And I need to vent with alcohol.

789
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,824
I got married,
and I'm scared it was a bad idea.

790
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:11,046
Nobody ever got married and
didn't think that at least once.

791
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:21,193
Did you find the fuse box?

792
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:24,424
Yeah. Yeah, I just needed to...

793
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,602
- Take a break?
- I don't know...

794
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,698
how to--
Or what to talk to her about.

795
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,811
Work's a good place to start.

796
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:36,172
You know,
she's proud of what she does.

797
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:37,444
She's good at it, too.

798
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,332
I'd start with that.

799
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:41,754
You get each other.
That's nice.

800
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,506
Some days it's nice.

801
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:48,237
Some days I'd like to...

802
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:50,708
come home to someone
who doesn't know a thing about it.

803
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:52,763
Rough day?

804
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,157
I almost lost a friend
in my own O.R.

805
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,457
Was it your fault?

806
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,424
I don't know.

807
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,897
You were both nervous tonight.

808
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,038
It'll get easier.

809
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:12,728
She was nervous?

810
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,036
She's tough.

811
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,740
She tries to hide it.
She's difficult.

812
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:20,817
But if you make an effort,

813
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,188
she's worth it.

814
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:25,512
You okay?

815
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,535
Not entirely.

816
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,506
She's worth the effort.

817
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,863
All right.

818
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:43,555
Ah, nice.

819
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,074
- Damn it.
- Gotta go back in, huh?

820
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:00,817
Why is there an 11-inch
incision in my chest?

821
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,064
You coded on the table--
Air embolus.

822
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:06,225
I had to open you up and aspirate.

823
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,967
See, I'm sure you did a great job,

824
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:11,683
but that's why you're gonna have
some real trouble

825
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,626
convincing me to do it again.

826
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:15,236
Helen...

827
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,217
we got it all.

828
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,554
The tumor-- We never have to
go back in there again.

829
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,006
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

830
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:27,874
You're gonna live a long,
long life.

831
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,761
And here I thought
you were just being an ass.

832
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:33,827
Ah, I was an ass.

833
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:41,615
I had no right to push you
like that.

834
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:44,450
No, you did not.

835
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,513
I was going through
some stuff, and I just-- I...

836
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:49,663
I was an ass.

837
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:55,937
But in this moment, you're the ass
who gave me my life back.

838
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:00,341
I'm so glad we did this.

839
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:03,291
I am, too.Thank you for suggesting it.
Because I--

840
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,733
You never would have
in a million years.

841
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:08,305
- God night, sweetie.
- Thank you. Good night.

842
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:14,406
I'm-- I'm sorry
about your mother.

843
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,945
Thank you.

844
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:17,523
Thanks.

845
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:21,031
Swing's still here.

846
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,862
Yes, it, uh, doesn't swing.
Nobody uses it.

847
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,945
Here.

848
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:37,499
I put this in there.
You used to catch your fingers in it.

849
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,174
Suck it up,

850
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,846
go back with your tail between
your legs and just apologize.

851
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,692
- No!
- No, really. Look, you just--

852
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:08,589
- I'm always apologizing.
- "I'm sorry. I'm an ass." blah.

853
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,768
And it's over.
And then it's all over.

854
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:14,255
No. Not real--
I can't be wrong all the time.

855
00:38:14,888 --> 00:38:17,213
Is that really possible?
Don't-- Don't finish it.

856
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:19,450
- Hey, don't be grabby.
- You-- I don't have any.

857
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:21,554
Bogie.

858
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:25,643
Maybe you're wrong all the time,
maybe she's just really insecure.

859
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,456
It doesn't matter.
You still have to grovel.

860
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,950
Don't you-- Fill...

861
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,655
Yeah, um, she's...

862
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,827
She's insecure.

863
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,817
Yeah. That is a fact.

864
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,647
She's insecure.

865
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,895
What?

866
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:43,210
What?

867
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:45,032
Just tell me.

868
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:47,482
- Come on.
- No.

869
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,592
Come on!

870
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:50,747
Shut up.

871
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,794
No, it's, um, ju-- nothing.

872
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:59,283
Just that she thinks you have feelings
for me, like that's the problem.

873
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:02,412
I love that.
That's fabulous.

874
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,763
- And-- and-- and...
- Oh, I need a tissue.

875
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,069
That, uh,
I-I-I desperately want you.

876
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:14,526
I'm crying.

877
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,122
I'm crying.

878
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:19,418
Is she crazy?

879
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:22,436
You know, I think--
I think she's maybe a little crazy.

880
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,031
- Oh, can't breathe.
- Shut up.

881
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:27,249
I can't breathe.

882
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:28,877
We gotta be quiet.

883
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,704
Scary day, huh?

884
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:46,746
Well, your amniotic sac's intact,

885
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,731
the placenta's in good position.

886
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,971
Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up
so tight, nothing's coming outta there.

887
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,563
So the baby's gonna be okay?

888
00:39:56,422 --> 00:39:58,168
We're gonna have to see how it goes.

889
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,845
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,725
You asked me what I thought,
and I told you to go for it, and...

891
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,123
I'm...

892
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:08,993
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

893
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,705
No, see, when I pulled you out
of that water at the ferry, I...

894
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,209
You're...

895
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:17,058
I talked to you like you were
my sister, and I shouldn't have.

896
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,956
I'm an intern.

897
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,109
You gotta get your medical
advice from an attending.

898
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,787
I asked you 'cause I trust you.

899
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:29,202
Why don't you sit and tell me
a bedtime story or something?

900
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:31,287
<i>What's worse,</i>

901
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:34,721
<i>new wounds,
which are so horribly painful...</i>

902
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:38,618
Move over.
You're in the middle of the bed.

903
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,869
<i>Or old wounds that should've
healed years ago and never did?</i>

904
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,104
Am I gonna screw up this engagement?

905
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:59,343
I don't know. Do you want to?

906
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:03,990
I don't know.

907
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,631
My mom is dead.

908
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,241
Yeah, she is.

909
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:17,767
<i>Maybe our old wounds teach us something.</i>

910
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,083
<i>They remind us of where we've been</i>

911
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,392
<i>and what we've overcome.</i>

912
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:31,244
<i>They teach us lessons about
what to avoid in the future.</i>

913
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,220
<i>That's what we like to think.</i>

914
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:38,973
<i>But that's not the way it is, is it?</i>

915
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:43,985
<i>Some things we just have to learn,</i>

916
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,141
<i>over and over,</i>

917
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,056
<i>and over again.</i>

918
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,027
