00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
Previously on
"grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,440
I slept with george.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,090
It was a horrible mistake.

4
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm done. We're done.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,540
Pancakes?
he's not my roommate.

6
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,380
This is why I shouldn't
have given up my place.

7
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,070
He would still be our roommate
if meredit would just apologize.

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,000
You know,at some point,you are
going to have to talk to me.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,460
your ex did
a real number on you,huh?

10
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,140
-You didn't call me.
-I did. I did.

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,860
A few times.
I just hung up every time.

12
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,390
How is she today?

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,820
She's great.

14
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,240
She really lights up
when dr. Webber visits.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,960
Denny,your congestive heart failure
is getting worse despite the meds.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,570
We need more time.

19
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,020
my college campus
has a magic statue.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,570
It's a long-standing tradition
for students to rub its nose for good luck.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,160
My freshman roommate really
believed in the statue's power

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,970
and insisted on visiting it

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,950
to rub its nose before every exam.

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,380
Are you sure my scrub caps
aren't in the laundry delivery?

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,250
I triple checked.

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,040
-You're sure?
-Yeah,I'm sure.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,530
Studying might have been
a better idea.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,950
She flunked out
her sophomore year.

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,000
but the fact is,we all have
little superstitious things that we do.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,100
all right,everybody

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,500
it's a beautiful morning to save lives,
people,okay? Let's have some fun.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,880
If it's not believing
in magic statues,

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,730
it's avoiding sidewalk cracks or

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,320
always putting
our left shoe on first...

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,360
knock on wood...

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
10 blade.

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,760
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,070
paddles.

39
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,110
10 joules.

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,510
he's having a reaction.
I need to take him off.

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,110
I'm in the middle
of his brain.

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,770
We're losing him.

43
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,850
time of death...

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,900
time of death...

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,140
time of death...

46
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,410
call it,grey.

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,170
The last thing we want to do
is offend the gods.

48
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,970
Time of death--8:17.

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,360
four surgeries,four fatalities,
and the day's barely started.

50
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,510
Could I have a bite of that?

51
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,090
No,you're in my apartment.
You don't get to be in my food.

52
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,070
Dr. Burke gave me
a protein bar this morning.

53
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,010
Burke packs his lunch for him.
Did I mention?

54
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,570
talked to
the morgue guy this morning.

55
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,700
The one with the unibrow?

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,260
The one with the,like,teeth thing.

57
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,520
And he said that surgical fatalities
come in threes and sevens.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,370
Says there'll be three more
before midnight.

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,450
Well,okay,then,
since dead tooth morgue guy said so.

60
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,980
He's the morgue guy.

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,180
He knows things about death.

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,510
You dropped this.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,310
He's still ignoring me.

64
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,600
ignore him back.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,230
Derek says I should apologize
until he listens.

66
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,250
"Derek says."

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,230
It's good advice.
He's my friend.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,070
That's good friend advice.

69
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,540
Meredith...

70
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,330
what?

71
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,990
Did you sneak out
last night?

72
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,690
Yeah. I,uh...

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,340
I couldn't sleep.

74
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,270
-Come on.
-Where?

75
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,830
-E.R.
-All of us?

76
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,680
We've all had deaths.
Let's all go save a life.

77
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,750
Uh,dr. Bailey.

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Here you go.

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,910
-What's this?
-Hot cocoa.

80
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,650
It's a little ritual
we had in new york.

81
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,970
Four surgeries,four deaths.I figure
we could all use a little good juju.

82
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,990
And cocoa equals juju how?

83
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,660
don't question the cocoa.

84
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,230
Carry on.

85
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,440
Meredith...

86
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,700
thank you for your help
this morning.

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,100
Oh,thank you,addison.

88
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,850
Yeah.

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,550
You know,thank you.

90
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,580
here you go.

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,010
-Juju.
-Yep.

92
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,680
-You jujued meredith.
-I did...

93
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,520
in the spirit of friendship.

94
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,820
What,are we not being friends
with meredith anymore?

95
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,160
No,no,we are.
Meredith and i are friends.

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,060
Yeah,and you and i
are married.

97
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,400
So then by proxy,
meredith and I are friends.

98
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,880
That's very big of you.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,910
you don't have to do that.

100
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,550
It's not like I'm gonna be friends with,
let's say,uh...

101
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,440
mark.

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,830
Yeah,well,neither am I.

103
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,000
Now finish your juju
before somebody else dies.

104
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,960
There are ten of them-- music notes,
colorful patterns,they were sent out last night.

105
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,060
Sorry to hear about your valve
replacement this morning.

106
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,480
The laundry misplaced
my scrub caps.

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,060
You know,there's some
foolish talk goin' around

108
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,600
about fatally clusters
in threes and sevens.

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,490
Are you sure they weren't sent
to another hospital?

110
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,810
How many electives
have they canceled today?

111
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,090
This is our third.

112
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,120
And what have the surgeons
been giving as their reasons?

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
Because I prefer
my own caps.

114
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,330
You're not pushing your surgeries
because you don't have your personal caps.

115
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,210
You understand me?

116
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,960
I didn't push
any surgeries.

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,130
No,no,the question is,
when will you find them?

118
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,490
No one changes that board
unless they talk to me.

119
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,990
No one.

120
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,810
Great. No blood,no guts,
no lives to save.

121
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,510
It's dead quiet.

122
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,660
Did you really
just say that?

123
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,910
-Cristina.
-What?

124
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,900
You said the "q" word.

125
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,550
That's like saying
macbeth in the theater.

126
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,320
Please. You think because
someone says it's quiet,

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,250
-that it'll mean--
-can someone please help us here?

128
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,720
-She's coughing up blood.
-O'malley,take that.

129
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,280
-denny duquette.
-I got it.

130
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,810
-He's my patient.
-He's both your patients.Answer the call.

131
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,760
two incoming.

132
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,120
okay,uh,yang,first one's yours.
Grey,take number two.

133
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,550
Jesse fannon,32,

134
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,570
unrestrained driver
in a rear end collision.

135
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,060
There was spider webbing
of the front windshield where his head hit.

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,780
B.P. Is 120 palp.
Pulse is 75.

137
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,830
what do you want to do,yang?

138
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,490
A primary and secondary survey,

139
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,680
uh,head C.T. And x-ray.

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,670
Great,page shepherd
when you get there.

141
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,250
Wait! I'm counting
the siren whoops.

142
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,040
We can't go till
it reaches 33.

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,120
He also seems to have
a touch of O.C.D.

144
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,900
Nikki ratlin,30,
erratic B.P. In the field,

145
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,190
complaining of chest
and leg pain.

146
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,010
-What happened?
-I got struck by lightning.

147
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,330
Can anyone spell
"coincidence"?

148
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,780
Grey's Anatomy
Season 02 Episode 22

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,030
My horoscope said,
"stay close to home today."

150
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,520
Aries couldn't have been
any clearer.

151
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,930
Okay,I guess it coulda said,

152
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,390
"don't leave the house today unless you
want to get struck by lightning." Ow.

153
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,410
See,ms. Ratlin,you have no
sign of wounds from lightning.

154
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,880
It was a sign.

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,930
Clearly,getting struck
by lightning is a sign.

156
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,020
A sign that I shouldn't
have left my house.

157
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,000
Nikki,normally people
struck by lightning.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,450
Have a wound where the bolt
entered and exited the body.

159
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,070
Well... well,I wasn't
"struck" struck.

160
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,820
I--the tree was struck
and it fell on me.

161
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,130
A tree fell on you?

162
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,770
A big,like,branch
or a limb--whatever.

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,520
Same difference.

164
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,040
No,actually,medically,
it isn't the same difference.

165
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,300
And it would be helpful if,

166
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,760
from now on...
You told us the whole truth.

167
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
You wanna know the truth?

168
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,340
My boyfriend loves that tree.

169
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,690
He's totally gonna freak out.

170
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,170
Oh,chief,there's a,uh,

171
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,070
ms. Warner down in admitting.
She's asking for you.

172
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,210
Who?

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
Um,olive warner?

174
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,800
50s,uh,blonde hair.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
She said she's known you
for about 20 years.

176
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
Are you taking about ollie?

177
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,780
RighT. Okay.
Uh,ollie warner--

178
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,000
she presented with,uh,
upper G.I. Bleeding.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,900
And she had a T.I.P.P.S.
Procedure last month for esophageal varices.

180
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,510
I'll take this from here,
o'malley.

181
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm happy to help,sir.

182
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,610
No,thank you.

183
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,650
I got this myself.

184
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,970
Ollie.

185
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,800
hi! richard.

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,370
It's good to see you.

187
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,090
sinus tachycardia,
low grade fever,

188
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,750
pulse ox 75.

189
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm hearing rales
in your lungs.

190
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,870
Yeah,a freight train
rolls through at noon.

191
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,740
How bad is the pain?

192
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,710
I don't know.

193
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,550
A five or six when I breathe.

194
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,280
That means a seven or eight when you're
not trying to impress your doctor.

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,060
I heard,uh,

196
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,220
four people died in surgery this morning.

197
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,140
Said they were expecting
three more.

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,250
You get that from a nurse?

199
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,970
Never reveal my sources.

200
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,190
Just like to avoid the O.R.

201
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,490
And I'm not liking
that look.

202
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,650
This could be
a pulmonary embolism,denny--

203
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,900
a complication
from the lvad surgery.

204
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,010
We're gonna have to talk
to dr. Burke.

205
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,600
I got hot chocolated.

206
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,230
The she-shepherd
hot chocolated me.

207
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,530
It's her juju.

208
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,090
I don't like people
who say juju.

209
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,020
I say juju.

210
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,310
Juju,juju,juju.

211
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,750
Juju,juju,juju.

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,190
Juju,juju,juju...

213
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,110
I didn't drink it.

214
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,470
You're not obligated to honor
some else's juju.

215
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,010
thought you were
being friends.

216
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,670
I am,with him.

217
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,750
Do I have to be friends
with her,too?

218
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,360
Definitely not

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,740
maybe.

220
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,730
I'll,uh,call psych
for you.

221
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,160
That would be good,
thanks.

222
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,580
All right,
that's the worst of it.

223
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,650
Oh,I never should've
gotten out of bed. Oh!

224
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,720
But I really wanted
to surprise my boyfriend

225
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,520
before he left for school.

226
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,340
He had a huge exam today,

227
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,480
and I just,you know,
I wanted to wish him luck.

228
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,230
Dr. Torres,hey.

229
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,700
Hi. Uh,can I give you a hand?

230
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,490
You missed the boat,
george.

231
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,020
You mean on this case or...

232
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,010
or a hot chick gives you her number,
you're supposed to call.

233
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,400
-Yeah.
-right. I was.

234
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,020
-I mean,I am.
-Too late.

235
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,800
Ouch. Don't give up.

236
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,060
I mean,
if you really like her.

237
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,360
Okay...

238
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,700
Okay,the plot thickens.

239
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,980
Nikki,dr. Grey here
is gonna take you upstairs for a C.T.

240
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,230
But before she does,
I have to ask,

241
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,360
you're bruised all up and down
your left side.

242
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,060
You sure a tree branch
did all this?

243
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,860
You think my boyfriend
did this?

244
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,500
He would never hit
a woman,ever.

245
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,410
The bruising doesn't
look like a tree branch hit you.

246
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,300
Fine.

247
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,400
Okay,you guys are gonna think
I'm really weird,

248
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,090
but I was sort of up in the tree
when the lightning hit,

249
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,320
and,well...you climbed a tree
in a thunderstorm?

250
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,210
I really wanted it to be
a surprise,you know,

251
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,910
for my boyfriend,and,

252
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,340
um,I just...I had to see if his psycho dog
was in the yard

253
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,510
because of,like,
the barking and stuff and...

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,250
I know.It sounds really weird.

255
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,160
Does it sound really weird?

256
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
-Not at all.
-No.

257
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,680
And the thing is,
I mean,he wasn't even there.

258
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,070
The dog?

259
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,920
No,my boyfriend.

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,710
He wasn't even home.

261
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,340
I really shouldn't
have gotten out of bed.

262
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,280
Oh,dr. Shepherd.

263
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,120
I've got a 34-year-old male with a blunt
head trauma and severe case of O.C.D.

264
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
Oh,really? Did you call
for a psych consult?

265
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,150
-Yes.
-All right,let me know when you get his C.T.

266
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,530
-Okay.
-Thank you.

267
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,130
Hey.

268
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,190
Hey.

269
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,420
Hey,uh,sorry about that,
uh,valve replacement.

270
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,860
Oh,thank you.

271
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,880
The laundry lost my caps.

272
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,960
The guy didn't die because you weren't wearing
one of your caps.

273
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,430
Fine,I know that.

274
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,740
I just prefer...
to operate wearing my own.

275
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,020
It's a comfort thing.

276
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,510
Huh. Well...

277
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,120
I prefer having george
out of our apartment.

278
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,300
So I guess we both have
comfort things.

279
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,060
What are you saying?

280
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,220
Uh,you know,um...

281
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,880
I have one of your caps
in my locker.

282
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,510
Why do you have one of my caps
in your locker?

283
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,050
Oh,that's not the point.
You know,the point is,uh,

284
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,310
is that I think
I'm gonna keep it hostage.

285
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,430
So you kick bambi out,
you get your cap back.

286
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,950
Oh,well,I don't do well
with ultimatums.

287
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,670
Maybe you should think of it
more as a trade.

288
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,350
Dr. Burke...

289
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,460
I've got free time.

290
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,940
Do you have any cases?
Do you need any help?

291
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,510
Actually,I do.

292
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,230
cristina has something of mine,
and I need you to get it back.

293
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,930
just call catherine back.

294
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,030
Yeah.

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,590
Gretchen,would you mind
leaving us alone for a minute?

296
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,880
Okay.

297
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,940
Thank you.

298
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,260
She's my new baby.

299
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,190
Six months sober.

300
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,030
She's already
on the ninth step.

301
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,730
You must be proud.

302
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,830
Always.

303
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,770
You're on
the transplant list,ollie?

304
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,280
Couple of years now.

305
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,190
The sclerosis prevents blood
from flowing into your liver,

306
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,950
so it's backing up
into your esophagus,

307
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,710
'causing the ruptures.
It's serious,ol.

308
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,350
Well,of course it is.I mean,you don't
puke blood if it's not serious.

309
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,250
The question is,

310
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,130
can you treat it?

311
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,250
Maybe.Surgically.

312
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,340
We'll have to run
more tests and...

313
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,610
whatever we do,

314
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,740
it's a stopgap.

315
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,860
You need a new liver.

316
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,970
Yet another reason I shoulda
laid off the sauce.

317
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,520
you look scared.

318
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,320
I am scared,ollie.

319
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,550
I haven't seen you
at a meeting in awhile.

320
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,300
I know,I know.

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,380
How have you been?

322
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,830
We're talking about you.

323
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,770
Now I'm asking about you.

324
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,180
Ellis grey's daughter
is working at the hospital.

325
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,560
Ellis is in a nursing home
with alzheimer'S.

326
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,860
I try to go see her
every chance I get.

327
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,730
You're having an affair
with the woman

328
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,210
who drove you
to your alcoholic bottom?

329
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,070
Ollie,we're not having an affair.
She's sick.

330
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,010
-You're lying to your wife?
-I'm not lying.

331
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,900
You're lying by omission.

332
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,890
You are having
an emotional affair

333
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,140
and now you're lying
to your sponsor about it.

334
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,570
You haven't been my sponsor
in years.

335
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,610
I still have the right
to bust your ass

336
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,180
if I see you slipping.

337
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm not slipping.

338
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,920
Not yet,but you're making
a pretty big mess.

339
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,830
How many years
you have now?

340
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,090
Just passed 17.

341
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,780
I'm proud of you.

342
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,270
And I'm scared,too.

343
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,760
You got me sober,ollie.

344
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,380
You walked me through it.

345
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,260
And I'm gonna walk you
through this.

346
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,230
she still has the...

347
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,600
You're a pervie
little boy,george,

348
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,300
and you're not finding
the cap.

349
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,410
I'll do your dishes
for a month.

350
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,670
-I don't do dishes.
-I'll do your laundry.

351
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,530
I don't do laundry.

352
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,420
Maybe that's why burke likes
having me around so much.

353
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,450
Interesting,interesting.

354
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,190
Are you having sex with him?

355
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,340
No.

356
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,860
Then he likes having me
around more.

357
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,110
Why does it always
have to be a competition?

358
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,160
-What do you want for the cap?
-You outta the apartment.

359
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
I'm not leaving till burke
says I have to leave.

360
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,950
Then you're not getting the cap.
Now clean up my crap.

361
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,540
No.

362
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,560
Wow. Is that her spleen?

363
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,930
Looks like a grade iii laceration,
maybe a iv.

364
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,930
What was she doing standing under a tree
in a thunderstorm?

365
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,250
She wasn't standing under it.
She was climbing it.

366
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,310
Why?

367
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,320
Uh...

368
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm getting the feeling
she's a little bit of a stalker.

369
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,650
Do we need to call the police?
I don't think so.

370
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,200
I think she's more of a "gentle" stalker
than a "kill you with a knife" stalker.

371
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,020
Right.

372
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,300
Well,let's hope she lives
to gently stalk another day.

373
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,940
Hey,you don't believe in
that seven fatally thing,do you?

374
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,930
I believe this girl needs
her spleen removed immediately.

375
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,990
Go pick up her labs
and get her on the board.

376
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,740
Then we'll break the news.

377
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,240
it's almost over.

378
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,510
You like horses,izzie?

379
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,080
Everybody likes horses.

380
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,340
That's not true.

381
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,450
You know,horses are
a great judge of character.

382
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,360
You don't like horses,
it means they don't like you.

383
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,350
I've got an uncle
that's a rodeo cowboy.

384
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,140
No kiddin'?

385
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,250
This is a big clot,denny.

386
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,280
I can't get it
with a catheter.

387
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm sorry.We're gonna have to open
your chest again.

388
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,340
I was counting the clicks--

389
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,100
the turn signal clicks.

390
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,360
I couldn't move
till it hit 333.

391
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,930
The light was green,
but I couldn't move.

392
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,400
I can't blame them
for hitting me.

393
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,560
How long have you been feeling
these compulsions?

394
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,120
A little bit all my life,but it's been
out of control the last three years.

395
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,050
Onset at 30 is typical.

396
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,380
Ruined a marriage.
I can't hold a job.

397
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,000
mr. Fannon,
do you--

398
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,620
is it clean?

399
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,250
-I need to know if it's clean.
-It's very clean.

400
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,350
Any relatives with O.C.D.?

401
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,780
My mother.

402
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,660
Killed herself at 38.

403
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,370
It ruined her life,
now it's ruining mine.

404
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,720
clean,clean clean?

405
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
I--we clean it
between each patient.

406
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,230
I think he needs you to say,

407
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,930
"clean,clean,clean."

408
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,240
It's clean,clean,clean.

409
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,700
Thank you.

410
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,330
I know it's annoying.
I can't help it.

411
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Find a penny,pick it up.

412
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,820
All day long,
you'll have good luck.

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,530
Find a penny,pick it up.

414
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,000
All day long,
you'll have good luck.

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,420
Mr. Fannon,
do you want--

416
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,460
repetitive rhymes,prayers--
it's classic.

417
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,170
He feels he needs to say it
a specific number of times,

418
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,520
probably a multiple of three.

419
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,120
Let's get him in before
he decides to start again.

420
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,250
Is everything all right
with,uh,that?

421
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,720
Find a penny,pick it up.

422
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,570
All day long,
you'll have good luck.

423
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,830
Just don't look at him.

424
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,990
Hey.

425
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,520
Hi.

426
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,180
-Hey--
-oh,hey.

427
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,650
-Hi.
-Hi.

428
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,040
I,uh... have to

429
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,190
-yeah.
-Yeah.

430
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,480
I do,too.

431
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,830
Yeah,I got something,too,
so...

432
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,310
I wish I had good news.

433
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
The T.I.P.P.S. Procedure
you had last month failed.

434
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,540
What does that mean?

435
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,580
It means you're lucky
you got sober young.

436
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,080
Ollie,it means I'm gonna
have to put in a portacaval shunt.

437
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,000
It's complicated.

438
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
Has only a 50%
survival rate.

439
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,150
What's my other choice?

440
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,160
Okay,then.  Um...

441
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,500
you'll be the one
to do it?

442
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,600
I've performed this surgery
nine times,

443
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,400
had four patients survive.

444
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,700
It's perfect then.

445
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,770
I'll be your five out of ten.

446
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,890
I'm not having surgery today.

447
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,820
You have a ruptured spleen.

448
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,080
And I am sure that the spleen
is very important,

449
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
but I am not
having surgery today.

450
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,860
You can operate after midnight,

451
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,150
but not one minute before.

452
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,940
Ms. Ratlin,if I thought
it would be safe,

453
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,880
I'd be more than happy
to wait till after midnight.

454
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,360
However,I have a husband
and a baby at home who won't be happy.

455
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,290
You know who else
won't be happy? You.

456
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,510
Your spleen is bleeding.
Spleen trumps horoscope.

457
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,630
But it was more
than just my horoscope.

458
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,890
I went out to my car this morning--
flat tire.

459
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,250
That's a sign,
but I just changed the tire.

460
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,150
Then there's a wreck
on the freeway.

461
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,420
Do I turn around and go home
like it's telling me to? No.

462
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,210
I detour an hour
out of my way

463
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,150
so that I can get
to kevin's house.

464
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,920
And when I get to kevin's house,
I get struck by lightning.

465
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,910
But you weren't struck
by lightning.

466
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,940
I'll die,okay?

467
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,750
If you operate on me today,
I will die.

468
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,550
'Cause I know I will.

469
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,480
Please,just...

470
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,830
just call my boyfriend

471
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,500
and tell him that I'm having
an operation at midnight,

472
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,670
because he will want
to be here.

473
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,730
Okay.

474
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,160
Please.

475
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,210
Should I call psych?

476
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,630
You can give it a shot.
In the meantime,get her down to I.C.U.

477
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,710
Poor girl's gonna kill herself
tryin' not to die.

478
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,810
Izzie paints a pretty picture
'cause she likes you,you know?

479
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,090
Okay.

480
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,290
I'm just sayin',
she likes you.

481
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,930
Which is gonna be hard
on her.

482
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,600
You mean...

483
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,120
when I die?

484
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,080
Come on...

485
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,690
I'm askin' you,

486
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,300
man-to-man.

487
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,770
With a clot
in your pulmonary artery,

488
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,130
it'll cut off the oxygen
to your lungs and you'll die of hypoxia.

489
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,620
If the hypoxia doesn't kill you,
the strain on your heart will.

490
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,330
And the surgery?

491
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,450
It's not a routine procedure.

492
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,090
You're at serious risk
for bleeding

493
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,310
because of the anticoagulants
already in your system.

494
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,050
What I'm saying
is izzie likes you.

495
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,220
And she's not gonna be
the one to pull away.

496
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,750
XXXXXXXX Wanna know why?

497
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,590
'Cause he couldn't move his car
until he stopped counting.

498
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,730
My girl--ruptured spleen--

499
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,290
won't have surgery
because of her horoscope.

500
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,590
Oh. Well,we should
introduce them.

501
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,400
They'd make a nice,
crazy couple.

502
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,970
Oh,you know what?
I'm sitting with meredith.

503
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,390
Have some self-respect.

504
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,350
Dr. Burke's orders trump any
personal issues I might have.

505
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,580
Is the craziness
rubbing off on him?

506
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,480
He's trying to stalk
burke's lucky cap out of me.

507
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,180
Burke has hat juju?

508
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,610
Apparently.

509
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,460
And you're using it
against him?

510
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,630
Well,
they're forcing me to...

511
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,200
because of
the clarinet playing

512
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,970
and the running
and all the breakfast food.

513
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,200
You guys...

514
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,580
this whole death cluster thing
is just ridiculous,right?

515
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,130
I mean,just 'cause
four died today

516
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,850
doesn't necessarily mean there's
gonna be three more before midnight.

517
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,020
-It doesn't,tinkerbell?
-For reals?

518
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,130
Are you worried about denny?

519
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,250
Yeah. Of course I am.

520
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,860
He's my patient.

521
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,140
I mean,if you're asking me
if I'm "worried about denny," no.

522
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,460
I'm sleeping with alex,so...

523
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,250
it's just...

524
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,900
hey,did burke say anything to you

525
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,660
about denny's surgery?
Did he?

526
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,840
No,it's your case.

527
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,160
Yeah. I know.
I'm just asking,you know,

528
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,600
as your boyfriend,did he--

529
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,400
well,I don't know
why you care.

530
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,330
I mean,you're sleeping
with alex,right?

531
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,530
Yeah.

532
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,840
Right. Whatever.
I'm just saying...

533
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,610
there's no such thing
as a death cluster.

534
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,400
It's just stupid. Right?

535
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,510
I have to go convince
my patient to let us operate.

536
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,140
You're removing
part of my skullcap?

537
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,700
Do you really
have to do that?

538
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,150
It's the only way I can get to
the affected part of the brain.

539
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,770
And the operating room,

540
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,890
it's clean,clean,clean?

541
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,150
Yes,it's clean,
clean,clean.

542
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,160
I'm gonna go get ready.

543
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,820
Can you stop that,please?

544
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,260
No. Sorry.
I wish I could.

545
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,350
She's judging me.

546
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,710
-No,she's not.
-Yes,she is.

547
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,190
I've been living with this
for three years,

548
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,240
and it's always the people
who are most like me who judge me the most.

549
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,300
You're type "a," right?

550
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,470
Straight-a student,
top of your class?

551
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,810
Yes,I was.

552
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,000
Well,so you've managed to turn your
compulsions into something productive.

553
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,300
But we're cut
from the same cloth.

554
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,140
That's why
you can't stand me.

555
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,480
Oh,time to go.

556
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,760
-But I'm not done.
-Uh,yes,you are,sir.

557
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,850
How many do you have to do?

558
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,880
-96.
-Let him finish.

559
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,470
Fine. I'll see you
in the O.R.

560
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,550
hey. Ollie says
you should come in.

561
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,400
She says you need
a meeting.

562
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
Not now,not here.

563
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,640
Yeah,except she said to tell you not to
protect your anonymity over your sobriety.

564
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,450
god...

565
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,530
grant me the serenity

566
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,670
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

567
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,310
the courage to change
the things I can

568
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,830
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

569
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,490
-Amen.
-Amen.

570
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,590
Amen.

571
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,480
Hey.

572
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,710
How are you feelin'?

573
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,100
Do me a favor.

574
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,310
My will is inside
my nightstand.

575
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,120
Just make sure it gets
in the right hands,okay?

576
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,050
Why are you talking
about your will?

577
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,740
We have to be realistic,
dr. Stevens.

578
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,430
Dr. Stevens?

579
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,770
We gotta be realistic.

580
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,130
And if you can't,

581
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,700
well,I can.

582
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,390
No,wait. Um,can you
just wait one minute?

583
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,220
Denny,denny,
listen to me,

584
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,190
you're not gonna die.

585
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,050
You can't go into surgery
thinking you're gonna die.

586
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,600
You want me to pee in front
of you? Is that what you want?

587
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,900
-You have it on you.
-Oh,really,you wanna go there?

588
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,770
I wanna go there.

589
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,700
So what are you gonna do,bambi?
You gonna,like,what,take it from me?

590
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,200
Well,burke said to do
whatever I have to do,

591
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,030
and I am gonna do whatever
I have to--

592
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,970
george,it's not there.
It's not there.

593
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,960
-no,you're not gonna get it.
-Maybe it's in here.

594
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,030
You're not gonna get it. No.

595
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,560
I got it. I got it.

596
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,830
Oh,you're getting my breast.

597
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,010
That's my breast,my breast.
My breast.That's my breast,damn it.

598
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,800
hey,dr. Torres.

599
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,270
Dr. O'malley,you're aware
this is the women's restroom?

600
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,930
-Yes,ma'am.
-Good.

601
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,800
Dude,
you called her "ma'am."

602
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,640
She's never gonna sleep
with you now.

603
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,590
Oh,hey.
Have you seen burke?

604
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,120
He's on the phone
with the laundry.

605
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,820
They still can't find
his scrub caps.

606
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,170
That's what I gotta tell him.
Cristina won't give hers back.

607
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,330
Unless I'm ready
to hit a woman,

608
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,540
and even though
it's cristina,

609
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm not ready
to cross that line.

610
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,670
Wait. Wait a moment.

611
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,120
Cristina has one of burke's
scrub caps?

612
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,620
She's holding it hostage.
Why do you think I am stalking her?

613
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,620
ow. Ow.
You're touching me.

614
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,190
George says you have
burke's scrub cap.

615
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,290
-So?
-Give it to him.

616
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,040
-No.
-Give it to him,cristina.

617
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,020
-What is with you?
-He needs it to operate.

618
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,990
-No,he doesn'T.
-That isn't your decision to make,

619
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,360
not when he's going in
on denny.

620
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,090
Now are you gonna give it to him or
am I gonna physically take it from you?

621
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,470
Are you threatening me?

622
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,520
I swear to god,cristina,
I like you,I really do,

623
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,100
but I grew up
in a trailer park,

624
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,010
and I am not above kicking
your pampered little beverly hills ass.

625
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,470
And I do mean physically
kicking your ass.

626
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,060
you don't have to follow me.

627
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,030
Thank you.

628
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,850
How long
have you had this?

629
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,830
It's one of my favorites.

630
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,930
You know,
you don't need it.

631
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,430
I keep that cap in my locker

632
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,800
because every morning,
I look at it,

633
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,230
and I'm reminded
of what I'm here for

634
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,840
and what I want to be--

635
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,420
a great surgeon,

636
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,510
a surgeon who is decisive
and who executes

637
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,960
and who doesn't need a piece of clothing
to give him an edge in surgery.

638
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,710
You don't need it.

639
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,680
I know.

640
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,700
You're right.

641
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,110
I know I'm right.

642
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,750
Nicely done,o'malley.
Let's go scrub in.

643
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,170
How am I doin'?

644
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,730
Nikki,is it possible
you're misreading the signs?

645
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,800
I mean,isn't two surgeons

646
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,830
telling you
that you need surgery

647
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,770
a sign
that you need surgery?

648
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,920
Did you call my boyfriend?

649
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,380
I did.

650
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,900
What did he say?

651
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,630
He said he hasn't been
your boyfriend in awhile.

652
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,810
Did you tell him
I got struck by lightning?

653
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,860
-What did you say to him?
-Who?

654
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,150
You know who.

655
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,590
What the hell?
Why does denny think he's dying?

656
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,710
Well,maybe 'cause there's
a good chance he is.

657
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,190
Just so we're clear,

658
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,440
we're over,alex.

659
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,150
This is over.

660
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh,you're breaking up
with me over a corpse.

661
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,530
No! No.

662
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,370
I am breaking up with you

663
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,810
because on
your very best day...

664
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,400
that corpse...

665
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,210
is twice the man
you will ever be.

666
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,190
You're not good enough
for me,alex.

667
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,910
You're not good enough
for anyone.

668
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,210
You two...

669
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,380
you're not scrubbing in.

670
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,900
Whatever is going on with you,
I don't need it in my O.R.

671
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,940
Fine.

672
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,950
I'll watch from the gallery.

673
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,420
No,no,you won'T.

674
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,240
You will take your energy
as far away from my O.R. As you can get.

675
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,460
Both of you.

676
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,160
Find a penny,pick it up.

677
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,200
All day long,
you'll have good luck.

678
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,940
Find a penny,pick it up.

679
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,930
All day long,
you'll have good luck...

680
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,210
we're gonna give you
your anesthetic now.

681
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,030
I'm sorry,
but we have to start.

682
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,420
Find a penny,pick it up.

683
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,130
All day long...

684
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,550
it's a beautiful afternoon
for saving lives,people.

685
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,600
Let's have some fun.

686
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,700
The incision begins along
the left subcostal margin,

687
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,310
across the right rectus
and extending well into the flank.

688
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,780
Dr. Bailey.

689
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,700
It's nikki ratlin.

690
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,450
I'll be all right,
dr. Bailey. Go.

691
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,120
She's bleeding out.

692
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,060
We need to get her
to the O.R. Now.

693
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,340
I don't want
an operation.

694
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,800
Nikki,
your boyfriend called.

695
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,330
He said he doesn't
want you to die.

696
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,360
Kevin called?

697
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,720
Yes. Now will you
let us operate?

698
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,890
Nikki.

699
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,710
Code blue.

700
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,450
Charge to 200.
Hang more blood.

701
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,310
Clear.

702
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,100
We have the back row
of sutures in place.

703
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,530
Give me some...

704
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,060
clear field.

705
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,090
-Pressure's dropping.
-Hang another unit.

706
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,030
I need the field clear.

707
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,540
Clear.

708
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,330
charge to 300.

709
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,080
Clear.

710
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,680
Gel foam.

711
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,140
That clip should've done it.

712
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,940
I don't know.
There's something I'm missing.

713
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,080
He's losing pressure,
dr. Burke.

714
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,630
I'm working
as fast as I can.

715
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,980
We're losing him.

716
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,010
I heard they're dying
left and right.

717
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,990
See? I told you
there'd be seven.

718
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,100
Who? Who died?

719
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,390
I don't know.
I bet it was that spleen chick.

720
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,910
You hear she wouldn't
let them operate?

721
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,900
My money's on
the chief's shunt.

722
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,090
I have $20 says
burke's guy went down.

723
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,810
The dude is
a walking time bomb.

724
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,010
bet.

725
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,790
that makes five.

726
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,210
You lost her?

727
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,090
Yeah.

728
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,910
I heard
there's a number six.

729
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,570
Do you know who else?

730
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,360
No.

731
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,850
I'm going
to inform the family.

732
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
She made it through.

733
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,970
thank you.

734
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,650
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

735
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,330
You're welcome.

736
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,540
You're welcome.

737
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,790
superstition lies in the space
between what we can control

738
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,220
and what we can'T.

739
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,710
so I wasn't one of the seven.

740
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,810
It's past midnight.
There were only six.

741
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,530
You cryin'?

742
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,630
I'm not crying.

743
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,240
You are,too.

744
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,920
Oh,damn it.

745
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,610
I cannot fall
for a patient.

746
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,580
Oh. Okay.

747
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,980
Good luck with that.

748
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,640
Find a penny,pick it up

749
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,870
and all day long,
you'll have good luck.

750
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,930
o'malley...

751
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,740
you are a sad excuse for a man.

752
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,830
Excuse me?

753
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,820
I know you heard me.
You're like a whiny little girl.

754
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,750
Alex...

755
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
you know why he's not
speaking to you.

756
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,990
Because he's not over you.

757
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,080
Man,you got laid.
It went badly.

758
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,780
A man would move on.

759
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,920
But you--you mope
around this place like a dog

760
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,530
that likes to get kicked.

761
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,960
You make me sick!

762
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,780
And if it wouldn't get me
thrown outta the program,

763
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,000
I'd smash your pathetic little face
right into that locker.

764
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,430
No one wants to pass up
a chance for good luck.

765
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,540
But does saying it 33 times
really help?

766
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,490
Is anyone really listening?

767
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,800
If you feel that strongly about o'malley,
I'll ask him to leave tonight.

768
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,370
No,don'T.

769
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,040
-I thought you wanted him out.
-I do,but...

770
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,400
not tonight.

771
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,370
Scrub cap.

772
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,490
Oh. Thank you.

773
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,450
And if no one's listening,

774
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,320
why do we bother doing
those strange things at all?

775
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,250
Hi.

776
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,430
I didn't call.
I shoulda called.

777
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,050
I just...

778
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,710
hi...this is
george o'malley calling.

779
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,360
You gave me
your phone number.

780
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,120
I know I shoulda called sooner,
but I'm calling now.

781
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,830
And I just want to know,

782
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,040
maybe you want to go out
with me sometime.

783
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,920
Because...

784
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,440
I...love to watch you
set bones.

785
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,930
And I--oh,I rarely spend

786
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,250
that much time
in a women's restroom.

787
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,210
And...
I really like you.

788
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,750
So...

789
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,570
is that a yes?

790
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,600
We rely on superstitions
because we're smart enough to know

791
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,810
we don't have
all the answers...

792
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,900
-hey.
-Hey.

793
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,740
I'm sorry to hear about
your patient.

794
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,300
Thank you,addison.

795
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,170
And that life works
in mysterious ways.

796
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,490
Here you go,babe.

797
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,600
thank you.

798
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,760
-You ready?
-Yeah.Here you go. Thank you.

799
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,690
Don't dis the juju...

800
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,570
from wherever it comes.
