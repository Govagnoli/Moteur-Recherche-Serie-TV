1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:01,510
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,238
You people are taking a test

3
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,900
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,477
- You want big wedding?
- Yes.

5
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:09,761
I know you think I have
feelings for you, but I don't.

6
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:12,161
Search and rescue
found those lost climbers.

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,757
- One's still missing.
- Tell me the truth.

8
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:15,658
Do you remember?
Do you know who you are?

9
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,930
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

10
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:20,100
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

11
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,476
- You're adopting?
- She hasn't actually picked us yet.

12
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:23,903
This heartburn, it's like it...

13
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:27,953
- Fourth climber.
- Is that an ax in his head?

14
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:31,096
If Richard finds out that
you're carrying another man's baby...

15
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,159
Somebody help!

16
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,107
<i>Being chief
is about responsibility.</i>

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,728
Every single surgical patient
in the hospital is your patient,

18
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:46,516
whether you're the one
who cut them open or not.

19
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:49,473
Come on. She's lost a lot of blood.
<i>The scalpel stops with you.</i>

20
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:53,129
Start 2 large bore I.V's
and bolus 2 liters L.R.

21
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:54,946
You need to be able
to look at a family...

22
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,749
Ready? One, two...

23
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:59,116
And tell them your team
did everything they could

24
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,393
to save someone's child...

25
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:02,636
Get me a stat E.K.G.
And a portable chest, Brooke.

26
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:05,393
- She's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.
- Their husband...

27
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,412
You guys, why don't you go have
a seat in the waiting room?

28
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,445
We're not leaving her.

29
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,713
Their wife.

30
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,900
What happened?

31
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,895
I don't know.
I found her unconscious.

32
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,036
You get caught up...

33
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,482
Taking care
of other people' families.

34
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,016
She's lost blood,
a-a lot of blood.

35
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:26,373
And the responsibility,
it makes you...

36
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,910
I didn't know
she was in the hospital.

37
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,157
What was she doing here?

38
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,471
You take care
of other people's families...

39
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:37,539
<i>And you sacrifice your own.</i>

40
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:41,454
I thought I was gonna hate this party
game thing, but it's kinda great.

41
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,539
Can we set her on fire after?

42
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,920
No, we cannot.

43
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,220
Okay, these wedding vows
are not all gonna fit on here.

44
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,460
- Okay, then write smaller.
- Be still, please.

45
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,380
- "vow" just became "cow."
- You don't need vows on your hand.

46
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:54,159
When you get up there,
just speak from the heart.

47
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,887
Izzie,
the heart is an organ.

48
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:00,571
It pumps, it circulates blood,
it gets clogged from time to time.

49
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,578
It does not, however, speak.
It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.

50
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,446
Well, you're all
"glass totally empty."

51
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,301
I'm gonna like being married.

52
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,493
It's the wedding part
that's ridiculous.

53
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:13,747
- Party's over.
- Damn.

54
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,138
Hey, mine didn't go off.

55
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,895
Piece of crap.

56
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:20,754
You can do this, right?

57
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:23,159
Become a piece of chattel?
Sure. Looking forward to it.

58
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,934
I mean, no matter what,

59
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,925
you're walking down
that aisle today.

60
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,271
I need you
to go down that aisle.

61
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,757
Is the toilet paper
cutting off your circulation?

62
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,597
You marrying Burke,
it's a sign.

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,734
It's a sign that people
like you and me... can do this.

64
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,658
Be healthy, be happy.

65
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,362
You marrying Burke,

66
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,513
restores my faith in me.

67
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,918
Oh, I get it.

68
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,489
My wedding's about you.

69
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,645
- Yes.
- Okay.

70
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:49,292
You can do this, right?

71
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,653
I can do this.

72
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:56,069
Hey. They found
the fourth climber.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,427
Vitals are stabilizing
after fluids, but...

74
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,145
- Thought he was dead.
- He was according to his friends.

75
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,866
- Did the C.T. show a bleed?
- Uh, we haven't done a C.T. Yet.

76
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:04,300
I don't understand.
You said there's a head trauma.

77
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,498
Yeah, there's been
a little head trauma.

78
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:08,138
Ice ax to the head.

79
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,217
What the hell happened
up on that mountain?

80
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,512
That's a good question.

81
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:21,076
You don't think it could be
uterine cancer, do you?

82
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:22,933
It runs in the family.

83
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,088
No, it's not...

84
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,736
She was in earlier.
She was in a fender bender.

85
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:32,361
My wife came into my hospital,
and you neglected to tell me?

86
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,976
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

87
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,897
We're still married.
She's unconscious.

88
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,010
There are medical decisions
to be made.

89
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,550
Legally I have a right to know.
I have a right...

90
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,647
She might...

91
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,202
be having a miscarriage.

92
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:47,997
She's pregnant.

93
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,002
I need to know what time
your chest pain started.

94
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,277
I don't know.

95
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,667
Yesterday afternoon.

96
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,241
What time exactly?
This is important.

97
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,883
Around 3:00.

98
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:05,931
What's wrong with me?

99
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,676
I'm gonna explain everything
to you. I promise.

100
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,465
But right now we need to get you
up to the surgical floor.

101
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:13,606
Surgery? But...

102
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,594
What about my babies?

103
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,383
I think those babies
are coming out today.

104
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,173
But I-I haven't decided.
I...

105
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:25,369
I haven't chosen the parents.
I need time to decide.

106
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,809
You don't need to decide
anything right now.

107
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,187
Right now
the most important thing

108
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,784
is making sure
that you are okay.

109
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:35,979
All right?

110
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,092
Ah, I've got a surgery,

111
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,825
but it shouldn't be more
than four hours, five tops.

112
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,534
- I can scrub in.
- How's Rina?

113
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,077
I need to get a C.T. angio,

114
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,988
but I'm pretty sure
it's a tear in her aorta.

115
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,342
Her heart is about to blow.

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,877
Most dissecting aortas
burst within 48 hours.

117
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,672
Which means we have
less than 12 hours

118
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,198
- to fix it before she's dead.
- So you need me to get the babies out.

119
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:00,579
- So I can save her life.
- You have an aortic dissection?

120
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,184
Hey, I promise I will make it
to the chapel in time.

121
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:07,124
I...

122
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,240
Okay.

123
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,256
Listen up. Uh, O'Malley,
you're with Shepherd and Sloan.

124
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,819
Stevens, you're with Burke.
Karev, Addison. Go.

125
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,139
Grey...

126
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,565
You are with the chief's wife.

127
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,525
- The chief's wife?
- Is pregnant.

128
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:21,998
Yes, I did say pregnant.

129
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:23,956
I recommend that you lose
the shocked look

130
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,914
and try for something
a little more dignified.

131
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:27,984
Go.

132
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:30,189
Who am I on?

133
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,209
Uh, I didn't page you.
Go home. Get some sleep.

134
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:34,409
Yeah,
but I'm here already, so...

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,105
You're getting married
in less than 12 hours.

136
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,257
Give us room.

137
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:40,573
Well, Burke's getting married, too,

138
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,042
- and he gets to operate.
- There's only one preston Burke.

139
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,271
There's only one
Cristina Yang.

140
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,015
I've given you the day off,
the whole day.

141
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,855
It's a kindness. Take it.
It's your wedding day.

142
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,846
- There'll always be more surgeries.
- But...

143
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,626
Really, what would you
rather be doing,

144
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,457
prepping a patient
or prepping for your wedding?

145
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,593
Go home.

146
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,311
I never got the sense
you really wanted the job.

147
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,470
Seems to me you got in the race
to play out

148
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:13,226
some kind of unfinished business
you had with Derek.

149
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,089
I was in this to win.

150
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,584
Sir. I don't know
if he's your new chief,

151
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:23,191
but if he is, he got there
because I made him fight for it.

152
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,444
You made them all
fight for it.

153
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,526
So I'm not gonna be chief.

154
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:31,556
No, you're not.

155
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,135
They recovered Lonnie's body?

156
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,572
Not his body. He's alive.

157
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:42,440
So why don't you tell me what really
happened up there on the mountain?

158
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,834
We're half way up this ice wall.

159
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,886
There's a...

160
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:56,451
There's a ledge a couple
of huned feet above us.

161
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,014
We figured
we'd set up the tents,

162
00:06:58,677 --> 00:06:59,836
wait out the storm.

163
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,438
Only Lonnie's insisting
we go down the mountain.

164
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,625
I told him,
we gotta dig in,

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,380
sit tight.

166
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,479
He started freaking out,

167
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:09,928
keeps saying
down's the way to go.

168
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,779
And then, he starts climbing down.

169
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:13,313
We were tied together.

170
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,077
- And just like that...
- We're falling.

171
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,635
I swing out with my ice ax,

172
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,785
just trying to catch a rock.

173
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,848
And I clip Lonnie
in the back of the head.

174
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:25,889
Ax just...

175
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,369
snags.

176
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:30,658
We thought he was dead.

177
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:35,454
It was an accident.

178
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,337
What happened?

179
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,723
You've been unconscious
for a while.

180
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:49,903
- What about...
- He knows.

181
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,189
Adele, you lost a lot of blood.

182
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,566
I'm gonna try to find
a heartbeat.

183
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,888
You should prepare yourself.

184
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:06,188
Heartbeat.

185
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,860
It's a little slower,
than I'd like,

186
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:13,259
but once we tank you
with liquids and a transfusion,

187
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,717
it might get stronger.

188
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,734
Um, I've gotta rush off
to surgery,

189
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:19,640
but I will back with you
the minute I'm done.

190
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,251
- Thank you.
- Okay.

191
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,602
Adele, why didn't you tell me?

192
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,400
Come on, Richard.

193
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,185
What do you think
you would've done,

194
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,185
congratulate me?

195
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,753
I'm sure you have work to do.

196
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,075
I'm good right here.

197
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,091
The peds resident's on call.

198
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,644
He'll be in the O.R.
For Rina's delivery.

199
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:56,518
Great. Just make sure
they notified the nicu.

200
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,161
Hi. Sorry for interrupting.

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,452
Uh, the nurse said that
you're Dr. Montgomery.

202
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,983
Yes.
Can I help you with something?

203
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,317
Yeah, I'm Jeff Pope...

204
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,777
Rebecca's husband?

205
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:34,797
Rebecca?

206
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,358
Hi, Jeff.

207
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:55,077
You, uh...

208
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:58,256
Your face...

209
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,423
But it's you.

210
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,023
I'm so sorry, baby.

211
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:16,789
I should've never let you go.

212
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,127
I'll never let you go again.

213
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:25,748
- I have a surgery.
- I heard you're the best man.

214
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,498
Well, maid of honor,
best man, kinda perfect.

215
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:34,064
I know I haven't been myself lately,
but I'm me again,

216
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,739
so I was thinking maybe
you should sleep over,

217
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:38,308
because the me that I am
is horny for the you that you are.

218
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:39,662
I met a woman last night.

219
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,768
- You met a woman last night?
- At Joe's.

220
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:45,437
Nothing happened.

221
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,061
She was pretty,
I noticed, and we talked.

222
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:50,658
- You met a woman last night?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,762
So should I be
worried or something?

224
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,053
Should you be worried
that I met a woman? No.

225
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,262
Should you be worried that,

226
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,295
for me, flirting with that woman
was the highlight of my week?

227
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,333
Yeah, you should be
worried or something.

228
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,383
I don't understand.

229
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,002
- It's not you.
- No, I understand that part.

230
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,570
What I don't understand is why.

231
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,768
I need this job, Richard.
I need it more than the others.

232
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:18,622
- Addison...
- No, I need a reason to stay here.

233
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:21,260
I need a reason to get up in the morning
I need to wake up...

234
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,174
and not care that it's raining
or that I'm 39 and alone.

235
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,815
I need the job, Richard.

236
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:28,655
That's why.

237
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,574
If you need a job
to give you a life,

238
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,100
you either need a new job
or a new life.

239
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:47,404
I'm thinking four hours tops
to repair this heart,

240
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:48,948
if all goes well.

241
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:50,897
You're a lucky man, Burke.

242
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,812
Cristina's great.

243
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,214
She's there, she's sure.

244
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,252
She's willing to commit.

245
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,507
You're a lucky man.

246
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,684
And you're not?

247
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,102
There he is.

248
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,886
T-minus five hours.

249
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:07,885
And how's the best man?
Up to the challenge?

250
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:09,914
I was an excellent best man.

251
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,794
The worst case scenario is I sleep
with your wife in ten years.

252
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,707
I just checked. Chief resident
hasn't been posted yet.

253
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:26,020
- I wasn't looking for chief resident.
- Yeah, you were.

254
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,735
Yeah. Okay, I was.

255
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,700
What I'm about to say is,
uh, is crazy.

256
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,329
And, uh, I-I am not responsible.

257
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,257
I-I am saying this
against my will.

258
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,719
Because I am a surgeon, okay?

259
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,382
I-I love my job. I love
my life exactly as it is.

260
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:48,366
Okay? Exactly as it is.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

261
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,387
Not really.

262
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,584
I-I have no desire
to house a human being

263
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:53,964
in my body for nine long months
and then... and then...

264
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,476
And then push it out
and raise it.

265
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,485
- Okay? None. Zero.
- Okay.

266
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,155
Except housing a human,

267
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,897
for nine long months
is all that I can think about.

268
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:04,641
It... It...
The thoughts are invading

269
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:06,374
the surgeries that I love,
and it's...

270
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,158
It's... It's hormonal.

271
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,098
It's... And horrible.

272
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,009
But it is happening...

273
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,034
To me.

274
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,375
You want to have a baby?

275
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:20,698
Apparently.

276
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,624
There's a guy with an ax
in his head.

277
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,141
Right. So go.

278
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:28,558
I'm a freak.
Just go. Just run. Just...

279
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:29,817
- Thank you.
- Please.

280
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:32,508
Go. I'm fine.

281
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,585
Take your pill...
and drink your water.

282
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,986
Richard, you know
you wanna go out that door

283
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,822
and start bossing
some people around.

284
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,456
Take your pill, Adele.

285
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,620
See?

286
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,921
I can do my bossing
right from this chair.

287
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,844
Go ahead, Richard, ask.

288
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,163
I know you are dying to know
whose baby...

289
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,515
Not really my place.

290
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,815
Mrs. Webber...

291
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:08,510
Your room is ready.

292
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,111
Excuse me,
but what do you want to do

293
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,093
about the announcement
for chief of surgery?

294
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,482
Look...

295
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:17,693
I will be right back.

296
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,120
I promise.

297
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,986
We've met before.

298
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:28,540
You probably don't remember.

299
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,072
You were little.

300
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,487
My husband always flirted
with your mother.

301
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,980
I didn't want to see that, so...

302
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,028
I watched you a lot,

303
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,037
watched you grow up.

304
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:46,892
You turned out well.

305
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,192
I'm sorry about your mother.

306
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,212
I'm...

307
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,275
sorry about my mother, too.

308
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:56,539
It wasn't your fault.

309
00:14:56,856 --> 00:14:58,739
Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.

310
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,473
You get married at 25
thinking, this is it,

311
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,444
happily ever after.

312
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,878
Maybe there is
no happily ever after.

313
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,450
It's stunning.

314
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,308
It's a little...

315
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,156
Um, is it supposed to be so tight?

316
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,021
Well, it's a choker.

317
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,529
It's beautiful.

318
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,633
It's really, really beautiful.

319
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:26,703
I just don't know if it's me.

320
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,924
Five generations of Burke women

321
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,502
have worn this
on their wedding day.

322
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:33,557
It's a way of...

323
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,918
joing our family,
becoming a Burke.

324
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:38,626
A Burke.

325
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,821
I'm afraid
I misjudged you early on.

326
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,122
I thought you were selfish.

327
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,521
But you've given way

328
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,393
to Preston's ideas
about the wedding,

329
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,706
and you've been flexible
about the things that are...

330
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,807
most important to him.

331
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,914
And that is wonderful.

332
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:58,472
Oh! It's just...

333
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,996
What were you planning to do
about your eyebrows?

334
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,312
Nothing.

335
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:11,638
How's she doing?

336
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,008
B.P.'s 92 over 56.

337
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,925
How'd the reunion go

338
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,768
- with Jane Doe's husband?
- Whatever.

339
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,677
He cried like a baby.
She looked bored.

340
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:22,392
Don't go overboard
with compassion, Karev.

341
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,638
She's not even sure
if she wants to stay with the guy.

342
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,298
- It's complicated.
- It's not actually... complicated.

343
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:29,819
They're married.
She took a vow.

344
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,995
You don't mess with vows.
Married is married.

345
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,204
Game over.
So freakin' over.

346
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,465
Just an opinion.

347
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,277
Pressure's dropped to 60.

348
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,982
She's bleeding out.
Addison, how much longer?

349
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,128
Rupturing the membrane now.

350
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,766
I just need 2 minutes
to get these babies out.

351
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:47,573
Make it one. She's flatlined.
Stevens, start compressions.

352
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:49,599
Got the first one out.
Clamp.

353
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,046
Come on, come on.

354
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,302
Second baby's out.
Okay, go.

355
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:54,353
Boki, 10-blade.

356
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,115
Poor guy...
he just wanted to climb a mountain,

357
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,322
and he ends up
with an ax in his head.

358
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:06,033
He shouldn't have tried turning back.

359
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,216
The group is going up,
you move with the group.

360
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:09,897
- Okay, drill, please.
- He panicked.

361
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,833
You have a right to turn back
if you're scared.

362
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,833
No, you don't.
You chose to climb a mountain.

363
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,049
You can't change your mind
in the middle of the climb.

364
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,134
Okay.
Now we pull it out?

365
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,125
Ah, yeah, but the ax went in
as they fell,

366
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,844
so there will be some tearing,

367
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,322
it should be a shallow wound,

368
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,135
and it should come out easily.

369
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,219
You got it?

370
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,381
All right, everybody.
Here we go. Ready?

371
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,461
Okay, one, two...

372
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,118
three.

373
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:47,439
That's strange.

374
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,576
One...

375
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,327
two...

376
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:53,625
Three!

377
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,490
That's a clean cut.

378
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,320
Thought you said
there was gonna be tearing.

379
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,293
I know.
It doesn't make sense.

380
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:07,805
You are a lucky guy.

381
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,422
Or the ax didn't go in there
by accident.

382
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,775
It's probably unfair,

383
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,240
but I hold you
to a higher standard.

384
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,646
And you let me down
this year, Preston.

385
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:26,755
After you got shot,
the tremor...

386
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,742
This job is about making
the tough calls.

387
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,180
Sometime the toughest call
you can make

388
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,136
is admitting
when you're in over your head.

389
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:37,873
You don't do that.

390
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:40,741
You know a lot, Preston.

391
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,276
You're one of the best surgeons
I know...

392
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,504
One of the best men.

393
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,924
But you're not perfect.

394
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,687
You don't know everything.

395
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,472
I want to give you the job.

396
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,136
I want to.

397
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,261
But I can't.

398
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:15,333
Preston.

399
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:17,730
I have a wedding to get to.

400
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:23,277
Thank you.

401
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:25,026
Yeah. The babies are doing great.

402
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,219
They're in the nicu.

403
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,928
How are you doing up there,
Preston?

404
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,740
Close call, but she's stabilized.

405
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,102
Good work, Dr. Burke.

406
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:33,401
We may actually get you
to the church on time.

407
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:34,946
You nervous?

408
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,604
No, not really.
More, uh...

409
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:39,728
excited.

410
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,121
Um, except by my vows.

411
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,299
I wrote them myself, and...

412
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:48,239
I don't know.
They may be too...

413
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,677
- I want 'em to be right.
- Well, let's hear 'em.

414
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,992
- What, now?
- You've got a room full of women.

415
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,204
Try it out on us.

416
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:07,888
Cristina...

417
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,555
I could promise...

418
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,535
to hold you...

419
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,348
and to cherish you.

420
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:21,671
I could promise to be there
in sickness and in health.

421
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,194
I could say...

422
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,155
till death do us part.

423
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,597
But I won't.

424
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,055
Those vows...

425
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:35,739
are for optimistic couples,

426
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:37,728
the ones full of hope.

427
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:40,872
And I do not stand here
on my wedding day,

428
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,946
opmistic...

429
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,608
or full of hope.

430
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,426
Okay, um...

431
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,993
I am not optimistic.

432
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:51,986
I am not hopeful.

433
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,409
I am sure.

434
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,877
I am steady.

435
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,594
And I know.

436
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,209
I am a heart man.

437
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,173
I take 'em apart.

438
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,413
I put 'em back together.

439
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,304
I hold them in my hands.

440
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,840
I am a heart man.

441
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,039
So of this I am sure...

442
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,573
You are my partner...

443
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:27,961
My lover...

444
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,268
My very best friend.

445
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:34,441
My heart...
My heart... beats for you.

446
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:36,890
And on this day,

447
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,073
the day of our wedding,

448
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,185
I promise you this...

449
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:43,753
I promise you...

450
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,691
to lay my heart
in the palm of your hands.

451
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:52,246
I promise you... Me.

452
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,422
Too trite?
Because I can rewrite it...

453
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,438
No.

454
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,793
No. It's...

455
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,843
I think I speak for...

456
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,615
every woman in this room

457
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,826
when I say dump her.

458
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,532
Dump Yang and marry me.

459
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,115
Hey. Oh, god.
Did I miss a page?

460
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,052
No, no, no, no, no.
Everything's okay.

461
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,093
What?

462
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:41,784
Is this really what you want?

463
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:46,661
'Cause if it's really
what you want, we could do it.

464
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,021
- Really?
- Yeah.

465
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:57,096
Okay, wait. Really?

466
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:58,393
Really.

467
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,126
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

468
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,400
- Really.
- Really.

469
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:14,445
She looks like Rebecca.

470
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,209
Well, at least what
Rebecca used to look like.

471
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,372
But still...

472
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:22,900
around the eyes.

473
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,305
Yeah.

474
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:26,002
I thought
I'd give her some space.

475
00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:28,198
She seemed a little overwhelmed.

476
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,893
The ferry crash
was on the news everywhere.

477
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,483
Your wife goes missing...

478
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,127
How could you
not look for her?

479
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,115
I thought she left me.

480
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:49,681
We got into a fight that night.

481
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,472
She was trying to tell me
how unhappy she was and...

482
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,234
I shut her down.

483
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,274
Yeah, I didn't look for her
when she was missing,

484
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,542
but what's worse is...

485
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:03,686
I didn't see her
when she was there.

486
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,435
I can't imagine

487
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,078
what it must have
been like for her,

488
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,121
what her face must have
looked like all broken.

489
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:12,687
She was beautiful.

490
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,571
I... I love her.

491
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,170
You know?

492
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:43,345
Meredith.

493
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:46,493
You are not gonna believe...

494
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,305
Derek met a girl...

495
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,124
In a bar.

496
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:52,832
And he flirted with her.
And he told me.

497
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:55,144
You know, no big deal.
Just thought I should know.

498
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:57,189
- Meredith.
- I'm not exaggerating.

499
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:59,662
He didn't even hint.
He just flat out told me.

500
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,484
Meredith, you know how
sometimes it's about you,

501
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,751
and sometimes it's about me?

502
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:05,934
This is really,
really about me.

503
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:10,030
Mama took my eyebrows.

504
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:12,076
She took my eyebrows,

505
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,861
and now I am a Burke.

506
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,529
Lonnie's stable...

507
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,383
But the damage he sustained
is significant.

508
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,543
But is he gonna wake up?

509
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,185
- Do you want him to?
- What?

510
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:32,393
The ax in his head
was put there deliberately.

511
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:36,345
I just wanted to give you three guys
another oportunity to tell me the truth.

512
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,354
- It wasn't...
- Shut up, Andy.

513
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:45,842
- But we can't just sit here...
- I said shut up, Andy.

514
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:49,070
Is that how you let him
talk to you at 14,000 feet?

515
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,253
I have to talk to his family.

516
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:52,850
You guys can talk to the cops.

517
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,902
Dr. Bailey.

518
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,418
Yeah. What?

519
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:08,362
Cristina needs to cut something.

520
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,785
I can't really explain it

521
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,410
in a way
that won't make you glare.

522
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,407
But... they took her eyebrows

523
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,999
and they called her a Burke.

524
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:19,276
She really needs
to cut somebody open.

525
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:20,737
Yang...

526
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,084
Go... do...
getting married things.

527
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:27,299
Get out of this hospital.

528
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,075
Hey!

529
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:33,253
I mean... hey.

530
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,223
I...

531
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,339
You have to let me cut,

532
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:42,507
because I am standing here
eyebrowless with no dignity left.

533
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,467
I am a surgeon, Dr. Bailey.

534
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,137
But right now
I don't feel like one.

535
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:47,348
I feel...

536
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,508
like...

537
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,028
somebody else.

538
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:54,478
Do you know what that's like,

539
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:56,928
not to feel like yourself?

540
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:03,911
Yeah.

541
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,244
- Oh!
- What's going on?

542
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:09,819
She started cramping and then
she got really diaphoretic.

543
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,664
Alert O.B. to a possible D&C,

544
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:14,476
due to an incomplete miscarriage.

545
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,611
Adele, you could have

546
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,588
a placental abruption
due to the trauma.

547
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:20,504
We've got to get you
to into an O.R. Now.

548
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,213
Let's move, people!

549
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,541
Sir, Dr. Shepherd is here.

550
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:35,020
Thank you.

551
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,578
Richard, are you sure
you want to...

552
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,137
You don't have to do this today.

553
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,074
Yes, I do.

554
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:54,975
She went into early D.I.C.

555
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,788
I gave her blood,
platelets, F.F.P,

556
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:01,192
pregnancy at 52 is dangerous.

557
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:04,253
I tried everything.
I couldn't save...

558
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:24,769
I thought...

559
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:27,532
I thought...

560
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,324
For a second,
I thought I'd lost you.

561
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:37,436
Do you want to...

562
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,911
call somebody? I can...

563
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:41,320
No, no one.

564
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,605
Well, the father of the baby,
maybe you want to...

565
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:47,488
He doesn't even know about it.
I didn't tell him.

566
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,465
I, um...

567
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:51,390
I think I misjudged him.

568
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,292
I thought he'd go running
for the hills.

569
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,254
But actually...

570
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:01,441
He's a much better man
than I thought.

571
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,105
He'll get over his initial judgments,
and he'll...

572
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:07,986
sit with you...

573
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,416
And he'll make you drink
your water.

574
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,228
Adele...

575
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:23,944
It was a boy.

576
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,102
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:38,100
All right, Dr. Leonard,

578
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:39,649
would you please close
for Dr. Burke?

579
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,916
He has a wedding to get to.

580
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:43,958
One cut, and then you're gone.

581
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:45,037
One.

582
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:46,460
But... But I still have to...

583
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,704
Come on. You want your bride
waiting for you at the altar?

584
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,131
They don't like that.
Let's go.

585
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:53,133
We gotta go now, Cristina.

586
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,458
- Grey.
- Put the scalpel down, Cristina.

587
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,305
you can still do this, right?

588
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,018
What?

589
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:15,727
Hold on a minute.

590
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:25,071
I just wanted to make sure
no one's around so I can say this.

591
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,808
I think we've said everything
we need to say.

592
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:27,944
Shut up.

593
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:29,662
I am an optimist.

594
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:32,932
I am hopeful.

595
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:34,782
I am not sure.

596
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,810
- Look, I can do this myself.
- Let me speak.

597
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,189
Because I'm your best friend,

598
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,029
and because I love you,

599
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,499
if what you want
is to be with Callie,

600
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,882
then I will do everything
in my power to support you

601
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,830
and help you
make your marriage work.

602
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:58,149
But because
I'm your best friend...

603
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,510
and because I love you...

604
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,391
I also have to say...

605
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,841
that I'm in love with you.

606
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,325
I'm in love with you.

607
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:21,127
I can't promise the future,
I can't....

608
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:25,019
promise perfection because
we're us and I'm me,

609
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:26,938
and who knows what will happen.

610
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:30,684
But in my heart...

611
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,266
I am sure.

612
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,769
I'm in love with you, George.

613
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:40,566
And I hope
you're in love with me, too.

614
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,635
Say something.

615
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,531
- What time is it?
- You got 30 minutes.

616
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,367
Crap. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding.

617
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,747
No, you're not.

618
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,493
Dr. Burke asked me
to check on you.

619
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:02,636
Let's see. Your, um...

620
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,281
Your post-op X-rays look good.

621
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,821
We'll discuss releasing you.

622
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,633
- Any change in Lonnie?
- Andy?

623
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:09,700
Who are you?

624
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:11,512
He's my lawyer.

625
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:15,220
- That was fast.
- Don't you dare judge me.

626
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:17,728
You weren't there.

627
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:20,893
We thought...
he was almost dead.

628
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,959
No way he was gonna make it.

629
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:25,703
He was in so much pain.

630
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:29,789
So I...

631
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:32,495
picked it up...

632
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:33,954
- Andy, shut up.
- No!

633
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:36,606
I'm not gonna shut up.

634
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:41,798
I put him out of his misery.

635
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:47,874
And if I was back there
right now...

636
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:50,954
I'd do the same thing.

637
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:53,867
He was my friend.

638
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:56,914
He is my friend.

639
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,121
I put him out of his misery.

640
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:07,398
Anyone got any deodorant?

641
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,482
Um, you're not putting my
deodorant in your hairy armpits.

642
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:10,881
Don't move.
You're gonna have a unibrow.

643
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,104
And I have some in my locker.

644
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:14,719
Uh, closed? Open?

645
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:16,131
Closed.

646
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,619
Perfect. Dashing.

647
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,864
- Thanks.
- You look great.

648
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:23,132
- Moment of truth, people.
- Those our scores?

649
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:24,277
Grey.

650
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:25,769
Karev. Yang.

651
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:27,216
Stevens.

652
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:29,459
- O'Malley.
- Yes!

653
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:30,610
Right here, baby.

654
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,258
Yes. Thank god.

655
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:37,094
- Did you pass?
- You bet your married booty, I did.

656
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,004
- How'd you do? Did you pass?
- Yeah.

657
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,884
I'll talk to you
at the church.

658
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,224
All right. Let's go.

659
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:49,848
Excuse me.

660
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:52,092
Meredith.

661
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,634
I'll meet you at the chapel.

662
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,042
Iz, will you take the dress?

663
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:56,843
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

664
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,660
I like the suit.

665
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:07,933
The suit is way better
than the scrubs.

666
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,066
Thanks.
Hey, uh, I passed my intern exam.

667
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,214
- Good!
- Yeah.

668
00:34:12,242 --> 00:34:13,303
That's good.

669
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,977
We got discharged,
me and the baby.

670
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:25,390
Oh, come on, you just...
You just had brain surgery.

671
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,713
You're still on antibiotics.

672
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:29,034
My body's been signed off on by...

673
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:31,457
plastics, cardio...

674
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,410
orthopedics, neuro and O.B.,
and my...

675
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,802
And also, my teeth
got the blessing from...

676
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:38,169
Wait, I can say this...
Prosthodontics.

677
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,313
But there's still your memory...

678
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:40,582
You know how I know
my memory's fine?

679
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,169
Because I can say prosthodontics.

680
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:45,386
- Yeah, but the baby...
- Discharged, by peds.

681
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,302
Yeah, but...

682
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,240
I have every reason to go.

683
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,752
And... And yeah, I'm scared.

684
00:34:57,753 --> 00:35:00,063
And yeah, this is...
this is moving at warp speed.

685
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:02,598
And yeah, I'm freaking out,
but Jeff is good.

686
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,657
And... And Jeff is
the father of my child.

687
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:07,259
The man is out buying
a car seat right now.

688
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,178
And the minute he gets back...

689
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:13,677
I-I have every reason to go,

690
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:15,358
because medically...

691
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,334
there's no need
for me to stay.

692
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:20,998
Medically.

693
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:28,370
Okay. Well, then I'll just
check the chart. And just...

694
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:30,028
- Damn it.
- We got, uh...

695
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,506
- What?
- Are you...

696
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,693
Do I... Do I have to spell
everything out for you?

697
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:38,819
I mean, did... did you sniff
too much glue as a child?

698
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:40,389
I'm asking you something here.

699
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,394
What do you want from me?

700
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:45,873
I want...

701
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,607
I want you to give me
a reason to stay...

702
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
A real reason.

703
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,543
I mean, Jeff's...

704
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:58,181
Jeff's a decent guy,
a good, decent guy.

705
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:00,773
But to him, I'm Rebecca,

706
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:04,650
and I don't know
if I am Rebecca anymore and...

707
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,659
You know me. You knew--

708
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,771
You knew when I couldn't
even speak who I was.

709
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:11,968
You...

710
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,794
You named me Ava,
and I was more me...

711
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:16,757
as Ava...

712
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,420
then I'll ever be as Rebecca.

713
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:22,630
Look, I-I have every reason
to go back to my life.

714
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:25,647
And I will.

715
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,565
Unless... you...

716
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,976
Alex, I'm asking you to give me
a reason to stay here...

717
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,117
A reason from you.

718
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,738
Jeff loves you. He's a...

719
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,692
He's a decent guy.

720
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,175
Alex, give me a reason.

721
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,091
I think you should stay
with the decent guy.

722
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,245
If you want to break up
with me

723
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,743
so you can see other women,
just do it.

724
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,739
Don't tell me you met
another woman.

725
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:22,522
Just end it
if that's what you want.

726
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:24,641
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

727
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,164
Here's how it goes...

728
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:29,139
Meredith, I don't want
to see you anymore.

729
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,524
Meredith,
I don't love you anymore.

730
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:32,590
Meredith...

731
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:36,304
I do love you.

732
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:38,812
Don't you see?

733
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,371
Don't you understand?

734
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,253
You're the lover of my life.

735
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,688
I can't leave you.

736
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:51,413
But you're constantly leaving me.

737
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,974
You walk away when you want,
you come back when you want.

738
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:56,786
Not everyone,

739
00:37:57,796 --> 00:38:00,068
not your friends,
but you leave me.

740
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,129
So I'm asking you...

741
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:08,918
If you don't see a future for us,
if you aren't in this...

742
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:12,701
Please...

743
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:15,320
Please just end it,
cause I can't.

744
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,381
I'm in it.

745
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:20,982
Put me out of my misery.

746
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,062
I... I can't.

747
00:38:28,091 --> 00:38:30,626
I...
Cristina is getting married.

748
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,097
I have to go
make sure she gets married.

749
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,167
Meredith...

750
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,236
I really need to make sure
she gets down that aisle.

751
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,663
Let's go.
We're running late.

752
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,022
You okay?

753
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:01,041
I'm fine. I'm fine.

754
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,309
You need anything?

755
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,866
Need a mint, huh?
A getaway car?

756
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,197
If it's the chief thing,
don't worry about it.

757
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,230
You deserve it.

758
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:12,873
Richard didn't pick me
to be chief.

759
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,617
We all assumed you...

760
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:20,402
- Well, who did he pick?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

761
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:24,721
You really don't...

762
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:26,460
look so good.

763
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,157
Meredith and I
may not make it.

764
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,701
I think I want it
more than she does.

765
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,998
But today's your day.
It's all about you today.

766
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:38,187
You really are
a good best man.

767
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,234
I try.

768
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:42,574
Cristina.

769
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,722
I didn't run.

770
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:54,794
You look beautiful.

771
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,230
I'm proud of you.

772
00:39:58,748 --> 00:39:59,800
Thank you.

773
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,124
Frankly, I always feared...

774
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:05,499
you were too emotionally
stunted to settle down.

775
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,044
You can do this.

776
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,815
I've always found it confusing.

777
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:18,413
If you know both the bride and
the groom which side do you sit on?

778
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,878
I look for the hottest chick
in the room

779
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:22,473
- and sit next to her.
- Stop.

780
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,513
Wanna ditch the reception,
grab a drink instead?

781
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:25,592
Stop it.

782
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:28,132
You don't want me.

783
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:29,297
Maybe I do.

784
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:30,454
No, you don't.

785
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:33,637
You want Ava.

786
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:34,858
She's not Ava anymore.

787
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,651
She's Rebecca now,
and I barely know her.

788
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:39,170
Look at me.

789
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,612
Look at me.

790
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:43,808
You suck.

791
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:45,737
To me, you suck.

792
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:48,253
I kind of... hate you.

793
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,242
But, Alex...

794
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:53,260
We do not get
unlimited chances,

795
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,977
to have the things we want.
And this...

796
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:57,488
I know...

797
00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:00,906
Nothing is worse
than missing an opportunity

798
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,488
that could've
changed your life.

799
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,649
And no matter
what her name is,

800
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,742
she'll always be Ava to you.

801
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,103
Dr. Bailey.

802
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,512
You didn't go
to the wedding either.

803
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:18,638
No.

804
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:25,572
I am... so sorry, George.

805
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,103
So, um...

806
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,308
What do I do now?

807
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:37,448
You fail your intern test,
you have two options.

808
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,532
You can...

809
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:42,873
walk away from being
a surgical resident altogether,

810
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,711
or you can start
from the very beginning.

811
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:49,144
Repeat my internship?

812
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,636
No.

813
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:56,186
I can't.

814
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,472
I can't.

815
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,866
Did I... Did I fail you...

816
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:18,520
George?

817
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:19,933
No.

818
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:24,504
No.

819
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:28,793
I failed you.

820
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,384
It looks so pretty in there.

821
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:44,459
I see Burke.

822
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,214
Yang...
The twins looks nice in that dress.

823
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:50,470
Thank you. Sort of.

824
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:52,592
- I gotta go. I gotta check...
- You're on call?

825
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:54,714
Wait, alex.
Did you see George in there?

826
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:57,161
I don't see him.

827
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,538
He's, uh...
Probably gonna be late.

828
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:01,783
We had kind of a big,
emotional day.

829
00:43:01,943 --> 00:43:03,041
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

830
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,661
Did something happen
between you two? I mean...

831
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,695
No. It's just that I was
named chief resident.

832
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,635
Plus we decided
to have a baby, so...

833
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:13,126
- A baby?
- Yeah, we're trying.

834
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,408
We tried today, in fact.

835
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:17,192
Yeah. Big day.

836
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:24,623
- Okay, this is it.
- Yeah.

837
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:25,919
- Okay?
- Yeah.

838
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,224
- You have the bouquet.
- Yeah.

839
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:28,473
- I have the ring.
- Yeah.

840
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:30,120
You remember your vows?

841
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,453
- Okay.
- I wrote them on my...

842
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:33,940
Oh, my god...

843
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:36,579
I scrubbed in.

844
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:39,899
I scrubbed in, and the vows were on
my hand. I scrubbed off my vows.

845
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:41,902
- Oh, okay. Um...
- Okay, hello?

846
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:43,101
I scrubbed off my vows.

847
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:44,725
I-I can't do this.
I don't have any...

848
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:46,110
I don't have anything
on my hand!

849
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,553
I should go see
what's going on.

850
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,543
Well,
Cristina wouldn't be Cristina

851
00:43:57,562 --> 00:43:58,970
if she didn't need
a little push.

852
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:02,329
There are no words
in my head. Okay?

853
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,639
I have no vows.
No vows.

854
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:05,471
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

855
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,657
You know what?
Stop saying that!

856
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:08,656
- Will you say sometng else?
- Like what?

857
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:10,355
Say something
that is gonna help me.

858
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:12,171
Okay, okay! I...

859
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,684
Meredith, please.
You know what? Say something.

860
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:17,543
Say... I don't know what.
Say... Say... Okay.

861
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,848
Say what I would say to you
if you were me.

862
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,031
- Okay.
- Good.

863
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:23,373
- Got it.
- Good, go.

864
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:26,293
Stop whining.

865
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,875
This is your wedding day.

866
00:44:28,076 --> 00:44:30,254
You will go down that aisle
and you will get married.

867
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,929
If have to kick your ass every step
of the way to get you there,

868
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,206
you will walk down the aisle.
You will get married.

869
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:37,260
Do you hear me, Cristina?
We need this.

870
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,670
We need you to get
your happy ending.

871
00:44:42,651 --> 00:44:43,665
Okay, I'm ready.

872
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:44,830
All right, then.

873
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:46,463
My train.

874
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:49,121
I'll go.

875
00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:26,756
I'm ready. I'm fine. I...

876
00:45:26,835 --> 00:45:28,441
Meredith talked me down.
Really I'm fine.

877
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:30,251
Go, go, go.
I'll be right behind you.

878
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:33,147
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:37,668
I can do this.

880
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:39,790
You know, I had a momentary
freak out, but now I'm fine.

881
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:41,996
- I can do this. Go.
- But you don't want to do this.

882
00:45:44,064 --> 00:45:46,219
I'm up there waiting for you
to come down the aisle,

883
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:48,539
and I knew
you don't want to come.

884
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:50,586
I know
you don't want to come

885
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:52,924
but that you'll come anyway
because you love me.

886
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:56,858
And if I loved you...

887
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:59,134
If I loved you,

888
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,657
not the woman
that I'm trying to make you be,

889
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,005
not the woman
that I hope you'll become,

890
00:46:05,038 --> 00:46:06,117
but you...

891
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:08,782
If I did...

892
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,235
I wouldn't be up there
waiting for you.

893
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:16,400
I would be letting you go.

894
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,764
I am wearing the dress.

895
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:24,550
I'm ready.

896
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:28,300
And maybe I didn't want to before,
but I want to now.

897
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,980
I really think I want this.

898
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,356
And I really wish
that you didn't think.

899
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,338
I wish that you knew.

900
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:12,454
It's over.

901
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:15,481
You can all go home.

902
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,363
It's over.

903
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:23,040
It's so over.

904
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:33,263
He's gone.

905
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:37,010
I-I don't think he's gone.

906
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,345
- Uh, his stuff is still here.
- No, it isn't.

907
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:41,936
His trumpet was here.

908
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,995
His entire Eugene Foote collection...

909
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:48,476
Vinyls and cds...

910
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:51,563
His grandmother's picture
was by the bed.

911
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,511
His lucky scrub cap
was hanging on the door.

912
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:05,716
He's gone.

913
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:10,235
I'm...

914
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,727
I'm free.

915
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:17,125
Damn it.

916
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:19,975
Damn it.

917
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:22,270
Damn it. Damn it.

918
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:24,936
Oh, god.
Get this off me.

919
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:27,456
Take this off!
Take this off!

920
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:29,381
Please, just...

921
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,741
Help me, help me, help me!

922
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:14,366
Do we get assigned lockers
here or what?

923
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:15,570
Dude, it stinks in here.

924
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,915
What do you want?
It's a locker room.

925
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,122
No, it's our locker room.

926
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:19,692
You guys, look,
bloody scrubs.

927
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:25,783
- Hi.
- Hi.

928
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:28,853
Come on, you guys.
Let's go check out the cafeteria.

929
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:29,933
Yeah.

930
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:37,989
We're the new interns.

931
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,722
Well, you look seasoned and wise...

932
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,277
Got any advice?

933
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:45,887
No.

934
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:53,471
Learn how to do an appendectomy
start to finish before your first day.

935
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:58,701
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

936
00:50:59,537 --> 00:51:00,600
Better offer?

937
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,307
Just, uh...

938
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,194
You know, life.

939
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:11,536
Anyways, uh,
good luck with...

940
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,921
life, Doctor...

941
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:17,278
My name is George.

942
00:51:17,419 --> 00:51:19,053
I'm lexie. Lexie grey.

943
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:27,091
Congratulations.
You'll make a fine chief.

944
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,421
I'm not the best man
for this job.

945
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:37,712
You're the best man
for this job.

946
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:39,440
What are you talking about,
Derek?

947
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,306
A good chief learns
from his mistakes.

948
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:44,802
I'm still working on that.

949
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:46,079
But you...

950
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:49,822
If you had a chance to do it all over
again, you'd do it differently.

951
00:51:50,662 --> 00:51:52,855
Go ahead.
Do it all over again.

952
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:55,957
Be the best man.
