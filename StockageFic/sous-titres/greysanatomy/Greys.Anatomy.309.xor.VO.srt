3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,055
george's dad
got admitted last night.

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,888
it's just a valve replacement, george

5
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:10,637
burke will do it,and you will clear his schedule.

6
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,712
if someone is gonna operate on my dad's heart,

7
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:13,295
i want it to be burke.

8
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:16,794
dr. hahn here graduated second.

9
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:20,543
adele and i--
she wants me to stop down as chief,retire.

10
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,002
we're starting fresh.

11
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,917
and starti fresh means no sex because?

12
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,375
because  started with sex last time,

13
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,083
and it didn't go very well.

14
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,250
you decannulated a heart this morning.

15
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:33,249
i didn't decannulate-- yes,you did.
and when burke and i were fishing,

16
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,790
i noticed something weird with his hand.

17
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:38,290
i slept with another guy. do i tell george?

18
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,622
callie slept with sloan.

19
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,289
i spent the entire day worrying about burke.

20
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,705
burke is fine. your dad will be fine.

21
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,246
you're lying.

22
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:48,413
burke is hiding something,
and you're helping him. george knows.

23
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:51,620
(heart beating rhythmically)

24
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,410
(cristina) as doctors...

25
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,951
we know everybody's secrets--

26
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:05,075
their medical histories...

27
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,367
sexual histories...

28
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,700
confidential information

29
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:13,365
that is as essential  to a surgeon as 10-blade...

30
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:18,239
and every bit as dangerous.

31
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,655
we keep secrets.

32
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,987
we have to.

33
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:33,611
but noall secrets  can be kept.

34
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,190
6-letter word for pinnacle.

35
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,447

50
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:34,356

51
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,855

54
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,896
and while he was in there,you were waiting outside

55
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,812
because it was your job to drive the getaway car.

56
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:43,728
why would derek rob a bank?

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,977
okay,derek's robbing a bank.

58
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,769
but no one knows you were involved

59
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,310
'cause you were driving the car.

60
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:52,310
okay,derek's in jail,i'm in the mystery car.

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,559
what's the question?

62
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,976
would you turn yourself in,

63
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,975
or would you stay quiet and let derek go down

64
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:59,933
for a robbery in which
you were a complicit participant?

65
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,183
or would you,you know,stand by him?

66
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,765

67
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,806

70
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:18,220
if you just walked away
and let the man you love take the fall?

71
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:22,970
if you tell me,maybe i can help.

72
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:25,927

73
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:28,093

74
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,010

83
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,792
i'm not worried,not anymore.

84
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,500

85
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,959

00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,582
sorry,i'm cranky.

89
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,665
candy striping makes me so cranky.

90
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:23,498
cristina's leaving.

91
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,413
ah,so i can have my girlfriend back.

92
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,953
what's wrong with her?

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,618
why are you acting like the sky is falling?

94
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,034
the sky isn't falling. it already fell. george knows.

95
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,074
i was in surgery for 14 hours yesterday,

96
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,658

97
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,116
yeah,with me by your side,ready to jump in.

98
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:59,448
i haven't had a tremor in a week.
george knows. and this is not any surgery.

99
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:03,447
you are operating on his father today.
i am aware of that,and i am fine.

100
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,113
well,he's gonna do something. i know him.

101
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:08,280
he's not gonna just stand by
and say nothing. there's nothing to say.

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,404
i had a tremor. now i don't.

103
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,862
we need a strategy.

104
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,778
we have to figure out
our story and come up with a plan.

105
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,861
oh,cristina,you're too intense.

106
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,777
i am too intense?

107
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,651
i have been working my ass off

108
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:24,192
making sure nobody here knows,

109
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,192
runninyour board,learning surgical procedures

110
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:29,358

111
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,440

112
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:34,773

113
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,148

114
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,897
we're a team...

115
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:40,647
okay.

116
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,647
a strong team,and i wouldn't be in that o.r.

117
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,563
if i didn't know i could do it,

118
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:45,938
and you just have to trust me on that.

119
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,937
don't let this o'malley thing break you down.

120
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,770

121
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,311

00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,475
plowed through the fish market at the warf.

126
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:07,099
at least a dozen injuries. i need all hands on deck.

127
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,016
all hands? does that mean "all hands,"

128
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,182
or just all hands?

129
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:12,140
stevens,uh,you shouldn't have been paged.

130
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:14,223
you can,uh,go and take over on mr. o'malley.

131
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,056
he's having his surgery today with dr. burke.

132
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,931
uh,that's my case. i'm with burke.

133
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,180

00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,887
you will not handle any instruments.

137
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,012
you will not move or talk or do anything

138
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,761
other than breathe and watch.

139
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,844
candy striping again. no problem.

140
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,344

142
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,717
dr. bailey... um,i just wanted to say,

143
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,759

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,383
so if i have to go...

145
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:46,340
i mean,izzie can't even scrub in,

146
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,674
so if and when my attending asks for me--

147
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,465

00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,408
let's go.

178
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,823
he's crashing. i need suction here.

179
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,822
should we shock him again?

180
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,988
shocking is not gonna help
a heart with no blood to pump.

181
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,779
damn it. there are clots everywhere.

182
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,321
if i could just get better visualization...

183
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,987
(addison) so you said
you were inside of the fish market

184
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:24,444
when this happened? okay,i need you to get her...

185
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,110
ma'am?

186
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,735
ma'am?

187
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:32,650
call it,grey.

188
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,358
time of death--7:53 a.m.

189
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,191
ma'am?

190
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,648
preston burke-- back from the dead.

191
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,605
can't say the same for your patient.

192
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:51,147
ma'am?!

193
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:53,146
ma--i need a stretcher over here.

194
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,937
i think i might be parked in a red zone.

195
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,186
oh! i need a stretcher,please!

196
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:03,477
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

197
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:07,685
<font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@fadeout
sync:frm@mini.f</font>

198
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,934
awesome cuts.

199
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,267
i flew through a window. i flew.

200
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:17,057
karev. stop manhandling my intern. that's my job.

201
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,391
can you tell me your name? janelle duco.

202
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,973
janelle,what do you do for a living?
i sell vegetables at the fish market.

203
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,472
janelle,honey,

204
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,555
can i get you anything? some food maybe?

205
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,638
mrs. dickerson,is that you?

206
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,930
mrs. dickerson,i'm sorry.
you can't be here right now.

207
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,096
larry is a good driver. the car went crazy.

208
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:35,053
janelle,if--if you need anything,

209
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:37,719
i'll be right over here.
oh,i'm sorry. i'm sorry. come with me.

210
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,302
she's my best customer.

211
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,219
she collapsed in my arms.
i just want to make sure she's okay.

212
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,843
you got it from here?
they don't call me "doctor" for nothing.

213
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,509
mr. dickerson is such a nice man.

214
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:50,133
i hope he didn't kill my baby.

215
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,466
addison! she's pregnant.

216
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:58,590
i need an ultrasound.
how far along are you? ten weeks. ow!

217
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,423
sorry.

218
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:02,464
there's glass in there,karev.
try a lighter tough.

219
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,963
the doctors... hot men.

220
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,047
they're all really hot.

221
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,504
they are,aren't they?

222
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:11,336
it's not just
'cause i'm wearing a plate-glass window?

223
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,378
no,they're man-candy.

224
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:18,210
good.

225
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,585
okay,that is nasty.

226
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:23,168
her sats are in the 80s.
i've got to get her oxygen.

227
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,876
and i'm gonna need a portable chest,stat.

228
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,542
i love the bossing. boss more.

229
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:32,374
hey,izzie.

230
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,832
honey,this is izzie. hi.

231
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:38,248
oh,yes. one of the girls who lives with georgie

232
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,247
in some kind of setup there.

233
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,330
it's not some kind of setup.

234
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,329
it's like what they do these days.

235
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:47,371
men and women live together without being...

236
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,203
you know... men and women.

237
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,911
it's like a neutral thing,huh?

238
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,703
so nothing sexual? mom!

239
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,119
no. nothing sexual.

240
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,284
where are the other o'malley men today?

241
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,909
i told 'em to get back to work.

242
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,325
they were climbing the walls in here.
well,i'm here to prep you for surgery.

243
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,574
as you know,dr. burke is your surgeon.
dr. burke--right.

244
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,241
georgie's always saying

245
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,782
"dr. burke this,dr. burke that."
yeah,he's pretty incredible.

246
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:12,698
he's one of the best cardiothoracic guys

247
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,281
in the world. yeah.

248
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,988
um,i have to go. i'm gonna be right back.

249
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:23,321
you're not even working today.
why are you getting paged? i have to go.

250
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,612
you're pretty.

251
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,653
there's nothing sexual between you and georgie,

252
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:30,236
not even a little bit?

253
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:31,486
louise!

254
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:32,653
what?

255
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,651
i just want georgie to be happy.

256
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,234
okay.

257
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:38,817
let's just prep you for surgery.

258
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,859
anything you would've done different,dr. hahn?

259
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,816
given the size of the wound,
i would've given up sooner.

260
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,232
so how have you been,preston?

261
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:49,149
last time i saw you,you stole my patient's heart.

262
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,690
then you got shot. karma rocks.

263
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:53,606
what brings you all the way

264
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,522
from seattle presbyterian to seattle grace?

265
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:58,855
a consult,
and knowing how much my being here would annoy you.

266
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:02,313
oh,on the contrary,it's always a pleasure,

267
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,228
but not as much as when you leave.

268
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:12,351
hey,do you think
i could get in on erica hahn's surgery?

269
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:13,893
i've heard she's amazing. who?

270
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:15,892
dr. hahn. she's doing a consult.

271
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,684
i wonder who the v.i.p. patient is.

272
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,932
um,get him-- get him to c.t

273
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,473
wh--

274
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:31,848
maria,may i have my father's chart?

275
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:35,097
dr. hahn... i was pleasantly surprised

276
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,555
to hear you were joining us today.

277
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,887
oh,well,i'm always
ready to lend a hand,dr. webber.

278
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,887
george. hey,how's your dad?

279
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,844
uh,here is his chart.

280
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,095
he's in room 3975.

281
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,010
it's down the hall,
third door on the right.

282
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,302
i'll be there in a minute. okay.

283
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,010
i'll escort you,and you can tell me

284
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:54,218
what it would take to steal
you away from seattle presbyterian.

285
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:57,591
we could use an extra hand around here.

286
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,008
callie.

287
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:01,007
hey.

288
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:03,715
we broke up. you broke up with me.

289
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,382
unless i'm missing something?

290
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,756
that doesn't mean...

291
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,422
i'm just asking about your dad. why?

292
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:11,214
why do you care?

293
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,671
because i care about you.

294
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:15,712
right. well,i guess
that's why you slept with mark sloan,huh?

295
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,128
that makes sense.

296
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:26,501
did dr. bailey see the chest x-ray?

297
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,543
no,but with the decreased breath sounds

298
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,959
and the low pulse ox,

299
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,751
she suspects janelle will need a chest tube.

300
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,375
i'm dabbing out freakin' glass splinters,

301
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,458
and she gets to do a chest tube?
you signed on for this.

302
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,333
this is not a good day for me.

303
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:41,206
this is not a good day for me at all.
the baby looks good,janelle.

304
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,081
heartbeat's strong.
do you want me to call the father?

305
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,748
you could do that,but that would require me

306
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,872
speaking to him,which i no longer do.

307
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:50,164
plus,hearing he's a daddy from some random doctor

308
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,871
might not go over real well.
so the baby's father doesn't know.

309
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,454
no,and he's never going to.

310
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,911
grey,can i speak with you?

311
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,578
um,i'm setting up a chest tube.

312
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,952
i need to talk to you when you're done.
i'll come find you.

313
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,410
you know,i can suture. i've done it before.

314
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,493
when you can do a z-plasty and barely see the scar,

315
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,326
give me a call.

316
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:12,242
till then,dab and clean,dab and clean.

317
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,575
how's plastics,karev?

318
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,824
everything you've ever dreamed of?

319
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,824
uh,we're not doing a chest tube,dr. grey.

320
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,282
what's going on?

321
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:25,406
ms. duco,there's a shard of glass going into your heart.

322
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,946
hey. hey.

323
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,070
have you seen dr. torres?

324
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,569
no. quite a morning,huh? 14 injured,2 dead.

325
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,361
i know. there's a lot of blood...

326
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:38,694
yeah. and blood.

327
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:41,360
you know,there's a girl who literally has

328
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,443
a shard of glass in her chest. come here.

329
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:45,943
larry dickerson--

330
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,275
the guy that crashed into the fish market.

331
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,567
it's a subdural hematoma

332
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,025
along with air in his mediastinum.

333
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,650
now look at this,look at his spine right here.

334
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,441
spinal stenosis. yep.

335
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,398
narring of the spine,most often a result of aging.

336
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
causes numbness in the legs and feet.

337
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,356
his case is so far advanced,

338
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,522
i doubt he could even feel his feet,

339
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,355
which means-- oh,he shouldn't have been driving.

340
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,771
you paged me? patient has air in the mediastinum.

341
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:09,687
wanted you to take a look.

342
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:12,270
oh,this guy shouldn't have been driving. i know.

343
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,853
it looks like he has a tracheal injury.

344
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:17,269
you going into the o.r.for the subdural?
yeah,as soon as one becomes available.

345
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,560
what's going on with cristina?

346
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:22,559
what do you mean?

347
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,184
well,first she kicks me out of bed at 5:00 this morning

348
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,975
so she can have girl talk with meredith,

349
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,892
and now i can't find her.
she was supposed to be my intern.

350
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:31,473
i had to get my own c.t. what's goin' on?

351
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,432
nothing. cristina's fine.

352
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,723
she's just working really hard.

353
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,180
i'm sure i don't have any idea.

354
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:46,929
don't mention cristina to burke,okay?

355
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:47,929
it's just not a good idea.

356
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,012
yeah? what did you talk about this morning?

357
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:52,012
bank robberies...

358
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,386
which isn't really the point,okay?

359
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,468
she was jogging,and well...

360
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,801
just cut her some slack today,okay?

361
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,676
not that i should interfere--

362
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,676
but you're going to anyway.

363
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:07,383
i'm just gonna ask once,very nicely.

364
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,674
please.

365
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,215
please.

366
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:13,464
you know what says
"thank you" like nothing else?

367
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,755
i'm leaving now.

368
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,752
hey,uh,derek's looking for you.

369
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,168
he said you left a patient in the c.t.--

370
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:37,210
i'm trying to hear.

371
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,793
what's going on?

372
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,832
dr. yang.

373
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:48,998
yes,sir.

374
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,956
when you see dr. burke,
tell him i need to speak with him.

375
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:53,331
of course,sir.

376
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,830
uh,is that,uh,dr. hahn from presbyterian

377
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,288
talking to george's dad?

378
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,787
mr. o'malley has elected to have dr. hahn

379
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,662
perform his valve replacement.

380
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,536
um,but what about dr. burke?

381
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:06,328
dr. burke's been replaced.

382
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,284
well,so what if he replaced me with dr. hahn?

383
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:18,825
i'm no longer on his father's surgery.

384
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:23,532
that's a good thing if it means you stop obsessing.
george didn't just replace you. he told the chief.

385
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,741
the chief knows. i mean,for all we know,

386
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:28,573
erica hahn's being considered the new head of cardio.

387
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,573
and the chief asked me to tell you

388
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,281
that he has something important to talk to you about.

389
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,530
oh,okay.

390
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,487
so we need to align our stories.

391
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,362
this is why i feel like i'm covering for you.

392
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,778
i don't line up stories. that's not me.

393
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,153
oh,i'm sorry. you think it's me? that's not fair.

394
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,319
you know,it's done.

395
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,027
the chief wants to talk to me,so i will talk to him.

396
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,985
i am not telling him a story,cristina.

397
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,067
i'm gonna tell him the truth.

398
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,692
burke. burke.

399
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,691
still getting a heartbeat there? happy to say.

400
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,065
and it'll get stronger once you've had your surgery.

401
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,606
do you mind me asking why you guys switched

402
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,023
from dr. burke to dr. hahn?

403
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:10,106
no,we didn't. georgie did. did he say why?

404
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,146
not really,no.

405
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,396
did georgie and dr. burke maybe have a falling out?

406
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,812
not that i know of. then is there something
going on with george and dr. hahn?

407
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:21,561
ah,here we go again. no,
there's nothing going on with george and dr. hahn.

408
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:25,644
i already told her.
dr. torres is the one who loves george.

409
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:28,352
well,then why did dr. torres break up with him?

410
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:31,351
why did dr. torres break up with him,

411
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,767
i mean,between us?

412
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:35,558
well... how much did george tell you?

413
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,641
everything,i'm his mother. okay,well,then you know

414
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,307
that callie is a little bit out there.

415
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,349
i mean,i have seen more of that girl's body

416
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,806
than i have of my own.

417
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:44,765
it's just a little bit too much information for me.

418
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:48,305
i mean,nobody needs to be naked that oft.

419
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:51,929
he didn't tell you that?

420
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,636
um... i don't know why they broke up.

421
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,970
george seemed to really like her,

422
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,553
and he kind of needed her.

423
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,178
i mean,you remember the whole george and meredith thing.

424
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:01,677
wait,george and meredith?

425
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,051
i knew it.

426
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:05,010
george didn't tell you that either.

427
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:06,509
first meredith,then dr. torres

428
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:08,050
and now this dr. hahn...

429
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,259
o'malley men are studs.

430
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,174
he isn't a stud,he's just very handsome.

431
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:15,008
okay,people,focus. george is not dating erica hahn.

432
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,173
then why would
he want her to perform his father's surgery

433
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:18,632
instead of dr. burke?

434
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:20,132
is she better than dr. burke?

435
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,339
she's good,really good.

436
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,547
nobody's better than burke.

437
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:27,130
then why can't i have dr. burke?

438
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,546
i don't know.

439
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:32,920
do me a favor... could you find out?

440
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,253
hey,have you seen george?

441
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:36,586
no.

442
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:39,128
he is acting so weird. so is cristina.

443
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,043
what is wrong with everyone today?

444
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:43,626
hey,callie. i was gonna come and find you.

445
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,875
what did you want toalk to me about? panties.

446
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,124
uh,callie,what you up to?
i'm gonna kick meredith's ass right now.

447
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,624
get off me! i kept your secrets,i was discreet,

448
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,374
i was a really good friend to you,
and i didn't have to be,

449
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:55,831
and then you go and do this? do what?!

450
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,748
hey,callie,use your words!
use your words,callie. panties,meredith.

451
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,498
i'm talkin' about the mcfreakin'-cone-of-silence

452
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,580
pair of panties i pulled off the bulletin board,

453
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,288
not to mention the adulterous mcsex i witnessed.
hey,hey,hey!

454
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,871
you remember that? hey,i'm sorry,i'm sorry,

455
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:10,037
but she's very little,and you're hurting her.
you told george.

456
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:12,453
my night with mcsteamy was not yours to share.

457
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,578
that's what this is about,your sex with mcsteamy?

458
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,994
you told izzie.

459
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:17,786
no. no,no! callie!

460
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:20,118
you told me you slept with someone.

461
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:24,575
you never said it was sloan.
george told me it was sloan.

462
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,200
george?

463
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,408
george told you?

464
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:30,824
who told george?

465
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:33,740
maybe perhaps the guy you slept with?

466
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,697
um...

467
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,072
george thinks i betrayed him,

468
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,155
and i didn't.

469
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:43,571
i didn't. we were broken up.

470
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,487
well,go tell george.

471
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,694
dude,she went all cage fighter on you.

472
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,444
i know.

473
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,068
how's my dad doing?

474
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,775
george,your ex is hard-core--

475
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,233
passionate,but hard-core.

476
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,442
yeah,i don't-- how is he doing?

477
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:06,858
he's fine,george.

478
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,357
and my mom,is she driving you crazy?

479
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,690
has she offered to iron your scrubs?

480
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,147
she does that. she offers to iron things,

481
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,273
weird things.

482
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,188
they're fine. they're just,um...

483
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:19,188
what?

484
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,604
confused.

485
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,021
you know,suddenly a stranger

486
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,312
is operating on your dad's heart,

487
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:24,687
and they both want to know why,

488
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,728
and i have no idea what to tell them,so...

489
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:28,978
cristina,tell izzie

490
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,352
why dr. hahn is doing my dad's surgery instead of burke.

491
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,767
go on.

492
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,767
look...

493
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,766
dr. hahn is an incredible surgeon.

494
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:44,891
your father is in great hands.
nothing else matters.

495
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:45,891
you're wrong.

496
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,973
there's a lot of people with fathers in this hospital,

497
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,097
and it does matter to them who their doctor is.

498
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,472
george,i...

499
00:21:57,472 --> 00:21:59,763
i-i know this is scary. i understand that.

500
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:01,637
but burke...

501
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:03,929
i didn't come back until i was ready.

502
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,345
preston burke is ready.

503
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,552
look,i... i just can't talk to you about this.

504
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:12,384
this is none of your business,and just please,

505
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:14,051
please stay out of this.

506
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,051
what do i do about your parents?

507
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:18,425
you don't do anything about my parents.

508
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,383
your job is to watch,remember?

509
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,007
i was just... sorry.

510
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:32,172
you might consider leaving that alone

511
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,630
until she goes into the o.r.

512
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,629
yeah,about that-- when's that gonna happen?

513
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,796
there's a large shard of glass in my heart,you know?

514
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,795
you'd be surised how long people can live

515
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,378
with stuff inside their bodies--

516
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,878
glass,shrapnel,bullets.

517
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,836
i saw a guy once with half a chair leg in his chest.

518
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:48,876
that was one hell of a splinter.

519
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:51,167
can we focus here?

520
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:54,209
well... it looks like we'll,uh,have the o.r.

521
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:55,625
in a few hours.

522
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,749
so if i get hit by a car,thrown through a window,

523
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,791
have a big shard of glass in my chest

524
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,290
and my baby survives,

525
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,248
that's pretty much a sign
i should have this baby,right,

526
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,831
even without a father?

527
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:08,164
everyone has a father.

528
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,664
not if she doesn't tell him.

529
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:12,663
you think i should tell him.

530
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,496
everyone saids i am wrong

531
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:16,454
he's scum,eand now i'm the bad guy

532
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,411
'cause i don't want him in my kid's life,right?

533
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,828
that's what you're thinking? janelle...

534
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,661
my thing is,what about the kid?

535
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,702
i mean,what happens when he's 6 or 7

536
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,327
and he wants to meet his dad?

537
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,034
karev,this is none of your business,
okay? she asked,okay?

538
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,408
he cheated on me.

539
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,241
makes him an ass.
doesn't mean you have to be one.

540
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:37,240
ms. duco?

541
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,199
b.p.'s 80 over 60.

542
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,448
j.v.d. and muffled heart sounds.

543
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,906
she's officially unstable.

544
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,739
the o.r. can't wait. alex,find burke

545
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:49,072
and bolus a liter of saline,
hang a unit of blood.

546
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:51,905
we've got to get her ready for transport,
people,now!

547
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:54,528
i'm sorry. spinal what?

548
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,820
stenosis.

549
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,570
and he got this in the accident?

550
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:59,360
i think it may have caused the accident.

551
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:01,319
spinal stenosis is common in older people.

552
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
no,no. larry didn't have anything wrong with him

553
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,401
before the accident.

554
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,859
so there were no symptoms
that either of you noticed?

555
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,942
no,larry was fine.

556
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,191
we're old,but we've both been in good health.

557
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,774
larry was fine.

558
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:17,065
we're gonna need to operate on your husband.

559
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,773
he has a subdural hematoma,
which is bleeding in the brain.

560
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,440
and we need to bng in a cardiothoracic surgeon

561
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,023
to repair the hole in his trachea,

562
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:24,355
which is his windpipe.

563
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:26,355
that--that--so that means that you need to operate

564
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:30,229
on his... chest and his head?

565
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:31,687
yes.

566
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,769
we just wanted to go to the market.

567
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:03,389
it'll be okay,

568
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,721
whatever happens.

569
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,805
cristina-- he can't punish you.

570
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,762
every surgery we've done has been textbook,

571
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,345
and we haven't lost a single patient.

572
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:12,136
we're flawless,and he can't-- cristina.

573
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,594
you we right.

574
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:16,511
the chief does want dr. hahn to replace me

575
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:20,884
as head of cardiothoracic surgery.

576
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:25,342
richard's planning to retire.

577
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:30,049
and he's recommending that the board name me...

578
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,173
the next chief of surgery.

579
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,669
this is good. it's good,right?

580
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:51,336
it means george didn't say anything.

581
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:52,045
i'm going to be chief.

582
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,335
and you didn't tell him
anything about your tremor,right?

583
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,793
i'm going to be chief...

584
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,126
of surgery at seattle grace hospital.

585
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,751
why do you sound like that?

586
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:03,584
because i'm going to be chief of surgery

587
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,875
at seattle grace hospital.

588
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,082
this is what you've worked for.

589
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:10,248
this is what you wanted.

590
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,706
and i can work harder. i--

591
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:14,206
i can learn more procedures,

592
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,581
i will do whatever you need. what?

593
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:18,621
right now nobody knows.

594
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,038
i-i mean,yes,okay,

595
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,037
the fact that george hasn't told the chief yet

596
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,204
doesn't mean that he won't,but we can deal with that.

597
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,620
i mean,i'll--i'll talk to him,or you talk to him.

598
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:28,577
and once you're chief,it won't matter.

599
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,910
i mean,you'll be chief. okay,this is--this is good.

600
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:33,785
nobody will ever know. i'll know.

601
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,451
i can't be chief,not now,not like this.

602
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,492
do you know how long i wanted this?

603
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:39,991
my entire career.

604
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,658
and when i finally get it...

605
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,990
there's blood on it.

606
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,115
i had a tremor,and i didn't say anything about it.

607
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:52,031
it's unimaginable. it's unethical... dishonorable.

608
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:53,531
i've crossed a line.

609
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:57,780
we crossed the line together.
i crossed the line with you.

610
00:26:57,821 --> 00:26:59,571
you dragged me across the line.

611
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:02,570
you made us a team,
you told shepherd i was fine,

612
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:04,487
you said,"nobody has to know."

613
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,694
i was out there on my own. you made us a team.

614
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:08,527
i did what you needed me to do.

615
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,027
you were standing there looking at me,

616
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,318
telling me your whole life was your hands,

617
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:14,734
ifou couldn't operate,if you couldn't be preston burke--
that was your concern,not mine.

618
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,442
oh,no,no,no,no. no,you put that on me.

619
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,607
when you got shot,i walked away,

620
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:27,440
and you cannot let that go,can you?

621
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,606
well,i'm sticking now. okay? i'm sticking.

622
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,230
you know how tired i am?

623
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,146
do you know how scared
i am every time we go into surgery?

624
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,896
but i do it,for you.
do you know how scared i am when we go into surgery?

625
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:41,644
i don't have to just worry about my career now.

626
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,477
i have to put yours on my back,too.

627
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,894
we are a team.

628
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:47,518
oh,there is no team. there is no team.

629
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,435
there is only me,once again,

630
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:51,767
making allowances for your emotional shortcomings.

631
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:00,807
okay,we shouldn't say anymore.

632
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:07,889
no...

633
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:12,596
we shouldn't.

634
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:33,384
oh,look who's here.

635
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:36,216
oh,look how wrinkled he is.

636
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,508
thank god i brought the travel iron.

637
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,799
mom. m,what's going on?

638
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,840
they paged me to your room. are you okay?

639
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:44,090
fine. it's just that...

640
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,797
what? want me to?

641
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,588
(mr. o'malley) no,i'll do it.

642
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,754
here's the thing,

643
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,045
we appreciate everything you've done for us.

644
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:56,544
all the strings you pulled with
dr. burke and dr. hahn--

645
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,669
the last thing we want to do is cause trouble

646
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:01,044
'cause we heard how much stress you been under.

647
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:04,376
first with you and meredith,
then with you and callie-- izzie!

648
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,293
i thought they knew.

649
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:08,459
and we hope you won't be mad,
but we rescheduled the surgery

650
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,167
for tomorrow because--
we're sticking with dr. burke.

651
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,166
what did you say to them?

652
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,789
we asked her-- i asked you to stay outta this.

653
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,581
i just told them what i thought,
that doc-- get out.

654
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:25,872
w-what? georgie...

655
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:28,329
you don't talk like that to anyone.

656
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:31,370
dad... did
dr. stevens tell you that she's on probation

657
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:32,870
because the last time

658
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,453
she was allowed to interact with patients,someone died?

659
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:48,449
it was really nice to see both of you.

660
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:01,822
you know the guy who caused the accident?

661
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,321
an o.r. just cleared up.

662
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:05,530

663
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,362
shherd...

664
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:13,319
burke.

665
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:14,777
what's going on?

666
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,610
dr. burke,we got a pregnant woman in the pit

667
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,151
with a traumatic cardiac tamponade

668
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,109
from a piece of glass piercing her heart.

669
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,234
addison asked for you. well,
you can't do two surgeries at once.

670
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:27,982
no,i can't.

671
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,023
well,she's bleeding like crazy.
what do you want to do?

672
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:36,898
burke,my guy can't wait much longer.

673
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:39,438
well,dr. hahn is here.

674
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,938
invite her to scrub in with you,dr. shepherd.

675
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:43,355
i'll take the glass piercing the heart.

676
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,938
okay.

677
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,562
uh,karev.

678
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:48,978
yes,sir.

679
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,353
make sure that dr. yang scrubs in with me.

680
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,393
everybody gets a surgery but me.

681
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:17,889
we were broken up,as in not together.

682
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:18,805
i can't do this now.

683
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:20,679
i-i slept with mark to get over you,

684
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,096
and guess what,it didn't work.

685
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:25,304
it was a mistake,but i did not betray you,george.

686
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:30,677
i wouldn't-- i would never do that. i can't do this now.

687
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:41,008
oh,where are you taking her? she's having an operation.

688
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,425
oh,no.

689
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,424
what--what-- what's wrong with her?

690
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,674
she has some bleeding in her chest,

691
00:31:46,715 --> 00:31:48,173
and they need to operate.

692
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:50,840
i'm sorry,janelle.

693
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,005
i'm so,so sorry.

694
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:56,129

695
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:59,504
i'm gonna be okay. all right.

696
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:02,295
mrs. dickerson,you should go back to your husband's room

697
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,003
and wait there,okay?

698
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:07,877
he's having surgery,too.

699
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,668
everyone is having surgery.

700
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:16,750
uh,go on and take her up. the surgical team is waiting.

701
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,208
ma'am.

702
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:21,208
what did i do? how could i have done this?

703
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,332
done what? done what?

704
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:27,539
i knew that he had trouble,my husband,with his feet.

705
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,997
my daughter came to town,she took away his keys.

706
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,955
she took away his ke.

707
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,662
you gave 'em back to him.

708
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,204
if i'd sided with my daughter,

709
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,578
oh,larry would have felt so betrayed.

710
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,703
he loves to drive.

711
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:46,243
he--he--he didn't mean to hurt anyone.

712
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:49,243
oh,god. i didn't mean to hurt anyone.

713
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:51,826
i'm so sorry.

714
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,075
um...

715
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:54,617
listen,come with me.

716
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:55,908
what?

717
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,116
i know that you didn't mean to hurt anyone...

718
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:03,823
but we need to tell the police.

719
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,448
just trust me,okay?

720
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:42,980
it entered the right ventricle

721
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,563
and went right through the septum.

722
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:47,605
i'm going to need to place a pericardial patch.

723
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,063
shall i do a running whip stitch? no,i've got it.

724
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:52,396
i can do a mcgoon. i've been practicing.

725
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:54,978
dr. yang,move to the other side of the table.

726
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,311
dr. burke,i apologize. i--

727
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:02,935
move... to the other side of the table. thank you.

728
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,765
(erica) can i get some more lap pads?

729
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,889
(derek) how's it going down there,dr. hahn? oh,just groovy.

730
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,014
they're all gonna be so jeous back at seattle presbyterian.

731
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:26,555
why is that? scrubbing in with derek shepherd,

732
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:28,554
the genius who saved preston burke

733
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:30,429
when he almost got his a shot off?

734
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,678
major jealousy. did you hear that? i'm a genius.

735
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,344
of course you are.

736
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:36,261
no,she was serious. mm-hmm.

737
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:38,844
damn it. i'm seeing a partial tear in his aorta.

738
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:41,551
you okay? i'm gonna have to enlarge the incision

739
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:42,843
to get to the aorta.

740
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,884
we're gonna have to turn him on his back and redress.

741
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,758
his pressure's bottomed out.

742
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:49,508
can you get control down there? i know,i know,he's crashing,

743
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,883
and this leration's getting bigger by the second.

744
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,882
all right,you need help? i need four hands,

745
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,882
and i need everyone in here to help me turn him.

746
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:57,715
page thompson. he's out.

747
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:59,339
is burke available? he's in o.r. three.

748
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,839
run in there and see if they can spare him a second.

749
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,130
okay,i need everyone to help me turn him.
on your count derek.

750
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,629
we've got about half an hour
before this patient dies... move it. take it off. let's go.

751
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,837
that is it.

752
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:10,336
start rewarming.

753
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:12,044
pledgeted 5-0 prolene.

754
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:14,044
it's gonna take about ten minutes

755
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:17,085
before the body warms up,
then we'll take her off bypass.

756
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,960
nice work,dr. burke.

757
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,376
thank you.

758
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,791
dr. burke,dr. hahn was repairing the trachea

759
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,332
and found an aortic transection.

760
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:34,248
patient's crashing. she really needs your help.

761
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,664
what are you doing?

762
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,788
the heart can't come off of bypass for a while yet.

763
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:43,621
i'll be right back. um,shall i come?

764
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:46,162
no,stay here.

765
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,620
mer. mer.

766
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,869
is it bad? what does she need him to do?

767
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,118
the guy's chest is a mess.

768
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,077
she's juggling the tracheal and the aortic injuries,

769
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,409
and she just needs another pair of hands.

770
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:01,241
he just repaired a hole in her heart.
i'm sure he can handle it.

771
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:04,866
cristina.

772
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,491
hey,hey,hey. what do you think you're doing?

773
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:09,240
get back in there.

774
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:15,072
what,do you think burke can't operate without you?

775
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:22,487
oh,my god,cristina.

776
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:23,987
shut up.

777
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,777
he can't operate without you.

778
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,319
if you ever gave a crap about me in any way,

779
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:32,985
you will shut your mouth and get back into that o.r.

780
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,396
there's a beat. it's beating.

781
00:36:57,437 --> 00:37:00,396
she's ready to come off bypass,right? she is.

782
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,520
dr. burke asked me to tell you

783
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,644
he's gonna be longer than he thought.

784
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:07,102
"longer than he thought"? what else did he say?

785
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:11,060
she could stroke out if she stays on any longer.

786
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:12,810
is--what did he say?

787
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,392
he said you shouldn't worry. he'll be right back.

788
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:20,974
well,let's unclp and see what we've got.

789
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,264
brain's not interesting enough for you,dr. grey?

790
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:27,473
i've still got a lot of bleeding.

791
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,972
i'll place a partial occluding clamp.

792
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:31,971
4-0 prolene.

793
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,386
there.

794
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:41,094
excellent,burke. thank you.

795
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:45,344
it should hold once you get a few more in there.

796
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:47,760
focus,dr

797
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,176
focus.

798
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:54,550
everything okay,dr. burke?

799
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:57,674
everything's fine.

800
00:37:57,716 --> 00:37:59,299
dr. grey?

801
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,505
it's been too long. she needs to come off bypass.

802
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:08,297
she should come off soon,dr. yang.

803
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:09,505
how do you want to proceed?

804
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:12,254
i'm not having this girl die of a stroke after all this.

805
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:16,295
page someone,anyone who can help take her off bypass.

806
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:22,169
what happened in there? he's going to live.

807
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:24,459
dr. burke,you were gone too long.

808
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:27,042
she could stroke out
any second from-- gather yourself,dr. yang.

809
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:29,001
let's take her off by pass.

810
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,083
good. good rhythm.

811
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,082
temperature is up. start protamine. her off by pass

812
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,124
coming up by pass

813
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:40,998
stop pulling me

814
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:43,373
give her more volume.

815
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:45,789
arterial line is out.

816
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:52,745
nice. keep going.

817
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:55,286
come on.

818
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:56,786
there it is.

819
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:59,202
heartbeat's still strong. nicely done,dr. burke.

820
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:01,244
uh,so we just check everything and close.

821
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,743
we'll close-- wait.

822
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:10,616
ugh! she blew a stitch.
she could have a tear in her heart.

823
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,033
give me the pledgeted 4-0 prolene.

824
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,115
put up two fresh units of blood.
what can i do? burke?

825
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:16,241
hold pressure. i need to repair the heart wall.

826
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:21,822
should i put on a clamp? one moment.

827
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:25,322
we don't have a moment. hold on!

828
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,237
i need to put the cannulas back in

829
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:29,112
so we can empty out the heart again.

830
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,736
she needs to go back on bypass.

831
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,528
reheparinize and give me the tubes.

832
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,610
her atrium is extremely friable.

833
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,984
it can't hold a stitch.

834
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,566
what about a horizontal mattress? i can do it.

835
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:51,732
dr. yang,i don't need you for this.

836
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:03,480
this is a known complication of the surgery.

837
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,854
it happens.

838
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,229
it happens.

839
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,852
restart bypass.

840
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,061
restarting bypass.

841
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:20,476
i was paged. can i help?

842
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:25,974
i'm repairing the heart wall.

843
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:28,016
i could use your help for a second attempt

844
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,724
to come off bypass.

845
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:32,265
i'll scrub in.

846
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,179
load more 4-0 prolene

847
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,095
and a new pericardial patch.

848
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,254
come in.

849
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:30,252
chief, i need to talk

850
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:32,210
yes,dr. burke,

851
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,292
i think we do.

852
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,118
you're lucky you know

853
00:42:10,576 --> 00:42:11,701
pardon?

854
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:14,201
to study into burke if your little intern brain

855
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,034
can routine any what he teaches you

856
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,492
maybe you will become half of the surgery years

857
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,866
that's pretty damn good

858
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:27,072
if you'd tell him i told you this, hem,
tell him that i'will leave in here

859
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:36,487
karev

860
00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:37,862
dr. montgomery

861
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:38,653
how is she doing?

862
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:42,319
she made her throught the surgery, so does the baby

863
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,986
she's like i said she is a fighter

864
00:42:44,986 --> 00:42:49,443
do you think she will call the guy?   the dad?
no , it takes more than a while meaning,

865
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,443
speech to get a girl to make a commitment like that

866
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,442
yeah

867
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,858
i appreciate if that will take

868
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:57,649
it was surprising.

869
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:58,440
surprising

870
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:00,023

875
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:50,387
i want to help you , if you told me.

876
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,261
burke

877
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,052
i cannot.

878
00:44:00,052 --> 00:44:03,885
it's been a long day.

879
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:08,508
and i just cannot

880
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,050
i thought you are my friend

881
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,798
i thought you are my surgeon.

882
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:21,881
in some ways,

883
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:24,505
betrayal is evadible

884
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:27,379
when our bodys betray us

885
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:30,795
surgery is often the key to recovery

886
00:44:33,752 --> 00:44:35,961
when we betray each other

887
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:39,085
when we betray each other

888
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:42,543
the path of  recovery is last clear

889
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:18,284
it was both of ours idea

890
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:20,159
to rob the bank

891
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,700
it was both of us

892
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,659
i know.

893
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:23,659
it just ...

894
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:26,116

895
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:27,949

lot and realized i cann't go home

00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:43,237

914
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,969
i cann't say anything.

915
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:10,510
there are  things christina told me , she is my friend, i cann't say anything

916
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:12,675
no,

917
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:15,467
no, that is not how this work

918
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:19,299
how couldn't you know when you know

919
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,549
i suspect on you to tell me

920
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,006
you cleared him for surgery ,derek

921
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:28,339
how did you not know?

922
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,255
you cannot be angry with me

923
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:32,921
she is my best friend ,

924
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:35,004
and right or wrong, she...

925
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:39,253
what?

926
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,044
she was there when you weren't

927
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,499
we'll do whatever it takes

928
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:00,665
to rebuilt the trust that was last

929
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:31,200
and then there are some wounds, some
betrayals that are so deep, so profound...

930
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:35,907
that there is no way to repair what was lost

931
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:44,988
and when that happens

932
00:48:56,694 --> 00:48:58,194
there is nothing left to do
