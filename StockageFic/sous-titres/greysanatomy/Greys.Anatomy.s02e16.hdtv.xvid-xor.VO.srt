1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,881
it's a look patients
get in their eyes.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,801
There's a scent,
the smell of death,

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,096
some kind of sixth sense.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,642
When the great beyond
is heading for you,

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,477
you feel it coming.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,857
what's the one thing you've
always dreamed of doing

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,359
before you die?

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,437
Okay,hello?Clearly not my dream.

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,735
George.

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,532
You're the strongest,

12
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,243
most masculine man
I have ever known.

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,246
You're smarter than me,

14
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,123
and you've got really great hair.

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,418
I'm in love with you,george.

16
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,798
I always have been,
and I always will be.

17
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,397
See... I told you.
Not my dream.

18
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,068
Okay...this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you this.

19
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,403
If you're gonna clog up
the toilet,

20
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,197
you have gotta be willing to
use a plunger.

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,240
Otherwise,we're gonna make
you crap in the backyard.

22
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,617
What are you doing
on the floor?

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,243
Get up. Something's wrong
with meredith.

24
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,081
-I'm just not going.
-You have to go to work.

25
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,959
You're an intern.
Saving lives is not optional.

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,045
Yes,it is.I'm staying home.

27
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,464
You're supposed to be helping.

28
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,469
Uh... mere.Maybe,um,
there'll be

29
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,554
a horrible accident
nearby the hospital.

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,265
Cut a bunch of people open--
sternotomies,craniotomies.

31
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,600
That'd be fun,right?

32
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,769
I don't care about surgeries.

33
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,647
You have a feeling?

34
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,612
Yes.

35
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,447
Okay,what kind of feeling?

36
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,616
Like I might die.

37
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,702
Today...tomorrow,
in 50 years?

38
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,079
'Cause we're all gonna
die eventually.

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,872
But now we're late.Let's go.

40
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,833
Crisna,come on.

41
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,086
okay.
This is me being supportive.

42
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,131
Really?

43
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,467
Yeah. Okay,fine.
I'm totally supportive. Go.

44
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:05,435
Okay,the man I love has a wife,
and then he chooses her over me,

45
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,855
and that wife takes my dog.

46
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,107
Okay,she didn't take the dog,
I gave it to her.

47
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,149
Yeah.But I didn't mean to
give it to her,

48
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,568
I meant to give it to him.

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,653
But that does not change the
fact that

50
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,782
she's got my mcdreamy
and my mcdog.

51
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,702
She's got my mclife.
And what have I got?

52
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,416
Do you know I can't remember
the last time we kissed?

53
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,085
'Cause you never think the
last time is the last time.

54
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,545
You think there'll be more.

55
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,464
You think you have forever,
but you don'T.

56
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,722
Plus,my conditioner decided
to stop working

57
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,599
and I think I have
brittle bones.

58
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,102
I just...
I just need something to happen.

59
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,272
I need a sign that things
are gonna change.

60
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,649
I need a reason to go on.
I need some hope.

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,111
And in the absence of hope,
I need to stay in bed

62
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,363
and feel like I might die today.

63
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,037
Whatever.Everybody has problems.

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,207
Now get your ass out of bed
and get to work. Now!

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,917
Move! Move! Move!

66
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,169
-What were you saying?
-Yeah,I...

67
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,005
we're good to go.

68
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,683
-Quiet board.
-I know.

69
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,478
-That's a bad sign.
-I know that.

70
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,106
-Don't you think I know that?
-That's a quiet board.

71
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,277
-Is he in a bad mood?
-Quiet board.

72
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,905
-Right.He hates a quiet board.
-I can hear you talking about me.

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,157
-We're just saying--
-a quiet board means trouble.

74
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,577
A quiet board is death.
A quiet board bodes bad news.

75
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,287
And stop lookin'
at me like that.

76
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,627
-Dr. Shepherd.
-Dr. Burke.

77
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,297
You and I,we've known each
otherfor a while now,right?

78
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,550
Yes.

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,261
We've done several successful
surgeries together.

80
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,011
Yes.

81
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,138
Your girlfriend is my
ex-girlfriend's best friend.

82
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,181
Yes.

83
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,433
Why can't we call each other
by our first name?

84
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,894
I don't think so.

85
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,731
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

86
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,693
-Dr. Shepherd.
-Dr. Burke.

87
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,947
I haven't been in the O.R.
In two days.

88
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,407
I'm getting some O.R.Time.

89
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,951
We haven't had a decent
resident this week.

90
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,369
Mm,the last two weren't
that bad.

91
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,830
It doesn't matter which
resident we get,they suck.

92
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,290
-they all sucked.
-yeah.

93
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,000
I miss dr. Bailey.

94
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,680
-I have a feeling.
-I get those.

95
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,683
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

96
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,018
And?

97
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,187
If you wait long enough,
it passes.

98
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:55,772
Promise?

99
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,609
I promise.

100
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,743
Hey.

101
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,746
-What you doin'?
-Waiting for it to pass.

102
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,831
For what to pass?

103
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,628
-So do you want to do charts later?
-Never gonna happen.

104
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,339
-Why?
-Alex,I gave you your chance.

105
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,382
You had your chance,and you
slept with someone else.

106
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,010
I forgave you in the spirit of
being a bigger person,

107
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,262
of rising above.

108
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,139
But these legs are
closed to you now.

109
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,849
The panties are staying on.

110
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,977
So you and me--
never gonna happen.

111
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,771
So you don't want
to do charts later?

112
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,314
Go stand over there.

113
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,941
-Can we get back to the point?
-You had a point?

114
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,401
Yeah,which surgeon are we gonna
have to suck up to today?

115
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,196
-That would be me.
-dr. Bailey.

116
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,532
I've been gone two weeks--
two weeks--

117
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,367
and you ran off two residents?

118
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,661
I've got people phoning me
at home,screaming,

119
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,996
telling me my interns are
rosemary's babies.

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,706
Nobody wants you.

121
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,250
Do you think I have the
time for this?

122
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,127
I am pregnant! I'm supposed
to be on bed rest.

123
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,838
I'm supposed to be growing
a human being.

124
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,172
I'm supposed to be calm.

125
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,841
Do I look calm to you?

126
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,176
Did I raise you fools
to be pariahs?

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,559
-You're back.
-I'm not back.

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,811
-You're not?
-Get off me.

129
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,694
yang,karev,grey,stay here
and wait for the incoming case.

130
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,780
O'malley,page addison shepherd.
Stevens,get a wheelchair.

131
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,532
-A wheelchair?
-A wheelchair.

132
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,242
What should I tell
dr. Montgomery-shepherd?

133
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,535
What did I say?

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,661
-Dr. Bailey?
-What?

135
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,121
What do you want me to tell
dr. Montgomery-shepherd

136
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,622
when she answers her page?

137
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,836
tell her my contractions
are ten minutes apart

138
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,630
and my water just broke
all over your shoes.

139
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,426
Ge-get--boy,get off me!

140
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,183
take her!

141
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,488
-dude.
-Yeah.

142
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,617
james carlson,age 46,

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,577
paramedics found him unconscious
and bleeding.

144
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,162
Mechanisms of injury
are unknown.

145
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,705
But he has a large,
sucking chest wound

146
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,249
and a wife with very
healthy lungs.

147
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,083
Vitals?

148
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,878
Tachycardic in the 140s.
B.P. Holding in the 90s.

149
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,340
You were gone when I woke up.

150
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,884
Oh,uh,I had--I had to do a thing.

151
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,595
-You didn't leave a note.
-Yeah,well,I-

152
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,387
I had this thing to do.

153
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,265
-I--you know,I did this thing.
-And once again...

154
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,059
what?

155
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,269
We go to sleep,
I think everything is fine

156
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,731
and by the time I wake up,
you're just a little bit crazy.

157
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,942
I--I'm not crazy.
I had a thing.

158
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,027
Okay.

159
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,987
How's his respiratory effort?

160
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,781
Absent breath sounds
on the right side.

161
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,533
Air bubbling
at the site of the wound.

162
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,159
He's shocky
and getting a little cyanotic.

163
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,327
My wife...

164
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,789
let's get him intubated
sivo sobre la herida.

165
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,958
And place an occlusive
dressing over the wound.

166
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,129
-And now you.
-Uh,hannah.Hannah davies.

167
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,216
Hannah,why do you have
your hand inside my patient?

168
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,509
I'd like to say for the record

169
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,718
that I told her not to.

170
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,555
I tried to tamponade the wound
with gauze and pressure,

171
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,765
but the only thing that would
stop the bleeding was my hand.

172
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,351
Every time I try to move it,
he starts bleeding out.

173
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,728
Can I take my hand out now?

174
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,230
You don't stick your hand
inside of a patient

175
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,523
when you don't know
how he was injured.

176
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,149
You don't stick your hand inside
of a patient at all.

177
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,235
-Yeah,I know that now.
-Out of my room.

178
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,486
She gets to stay?

179
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,697
She has her hand stuck
inside of my patient.

180
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,996
-Nice. Thanks.
-Well,don't get happy.

181
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,455
You have your finger
on a major bleeder,

182
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,416
and mr. Carlson
is running out of time.

183
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,001
The only thing that you have won

184
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,211
is an all-expense-paid trip
to the O.R.

185
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,714
Dr. Grey,prepare to transport
him to the O.R.

186
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,591
And let's make this happen
quickly,people.

187
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,426
what do you want me to do?

188
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,721
I want you to make that woman
stop screaming

189
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,972
and tell us what happened.

190
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,474
-I-I can't go into the O.R.?
-No,you have "a thing" to do.

191
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,103
What was that about?

192
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,396
If I had know you were
gonna get the good case,

193
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,856
I woulda let you stay in bed.

194
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,359
She's been going at least 15,
20 minutes.

195
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,819
This must be,like,
some kind of record.

196
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,905
Look at her.She's not even
turning red.

197
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,616
Good for her.Burke says
shut her up.

198
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,202
We've got an incoming trauma--
M.V.C. With a 30-minute

199
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,079
extrication time,and severe
intrusion damage to the car.

200
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,581
Definite head injury.

201
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,833
Stable vitals on everything else.
Five minutes out.

202
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,752
-I've got it.
-I got it.I called it first.

203
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,795
I thought you said burke
told you to shut her up.

204
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,672
Oh,no. Burke told me
to tell you to shut her up.

205
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,302
ma'am.Ma'am.

206
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,807
Mrs. Carlson...
are you injured?

207
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,144
I need you to try and calm down.

208
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,272
Mrs. Carlson?
Can you hear me?

209
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,149
Can you hear me?

210
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,659
Good. Okay.

211
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,620
Now can you tell me exactly
what happened to your husband?

212
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,347
what are you doing?

213
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,601
-Chief.Bailey's in there.
-Bailey's back?

214
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,188
-O'malley!
-She's in labor.

215
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,440
Dr. Montgomery-shepherd is
examining her cervix,sir.

216
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,192
I can see that quite clearly.

217
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,320
O'malley,stop looking.

218
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,660
Pretty amazing,right?

219
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,537
The miracle of life.

220
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:48,333
Our bailey becoming a mother,
it feels good.

221
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,711
Having bailey back at the hospital--

222
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,339
-balance is beingestoreD.
-That's all I'm sayin',sir.

223
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,593
Hey,guys.Would you,uh,
give this to dr. Shepherd for me?

224
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,969
Thanks.
What's going on?

225
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,679
-Bailey's in there.
-Oh,bailey's back.

226
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,930
That's excellent.

227
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,935
And her cervix is being
examined by my wife,which is

228
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,104
which is a visual I'll never
get out of my head.

229
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,190
-Thanks for the warning.
-right.

230
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,988
Well...a gathering of men
outside the delivery room.

231
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,323
How mid-century of you.

232
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,241
Say hi to bailey for me.

233
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,952
-How's she doin'?
-Taking it like a woman.

234
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,580
6 centimeters dilated,
50% effaced,

235
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,541
and refusing all pain meds,
which I think is stupid,

236
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,502
but I'm not in labor,
so...

237
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,963
what are you people
doin' out here?

238
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,798
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?

239
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,092
A boy the size of a
10-pound bowling ball

240
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,469
is working his way
out of my body.

241
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,637
Can you give me something
for that?

242
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,888
Can you give me a new vagina?

243
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,765
-Uh,well--
-I didn't think so.

244
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,017
Look,everybody,
I appreciate the concern,

245
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,728
but I'm fine.
It's just childbirth.

246
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,439
All I need is my husband,
who shouldbeen here by now.

247
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,275
Write down his number.

248
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,653
I'll call him.
I'll track him down.

249
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,240
All right.Then go away.
Give me some privacy.

250
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,533
I don't wanna see
any of you again

251
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,326
until after the baby is born,

252
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,203
which,if he does
like I told him to

253
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,914
and stays on schedule,should be
in about four and a half hours.

254
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,000
I mean it.

255
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,671
-bailey's back.
-She's back,sir.

256
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,757
He's my patient,cristina.
Get your own.

257
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,384
I had one.
Meredith took him.

258
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,885
So now you're gonna take mine?

259
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,886
If I can.

260
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,265
is my wife here?
Is--is she here?

261
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,101
-Was she in the accident with you?
-She should be here.

262
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,353
-She's--she's supposed to--
-we'll find her,mr. Jones.

263
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,272
Okay,what do we got?
Tucker jones,age 35,

264
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,940
lost control of his car,
hit the guardrail,flipped--

265
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,191
he's got a chest contusion.

266
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,443
A head C.T. Shows a left-sided
depressed skull fracture

267
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,404
and temporal epidural hematoma.

268
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,865
G.C.S. 14 in the field,
now down to 12.

269
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,949
His motor exams are intact.

270
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:44,908
Okay,let's get him
on a gram of dilantin

271
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,326
-and 70 grams of mannitol.
-I'm on it.

272
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,662
Mr. Jones,I'm gonna need to do
an examination of you,okay?

273
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,499
uh,my phone.An-answer.It's my wife.

274
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,877
-Y-you need to answer...
-okay,we're gonna answer your phone.

275
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,461
Dr. Stevens,answer his phone.

276
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:57,546
-It's fine.
-I got it.

277
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,090
Mr. Jones,can you squeeze
my fingers for me,please?

278
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,552
Mr. Jones,I need you to
squeeze my finger,okay?

279
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,219
Can you--
okay,he's in a seizure.

280
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,679
Let's get him on his side.
Watch his arm.

281
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:11,310
Hello.Hello? George?
it's me,izzie.

282
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,186
All right,let's get him
to the O.R.

283
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,896
No,I don't have bailey's
husband's phone.

284
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,982
I think I'd know if I had
bailey's husband's phone,george.

285
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,235
What's bailey's husband's name?

286
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,195
Watch the wall.

287
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,744
How are you doing over there?

288
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,829
My hand's getting numb.

289
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,040
And I gotta tell you,
this whole "insides are

290
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,210
bloody and squishy" thing is
so not good for my gag reflex.

291
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,338
But I'm good.
Is this okay?

292
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,089
Me being in here likeke this?

293
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,301
Once dr. Burke scrubs in,
he'll have you remove your hand.

294
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,137
And then you can go,
and we'll fix mr. Carlson.

295
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,515
Good.'Cause I know
how much medicine I know,

296
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,850
and it's just enough to never
be allowed in an O.R.

297
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,562
It's my second week
as a paramedic.

298
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,940
I got out of school
about a month ago.

299
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,859
I haven't been doing this
that long either.

300
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,531
Talk about on-the-job
training,uh?

301
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,958
-Dr. Burke.
-Dr. Shepherd.

302
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,002
-Hey.
-Hey

303
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,879
You've got dr. Bailey's
husband on the table?

304
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,507
Bailey's husband is going
into surgery?

305
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,510
Got into a car accident trying to
get to the hospital before the birth.

306
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,011
-What do I tell bailey?
-Nothing.

307
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,180
Just wait till I get in there
and see how bad the damage is,

308
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,765
have something concrete
to tell her.

309
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,475
Yeah,no use upsetting her
until we know.

310
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,393
Yeah.

311
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,520
-Okay,keep me posted.
-Okay.

312
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,772
-Hey,preston.
-Good seeing you,addison.

313
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,609
What?

314
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,070
She gets to call you by your
first name and I don't.

315
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,029
I like her.

316
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,365
-And you don't like me?
-No.

317
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,749
-How are we doin'?
-He's stabilized.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,501
I'm just about to
put him under.

319
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,128
Doctor.

320
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,847
Y-you're... shepherd,right?

321
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,015
Yes,I am.

322
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,100
I thought so.

323
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,689
Miranda...
she really likes you.

324
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,984
I like her,too.

325
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:30,908
-W-we're having a baby.
-I know.

326
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,202
I'm gonna take care of you.

327
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,454
I'm gonna get you back
to bailey,okay?

328
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,497
Safe and sound.

329
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,878
All this blood
and none of it's hers?

330
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,255
Yeah,she's fine.

331
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,549
Acute anxiety reaction.
Give her 2 of diazepam P.O.

332
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,384
-To calm her down.
-She in shock?

333
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,552
I'll say.

334
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,889
Can you tell us exactly
what happened?

335
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,599
I mean,the shock part.

336
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,436
it was shocking.
I'm shocked.

337
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,104
You tell my husband
when I get my hands on him,

338
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,398
he's a dead man.
Do you hear me?

339
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,067
Scaring me like this.

340
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:06,902
Exactly how was your
husband injured?

341
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,862
mindy?
Mindy,are you in here?

342
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,615
I'm over here,you moron.

343
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,201
How's james doing?

344
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,577
Oh,he's bleeding
all over the place.

345
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,537
That's how he's doing.

346
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,956
The girl in the ambulance
put her hand inside of him!

347
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,123
That's how he's doing!

348
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,333
What are you yelling at me for?

349
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,167
Because!

350
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,796
Because you and james are like
idiots,playing like 8 year olds.

351
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:26,255
-Excuse me,um--
-we don't play

352
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,048
-Look,we reenact.
-You play.

353
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,550
You put on your costumes,

354
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,927
and you build your stupid
toys and you play.

355
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,471
-No,we reenact.
-Nobody reenacts world war ii,

356
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,682
-you moron!
-Again,exactly what happened?

357
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,724
You wanna know what haened?

358
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,936
What happened is my husband
and his moron best friend--

359
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,062
could you stop calling me a mor?

360
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:46,692
Moron best friend decided to
build some kind of big gun.

361
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,819
Yeah,an exact replica
of the finest

362
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,698
allied antitank weapon of
world war ii,the m981 bazooka.

363
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,992
So they put on their
stupid costumes,

364
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,702
and they go out into
the backyard,

365
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,287
and they try to shoot the thing.

366
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,330
I'm the gunner.
James is the loader,okay?

367
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,999
We followed the specifications
exactly.

368
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,792
You should see it.
It's a 60-millimeter,

369
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,128
1 1/2-pound rocket--
I mean,it's a beauty.

370
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,588
It didn't work,

371
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,716
so like an idiot,my husband
has to go and stand

372
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,218
in front of his big gun
to see what went wrong.

373
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,013
That's when the stupid toy
starts working.

374
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,515
-Stop calling it a toy.
-It's taking up half my garage.

375
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,184
I'll call it whatever I want!

376
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,437
Hold on.
He shot himself with a bazooka?

377
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,271
Yeah.

378
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,232
He shot himself with a bazooka?

379
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,985
Like I said,morons,
the pair of 'em.

380
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,361
-Was there an explosion?
-Huh?

381
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,031
-Was there an explosion?
-No,why?

382
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,241
Oh,crap

383
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,248
What? What is it?

384
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,215
Hey,slow down.

385
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,511
if bailey asks,I'm not
the one who did this.

386
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,109
okay,everybody,I'm going
to do a thoracotomy,

387
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,070
and hannah here is going
to pull her hand out.

388
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,572
Dr. Grey is going
to clamp the bleeder

389
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,032
when we have more exposure.

390
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,743
-You ready?
-More than ready.

391
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,203
Scalpel.

392
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,673
uh,tucker jones,

393
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:37,886
you better be lying in the
street somewhere dead,mister,

394
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,681
because when I get my hands
on you--

395
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:44,226
I am having your baby here,
mister!

396
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,106
okay,on the count of three.

397
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,315
One...

398
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,151
two...

399
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,157
dr. Burke.

400
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,454
-I need to speak with you.
-I'm in surgery,karev.

401
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,540
You want to talk to me,sir.

402
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,758
unhook me.

403
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,350
Karev,if you interrupt me
in my O.R.,

404
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,269
-It better be for a good damn reason.
-Was it through and through?

405
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,145
What?

406
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,230
The wound on james carlson,
was it through and through?

407
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,649
No,it was just an entry.
No exit. Why?

408
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,237
he's cute.He single?

409
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,760
-hannah.
-Yes,dr. Burke.

410
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,846
What do you feel inside
of mr.Carlson?

411
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,183
-What is your hand touching?
-What do you mean?

412
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,479
Is your hand touching
anything hard?

413
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,273
-hard?
-Like metal.

414
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,610
Um... I don't know.

415
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,904
Don't move your hand.

416
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,198
Just tell me...
what you feel.

417
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,450
Dr. Burke,what's going on?

418
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:24,827
Hannah.

419
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:29,748
Um,my fingertips are touching
something...kinda hard.

420
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,669
-Yeah.Yeah,definitely.
-Oh,my god.

421
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,506
-Dr. Milton.
-What? What's wrong?

422
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,383
hannah,I don't want you to move--

423
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:43,512
not your hand,not your body,
not an inch.

424
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,849
Okay. You should know you're
starting to scare me.

425
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,768
Don't be scared.Everything's
going to be fine.

426
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:51,603
Dr. Grey,can you...

427
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,156
I want you to walk out
of this room--

428
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,868
walk,do not run--

429
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:10,289
go and tell the charge nurse
that whave a code black.

430
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,169
-I'm sorry,"code black"?
-Code black.

431
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,504
Tell him that I am sure,

432
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,216
and then tell him to call
the bomb squad.

433
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,890
god,can you imagine?

434
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,516
What'd she stick her hand
in there for anyway?

435
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,185
She was trying to save his life.

436
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,936
And now she might die
because of it.

437
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,607
What do we do now?

438
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,984
I go back in and wait for
the bomb squad.

439
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,152
You leave.

440
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,362
You all leave.

441
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,617
Mere,you comin'?

442
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,037
It's your funeral.

443
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,081
You need a surgical team.

444
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,958
All I need is dr. Milton
to keep him under.

445
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,418
I can do the rest myself.

446
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,972
fine.But you wait
by the elevator.

447
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,933
I don't want anyone in here
that doesn't need to be

448
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,100
in this O.R.

449
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,770
When the bomb squad arrives,
we'll take it from there.

450
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,064
Until then,milton and i are
doing this alone.

451
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,774
Now,go.

452
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,492
Okay,okay,okay.

453
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,081
eight minutes apart.

454
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,584
There is no shame
in an epidural,miranda.

455
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,754
Epidural increases the
possibility of a c-section.

456
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,757
It also decreases in.Mirand
this is a big baby,

457
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,342
it is your first baby,
and I am telling you,

458
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,594
it is not gonna a short
or an easy labor.

459
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,930
I can handle a little pain.
No problem.

460
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:53,600
Women all over the world
do this at home...

461
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,811
With nothing more than
a pair of scissors

462
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,229
and a bucket of hot water.

463
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,356
Well,women all over the world
also die giving birth at home

464
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,649
every single day.

465
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,530
I did not just say--

466
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,448
you're supposed to be making
yourself useful

467
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,200
and finding my husband.

468
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,452
-Well,I-I--
-he's not... here.

469
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,206
Oh,now he should be
here by now.

470
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,624
okay,we're gonna go find him,

471
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,918
-right,dr. O'malley?
-Right.

472
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,423
what?

473
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,094
Uh,nothing.I'll--
I'll be right back.

474
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,269
yang,could you check that?

475
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,274
-how's he doing?
-Ah,it' s touch and go.

476
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,151
I've located the clot.

477
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,986
I'm just trying to find the
source of the bleeding.

478
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,696
Go and find addison,

479
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,781
and tell her he's in worse
shape than I thought.

480
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,246
-What'd they want?
-They want us to evacuate.

481
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,831
Evacuate?Did they say why?

482
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,125
Uh,no,but your pager said,
"code black."

483
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,795
-You're sure they said that?
-Yes.

484
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:07,382
It could be a drill.

485
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,801
Even if it's not a drill,
I can't evacuate.

486
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,720
I've got an open brain
on the table.

487
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,349
I'm not leaving bailey's
husband on the table

488
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,017
with his skull flap open,

489
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,102
so if anybody wants to go,
they should go.

490
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,021
Anybody want to evacuate?

491
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,358
Going once,going twice,
three times.

492
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,530
You're sure they said,
"code black"?

493
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,447
Yes.

494
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,869
I don't like having to
lie to dr.Bailey.

495
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,164
-She would want--
-now is not the time,
dr. O'malley.

496
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:40,999
She'd want to know about
her husband.

497
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:45,963
"code black"?
What's a code black.

498
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,881
wait,wait,hold it.

499
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,633
Dr. Shepherd,
the other dr. Shepherd

500
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,968
wanted me to let you know
that tucker's bleed

501
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,845
is more extensive than
he originally thought.

502
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,180
It's gonna be a few more hours
before he has anything concrete

503
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,099
-to tell dr. Bailey.
-Thanks,stevens.

504
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,853
-What's a code black?
-A what?

505
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,690
"code black"?

506
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,943
Code red,code blue,code white-
I've never had a code black.

507
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,319
Dr. Shepherd?

508
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,655
Just--just go back to
your locker room

509
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,699
and wait for your resident
to give you instructions.

510
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:15,784
-We don't have a resident.
-What's going on?

511
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,077
Is it something bad?

512
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,712
yeah,it's something bad.

513
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,638
so...

514
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,810
so I'm touching live...
unexploded ammunition?

515
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,271
I'm afraid so.

516
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,567
not the greatest feeling
in the world.

517
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,320
No.

518
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,739
I guess not.

519
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,494
And he's still out?

520
00:26:58,869 --> 00:26:59,828
yeah.

521
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,164
But he's not hooked up to
the machine anymore?

522
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,625
I had dr. Milton take him off
the ventilator.

523
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,668
The flow of oxygen
posed a danger.

524
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:11,381
The ambu bag is...breathing
for him now.

525
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,176
But he can't hear me?

526
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,594
No.

527
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,690
Hannah.

528
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,987
what if I just take my hand
out really quickly?

529
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:37,574
We'd have to ask the bomb squad
that when they arrive,

530
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:41,286
but I'm guessing that would cause
the ammo to shift and explode.

531
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:45,791
Oh.

532
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,472
-Hannah.
-Yeah.

533
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:05,227
Your hand is keeping mr. Carlson
from bleeding out.

534
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,439
You are keeping him alive.

535
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,487
Right.An--and the bomb squad
is coming?

536
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,447
The bomb squad is coming.

537
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,658
Okay.

538
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,162
Okay.

539
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,171
we are having pre-op patients
transported to mercy west.

540
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:35,007
all trauma rerouted to
seattle presbyterian.

541
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,468
there is no danger to the north,
south and west wings of this hospital

542
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,304
just the east surgical wing.

543
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,223
that said,anyone who wants to
leave can leave.

544
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,809
one stays unless they volunteer
to stay.

545
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:46,727
understood?

546
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:47,936
okay.

547
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:51,523
richard,it's a code black,
a real one?

548
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:52,983
yes,i've shut down the o. r. 's.

549
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,401
-to trauma?
-to everything.

550
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,111
wait a minute,to "everything"
everything?

551
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,323
as of ten minutes ago,all the
operating rooms at seattle grace

552
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:02,367
were completely evacuated,with
the exception fo dr.burke's team.

553
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,119
and dr. shepherd's team.

554
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,413
what?

555
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,248
what do you mean,
"dr. shepherd's team"?

556
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:10,042
they're still in o. r. two.

557
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,211
the bomb squad just arrived.

558
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:13,086
excuse me.

559
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,925
-you're the surgical team?
-yes.

560
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,010
dylan young,bomb squad.

561
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,178
spread out,check the area,

562
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,180
and then we'll secure the patient.
where are they?

563
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,389
dr. burke has them in there.

564
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,016
and the rest of this floor
has been evacuated?

565
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:26,892
it has,yes.

566
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,436
all right,you stay here.
nobody moves unless i say so.

567
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:33,815
we've got people over here!

568
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,735
i thought you said the floor
had been evacucuated.

569
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,570
i thought it had. i'm not
in charge of anything.

570
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,822
-cristina!\-seriously,back up.

571
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,615
oh,no,no.
she will hurt him.

572
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,992
-what's going on?
-bomb in a body cavity.

573
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:46,870
man.

574
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,374
all i got is bailey's husband's
open brain.

575
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,459
what procedure?
craniotomy with shepherd.

576
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,127
shepherd's got bailey's
husband on the table?

577
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,003
bailey's having a baby
right now.

578
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,005
excuse me! stop talking.

579
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,024
gotta eat something.

580
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,572
you knew meredith and cristina
would be on the floor with the bomb.

581
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:22,781
yeah.

582
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:23,907
is it wrong that we're jealous?

583
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:24,908
it's all right that we're
jealous,right?

584
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,951
the fact that we're jealous

585
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,371
because they might blow up and die
is not a reflection on our character.

586
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,166
-it's about feeling useless.
-ineffectual.

587
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,210
we couldn't even get meredith
out of bed this morning.

588
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,920
we had to call in cristina.

589
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,381
how embarrassing is that?

590
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,216
you know what i think,george?

591
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,012
i think meredith
and cristina are doers.

592
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:48,599
-They do.They're doers.
-They do,and we--

593
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,185
we watch.

594
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,147
We're watchers.

595
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,776
check mrs.Carlson's levels.

596
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,862
If they are stable,
she can come up here.

597
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,613
All right!

598
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,531
-Excuse me. -Oh,no problem

599
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,492
We have to become more
proactive,george.

600
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,785
We have to become doers.

601
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,581
fight for what we want.

602
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,167
-We have to do.
-Yeah.

603
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:17,836
Oh,you mean...

604
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,714
we are starting right now.
Okay.

605
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,511
Alex.

606
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,056
How crazy is this?
Dude,it's like the apocalypse.

607
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,390
-Alex.
-It's true.

608
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,391
I mean,look around you--

609
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,018
half the people who are
supposed to be saving lives

610
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,603
have fled the building
to save themselves,

611
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,231
bailey's husband almost died
coming to see his kid get born,

612
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,399
the annoying twins are down
on the O.R. Floor with a guy

613
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,235
who literally might explode
in their faces.

614
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,694
It's a morgue waiting
to happen in here.

615
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,571
I'm just saying,people should
get while the getting's good

616
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,864
because there might not
be a tomorrow.

617
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,491
-Alex!
-What?

618
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,876
-Take off your pants.
-Izzie,what are you doing?

619
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,462
I'm being a doer.
Getting while the getting's good.

620
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,588
Now take off your pants.

621
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,090
You do realize that when
I said "the apocalypse,"

622
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,675
I meant it metaphorically,
not literally?

623
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:05,968
Alex...

624
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,180
I haven't had sex
in 8 months and 12 days.

625
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,432
I'm horny,I'm half-naked,
and I'm saying yes.

626
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,725
You want to stand there
and talk metaphors

627
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,186
or do you want to literally
take off your pants?

628
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:27,114
dr.Shepherd,
there's an explosive device

629
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,366
in the O.R. Next door.
I need you to evacuate now.

630
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,660
Yeah,and I've got a guy whose
brain is exposed on this table.

631
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,579
I'm not gonna walk away
and leave him to die.

632
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:36,623
The rest of you can go.

633
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:38,500
You should go.

634
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:40,419
Suction.

635
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:01,106
You close him up.You do
whatever you have to do.

636
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,567
The chief of surgery has
authorized me to tell you

637
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,985
you cannot stay here.

638
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,695
The chief of surgery
doesn't scare me.

639
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,697
Dr. Bailey scares me.

640
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,991
I'm not gonna be the one
to tell her her husband died,

641
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,619
and that's what would happen
if we put his skull flap on

642
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,663
in this condition,
bomb or no bomb.

643
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,123
Now get out of my O.R.

644
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,877
Suction.

645
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,014
I'm trying to get gravity
to do me a favor.

646
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,682
I'm 9 centimeters dilated.

647
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,935
I need that last centimeter.

648
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,895
Good.
That's,uh...

649
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,980
that's good.

650
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:47,820
Dr.Shepherd.

651
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:56,411
Where exactly is my husband?

652
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,546
He's with my husband.

653
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,097
there's no telling
how dangerous it is.

654
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:17,808
We need more info.

655
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:21,353
The longer we wait,

656
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,438
the greater the chance
he'll bleed out and die.

657
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,993
-Pink mist.
-Excuse me?

658
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,417
That's what the bomb squad
calls you when you blow up.

659
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:47,337
Pink mist.
I read that somewhere.

660
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,341
The bomb goes off and...

661
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,762
anyone in range explodes
into a billion pieces.

662
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,016
You're liquid.
here's nothing left.

663
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:04,605
Just flecks of human
flesh and blood.

664
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,067
Pink mist.

665
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,530
Sometimes they don't
even find a finger.

666
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,533
One minute you're a
person...

667
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,370
the next,you're...

668
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:22,498
bloody rain.

669
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,010
-Here,take this.
-What?

670
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,220
Go ahead.

671
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:42,601
Now I want you to squeeze
it in even beats,okay?

672
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,895
No,not too fast.
Not too fast.

673
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,314
There you go.

674
00:35:58,826 --> 00:35:59,785
Dr.Milton?

675
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:09,920
I've got kids.

676
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,885
Even beats.
Okay?

677
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:21,849
That's it.

678
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:39,825
what-- what about my husband?

679
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:44,204
How long can he staylike that,
with live ammo inside him?

680
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,747
I honestly don't know.

681
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,958
But you're gonna try to
save him,right?

682
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,084
We're gonna try.

683
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,336
First,the bomb squad has
to determine the best way

684
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,921
to retrieve the device.

685
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,882
I'm sorry,mindy.
I'm so sorry.

686
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,885
Shut up!We've got three kids,

687
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,220
and you've got him
building bazookas.

688
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:05,893
Oh,god.

689
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,105
he's gonna die.

690
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,483
Uh,paul,why don't you go with
the officer there

691
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,153
and answer his questions about
the device you guys built?

692
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:17,362
Oh,anything.Anything to help.

693
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,991
Uh,karev,why don't we get
mrs.Carlson a cup of coffee?

694
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,745
I-I guess I should look on
the bright side.

695
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,789
It's not like this
can get any worse.

696
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,835
I mean... this is it.

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,046
This is as bad as it gets.

698
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:35,964
Right?

699
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,141
Dr.Bailey...
um,I was...

700
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,559
dr.Bailey, what are you--

701
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,561
-get someone to find me my suitcase.
-I need my suitcase.

702
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,729
I'm goin' home.

703
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,773
Dr.Bailey, you're having a baby.

704
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,192
There's not going to be
any baby born today.

705
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,985
You hear me?
I'm holding it in.

706
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,612
I'll have him tomorrow.

707
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,447
Just not now.
Not like this.

708
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:03,367
No!
Just...

709
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,410
no.

710
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,371
I'm goin' home.

711
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,122
I'm goin' home right now.

712
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,003
I can't.

713
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,466
I can't do this without
my husband.

714
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,304
I can't do this all alone.

715
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,728
Okay,okay.

716
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,860
so how are they gonna
remove that ammo

717
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,946
without killing
hannah and james?

718
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,033
Cristina.

719
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,704
The bomb squad guy said you're
supposed to stay away from there.

720
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,455
Is it me or is hannah shaking?

721
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,710
Is she squeezing that
ambu bag by herself?

722
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,086
Where is dr.Milton?

723
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:04,761
Hannah.

724
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,640
Where is the anesthesiologist?

725
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,058
He,um...

726
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:12,394
he left.

727
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:14,938
He didn't want to die.

728
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,235
Hannah.

729
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,365
I think I'm gonna take
my hand out now.

730
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,370
When the hell are people
gonna learn?

731
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,749
it may not be as bad
as it seems.

732
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,585
Her hand is holding
that device steady.

733
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:40,297
Or maybe her hand is simply
in there with the ammo.

734
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,423
We can't know.

735
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,634
Yeah,well,my guy's talked
to the friend.

736
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:44,510
That device is homemade,

737
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:46,887
which means it's unstable
and very unreliable.

738
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,097
It could be a dud,
but we have no way of knowing.

739
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,099
Add to that the fact
that you've got a surgeon

740
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:52,601
in the O.R. Next door
refusing to leave

741
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:55,145
and a nervous paramedic's hand
inside the body cavity--

742
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,981
it's definitely
as bad as it seems.

743
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,108
That's what I'm saying.

744
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,278
hey,somebody! Help!
We need help in here.

745
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,032
I think I'm just gonna
take it out now,okay?

746
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,909
You made it almost to the finish
line.You can do this.

747
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,620
No,no,I just want to take it out
and be done with it.

748
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,914
hannah,it won't be much longer.

749
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,958
Remember,you're keeping him
from bleeding out.

750
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,293
No!I am 22 years old.

751
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,171
I should not even be in here.
This is some kind of mistake.

752
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,714
She's panicking.
We need to clear the room.

753
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:23,799
I'm not leaving.

754
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,634
-Grey,let's move.
-I'm not leaving her.

755
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,344
You need to get everyone
out now,dr.Burke.

756
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,263
She's my intern.
I am responsible for her.

757
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,390
No,it's gotta come out.
It has to come out.

758
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,517
-Yang,go with dylan.
-You go with dylan.

759
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:35,435
-Hannah,look at me.
-No,it's gotta come out.

760
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,854
-Hannah.
-No,no.

761
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,523
Hannah,look at me.
You can do this.

762
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,483
Hannah, you need to calm down.

763
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,569
You need to relax,hannah.
Everything's gonna be fine.

764
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:44,778
-No! -Hannah.

765
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,698
you can do this.
You can do this,hannah.

766
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:48,824
No,it has to come out.

767
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,535
No,you keep it there just
a little while longer.

768
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:51,702
I have to take it out!
I have to! I have to!

769
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,245
-Hannah. -I have to!

770
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,371
If you leave,
it'll break.

771
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,191
Meredith.

772
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,361
What did I do?

773
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:27,988
oh,god,meredith.

774
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,743
Just stay right
where you are.

775
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,621
Nobody move.
Stay exactly where you are.

776
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,758
What did I do?
What did I do?

777
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:48,884
What did I do?
What did I do?

778
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,344
What did I do?
What did I do?

779
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,638
What did I do?
What did I do?

780
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,518
What did I do?
What did I do?
