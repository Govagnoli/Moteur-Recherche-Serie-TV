1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,643
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:03,324
You and the red make
a pretty good team.

3
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,042
- Don't tell Sloan...
- Oh...

4
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:06,770
She and Sloan aren't happening.

5
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:09,475
- I'm not what you're looking for.
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:11,175
Once a man-whore,
always a man-whore, right?

7
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:15,056
I keep telling her there's more
to life than surgery and career.

8
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:16,542
- Mother.
- It has to be small.

9
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,251
Make an appointment at city hall,
and that'll be that.

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,021
I don't know if I wanna keep
trying to breathe for you.

11
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:24,151
- I'll go.
- He said he spent the day in the clinic

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,660
when he spent it doing
god knows what with Izzie Stevens.

13
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,190
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,895
I mean, no offense.
Today was awesome.

15
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:32,618
It's just you're not my girlfriend.
Okay?

16
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,242
<i>The dream is this:</i>

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,716
<i>that we'll finally be happy
when we reach our goals.</i>

18
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,535
<i>Find the guy,
finish our internship...</i>

19
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:44,972
<i>That's the dream.</i>

20
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,343
<i>Then we get there.</i>

21
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:48,173
<i>And if we're human,</i>

22
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,960
<i>we immediately start dreaming
of something else.</i>

23
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,284
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What are you doing up?

24
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,214
What are you doing up?

25
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,927
I can't sleep.

26
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:58,617
What are we watching?

27
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,377
- Why can't you sleep?
- No reason.

28
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>Because if this is the dream...</i>

29
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,591
<i>then we'd like to wake up...</i>

30
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,638
<i>Now, please.</i>

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,372
Cristina, stop lurking.

32
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,560
Come and say good morning
to your guests.

33
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:22,833
Good morning, mother.

34
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,228
Uh, good morning, Missus...

35
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:26,989
Mama.

36
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,182
What...

37
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:31,428
What's every... everyone...

38
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,118
doing here so early?

39
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,689
Early? Darling,

40
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,182
by the look of the calendar,

41
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,751
we should've been here
6 months ago.

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,851
She doesn't understand
what goes into planning a wedding.

43
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,584
Breathe.

44
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,735
Sip... and breathe.

45
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,599
The police haven't found
anything on our Jane Doe.

46
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:53,592
Well, I believe
she calls herself Ava now.

47
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,822
Yes, well, she doesn't seem
to be getting her memory back.

48
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,380
Now that the rest
of her medical problems

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,775
are taken care of,
I'll see what I can do.

50
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,990
- That'd be great. Thanks.
- Has anybody seen Addison?

51
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:04,155
- Oh, she's gone.
- Gone?

52
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:06,359
- She took a leave of absence.
- Why?

53
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:08,884
- I mean, did she tell you why?
- What'd you do to her, Mark?

54
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:10,127
She didn't give a reason.

55
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,289
Did she tell you
where she was going?

56
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:15,813
All she said was
she need some time,

57
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,840
"To be happy and free",
if I recall correctly.

58
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:20,545
Excuse me.

59
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,569
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

60
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,339
Where I come from...

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,830
elevators tend to be this
kind of aphrodisiac.

62
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:46,308
You know? People get on 'em,
and they just get all horny.

63
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:50,272
No, no. Not that I'm, uh,

64
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,704
not that I'm talking about
you and I. No.

65
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm... I'm just saying,
it... it's a relief.

66
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,997
You know, to be
on a not horny elevator.

67
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,810
You know? Just get on...

68
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,965
And ride... without the sex.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,474
Right?

70
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,482
Oh, my god. I'm becoming
a crazy freak...

71
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:21,609
A crazy, inappropriately chatting freak.

72
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,717
<i>Becoming?</i>

73
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,240
<i>Seems like you're already there.</i>

74
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,399
Hello.

75
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,526
Someone have bones
that need resetting or...

76
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:47,538
- <i>Bridesmaid.</i>
- Excuse me?

77
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:53,578
Bridesmaid.

78
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,615
My mother and...

79
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,310
Burke's mother
have been talking on the phone,

80
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,269
and now they are here...
with me.

81
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,117
To plan the wedding.

82
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,288
Cristina led us to believe
that you were friends.

83
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,300
Okay. I guess.

84
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:15,347
Good. It's settled.

85
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,334
Wait. Um... what are you...

86
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,428
are you... are you...
You actually asking me to be--

87
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:26,846
To be one of my bridesmaids? Yeah.

88
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,157
Did you get any sleep?

89
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:39,629
I did, actually,
after I evicted a raccoon

90
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,624
who chewed his way
into the luggage compartment.

91
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,265
Mm. The trailer.

92
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,484
Yes.

93
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,490
So while you were sleeping...

94
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:51,975
When I drowned,

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
it was different for you
than it was for me.

96
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,231
Something happened to me.

97
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,765
And I really don't know
how to explain it

98
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,192
without sounding like...

99
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:06,450
I just... I feel different.

100
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,100
I wanna be better at everything,

101
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,311
and I wanna let you in.

102
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:13,901
I swear.

103
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,963
Did you practice that?

104
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:20,713
With hand gestures,
but I dropped those.

105
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:26,503
Just, now is not the time
to give up on me, okay?

106
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:27,724
That's what I'm saying.

107
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,775
Oceanside Wellness Group.

108
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,667
Uh, yes. You're confirmed
for tuesday at 4:00.

109
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:58,666
Oh, no. No, Ma'am.
No, I'm not a doctor.

110
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,927
I don't know
what you should do

111
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,504
about the itchiness "Down there."

112
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,141
Okay. Okay, bye.

113
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,525
Hi. I, uh, I think
I'm in the right place.

114
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:19,633
I'm looking for, uh...

115
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,791
Maya, is that you?

116
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:27,250
- Addison!
- Oh, my god. You got so big.

117
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,121
What are you, like, 45 now?

118
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,718
Maya, you're gonna be late for school--

119
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:32,870
Addison.

120
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,227
Naomi.

121
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,039
Surprise!

122
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,139
Oh, I got lost like eight times,

123
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:40,777
I smell like someone who's been
driving in car a for two days,

124
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,851
and I think I just had
some kind of psychotic break

125
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,658
in your elevator, but, um...

126
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:47,602
Surprise!

127
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,519
Maya, go get your backpack.

128
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:54,265
So...

129
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:56,470
What do you want, Addison?

130
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,923
- I miss you.
- Really?

131
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,659
'Cause I haven't heard from you
in over a year.

132
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,881
Unless you count the christmas card,
which was nice.

133
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,574
I know. I'm sorry about... I'm--

134
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,754
I left you messages on your pager.
I e-mailed you.

135
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,603
I had some really
special conversations

136
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,011
- with your voice mail.
- Can we let this go?

137
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,946
I've been having
some rough times lately, okay?

138
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,500
- I got divorced.
- So did I.

139
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:17,256
Oh, my god.

140
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,444
You and Sam?

141
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,645
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, baby.

142
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,130
Sam, I'd say good to see you, but...

143
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,060
- Yeah.
- Your face is everywhere.

144
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,325
"Body language"?

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,809
Uh, yeah, I just...
I had a few thoughts,

146
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,332
so I wrote 'em down,
and that's...

147
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,508
And now you're
the common man's medical guru.

148
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:41,246
Hey, Dell, can you push
my appointments back an hour?

149
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,603
I have to rescue Cooper.

150
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,364
This is Addison.
Addison, this is our shrink.

151
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,081
Violet. Hi. Bye.

152
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,706
- What did Cooper do this time?
- What is Cooper always do?

153
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,396
- A woman.
- Can't believe this.

154
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,475
I'm his colleague,
not his chauffeur.

155
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,099
So this is, uh...
co-op medicine, huh?

156
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,162
Yeah, doctors working together.

157
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:01,285
It's me, Naomi,
we have a pediatrician, a shrink,

158
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,285
an alternative medicine practioner...

159
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,709
- Could you excuse us for just a minute?
- Sure, I can.

160
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,765
- Good morning, Naomi.
- Oh, shut up.

161
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,791
So you two still work together?

162
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:11,808
Hey, Pete.

163
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,155
Who is that redhead
with your ex-wife?

164
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:15,720
She's hot.

165
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:18,541
Possibly insane, but hot.

166
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:19,971
Don't even think about it.

167
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,077
You work with your ex-husband

168
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,358
in a shrine
for your ex-husband.

169
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,877
It's actually a good book.

170
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:29,603
And we're friends.

171
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,739
We stayed friends
even after we got divorced.

172
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,815
It's very healthy.
We're healthy.

173
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,042
What happened between you and Sam?

174
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,537
Addison, you and I were close
in med school.

175
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,472
- It was a long time ago.
- Oh, Naomi.

176
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,592
Come on. You can't stay
mad at me forever.

177
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:47,521
I know you.

178
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,010
- You got fat.
- I did not.

179
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,118
Your hair looks hideous.

180
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,583
- It does not.
- And you're getting really really ugly.

181
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:56,630
I've missed you, too.

182
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,924
So... why are you really here?

183
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,595
You're a fertility specialist,
one of the best.

184
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:09,365
You want to have a baby?

185
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,112
I want to have a baby.

186
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,254
Susan Grey.

187
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,983
You sure you're in the right place?

188
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,184
I have reflux...

189
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:27,344
acid reflux.

190
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,115
And the, uh, hiccups come and go...

191
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,827
when it gets really bad.

192
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,248
They've stopped a few times,
but lately it's been getting...

193
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:36,615
worse.

194
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,059
Have you had chlorpromazine?

195
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,500
- There you go.
- Thank you.

196
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,375
Isn't that the crazy person's drug?

197
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,552
It's used as an anti-psychotic,

198
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,878
but it's also,

199
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,539
helpful with hiccups.

200
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,456
And if we don't stop these soon,
you will be a crazy person.

201
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,753
Hey, how is Meredith doing?

202
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,459
I know they have
that big intern exam coming up,

203
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,013
and she's been really busy.

204
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,450
I tried to call, but...

205
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,110
Hey, no hiccups.

206
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:07,799
Chlorpromazine.

207
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:12,354
I'm not getting any younger, you know?

208
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,260
And I always planned
to have one, it's just...

209
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,892
Well, now clearly,
a man is not in the cards for me.

210
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:20,576
I mean, this is Addison
post Mcdreamy, post Mcsteamy.

211
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:21,835
You know, I just have to...

212
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,651
- Mcwhat?
- Forget it.

213
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:25,933
You know what?
Let's never "Mc" anything.

214
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,601
A baby, that is...

215
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,620
my answer.

216
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,612
Find a sperm donor,
have a baby.

217
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,964
My new dream... a baby.

218
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,608
A baby's not really an answer.

219
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,931
It's more of a crying,
puking, non-answer.

220
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,598
- But you did it.
- With a husband.

221
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:40,716
Yeah, but you did it.

222
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,332
You got married,
you had a baby.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,254
You're my example.

224
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:48,611
Okay, we should check your F.S.H.
And your estradiol levels,

225
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,772
and we should probably do
and antral follicle count.

226
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:52,919
Holy crap.

227
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,928
I'm gonna have a baby.

228
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:00,956
The treadmill, huh?

229
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,973
Okay, what's going on?

230
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,732
I tried to take it up to ten
and do the hilly terrain mode,

231
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,394
which you can do,
but only if you're an olympian,

232
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,887
so I paused and I went flying off.

233
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,810
No. I mean, what's going on with
you pushing yourself this hard?

234
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,665
This is your fourth
sports injury in three months.

235
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,271
I am a sexual person.

236
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,725
I'm a normal sexual person.
I like sex.

237
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,675
I need sex.
And he won't do it.

238
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,851
He won't have sex with me.
He just... won't.

239
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm hoping you're talking
about your husband.

240
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm not hoping
because of the no-sex part...

241
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,284
It's been 18 months.

242
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:39,084
18 months! Do you have
any idea what that is like?

243
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,508
My husband won't do it.

244
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,282
- So you know what Ido?
- Uh, you run.

245
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,348
I run. I run
so I won't sleep with someone else.

246
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,893
I run so I have someplace
to channel my energies.

247
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,677
I run so I won't pick up
a tire iron

248
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,649
and beat my husband to death.
I need sex!

249
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,701
You'd do it with me, right?

250
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,014
I think you need to spend
me time with our therapist.

251
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,482
Thanks for the ride.

252
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,380
- Have you been crying?
- Where's your car?

253
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:25,726
- Were you crying?
- Where's your car?

254
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:27,234
- Were you crying?
- You wanna walk?

255
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,283
I met a girl at a bar...

256
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:33,906
on the Internet...

257
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,035
And she borrowed my car.

258
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:40,649
- Did you file a police report?
- She might bring the car back.

259
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,421
- She was gorgeous and hot and s...
- Okay Cooper, Cooper.

260
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:47,153
All right, so you meet a strange
woman on the Internet again.

261
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,663
You bring her back
to your apartment

262
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,768
to have sex with you again,
and she steals from you again.

263
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,789
What does that suggest
to you about you?

264
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:57,375
That I'm an optimist.

265
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,431
That I believe in magic.

266
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:03,038
That there is a soul mate
out there waiting for me.

267
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,404
Oh, Violet...

268
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,754
Allan's not wort it.
You deserve better.

269
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,801
I know that. I do.

270
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,584
I'm not...

271
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,340
I'm not crying about him.
I'm not.

272
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,536
Don't look at me.
Look over there.

273
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:33,780
I switched my hours at the clinic

274
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,456
so I can go to the bridal shop. Yay!

275
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,884
Did she cheer?
She just cheered.

276
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,860
Someone's not being very bride-y.

277
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,897
I am not a bride.
I am a surgeon.

278
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,668
Don't tease the caged animal.

279
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,166
You're not excited?

280
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,811
I'm excited. I love weddings.

281
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,135
Weddings are
all about hope and the future.

282
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:53,823
Okay. I rescheduled an A.C.L. repair,
but I wanna be clear.

283
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,863
I will not be wearing pink
or baby blue.

284
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,347
I do not do flowers in my hair.

285
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,544
And I will never be seen
with a bow on my ass, okay?

286
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,062
See? She's got the right attitude.

287
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:03,058
Thank you very much.

288
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:09,828
Hi. I... I'm here with Susan.
She's down in the clinic.

289
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:11,266
The clinic?
Is everything okay?

290
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,136
Callie's a bridesmaid?

291
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,046
Yeah, Ca... Yes, of course.
Callie's a bridesmaid.

292
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,626
- Fun.
- Yeah.

293
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,268
You gotta do it.

294
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:28,257
That kid of yours
is gonna need you on your feet.

295
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:31,356
She's cute, huh?
She's a cute shriveled kid.

296
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,218
She's cute. Come on.
Let's keep walking.

297
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,341
So... where is she?

298
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,408
Red... I thought that was on.

299
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,202
- Walk.
- Gossip.

300
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:43,780
You called it.

301
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,432
She was too serious
about the whole thing.

302
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:48,254
And Alex is a rolling stone.

303
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:49,570
I was being thoughtful.

304
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,678
Yeah, right. And dumping red
after one night is sensitive?

305
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,465
Come on.
You need to buff up.

306
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,733
So did she just take off?
What'd you say to her?

307
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:00,023
Did she cry?

308
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,859
Idiot. You divorced Naomi?

309
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,863
Look, just mind your own business.

310
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,751
Moron.
She is my best... friend.

311
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,914
Stop hitting me
on top of my head.

312
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,274
Did you cheat?

313
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,637
Two things I learned
way back in kindergarten...

314
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,533
One, keep your hands to yourself,

315
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,931
two, he who smelt it dealt it.

316
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,208
- That makes no sense.
- Yeah. Well...

317
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:26,416
You cheated.

318
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:29,242
You cheated on your husband
with his best friend.

319
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,237
There. Smelt it, dealt it...
It works.

320
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,998
You're using fart logic.

321
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,946
Hey, if you want details,
go see Naomi.

322
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,903
- She won't talk about it.
- Then you get no details.

323
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,759
- I'm on her side. You know that.
- That's why you get no details.

324
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,882
- Oh, details!
- Woman, be quiet.

325
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,560
I've missed you.

326
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,011
Well, you know,
Naomi's known you longer,

327
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,982
so she gets custody of you
in the divorce.

328
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,341
So, uh, other than project baby,
this is strictly a vacation.

329
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,222
I am here to read trashy novels
and go to the beach.

330
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,319
Okay, nobody over 30
goes to the beach.

331
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,615
You should stay here
at the practice, hang out,

332
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:14,981
see how we work.

333
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,607
It's more fun
than a stuffy hospital.

334
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,849
And we have an empty office.

335
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:21,972
Are you trying to lure me?

336
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,904
Look, maybe.

337
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,698
We do have sunshine
and cute boys.

338
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,177
Speaking of which,
cute boy behind the desk

339
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,862
- is tracking you with his eyes.
- No, he's not.

340
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,579
Oh, cute boy wants Naomi.

341
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,876
Okay, maybe you should shut up...

342
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:38,303
And go get some coffee
or something...

343
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,662
Please.

344
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,025
- You have to stop that.
- Stop what?

345
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,418
You cannot watch me like that.

346
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:50,108
It's... not something you can do.
I won't allow it.

347
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:51,967
Yeah, you can't make
rules about my eyes.

348
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,639
<i>- That's enough!
- No, all of you.</i>

349
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:54,657
Did you hear that?

350
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,225
Did you hear that?

351
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,525
- What was that?
- Did I just hear...

352
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:05,410
I'm the father of that child!

353
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,705
- No, I'm the father!
- If it's anybody's baby, it's mine!

354
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,926
Calm down everybody!

355
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,589
A little help here. A little help.

356
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,056
Dr. Freedman!

357
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,909
Oh, that's great.

358
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,688
- Really great.
- You gotta be kidding me.

359
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,583
You could've called.

360
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:29,060
Oh, it's such a silly problem.
Hiccups?

361
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,424
We didn't want to bother you.

362
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,356
Well, it's not silly
if you can't sleep.

363
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:36,575
Chlorpromazine is good,
but it doesn't always work long-term.

364
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,686
We've had some good result
with endoscopic gastroplication.

365
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:42,957
We put a tube down your throat

366
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,576
and sew together
the bottom of your esophagus

367
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:47,534
to protect it from
the acid in your stomach.

368
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,108
- It would be an outpatient procedure.
- I'm sold.

369
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,453
- Ready when you are.
- You're sure that that's not...

370
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,685
Just think of it like

371
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,525
breathing into a very expensive
brown paper bag.

372
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,896
Okay, let me see
if I can explain this to everyone.

373
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,783
So Carol was married to Rick.

374
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,757
Carol is now married to Doug.

375
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,812
Keith is Lisa's husband.

376
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,285
- Uh, I'm Rick's husband.
- Life partner.

377
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,804
- You're just mad I left you for a man.
- I'm Lisa's husband.

378
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:17,256
- And Lisa is the...
- Surrogate carrying my child.

379
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,248
- Our child.
- You are not the father!

380
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,008
- You don't know that, Rick!
- I am so sick of you!

381
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,402
- Hey, hey!
- O-Okay, okay.

382
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:26,762
Let's all try to remember that
we are in a place of healing.

383
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,318
Uh, Lisa...

384
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,903
H-How are you feeling?

385
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,417
Guilty.
Guilty is how she is feeling.

386
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,188
Wh-why is that, Lisa?

387
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:43,753
Because the same week that
I brought her here to be inseminated,

388
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,464
she had sex with him...

389
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,405
and him... and him.

390
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:51,573
And we have no idea
who the father is.

391
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,333
Yeah, she, um, really gets around.

392
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,739
Okay, how does this happen?

393
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:01,157
How do you pick a super freak

394
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:02,678
- for a surrogate?
- I screened her.

395
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,393
There was nothing there
to indicate she was...

396
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,449
Sex crazed?
Insatiable?

397
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,614
- Cooper-like?
- Oh. Okay.

398
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,656
The point is, everybody's
flipping out over nothing.

399
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,534
Medically,
it has to be Rick's baby.

400
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,088
We implanted Lisa
with a fertilized embryo

401
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,757
from Carol's egg
and Rick's sperm.

402
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,579
Then Rick implanted some more
of his own for good measure.

403
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,099
Before he decided he was gay.

404
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,303
I've treated Doug.

405
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,987
I have him on valerian root
for anxiety and stress.

406
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:26,808
And I knew
he was fooling around,

407
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,849
but with his new wife's surrogate?

408
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,205
Can I just, uh...

409
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,891
I think the more pressing issue,

410
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,825
uh, here, is that, uh,
Lisa's had no prenatal care.

411
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,163
She took off

412
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,184
- right after her, uh...
- Sex-a-thon?

413
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:42,989
Hi. We haven't officially met.
Cooper. Pediatrics.

414
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,275
Hi. Uh, yeah, she... left town,

415
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:47,306
and, uh, she and the baby
need a complete workup.

416
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,560
Um, who's your usual G.Y.N.?

417
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,910
Uh, she left the practice
rather suddenly.

418
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,315
I didn't do anything.

419
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,585
Well, look,
I would be happy to examine her.

420
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,214
Trashy novels can wait.

421
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:02,705
Have you ever thought of...

422
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,776
plying your trade
in sunnier climes, Addison?

423
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:07,398
"sunnier climes"?

424
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:09,640
Now we see why he has to type
to pick up women.

425
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,868
Hey!

426
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:14,501
Besides, we have a very strict
no consorting rule here now.

427
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,318
I didn't do anything.

428
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,471
I can't wait to tell Meredith

429
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,499
her stepmom hiccupped
through the whole thing.

430
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:27,782
She should be here for this.

431
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:30,487
Susan asked her
to be with her father.

432
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,608
She said he's having
a lot of anxiety.

433
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:38,688
And... Meredith is supposed
to help with that?

434
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,713
You know there's nothing
to worry about.

435
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,223
What I...

436
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,105
What I worry about is,

437
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,828
Molly living in a new city

438
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,600
alone with a baby
most of the day.

439
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,750
That's hard. And Lexie, who's...

440
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,451
about to start her residency.

441
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,484
She's a really good student,
but it's grueling.

442
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,582
I know.

443
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,973
You know. Right. And...

444
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,717
I worry about you....

445
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,479
Too. How you're getting on,
your mom...

446
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,526
None of that was... simple.

447
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:17,266
Susan's really on you
to talk to me, huh?

448
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:22,317
I got to admit, I'm envious...

449
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,099
that she's getting to know you,

450
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,203
and I'm not yet.

451
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,977
I think she may be faking
these hiccups.

452
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:36,459
To get... us in the same place?

453
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,666
I guess I'm just not very sexual.

454
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,587
He's having an affair.
He's not in love with me anymore.

455
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,480
That's not true, honey.
I love you. I love you so much.

456
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,086
I-I want to do it.

457
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:55,378
I just want to want to do it.

458
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:59,152
Okay, Paul, I'm gonna give you
some homework for next session.

459
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,754
- Homework?
- Have sex with your wife.

460
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,104
- Well, but...
- No matter what.

461
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,499
Whether you're in the mood or not,
have sex.

462
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:08,513
Do it in the bed,
do it on the kitchen floor.

463
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:09,940
- Do you have a pool?
- Yes.

464
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,095
Okay, do it in the pool.

465
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:12,686
Have sex.

466
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,038
No pressure, no judgment,
no expectations.

467
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:17,961
Have sex. Just... do it.

468
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,826
We do need a new G.Y.N.

469
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,497
- Right.
- And Addison seems...

470
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,446
Oh, no, huh-huh, absolutely not.

471
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,338
- What?
- Addison is a nice person.

472
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:32,991
She is a decent person.

473
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,488
She is a person.

474
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:36,724
I'm lookin' for a person.

475
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,733
Man, you're just looking.

476
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,283
At least I'm trying.

477
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:41,912
Dr. Feelgood.

478
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,138
- Hey.
- I love you.

479
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:45,524
Hi. Thank you.

480
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:49,093
Okay, Dr. Feelgood,
this is what I'm saying.

481
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:50,653
Your career is taking off,

482
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:53,132
girls like that are
throwing themselves at you.

483
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,280
You should be celebrating.

484
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,205
Celebrating?
I just got a divorce.

485
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,792
You got a little tiny dog,

486
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,782
and you cook it chicken,
and you talk to it.

487
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:02,337
- That's not normal.
- Hey, easy. All right?

488
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:06,213
I'm alone because I choose to be.
It's... It's a choice.

489
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,107
So you're saying
that you're not interested in Addison,

490
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,145
but I can't have her.

491
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:12,657
See, Addison isn't
the type of woman you have.

492
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,041
She's a marriage woman.
All right?

493
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,487
She's gonna want a commitment,
and you--

494
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,027
Hey, I do not sleep around.

495
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,747
No. You are a serial monogamist,
all right?

496
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,671
You... You date a girl,
you romance a girl,

497
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:24,464
and when it's time to commit,
you cut and you run.

498
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:26,202
- I do not.
- Linda,

499
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,423
Karen, uh, Julie.

500
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,910
Then there was Tricia,

501
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:31,966
Amy, Carrie, the other Linda...

502
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:34,313
- Fine. I won't ask her out.
- Good boy.

503
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:36,260
That's a good boy.

504
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:38,740
And the week before
I implanted the embryo,

505
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:40,167
you slept with how many, three?

506
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:41,670
Three men.

507
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:43,387
We're almost done here, Lisa,

508
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,025
and then we'll do the amniocentesis.

509
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,218
You're on Carol's side.

510
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,517
I'm Carol's doctor.

511
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,092
You came to us.
You applied to be a surrogate.

512
00:24:50,477 --> 00:24:52,552
- It was your choice.
- I know. I just...

513
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,107
I was about to hand my body over

514
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,738
to a baby that's not mine
for nine month

515
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,325
which is a big responsibility.

516
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:02,523
That... hit me...

517
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:04,570
The responsibility... and I just...

518
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:08,990
They all wanted me.

519
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:11,046
Me.

520
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:15,572
And f-for once,
I just stopped thinking and I just...

521
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,488
I did something wild.

522
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,004
Dr. Montgomery, is something wrong?

523
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,732
I'm gonna run
some more tests.

524
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:32,500
You promise me
you'll take it easy.

525
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,763
I have a stack of dvd's to watch,

526
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,823
and I expect your father
to feed me by hand.

527
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,819
So just call
if you have any questions.

528
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,924
It was nice t-talking with you.

529
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,453
Any news about Mercy West?

530
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,031
Uh, there's a spot.

531
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:11,524
There's a lot of takers,
but they said it looks good.

532
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,240
So after the intern exam...

533
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:16,606
I'm not an unfaithful guy.
I'm not a cheater.

534
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,331
You think it'll happen again
if you stay here...

535
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,980
- With me?
- No, I don't know.

536
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,222
George.

537
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,279
I have to go.

538
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:33,924
- Sam.
- Yeah.

539
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,232
So Paul and Kathy,
I gave them an assignment.

540
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,945
I told 'em to do it.
He didn't rise to the occasion.

541
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:40,131
Nothing?

542
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,369
No wood.

543
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:42,591
Not even a twig.

544
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,086
There's gotta be something
physical going on, right?

545
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,663
Because the only other option...

546
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,142
That he just
doesn't love her anymore...

547
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,362
I mean, that's just...

548
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:51,686
Not the only option.

549
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:55,325
I mean, did they meet
in the drama department in college?

550
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:57,019
Could be a thyroid thing, anemia.

551
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,076
- Could be a bunch of stuff.
- Have you checked for extreme ugliness?

552
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,766
Okay, not funny.
Will you get back to me...

553
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,204
- Yes, I will.
- With what you find soon?

554
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,556
And, Cooper, you know what?

555
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:05,615
Ugly people have sex, Cooper.

556
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:07,634
Ugly people are people, too.

557
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:18,403
Hello?

558
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:22,618
Hello?

559
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,753
You fill out this E.E.G. request on Ava?

560
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:38,913
Yeah, you asked for it.

561
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,683
I asked you to run labs
on her every other day.

562
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,209
- What the hell is this?
- Shepherd's doing a full neuro workup.

563
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:44,955
- Just get the hell of my...
- Go ahead.

564
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,297
I would love to have
an excuse to lay you out.

565
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:49,725
I didn't do anything.

566
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,124
Whatever you didn't do,

567
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,360
sent Addison running for the hills.

568
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,716
Okay, this guy is 6'2",
dark hair, green eyes,

569
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:09,172
totally healthy.
He plays the violin,

570
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:10,934
and he's a physicist.

571
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,541
That is good sperm.

572
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,677
Geeky, but, uh, good.

573
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,358
Lisa has extra donors
if you want to borrow one.

574
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:19,480
Her tests come in yet?

575
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:20,765
No, tomorrow.

576
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,869
I don't want to ring
any alarm bells till we're sure.

577
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:25,793
Ooh. What about this guy?
He's a marine biologist.

578
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:26,881
Good hair.

579
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,009
Are you sure you want to do this?

580
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,023
Your life is really gonna change.

581
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,088
That's why I'm doing this.

582
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:37,838
I want my life to change.

583
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,420
I need... my life to change.

584
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,569
I mean, look, you have Maya.
You have a family.

585
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,864
You did everything
the way you were supposed to.

586
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:47,996
You didn't wait.

587
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:51,088
Maybe I should have.

588
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,243
Waited.

589
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:55,802
What do you mean?

590
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,964
Addison, I did everything

591
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,396
exactly the way
I was supposed to.

592
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:03,981
After college, I never dated anybody
but Sam, because he was the one.

593
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,673
I never had sex with anybody
but Sam because...

594
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:08,269
cheating is wrong.

595
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,374
I had a baby because...

596
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:13,132
That's what you do
when you get married.

597
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,627
I never made a single mistake.
I did everything right.

598
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:20,119
And then Sam comes home
and says he wants a divorce.

599
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:25,303
So all those photos you're...
busy admiring,

600
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:28,354
all they are are reminders
of all the stuff I didn't do.

601
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:30,564
I'm 38 years old,

602
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:32,123
and I don't know
how to have fun.

603
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,893
That's not lucky.
That's sad.

604
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:36,033
So just...
shut up about lucky!

605
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,003
Poor...

606
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,958
sad... dried up Naomi.

607
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,568
Shut up.

608
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,352
Poor little, special

609
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,550
talented doctor girl.

610
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,767
Let's make a made-for-tv movie...

611
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,502
about the poor little, dried up

612
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:01,018
special girl who has no fun.

613
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:04,183
I could put you out.
You'd have to sleep in the car.

614
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:06,382
I just...

615
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,903
I just wish I'd been
a little more like you.

616
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,049
What, an adulterous bitch
who forgot to have kids?

617
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:35,677
Violet?

618
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,109
- Allan.
- Hey!

619
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,928
- Great to see you.
- How you doing?

620
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,970
I'm great. Really.
I'm really wonderful.

621
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:48,758
Well, I saw you and I...
I didn't want to be rude.

622
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,082
So I hope it's okay.

623
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,676
You know, it's just...

624
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:54,955
It's really wonderful to see you.

625
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:55,997
You look, uh...

626
00:30:57,512 --> 00:30:58,822
You look really wonderful.

627
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,560
They didn't have
the gouda you like,

628
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:03,348
but they had a camembert... Hi.

629
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,055
Hi.

630
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,729
This is Violet.

631
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:08,298
Violet... Oh, Violet.

632
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,078
Hi.

633
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:12,131
Nice to meet you.
I-I'm Cami.

634
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:15,970
Allan's wife.

635
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:20,224
God, I still can't get used
to that word... Wife.

636
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:23,997
Uh, wife?

637
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:30,778
- How long have you been married?
- Newlyweds...

638
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:32,584
eight weeks.

639
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,667
Congratulations.

640
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,723
We'll see you.

641
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,829
Nice to meet you.

642
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:10,851
Hey, Addison, uh, latte?

643
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:12,789
Or ac... more of a cappuccino.

644
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,004
Lisa's baby has something

645
00:32:15,012 --> 00:32:17,035
- called lacenta accreta.
- Is that bad?

646
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,919
The placenta abnormally
attaches to the uterine wall.

647
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,046
It makes delivering dangerous
for both mom and baby.

648
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:25,468
- But there was something else.
- That's not enough?

649
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,342
The baby has some genetic markers

650
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,872
that don't match Carol,

651
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:30,581
just Lisa.

652
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,120
What? The embryo...

653
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:34,492
- Did not implant.
- This is Lisa's baby?

654
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:37,816
Which also means
that the paternity is once again

655
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,027
up for grabs.

656
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,139
Good luck.
I'm off to the beach.

657
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,127
Uh, you can't leave.
Someone has to tell the patient.

658
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,981
Honestly, I ha... I have...

659
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,343
low people skills
with anybody over 12.

660
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,642
It's true. An Internet
hooker just stole his car...

661
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,831
Violet! Privacy. She was not...

662
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:56,652
She just...

663
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,464
She borrowed my car.

664
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,978
She... She borrowed.
Borrowed.

665
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,471
911 turbo, hand-sewn leather seats.

666
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,029
911 turbo with hand-sewn
leather seats.

667
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,128
Who does that,

668
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:20,611
to a 911?

669
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,836
A chick. A crazy chick.

670
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:26,027
- But she was so hot.
- A crazy hot chick.

671
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:27,390
I loved that car.

672
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:29,540
That was a single man's car.

673
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,458
That's the point.
I mean, I...

674
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,499
I thought maybe
I was done being single.

675
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,197
I thought she was gonna be
the mother of my children.

676
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,396
What was her name again?

677
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,040
Sexyboobs316.

678
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,378
Are you...

679
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,177
Dude, are you crying?

680
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,266
You better be crying
about that car

681
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:54,137
and not over sexyboobs315.

682
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:55,400
316.

683
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,197
I can't. I can't.
I'm gonna hurt him.

684
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:03,129
Let's just say he's crying
over the car and the woman.

685
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,940
All right? There we go.
Let it out.

686
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:08,968
Let it out.

687
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,256
Uh, Cristina?

688
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:23,544
That's a pretty one.

689
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:26,549
Moves very well in it.
Looks quite natural.

690
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:29,370
- You paged?
- I need you over here.

691
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:32,946
Should I be seeing you in
the dress before the wedding?

692
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:34,989
You think I'm wearing this?

693
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:41,382
- Well, it is very femine.
- Exactly.

694
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:45,248
Do you know your mother booked
a chapel that sits 200 people?

695
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:47,635
Okay, how did I get bridesmaids, huh?

696
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,137
Freakin' stupid cotton-candy
colored bridesmaids?

697
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,735
No offense.

698
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:55,045
What happened to our small ceremony?

699
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:57,585
What happened to you
and me at city hall?

700
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,877
I didn't...
I didn't think you were serious.

701
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:03,971
I am not wearing this.

702
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,881
Oh, I gotta get to the hospital.

703
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,420
You know, we should, uh,
give 'em some privacy.

704
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,681
What?

705
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:16,443
Oh, you want me to go
over there with you...

706
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:19,054
- By myself.
- Yeah.

707
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:22,590
You want a big wedding?

708
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,622
You want the chapel,

709
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:27,148
you want the guests
and me in a white dress?

710
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:29,416
Well...

711
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:31,679
Yes.

712
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:35,174
I'm a traditional man, Cristina.

713
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,249
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

714
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,858
The saleslady has another batch
of dresses for you to see, Cristina.

715
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,872
Oh, thank you... Mama.

716
00:35:57,386 --> 00:36:00,897
Cristina has certainly
made quite an effort.

717
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:03,941
Tried on, I would say,
over a hundred dresses,

718
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,158
and that certainly could not
have been easy for her.

719
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:10,462
Yeah, Mama, I know she seems
disinterested in wedding planning.

720
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:12,510
But Cristina...

721
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,319
she's not cold.

722
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,939
- I know she seems cold...
- Preston...

723
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,345
If you think Cristina
is right for you,

724
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,270
I trust you.

725
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,435
I trust your instincts.

726
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,410
And the baby, the, um...

727
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:41,251
the baby isn't even mine?

728
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:43,091
- Honey, calm down.
- Calm down?

729
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,460
You mean I can keep this baby
if I want to?

730
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:48,280
Uh, legally, yes.

731
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,096
So who's the father?

732
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:53,067
We won't know the paternity
of the baby till after Lisa delivers.

733
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:56,366
More urgent at the moment
is the lacenta accreta.

734
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,510
The fact is, Lisa is at risk

735
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:00,337
of having
a life-threatening hemorrhage

736
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,309
and the baby could deliver preterm.

737
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:04,883
So you're saying they could die?

738
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:07,988
There is a risk of death, yes.

739
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:09,709
Lisa,

740
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,118
I know you're scared.

741
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:15,206
If you do go into preterm labor,
you'll have a c-section.

742
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,137
And they'll monitor it
and control it so that they have

743
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:20,068
a better chance
of saving your uterus

744
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:21,510
and your life.

745
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:23,945
And you'll save us,
me and the baby?

746
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:25,678
Well, I have...

747
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:27,705
I have to get back to Seattle.

748
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,892
I have a practice.
But I can refer you to someone local...

749
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,168
No, I want you.
You be there.

750
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,444
I thought Kathy was coming
to the appointment today.

751
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,191
Just...
Kathy didn't come home last night.

752
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,492
And, you know,
I don't blame her, but it's just...

753
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,251
What... What if
she's with some guy right now?

754
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,507
Some guy... some... some guy...

755
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,619
who can... who can bring it?

756
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,276
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

757
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:04,834
It's okay. All right?

758
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,082
There are plenty of medical
reasons for low sex drive.

759
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,284
All right?

760
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,964
Sorry. Sorry.

761
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:12,513
Honey... where were you?

762
00:38:13,412 --> 00:38:14,424
I was out.

763
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,223
All night?

764
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:20,596
And I had a chance to cheat,
believe me.

765
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:22,782
But I passed. Okay?

766
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:25,082
I passed up being with someone
who actually wants to be with me

767
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,445
because I am stuck with you.

768
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,027
You're crying?

769
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,168
Okay, let's...
let's all just calm down here.

770
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,575
I'll be in the waiting room.

771
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,833
Oh! She's starting to hate me.

772
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:41,111
Oh. What am I gonna do if
little Paul can't perform?

773
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,521
Don't talk about your penis
while you hug another man.

774
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,175
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay.

775
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:49,638
- I'm sorry.
- Let's draw some blood.

776
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,063
Let's draw some blood.

777
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:56,983
What's in L.A.?

778
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,431
What?

779
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,253
For Addison.

780
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:02,221
Any idea...

781
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,167
what she might be doing there?

782
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,993
Uh... Naomi and Sam are
down there, I guess. I don't know.

783
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:09,900
You all right?

784
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:12,575
We were gonna try.

785
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,476
We were gonna make a go of it...

786
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,312
as a couple.

787
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,677
She bet me I couldn't go
60 days without having sex.

788
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:24,165
Oh. Let me guess.
You couldn't do it.

789
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,543
No, she couldn't.

790
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:32,315
She didn't want to be with me.

791
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:34,220
I thought she did.

792
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:36,719
I thought she might.

793
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:39,827
But she didn't.

794
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:44,731
And I caught her.
You know...

795
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,395
Sleeping with somebody else?

796
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:50,610
That must have been
so hard for you.

797
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:53,190
Not that I can't relate.

798
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,449
So I told her I did it.

799
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,408
You told her you did it?

800
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:01,550
I told her I lost the bet.
I told her I slept with someone.

801
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:04,152
I figured if she didn't want
to be with me,

802
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,044
she shouldn't have to
feel guilty about it.

803
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,419
Selfless. That's...

804
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:10,963
- out of character.
- Yeah.

805
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:14,856
Anyway, uh...

806
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:19,823
I was just wondering
if you knew what was in L.A.

807
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,354
No.

808
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,045
Okay,

809
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:30,688
now I am going to the beach.

810
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:31,777
Wait, Addie.

811
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:35,223
- Your test results came back in.
- Oh, good.

812
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:37,962
Because, um, I picked a donor.

813
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:40,122
I think I'm gonna go
with physicist guy.

814
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:42,282
Your F.S.H. level is high.

815
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,223
Well, they're high this month.
We can do, uh,

816
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:47,406
ovarian stimulation.

817
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,849
And your antral follicle count
is only two.

818
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:54,615
That could be due to stress.

819
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:56,963
Addison, I'm sorry.

820
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:58,550
I did all the tests.

821
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,743
There's no fertility potential here.

822
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:12,906
This is good. This is, um...

823
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:16,891
Oh, this is just... perfect.

824
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:18,994
- Addison...
- I have the great guy.

825
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:22,643
I don't have a baby because
I'm focusing on my career.

826
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:24,670
Then I have the other guy.
I don't have his baby

827
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,172
because he's not the great guy.

828
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:29,225
And now I don't have
the great guy or the other guy,

829
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:31,836
and I'm finally ready
to have a baby, and I can't.

830
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,458
That is so...

831
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,754
exactly what my life is.

832
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,415
Addie, there are other options.

833
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,965
Yeah,
I know about the options.

834
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:44,753
I'm so sorry.

835
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,116
I know how much you wanted this.

836
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:50,796
It's okay.

837
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:53,387
I just, um...

838
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,098
I just didn't realize
I was out of time, that's all.

839
00:42:02,057 --> 00:42:03,850
Addie, please stay so we can...

840
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,300
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

841
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:07,722
Thank you... for telling me.

842
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:09,516
Thank you.
I will see you at home.

843
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,716
<i>Looks like you had a bad day.</i>

844
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:24,734
Okay...

845
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:26,950
enough.

846
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:29,138
Okay? Not today.

847
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:31,392
This is not a good day all right?

848
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:34,314
So why don't you just... shut up?

849
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,197
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

850
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,331
All right, then.
