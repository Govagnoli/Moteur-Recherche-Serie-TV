1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:01,795
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:01,805 --> 00:00:03,476
You and the red make
a pretty good team.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,194
- Don't tell Sloan...
- Oh...

4
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:06,922
She and Sloan aren't happening.

5
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:09,627
- I'm not what you're looking for.
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,327
Once a man-whore,
always a man-whore, right?

7
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:15,208
I keep telling her there's more
to life than surgery and career.

8
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:16,694
- Mother.
- It has to be small.

9
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:19,403
Make an appointment at city hall,
and that'll be that.

10
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,173
I don't know if I wanna keep
trying to breathe for you.

11
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:24,303
- I'll go.
- He said he spent the day in the clinic

12
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,812
when he spent it doing
god knows what with Izzie Stevens.

13
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,342
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

14
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,047
I mean, no offense.
Today was awesome.

15
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,770
It's just you're not my girlfriend.
Okay?

16
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:37,394
<i>The dream is this:</i>

17
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,868
<i>that we'll finally be happy
when we reach our goals.</i>

18
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:43,687
<i>Find the guy,
finish our internship...</i>

19
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,124
<i>That's the dream.</i>

20
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,495
<i>Then we get there.</i>

21
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,325
<i>And if we're human,</i>

22
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:51,112
<i>we immediately start dreaming
of something else.</i>

23
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,436
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What are you doing up?

24
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,366
What are you doing up?

25
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,079
I can't sleep.

26
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,769
What are we watching?

27
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,529
- Why can't you sleep?
- No reason.

28
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,664
<i>Because if this is the dream...</i>

29
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,743
<i>then we'd like to wake up...</i>

30
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:11,790
<i>Now, please.</i>

31
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,524
Cristina, stop lurking.

32
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:20,712
Come and say good morning
to your guests.

33
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,985
Good morning, mother.

34
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,380
Uh, good morning, Missus...

35
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,141
Mama.

36
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,334
What...

37
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:31,580
What's every... everyone...

38
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,270
doing here so early?

39
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:34,841
Early? Darling,

40
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,334
by the look of the calendar,

41
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,903
we should've been here
6 months ago.

42
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:41,003
She doesn't understand
what goes into planning a wedding.

43
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:44,736
Breathe.

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,887
Sip... and breathe.

45
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,751
The police haven't found
anything on our Jane Doe.

46
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,744
Well, I believe
she calls herself Ava now.

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,974
Yes, well, she doesn't seem
to be getting her memory back.

48
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,532
Now that the rest
of her medical problems

49
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,927
are taken care of,
I'll see what I can do.

50
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,114
- That'd be great. Thanks.
- Has anybody seen Addison?

51
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,307
- Oh, she's gone.
- Gone?

52
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,511
- She took a leave of absence.
- Why?

53
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:09,036
- I mean, did she tell you why?
- What'd you do to her, Mark?

54
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,279
She didn't give a reason.

55
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,441
Did she tell you
where she was going?

56
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,965
All she said was
she need some time,

57
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,992
"To be happy and free",
if I recall correctly.

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,697
Excuse me.

59
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,721
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

60
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,491
Where I come from...

61
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,982
elevators tend to be this
kind of aphrodisiac.

62
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:46,460
You know? People get on 'em,
and they just get all horny.

63
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,424
No, no. Not that I'm, uh,

64
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,856
not that I'm talking about
you and I. No.

65
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:55,012
I'm... I'm just saying,
it... it's a relief.

66
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,149
You know, to be
on a not horny elevator.

67
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,962
You know? Just get on...

68
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:04,117
And ride... without the sex.

69
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,626
Right?

70
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,634
Oh, my god. I'm becoming
a crazy freak...

71
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,761
A crazy, inappropriately chatting freak.

72
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:23,869
<i>Becoming?</i>

73
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,392
<i>Seems like you're already there.</i>

74
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:39,551
Hello.

75
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,678
Someone have bones
that need resetting or...

76
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,690
- <i>Bridesmaid.</i>
- Excuse me?

77
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:53,730
Bridesmaid.

78
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,767
My mother and...

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,462
Burke's mother
have been talking on the phone,

80
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,421
and now they are here...
with me.

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,269
To plan the wedding.

82
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,440
Cristina led us to believe
that you were friends.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,452
Okay. I guess.

84
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,499
Good. It's settled.

85
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,486
Wait. Um... what are you...

86
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,580
are you... are you...
You actually asking me to be--

87
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,998
To be one of my bridesmaids? Yeah.

88
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,309
Did you get any sleep?

89
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,781
I did, actually,
after I evicted a raccoon

90
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,776
who chewed his way
into the luggage compartment.

91
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,417
Mm. The trailer.

92
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,636
Yes.

93
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:47,642
So while you were sleeping...

94
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:52,127
When I drowned,

95
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:54,832
it was different for you
than it was for me.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,383
Something happened to me.

97
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,917
And I really don't know
how to explain it

98
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,344
without sounding like...

99
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,602
I just... I feel different.

100
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:09,252
I wanna be better at everything,

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,463
and I wanna let you in.

102
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,053
I swear.

103
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,115
Did you practice that?

104
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,865
With hand gestures,
but I dropped those.

105
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,655
Just, now is not the time
to give up on me, okay?

106
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:27,876
That's what I'm saying.

107
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:48,927
Oceanside Wellness Group.

108
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,819
Uh, yes. You're confirmed
for tuesday at 4:00.

109
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,818
Oh, no. No, Ma'am.
No, I'm not a doctor.

110
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,079
I don't know
what you should do

111
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,656
about the itchiness "Down there."

112
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,293
Okay. Okay, bye.

113
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:18,677
Hi. I, uh, I think
I'm in the right place.

114
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:19,785
I'm looking for, uh...

115
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,943
Maya, is that you?

116
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,402
- Addison!
- Oh, my god. You got so big.

117
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,273
What are you, like, 45 now?

118
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,870
Maya, you're gonna be late for school--

119
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,022
Addison.

120
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,379
Naomi.

121
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,191
Surprise!

122
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, I got lost like eight times,

123
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,929
I smell like someone who's been
driving in car a for two days,

124
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,003
and I think I just had
some kind of psychotic break

125
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:45,810
in your elevator, but, um...

126
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,754
Surprise!

127
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,671
Maya, go get your backpack.

128
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:54,417
So...

129
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:56,622
What do you want, Addison?

130
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,075
- I miss you.
- Really?

131
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:00,811
'Cause I haven't heard from you
in over a year.

132
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:04,033
Unless you count the christmas card,
which was nice.

133
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,726
I know. I'm sorry about... I'm--

134
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:07,906
I left you messages on your pager.
I e-mailed you.

135
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,755
I had some really
special conversations

136
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,163
- with your voice mail.
- Can we let this go?

137
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,098
I've been having
some rough times lately, okay?

138
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,652
- I got divorced.
- So did I.

139
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,408
Oh, my god.

140
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:19,596
You and Sam?

141
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,797
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, baby.

142
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,282
Sam, I'd say good to see you, but...

143
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,212
- Yeah.
- Your face is everywhere.

144
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,477
"Body language"?

145
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,961
Uh, yeah, I just...
I had a few thoughts,

146
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,484
so I wrote 'em down,
and that's...

147
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,660
And now you're
the common man's medical guru.

148
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:41,398
Hey, Dell, can you push
my appointments back an hour?

149
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:42,755
I have to rescue Cooper.

150
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,516
This is Addison.
Addison, this is our shrink.

151
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,233
Violet. Hi. Bye.

152
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,858
- What did Cooper do this time?
- What is Cooper always do?

153
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,548
- A woman.
- Can't believe this.

154
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,627
I'm his colleague,
not his chauffeur.

155
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:56,251
So this is, uh...
co-op medicine, huh?

156
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,314
Yeah, doctors working together.

157
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:01,437
It's me, Naomi,
we have a pediatrician, a shrink,

158
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,437
an alternative medicine practioner...

159
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,861
- Could you excuse us for just a minute?
- Sure, I can.

160
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,917
- Good morning, Naomi.
- Oh, shut up.

161
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,943
So you two still work together?

162
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:11,960
Hey, Pete.

163
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,307
Who is that redhead
with your ex-wife?

164
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,872
She's hot.

165
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,693
Possibly insane, but hot.

166
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:20,123
Don't even think about it.

167
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,229
You work with your ex-husband

168
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,510
in a shrine
for your ex-husband.

169
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:28,029
It's actually a good book.

170
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,755
And we're friends.

171
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,891
We stayed friends
even after we got divorced.

172
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:33,967
It's very healthy.
We're healthy.

173
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,194
What happened between you and Sam?

174
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,689
Addison, you and I were close
in med school.

175
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:42,624
- It was a long time ago.
- Oh, Naomi.

176
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:45,744
Come on. You can't stay
mad at me forever.

177
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:47,673
I know you.

178
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,162
- You got fat.
- I did not.

179
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:51,270
Your hair looks hideous.

180
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,735
- It does not.
- And you're getting really really ugly.

181
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:56,782
I've missed you, too.

182
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:02,076
So... why are you really here?

183
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,747
You're a fertility specialist,
one of the best.

184
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:09,517
You want to have a baby?

185
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,264
I want to have a baby.

186
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,018
Susan Grey.

187
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,747
You sure you're in the right place?

188
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,948
I have reflux...

189
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,108
acid reflux.

190
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,879
And the, uh, hiccups come and go...

191
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,591
when it gets really bad.

192
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,012
They've stopped a few times,
but lately it's been getting...

193
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,379
worse.

194
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:39,823
Have you had chlorpromazine?

195
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,264
- There you go.
- Thank you.

196
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,139
Isn't that the crazy person's drug?

197
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,316
It's used as an anti-psychotic,

198
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,642
but it's also,

199
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,303
helpful with hiccups.

200
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,220
And if we don't stop these soon,
you will be a crazy person.

201
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:56,517
Hey, how is Meredith doing?

202
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:59,223
I know they have
that big intern exam coming up,

203
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,777
and she's been really busy.

204
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,214
I tried to call, but...

205
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,874
Hey, no hiccups.

206
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:09,563
Chlorpromazine.

207
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,118
I'm not getting any younger, you know?

208
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,024
And I always planned
to have one, it's just...

209
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,656
Well, now clearly,
a man is not in the cards for me.

210
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:22,340
I mean, this is Addison
post Mcdreamy, post Mcsteamy.

211
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,599
You know, I just have to...

212
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,415
- Mcwhat?
- Forget it.

213
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,697
You know what?
Let's never "Mc" anything.

214
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,365
A baby, that is...

215
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,384
my answer.

216
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,376
Find a sperm donor,
have a baby.

217
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,728
My new dream... a baby.

218
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,372
A baby's not really an answer.

219
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,695
It's more of a crying,
puking, non-answer.

220
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,362
- But you did it.
- With a husband.

221
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,480
Yeah, but you did it.

222
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,096
You got married,
you had a baby.

223
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,018
You're my example.

224
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,375
Okay, we should check your F.S.H.
And your estradiol levels,

225
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,536
and we should probably do
and antral follicle count.

226
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,683
Holy crap.

227
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:56,692
I'm gonna have a baby.

228
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,720
The treadmill, huh?

229
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,737
Okay, what's going on?

230
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,496
I tried to take it up to ten
and do the hilly terrain mode,

231
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,158
which you can do,
but only if you're an olympian,

232
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,651
so I paused and I went flying off.

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,574
No. I mean, what's going on with
you pushing yourself this hard?

234
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,429
This is your fourth
sports injury in three months.

235
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,035
I am a sexual person.

236
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,489
I'm a normal sexual person.
I like sex.

237
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,439
I need sex.
And he won't do it.

238
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:32,615
He won't have sex with me.
He just... won't.

239
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,184
I'm hoping you're talking
about your husband.

240
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:36,024
I'm not hoping
because of the no-sex part...

241
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,048
It's been 18 months.

242
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:40,848
18 months! Do you have
any idea what that is like?

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,272
My husband won't do it.

244
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,046
- So you know what Ido?
- Uh, you run.

245
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:48,112
I run. I run
so I won't sleep with someone else.

246
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,657
I run so I have someplace
to channel my energies.

247
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:52,441
I run so I won't pick up
a tire iron

248
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,413
and beat my husband to death.
I need sex!

249
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,465
You'd do it with me, right?

250
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:05,778
I think you need to spend
me time with our therapist.

251
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,246
Thanks for the ride.

252
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,144
- Have you been crying?
- Where's your car?

253
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:27,490
- Were you crying?
- Where's your car?

254
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,998
- Were you crying?
- You wanna walk?

255
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,047
I met a girl at a bar...

256
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,670
on the Internet...

257
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:37,799
And she borrowed my car.

258
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,413
- Did you file a police report?
- She might bring the car back.

259
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,185
- She was gorgeous and hot and s...
- Okay Cooper, Cooper.

260
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,917
All right, so you meet a strange
woman on the Internet again.

261
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,427
You bring her back
to your apartment

262
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,532
to have sex with you again,
and she steals from you again.

263
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,553
What does that suggest
to you about you?

264
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:59,139
That I'm an optimist.

265
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,195
That I believe in magic.

266
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:04,802
That there is a soul mate
out there waiting for me.

267
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,168
Oh, Violet...

268
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:16,518
Allan's not wort it.
You deserve better.

269
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,565
I know that. I do.

270
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,348
I'm not...

271
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,104
I'm not crying about him.
I'm not.

272
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,300
Don't look at me.
Look over there.

273
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:35,544
I switched my hours at the clinic

274
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,220
so I can go to the bridal shop. Yay!

275
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,648
Did she cheer?
She just cheered.

276
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,624
Someone's not being very bride-y.

277
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:42,661
I am not a bride.
I am a surgeon.

278
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,432
Don't tease the caged animal.

279
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:45,930
You're not excited?

280
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,575
I'm excited. I love weddings.

281
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:51,899
Weddings are
all about hope and the future.

282
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,587
Okay. I rescheduled an A.C.L. repair,
but I wanna be clear.

283
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,627
I will not be wearing pink
or baby blue.

284
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,111
I do not do flowers in my hair.

285
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,308
And I will never be seen
with a bow on my ass, okay?

286
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,826
See? She's got the right attitude.

287
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,822
Thank you very much.

288
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:11,592
Hi. I... I'm here with Susan.
She's down in the clinic.

289
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,030
The clinic?
Is everything okay?

290
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:14,900
Callie's a bridesmaid?

291
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,810
Yeah, Ca... Yes, of course.
Callie's a bridesmaid.

292
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:22,390
- Fun.
- Yeah.

293
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,032
You gotta do it.

294
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,021
That kid of yours
is gonna need you on your feet.

295
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,120
She's cute, huh?
She's a cute shriveled kid.

296
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,982
She's cute. Come on.
Let's keep walking.

297
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,105
So... where is she?

298
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,172
Red... I thought that was on.

299
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,966
- Walk.
- Gossip.

300
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,544
You called it.

301
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,196
She was too serious
about the whole thing.

302
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,018
And Alex is a rolling stone.

303
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,334
I was being thoughtful.

304
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:54,442
Yeah, right. And dumping red
after one night is sensitive?

305
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,229
Come on.
You need to buff up.

306
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,497
So did she just take off?
What'd you say to her?

307
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:01,787
Did she cry?

308
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,623
Idiot. You divorced Naomi?

309
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,627
Look, just mind your own business.

310
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,515
Moron.
She is my best... friend.

311
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,678
Stop hitting me
on top of my head.

312
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,038
Did you cheat?

313
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,401
Two things I learned
way back in kindergarten...

314
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,297
One, keep your hands to yourself,

315
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,695
two, he who smelt it dealt it.

316
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:25,972
- That makes no sense.
- Yeah. Well...

317
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,180
You cheated.

318
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:31,006
You cheated on your husband
with his best friend.

319
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:33,001
There. Smelt it, dealt it...
It works.

320
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,762
You're using fart logic.

321
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,710
Hey, if you want details,
go see Naomi.

322
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:38,667
- She won't talk about it.
- Then you get no details.

323
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:41,523
- I'm on her side. You know that.
- That's why you get no details.

324
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,646
- Oh, details!
- Woman, be quiet.

325
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,324
I've missed you.

326
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,775
Well, you know,
Naomi's known you longer,

327
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:57,746
so she gets custody of you
in the divorce.

328
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:07,105
So, uh, other than project baby,
this is strictly a vacation.

329
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:10,986
I am here to read trashy novels
and go to the beach.

330
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:13,083
Okay, nobody over 30
goes to the beach.

331
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,379
You should stay here
at the practice, hang out,

332
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:16,745
see how we work.

333
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:19,371
It's more fun
than a stuffy hospital.

334
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,613
And we have an empty office.

335
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,736
Are you trying to lure me?

336
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:25,668
Look, maybe.

337
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,462
We do have sunshine
and cute boys.

338
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,941
Speaking of which,
cute boy behind the desk

339
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,626
- is tracking you with his eyes.
- No, he's not.

340
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:35,343
Oh, cute boy wants Naomi.

341
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:37,640
Okay, maybe you should shut up...

342
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:40,067
And go get some coffee
or something...

343
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,426
Please.

344
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,789
- You have to stop that.
- Stop what?

345
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,182
You cannot watch me like that.

346
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,872
It's... not something you can do.
I won't allow it.

347
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,731
Yeah, you can't make
rules about my eyes.

348
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,403
<i>- That's enough!
- No, all of you.</i>

349
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,421
Did you hear that?

350
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,989
Did you hear that?

351
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,289
- What was that?
- Did I just hear...

352
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,174
I'm the father of that child!

353
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,469
- No, I'm the father!
- If it's anybody's baby, it's mine!

354
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,690
Calm down everybody!

355
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,353
A little help here. A little help.

356
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:17,820
Dr. Freedman!

357
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,673
Oh, that's great.

358
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,452
- Really great.
- You gotta be kidding me.

359
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:27,745
You could've called.

360
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,222
Oh, it's such a silly problem.
Hiccups?

361
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,586
We didn't want to bother you.

362
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:33,518
Well, it's not silly
if you can't sleep.

363
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,737
Chlorpromazine is good,
but it doesn't always work long-term.

364
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,848
We've had some good result
with endoscopic gastroplication.

365
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,119
We put a tube down your throat

366
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,738
and sew together
the bottom of your esophagus

367
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,696
to protect it from
the acid in your stomach.

368
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:51,270
- It would be an outpatient procedure.
- I'm sold.

369
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:53,615
- Ready when you are.
- You're sure that that's not...

370
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:54,847
Just think of it like

371
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,687
breathing into a very expensive
brown paper bag.

372
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,058
Okay, let me see
if I can explain this to everyone.

373
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,945
So Carol was married to Rick.

374
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,919
Carol is now married to Doug.

375
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:09,974
Keith is Lisa's husband.

376
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:12,447
- Uh, I'm Rick's husband.
- Life partner.

377
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:14,966
- You're just mad I left you for a man.
- I'm Lisa's husband.

378
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:18,418
- And Lisa is the...
- Surrogate carrying my child.

379
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:20,410
- Our child.
- You are not the father!

380
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:23,170
- You don't know that, Rick!
- I am so sick of you!

381
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,564
- Hey, hey!
- O-Okay, okay.

382
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,924
Let's all try to remember that
we are in a place of healing.

383
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,480
Uh, Lisa...

384
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,065
H-How are you feeling?

385
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:38,579
Guilty.
Guilty is how she is feeling.

386
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:41,350
Wh-why is that, Lisa?

387
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,915
Because the same week that
I brought her here to be inseminated,

388
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:46,626
she had sex with him...

389
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,567
and him... and him.

390
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,735
And we have no idea
who the father is.

391
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,495
Yeah, she, um, really gets around.

392
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,901
Okay, how does this happen?

393
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:02,319
How do you pick a super freak

394
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:03,840
- for a surrogate?
- I screened her.

395
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,555
There was nothing there
to indicate she was...

396
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,611
Sex crazed?
Insatiable?

397
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,776
- Cooper-like?
- Oh. Okay.

398
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,818
The point is, everybody's
flipping out over nothing.

399
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,696
Medically,
it has to be Rick's baby.

400
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:16,250
We implanted Lisa
with a fertilized embryo

401
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,919
from Carol's egg
and Rick's sperm.

402
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:20,741
Then Rick implanted some more
of his own for good measure.

403
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,261
Before he decided he was gay.

404
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:23,465
I've treated Doug.

405
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:26,149
I have him on valerian root
for anxiety and stress.

406
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,970
And I knew
he was fooling around,

407
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:30,011
but with his new wife's surrogate?

408
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,367
Can I just, uh...

409
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,053
I think the more pressing issue,

410
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,987
uh, here, is that, uh,
Lisa's had no prenatal care.

411
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,325
She took off

412
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,346
- right after her, uh...
- Sex-a-thon?

413
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,151
Hi. We haven't officially met.
Cooper. Pediatrics.

414
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,437
Hi. Uh, yeah, she... left town,

415
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:48,468
and, uh, she and the baby
need a complete workup.

416
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,722
Um, who's your usual G.Y.N.?

417
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,072
Uh, she left the practice
rather suddenly.

418
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,477
I didn't do anything.

419
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:00,747
Well, look,
I would be happy to examine her.

420
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,376
Trashy novels can wait.

421
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,867
Have you ever thought of...

422
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,938
plying your trade
in sunnier climes, Addison?

423
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:08,560
"sunnier climes"?

424
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,802
Now we see why he has to type
to pick up women.

425
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,030
Hey!

426
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:15,663
Besides, we have a very strict
no consorting rule here now.

427
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,480
I didn't do anything.

428
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:25,633
I can't wait to tell Meredith

429
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,661
her stepmom hiccupped
through the whole thing.

430
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,944
She should be here for this.

431
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,649
Susan asked her
to be with her father.

432
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,770
She said he's having
a lot of anxiety.

433
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,850
And... Meredith is supposed
to help with that?

434
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,875
You know there's nothing
to worry about.

435
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,385
What I...

436
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,267
What I worry about is,

437
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,990
Molly living in a new city

438
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,762
alone with a baby
most of the day.

439
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,912
That's hard. And Lexie, who's...

440
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,613
about to start her residency.

441
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,646
She's a really good student,
but it's grueling.

442
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:01,744
I know.

443
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:05,135
You know. Right. And...

444
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,879
I worry about you....

445
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:10,641
Too. How you're getting on,
your mom...

446
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,688
None of that was... simple.

447
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:18,428
Susan's really on you
to talk to me, huh?

448
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,479
I got to admit, I'm envious...

449
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,261
that she's getting to know you,

450
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,365
and I'm not yet.

451
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:34,139
I think she may be faking
these hiccups.

452
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:37,621
To get... us in the same place?

453
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:43,828
I guess I'm just not very sexual.

454
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,749
He's having an affair.
He's not in love with me anymore.

455
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,642
That's not true, honey.
I love you. I love you so much.

456
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,248
I-I want to do it.

457
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:56,540
I just want to want to do it.

458
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,314
Okay, Paul, I'm gonna give you
some homework for next session.

459
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,916
- Homework?
- Have sex with your wife.

460
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:05,266
- Well, but...
- No matter what.

461
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,661
Whether you're in the mood or not,
have sex.

462
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,675
Do it in the bed,
do it on the kitchen floor.

463
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,102
- Do you have a pool?
- Yes.

464
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,257
Okay, do it in the pool.

465
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:13,848
Have sex.

466
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,200
No pressure, no judgment,
no expectations.

467
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,123
Have sex. Just... do it.

468
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,988
We do need a new G.Y.N.

469
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,659
- Right.
- And Addison seems...

470
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:29,608
Oh, no, huh-huh, absolutely not.

471
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:32,500
- What?
- Addison is a nice person.

472
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,153
She is a decent person.

473
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,650
She is a person.

474
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,886
I'm lookin' for a person.

475
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,895
Man, you're just looking.

476
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,445
At least I'm trying.

477
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,074
Dr. Feelgood.

478
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,300
- Hey.
- I love you.

479
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,686
Hi. Thank you.

480
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:50,255
Okay, Dr. Feelgood,
this is what I'm saying.

481
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,815
Your career is taking off,

482
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,294
girls like that are
throwing themselves at you.

483
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:55,442
You should be celebrating.

484
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,367
Celebrating?
I just got a divorce.

485
00:23:57,423 --> 00:23:58,954
You got a little tiny dog,

486
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,944
and you cook it chicken,
and you talk to it.

487
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,499
- That's not normal.
- Hey, easy. All right?

488
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:07,375
I'm alone because I choose to be.
It's... It's a choice.

489
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:10,269
So you're saying
that you're not interested in Addison,

490
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,307
but I can't have her.

491
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,819
See, Addison isn't
the type of woman you have.

492
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:16,203
She's a marriage woman.
All right?

493
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,649
She's gonna want a commitment,
and you--

494
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,189
Hey, I do not sleep around.

495
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,909
No. You are a serial monogamist,
all right?

496
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,833
You... You date a girl,
you romance a girl,

497
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,626
and when it's time to commit,
you cut and you run.

498
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:27,364
- I do not.
- Linda,

499
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,585
Karen, uh, Julie.

500
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,072
Then there was Tricia,

501
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:33,128
Amy, Carrie, the other Linda...

502
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,475
- Fine. I won't ask her out.
- Good boy.

503
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:37,422
That's a good boy.

504
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,902
And the week before
I implanted the embryo,

505
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,329
you slept with how many, three?

506
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,832
Three men.

507
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,549
We're almost done here, Lisa,

508
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,187
and then we'll do the amniocentesis.

509
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:47,380
You're on Carol's side.

510
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:48,679
I'm Carol's doctor.

511
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,254
You came to us.
You applied to be a surrogate.

512
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,714
- It was your choice.
- I know. I just...

513
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,269
I was about to hand my body over

514
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,900
to a baby that's not mine
for nine month

515
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,487
which is a big responsibility.

516
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:03,685
That... hit me...

517
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,732
The responsibility... and I just...

518
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,152
They all wanted me.

519
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:12,208
Me.

520
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,734
And f-for once,
I just stopped thinking and I just...

521
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:20,650
I did something wild.

522
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,166
Dr. Montgomery, is something wrong?

523
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,894
I'm gonna run
some more tests.

524
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,558
You promise me
you'll take it easy.

525
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,821
I have a stack of dvd's to watch,

526
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:38,881
and I expect your father
to feed me by hand.

527
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:46,877
So just call
if you have any questions.

528
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,982
It was nice t-talking with you.

529
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:09,511
Any news about Mercy West?

530
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,089
Uh, there's a spot.

531
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,582
There's a lot of takers,
but they said it looks good.

532
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,298
So after the intern exam...

533
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,664
I'm not an unfaithful guy.
I'm not a cheater.

534
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:23,389
You think it'll happen again
if you stay here...

535
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:25,038
- With me?
- No, I don't know.

536
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:28,280
George.

537
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:30,337
I have to go.

538
00:26:34,874 --> 00:26:35,982
- Sam.
- Yeah.

539
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,290
So Paul and Kathy,
I gave them an assignment.

540
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,003
I told 'em to do it.
He didn't rise to the occasion.

541
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,189
Nothing?

542
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:43,427
No wood.

543
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,649
Not even a twig.

544
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:47,144
There's gotta be something
physical going on, right?

545
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,721
Because the only other option...

546
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,200
That he just
doesn't love her anymore...

547
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:52,420
I mean, that's just...

548
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,744
Not the only option.

549
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:57,383
I mean, did they meet
in the drama department in college?

550
00:26:57,411 --> 00:26:59,077
Could be a thyroid thing, anemia.

551
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:01,134
- Could be a bunch of stuff.
- Have you checked for extreme ugliness?

552
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,824
Okay, not funny.
Will you get back to me...

553
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:04,262
- Yes, I will.
- With what you find soon?

554
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:05,614
And, Cooper, you know what?

555
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:07,673
Ugly people have sex, Cooper.

556
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,692
Ugly people are people, too.

557
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:20,461
Hello?

558
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,676
Hello?

559
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,811
You fill out this E.E.G. request on Ava?

560
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:40,971
Yeah, you asked for it.

561
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,741
I asked you to run labs
on her every other day.

562
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,267
- What the hell is this?
- Shepherd's doing a full neuro workup.

563
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:47,013
- Just get the hell of my...
- Go ahead.

564
00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:50,355
I would love to have
an excuse to lay you out.

565
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:51,783
I didn't do anything.

566
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,182
Whatever you didn't do,

567
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:55,418
sent Addison running for the hills.

568
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:08,774
Okay, this guy is 6'2",
dark hair, green eyes,

569
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,230
totally healthy.
He plays the violin,

570
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,992
and he's a physicist.

571
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,599
That is good sperm.

572
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:16,735
Geeky, but, uh, good.

573
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,416
Lisa has extra donors
if you want to borrow one.

574
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:21,538
Her tests come in yet?

575
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:22,823
No, tomorrow.

576
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:24,927
I don't want to ring
any alarm bells till we're sure.

577
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,851
Ooh. What about this guy?
He's a marine biologist.

578
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:28,939
Good hair.

579
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,067
Are you sure you want to do this?

580
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,081
Your life is really gonna change.

581
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,146
That's why I'm doing this.

582
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,896
I want my life to change.

583
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,478
I need... my life to change.

584
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:46,627
I mean, look, you have Maya.
You have a family.

585
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,922
You did everything
the way you were supposed to.

586
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,054
You didn't wait.

587
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,146
Maybe I should have.

588
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,301
Waited.

589
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:57,860
What do you mean?

590
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,022
Addison, I did everything

591
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,454
exactly the way
I was supposed to.

592
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:06,039
After college, I never dated anybody
but Sam, because he was the one.

593
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:08,731
I never had sex with anybody
but Sam because...

594
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,327
cheating is wrong.

595
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,432
I had a baby because...

596
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:15,190
That's what you do
when you get married.

597
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:18,685
I never made a single mistake.
I did everything right.

598
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:22,177
And then Sam comes home
and says he wants a divorce.

599
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,361
So all those photos you're...
busy admiring,

600
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,412
all they are are reminders
of all the stuff I didn't do.

601
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,622
I'm 38 years old,

602
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,181
and I don't know
how to have fun.

603
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:35,951
That's not lucky.
That's sad.

604
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,091
So just...
shut up about lucky!

605
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:45,061
Poor...

606
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:48,016
sad... dried up Naomi.

607
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:50,626
Shut up.

608
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,410
Poor little, special

609
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:55,608
talented doctor girl.

610
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,825
Let's make a made-for-tv movie...

611
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,560
about the poor little, dried up

612
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,076
special girl who has no fun.

613
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,241
I could put you out.
You'd have to sleep in the car.

614
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,440
I just...

615
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,961
I just wish I'd been
a little more like you.

616
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:15,107
What, an adulterous bitch
who forgot to have kids?

617
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,735
Violet?

618
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:42,167
- Allan.
- Hey!

619
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,986
- Great to see you.
- How you doing?

620
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,028
I'm great. Really.
I'm really wonderful.

621
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,816
Well, I saw you and I...
I didn't want to be rude.

622
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,140
So I hope it's okay.

623
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:54,734
You know, it's just...

624
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:57,013
It's really wonderful to see you.

625
00:30:57,032 --> 00:30:58,055
You look, uh...

626
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,880
You look really wonderful.

627
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:02,618
They didn't have
the gouda you like,

628
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:05,406
but they had a camembert... Hi.

629
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,113
Hi.

630
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,787
This is Violet.

631
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:10,356
Violet... Oh, Violet.

632
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,136
Hi.

633
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:14,189
Nice to meet you.
I-I'm Cami.

634
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,028
Allan's wife.

635
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:22,282
God, I still can't get used
to that word... Wife.

636
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,055
Uh, wife?

637
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,836
- How long have you been married?
- Newlyweds...

638
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,642
eight weeks.

639
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,725
Congratulations.

640
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:46,781
We'll see you.

641
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:49,887
Nice to meet you.

642
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:14,068
Hey, Addison, uh, latte?

643
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:16,006
Or ac... more of a cappuccino.

644
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:18,221
Lisa's baby has something

645
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,252
- called lacenta accreta.
- Is that bad?

646
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,136
The placenta abnormally
attaches to the uterine wall.

647
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,263
It makes delivering dangerous
for both mom and baby.

648
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,685
- But there was something else.
- That's not enough?

649
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:30,559
The baby has some genetic markers

650
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:32,089
that don't match Carol,

651
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:33,798
just Lisa.

652
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:35,337
What? The embryo...

653
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:37,709
- Did not implant.
- This is Lisa's baby?

654
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:41,033
Which also means
that the paternity is once again

655
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,244
up for grabs.

656
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,356
Good luck.
I'm off to the beach.

657
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,344
Uh, you can't leave.
Someone has to tell the patient.

658
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,198
Honestly, I ha... I have...

659
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,560
low people skills
with anybody over 12.

660
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,859
It's true. An Internet
hooker just stole his car...

661
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,048
Violet! Privacy. She was not...

662
00:32:58,808 --> 00:32:59,869
She just...

663
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:01,681
She borrowed my car.

664
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,195
She... She borrowed.
Borrowed.

665
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:15,688
911 turbo, hand-sewn leather seats.

666
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:21,246
911 turbo with hand-sewn
leather seats.

667
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,345
Who does that,

668
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:23,828
to a 911?

669
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,053
A chick. A crazy chick.

670
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,244
- But she was so hot.
- A crazy hot chick.

671
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,607
I loved that car.

672
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,757
That was a single man's car.

673
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,675
That's the point.
I mean, I...

674
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,716
I thought maybe
I was done being single.

675
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,414
I thought she was gonna be
the mother of my children.

676
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:42,613
What was her name again?

677
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:44,257
Sexyboobs316.

678
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,595
Are you...

679
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,394
Dude, are you crying?

680
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,483
You better be crying
about that car

681
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:57,354
and not over sexyboobs315.

682
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,617
316.

683
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,414
I can't. I can't.
I'm gonna hurt him.

684
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:06,346
Let's just say he's crying
over the car and the woman.

685
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,157
All right? There we go.
Let it out.

686
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,185
Let it out.

687
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,473
Uh, Cristina?

688
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,761
That's a pretty one.

689
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:29,766
Moves very well in it.
Looks quite natural.

690
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:32,587
- You paged?
- I need you over here.

691
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:36,163
Should I be seeing you in
the dress before the wedding?

692
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,206
You think I'm wearing this?

693
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:44,599
- Well, it is very femine.
- Exactly.

694
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,465
Do you know your mother booked
a chapel that sits 200 people?

695
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,852
Okay, how did I get bridesmaids, huh?

696
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,354
Freakin' stupid cotton-candy
colored bridesmaids?

697
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:55,952
No offense.

698
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:58,262
What happened to our small ceremony?

699
00:34:58,548 --> 00:35:00,802
What happened to you
and me at city hall?

700
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:04,094
I didn't...
I didn't think you were serious.

701
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:07,188
I am not wearing this.

702
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:11,098
Oh, I gotta get to the hospital.

703
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:13,637
You know, we should, uh,
give 'em some privacy.

704
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:15,889
What?

705
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,660
Oh, you want me to go
over there with you...

706
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,271
- By myself.
- Yeah.

707
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:25,807
You want a big wedding?

708
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:27,839
You want the chapel,

709
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:30,365
you want the guests
and me in a white dress?

710
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,633
Well...

711
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:34,896
Yes.

712
00:35:36,691 --> 00:35:38,391
I'm a traditional man, Cristina.

713
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,466
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

714
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:51,075
The saleslady has another batch
of dresses for you to see, Cristina.

715
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:54,089
Oh, thank you... Mama.

716
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:04,114
Cristina has certainly
made quite an effort.

717
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:07,158
Tried on, I would say,
over a hundred dresses,

718
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:10,375
and that certainly could not
have been easy for her.

719
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:13,679
Yeah, Mama, I know she seems
disinterested in wedding planning.

720
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,727
But Cristina...

721
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:17,536
she's not cold.

722
00:36:18,024 --> 00:36:20,156
- I know she seems cold...
- Preston...

723
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,562
If you think Cristina
is right for you,

724
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,487
I trust you.

725
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,652
I trust your instincts.

726
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,308
And the baby, the, um...

727
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,149
the baby isn't even mine?

728
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:46,989
- Honey, calm down.
- Calm down?

729
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:49,358
You mean I can keep this baby
if I want to?

730
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,178
Uh, legally, yes.

731
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:53,994
So who's the father?

732
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,965
We won't know the paternity
of the baby till after Lisa delivers.

733
00:36:57,222 --> 00:37:00,264
More urgent at the moment
is the lacenta accreta.

734
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,408
The fact is, Lisa is at risk

735
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:04,235
of having
a life-threatening hemorrhage

736
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,207
and the baby could deliver preterm.

737
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,781
So you're saying they could die?

738
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,886
There is a risk of death, yes.

739
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:13,607
Lisa,

740
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,016
I know you're scared.

741
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:19,104
If you do go into preterm labor,
you'll have a c-section.

742
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:22,035
And they'll monitor it
and control it so that they have

743
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,966
a better chance
of saving your uterus

744
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:25,408
and your life.

745
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,843
And you'll save us,
me and the baby?

746
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,576
Well, I have...

747
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,603
I have to get back to Seattle.

748
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:33,790
I have a practice.
But I can refer you to someone local...

749
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,066
No, I want you.
You be there.

750
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,342
I thought Kathy was coming
to the appointment today.

751
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:55,089
Just...
Kathy didn't come home last night.

752
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,390
And, you know,
I don't blame her, but it's just...

753
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:00,149
What... What if
she's with some guy right now?

754
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,405
Some guy... some... some guy...

755
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:04,517
who can... who can bring it?

756
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,174
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

757
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:08,732
It's okay. All right?

758
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,980
There are plenty of medical
reasons for low sex drive.

759
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:12,182
All right?

760
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:13,862
Sorry. Sorry.

761
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,411
Honey... where were you?

762
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,322
I was out.

763
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,121
All night?

764
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,494
And I had a chance to cheat,
believe me.

765
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,680
But I passed. Okay?

766
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,980
I passed up being with someone
who actually wants to be with me

767
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,343
because I am stuck with you.

768
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:33,925
You're crying?

769
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,066
Okay, let's...
let's all just calm down here.

770
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:37,473
I'll be in the waiting room.

771
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,731
Oh! She's starting to hate me.

772
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,009
Oh. What am I gonna do if
little Paul can't perform?

773
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:49,419
Don't talk about your penis
while you hug another man.

774
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,073
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay.

775
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,536
- I'm sorry.
- Let's draw some blood.

776
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,961
Let's draw some blood.

777
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,881
What's in L.A.?

778
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:02,329
What?

779
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:04,151
For Addison.

780
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,119
Any idea...

781
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,065
what she might be doing there?

782
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:10,891
Uh... Naomi and Sam are
down there, I guess. I don't know.

783
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,798
You all right?

784
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:16,473
We were gonna try.

785
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,374
We were gonna make a go of it...

786
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,210
as a couple.

787
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:25,575
She bet me I couldn't go
60 days without having sex.

788
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,063
Oh. Let me guess.
You couldn't do it.

789
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:30,441
No, she couldn't.

790
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,213
She didn't want to be with me.

791
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:38,118
I thought she did.

792
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,617
I thought she might.

793
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:43,706
But she didn't.

794
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,629
And I caught her.
You know...

795
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,293
Sleeping with somebody else?

796
00:39:52,695 --> 00:39:54,508
That must have been
so hard for you.

797
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,088
Not that I can't relate.

798
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:00,347
So I told her I did it.

799
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,306
You told her you did it?

800
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,448
I told her I lost the bet.
I told her I slept with someone.

801
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,050
I figured if she didn't want
to be with me,

802
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,942
she shouldn't have to
feel guilty about it.

803
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,317
Selfless. That's...

804
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,861
- out of character.
- Yeah.

805
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,754
Anyway, uh...

806
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,721
I was just wondering
if you knew what was in L.A.

807
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,252
No.

808
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:32,943
Okay,

809
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,586
now I am going to the beach.

810
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:35,675
Wait, Addie.

811
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,121
- Your test results came back in.
- Oh, good.

812
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:41,860
Because, um, I picked a donor.

813
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,020
I think I'm gonna go
with physicist guy.

814
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:46,180
Your F.S.H. level is high.

815
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:50,121
Well, they're high this month.
We can do, uh,

816
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,304
ovarian stimulation.

817
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,747
And your antral follicle count
is only two.

818
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,513
That could be due to stress.

819
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,861
Addison, I'm sorry.

820
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,448
I did all the tests.

821
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,641
There's no fertility potential here.

822
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:16,804
This is good. This is, um...

823
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,789
Oh, this is just... perfect.

824
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,892
- Addison...
- I have the great guy.

825
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:26,541
I don't have a baby because
I'm focusing on my career.

826
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,568
Then I have the other guy.
I don't have his baby

827
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,070
because he's not the great guy.

828
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:33,123
And now I don't have
the great guy or the other guy,

829
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,734
and I'm finally ready
to have a baby, and I can't.

830
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,356
That is so...

831
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,652
exactly what my life is.

832
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:44,313
Addie, there are other options.

833
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:45,863
Yeah,
I know about the options.

834
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:48,651
I'm so sorry.

835
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,014
I know how much you wanted this.

836
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:54,694
It's okay.

837
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,285
I just, um...

838
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:02,996
I just didn't realize
I was out of time, that's all.

839
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:07,748
Addie, please stay so we can...

840
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,198
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

841
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,620
Thank you... for telling me.

842
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,414
Thank you.
I will see you at home.

843
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:26,614
<i>Looks like you had a bad day.</i>

844
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,632
Okay...

845
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,848
enough.

846
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,036
Okay? Not today.

847
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,290
This is not a good day all right?

848
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,212
So why don't you just... shut up?

849
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:43,095
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

850
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,337
All right, then.
