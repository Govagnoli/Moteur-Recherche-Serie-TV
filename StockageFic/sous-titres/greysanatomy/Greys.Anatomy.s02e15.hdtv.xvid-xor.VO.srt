1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,450
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,000
what's gonna happen to us when
she goes on leave?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,240
You think we're gonna get a new resident?

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,620
My mother is very sick.

5
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,820
I'm the only person she'll allow
to see her.

6
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,700
Cujo has to go!

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,600
hey,doc.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,650
Hey,buddy.

9
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,960
Thanks for doing this.

10
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,110
He'll be fine.

11
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,900
I grew up in a trailer park,

12
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,170
put myself through med school by
posing in my underwear.

13
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,670
I walk into the O.R.,
Everyone hopes I'm the nurse.

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,810
the nurses are overworked and unhappy.

15
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,250
Sorry,we're short staffed.

16
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,000
Unhappy nurses lead to...

17
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,560
I don't even want to think about it.

18
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,120
We go on strike in ten days.

19
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,350
in surgery there is a red line on the floor

20
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,150
that marks the point where the
hospital goes from being accessible

21
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,160
to being off-limits to all but
a special few.

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,070
Crossing the line unauthorized
is not tolerated.

23
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:57,080
Fair hours! Fair wages!.....

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,050
can'T... can't cross the picket line.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,510
I don't like it either,george,
but what choice do we have?

26
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,210
Okay,you took an oath to heal.

27
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,070
You're a healer.

28
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,460
My dad's a truck driver.
Mom's a teacher.

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,000
The evening news shows me crossing a picket line,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,540
they'll outlive me just to pee on my grave.

31
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,660
In general,lines are there for a reason...

32
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,970
has there been any blood yet?

33
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,640
I hear they brought in scab nurses.

34
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,000
For safety...

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,600
for security...

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,750
for clarity.

37
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,840
I think the nurses know that we are on their side.

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,210
-Don't they?
-We're doctors.

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,490
We have sick patients inside.
I mean,we have surgeries.

40
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,520
Okay...

41
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,010
then you go first.

42
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,630
screw it.

43
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,370
fair hours! Fair wages!....

44
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,800
Yeah,doing my job.

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,210
Doing my job. Ha ha.

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,090
they threw food at her.

47
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,100
That is just wrong!

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,790
fine. I'm goin' in.

49
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,570
Changes your own bedpans,
stevens!

50
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,790
Yeah,enjoy your syphilis,olivia.

51
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,670
George,are you coming?

52
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,150
No,I'm good here.

53
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,760
If you choose to cross the line,

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,090
you pretty much do so at your own risk.

55
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,170
Good morning.

56
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,410
Morning,meredith.

57
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,890
How is she today?

58
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,900
She's great.

59
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,610
She really lights up
when dr. Webber visits.

60
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,900
and I did not back down.

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,450
Not in my O.R.,Not in front of those
jock ortho idiots.

62
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,410
That was the last time windsor
called you "little lady,"

63
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,970
not even behind your back.

64
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,930
One day,I'm gonna be chief of surgery.

65
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,710
The first woman chief,
you watch.

66
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,180
I don't doubt it,ellis.

67
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,120
So why is it...

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
I don't doubt it for a minute.

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
that the bigger the line,

70
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,150
the greater the temptation to cross it?

71
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,100
Fair hours! Fair wages!....

72
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,560
And I can't say this enough--

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,540
charts are organized by room number.

74
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,600
I know you're temp nurses,
but there's no excuse for sloppiness.

75
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,780
-Did they bring back edmonds'
chart from physical therapy?
-You know,I can't do my job
without vitals on the chart.

76
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,070
You know why I stopped being a nurse? Doctors.

77
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,270
Doctors who don't know how to pitch in.

78
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,240
Right.

79
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,190
-This place is going to hell.
-There should be a better way to compromise.

80
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,330
We need the real nurses back.

81
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,580
We need an additional 40 nurses

82
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,870
to relieve the overtime that
they're striking about.

83
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,340
That's $2 million a year we don't have.

84
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,380
Have you checkedunder the couch?

85
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,810
I always find spare change
under the cushions.

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,060
Oh,okay.
And I'm silencing myself.

87
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,540
Yes,yes.
Uh... that's him.

88
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,170
He's published twice,
and he's flawless.

89
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh,I don't want that guy.
That guy's a freak.

90
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,890
He doesn't let you speak in the O.R.

91
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,040
Yeah,but he's flawless.

92
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,090
I think it's him.

93
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,990
What's his name again?

94
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,020
Oh,yeah.
Mouth breather guy.

95
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,110
But he'll let you do a procedure
on your own if he likes you.

96
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,100
What are we doing?

97
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,470
Trying to figure out who they're
gonna pick for bailey's replacement.

98
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,140
yang!
Stevens...grey,o'malley,karev,

99
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,430
here you are.

100
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,640
I was looking for you guys in
the locker room,

101
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,870
but you weren't there.

102
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,180
And then I thought,well,maybe my
interns are looking for me,too.

103
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,770
And then I come out here,
and here you are.

104
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,910
Yeah,you guys look like a great
group,which is awesome.

105
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,230
Because my horoscope said it was
gonna be a very challenging day,

106
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,850
and I was a little worried,but,no.

107
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,500
You guys... yeah.

108
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,920
You look like a good group.

109
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,710
Which is great,

110
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,830
'cause we're gonna have so much fun.
Hi! Hi.

111
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,060
First of all,hi.

112
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,220
Ow! Ow. Ow.

113
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,190
Oh. Sorry.

114
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,040
Am I hurting you?

115
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,990
Uh,no,you're--
you're touching me.

116
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm sydney heron,fourth year,

117
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,050
and,uh,my philosophy,

118
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,870
uh,just so you know,
is,um,is heal with love.

119
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,930
Okay. So,wonderful.

120
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,350
So alex,izzie,
meredith,cristina--

121
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,940
and our little group is just missing--

122
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,310
o'malley. He's cowering behind
the strike line like a little girl.

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Standing up for what he believes in.
That's my kind of "little girl," right?

124
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,370
So... the E.R. Needs somebody
down there for a consult.

125
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,680
Does anybody--
who wants to--

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,550
we get to pick?

127
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,460
Oh,me. I'm on it.

128
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,370
I'll help.

129
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,250
I have patients I need to check on.

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,850
So it looks like it's just you and
me,izzie mcgee.

131
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,990
Right. It's,um,
it's stevens. Izzie stevens.

132
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,200
Oh,no,I knew. I-I was just rhyming.

133
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,960
Oh,rhyming. Right,yeah.
That's--that's neat.

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,770
-Dr. Stevens.
-Yeah.

135
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,600
Could use you on a consult.

136
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay,I'm on it. Absolutely.

137
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,730
Yeah.

138
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,640
You need a consult for a rash?

139
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,830
It's spreading pretty fast.

140
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,960
I wanted to make sure there's
nothing surgical going on.

141
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Mrs. Solomon.

142
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh.

143
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,870
Oh,god.

144
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,850
Sorry.

145
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,100
we're on our honeymoon.

146
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,660
-Yeah.
-Sweet.

147
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,680
Uh,can you,um...

148
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,910
dismount,please?

149
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,880
Yeah.

150
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,950
Okay,great. Just-

151
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,180
-aah!

152
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,110
l-len?

153
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,220
Lenny... I-is that you?

154
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,170
Lenny!

155
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,030
are you okay,ma'am?

156
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,440
"Grace bickham."

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,420
Mrs. Bickham,
do you know who your doctor is?

158
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,460
-Lenny...
-I don't see your chart here.

159
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,350
Are you there?

160
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm gonna need you to calm
down for me,okay?

161
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,660
Lenny?

162
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,760
Is that your husband?

163
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,220
Oh,where is he?

164
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,640
He was here.

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,570
I'm sure he'll be back any moment.

166
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,440
You're having some trouble breathing.
I'm gonna need to run some tests.

167
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,470
Lenny.

168
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,730
Nurse!
I need a nurse in here.

169
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:10,310
Fair hours! Fair wages...

170
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,620
you can go,george.

171
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,330
We won't throw doughnuts.

172
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,490
No,I can take the doughnuts.

173
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,130
Then what are you still doing here?

174
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,290
Teacher strike of '03,
mom walked the line for 48 days.

175
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,870
I can't just--

176
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,050
I can't cross.

177
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,120
So go home.

178
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,150
I can't go home.
You just don't go...

179
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,470
yeah,and get kicked out of the program,

180
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,360
lose my place as a resident.

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,400
No,I'm a doctor.
Don't do...

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,260
don'T... don'T...

183
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,620
I'm a union guy.

184
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,040
So that means...

185
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,470
give me that sign.

186
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,130
all right,
dr. O'malley.

.Greys Anatomy.
Season02 Episode 15

189
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,480
help!
I need a nurse in here,please.

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,520
Her pressure's falling.
She's stopped breathing.

191
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,620
Whoa. Is she dying?

192
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,440
Are you a nurse?

193
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,020
Um,I'm,like,a nursing student.

194
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,610
I need to intubate.

195
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,210
Get me a 7 1/2 tube.
They're out in the hall.

196
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,130
Not that one.
The that says "7-5."

197
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,740
I'm in.

198
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,930
Awesome.

199
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,790
is that too much?

200
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,310
It's a lot of extra amniotic fluid,cheyenne,

201
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,870
but your baby looks strong.

202
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,100
Does that mean we can go?

203
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,910
I mean,I appreciate you seeing us,I really do,

204
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,940
but this is a long drive for us,

205
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,130
and I can't afford to miss another shift.

206
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,380
Unfortunately,ms. Wood,

207
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,380
the mass on the baby's neck is what's
causing the build up of fluid.

208
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,480
It's also obstructing her airway and the spine.

209
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,270
Mom.

210
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,390
It's all right.

211
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,420
Let's listen.

212
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,210
We're gonna do a procedure called an exit surgery.

213
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,140
Basically,we do a c-section
and only half deliver the baby.

214
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,330
Half deliver?

215
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,850
That's right.
We pull the head and the arms out,

216
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,680
but we don't cut the umbilical cord.

217
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,420
Why?

218
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,310
The tumor won't let air get to the baby's lungs,

219
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,570
so we need the umbilical cord to
keep her alive during the operation.

220
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,380
It's kinda cool if you think about it.

221
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,440
You'll be like your baby's life support machine.

222
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,690
And then after the surgery,
if all goes well,

223
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,740
we cut the umbilical cord and you'll
be the mother of a healthy baby girl.

224
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,890
How's that sound?

225
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,320
It sounds expensive.

226
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,810
Well,your doctor at the clinic is
a former student of mine,

227
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,220
so... it's covered.

228
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,940
I'm gonna go ahead and take this up to the lab.

229
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,430
The hospital gets a write-off for the surgery,

230
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,360
and it makes dr. Shepherd
look good,so...

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,520
so it's not charity?

232
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,690
It's not charity.

233
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,030
What time's your shift?

234
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,330
6:00 to 6:00.

235
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,310
Graveyard.

236
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,430
In chehalis?

237
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,190
Yeah.

238
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,410
That's three hours away.

239
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,310
You better get goin'.

240
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,650
I'll look out for her.

241
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,450
Chief.

242
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,370
Hello,meredith.

243
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,020
Saw my mother this morning.

244
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,490
Did you?

245
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,040
How is she?

246
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,470
She's fine.

247
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,180
I'm glad to hear it.

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,050
Give her my best.

249
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:26,940
Why are you--

250
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,190
oh,I'm drawing a line to mark the
borders of the infection.

251
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,660
We'll watch you for a couple of hours,

252
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,870
and if doesn't cross the line,
you'll get I.V. Antibiotics.

253
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,290
And if it does cross the line?

254
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,250
Well,it would mean
the infection's aggressive.

255
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,130
We'd have to do a muscle biopsy.

256
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,950
You have to take out a piece of my muscle?

257
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,810
Mm-hmm.

258
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,730
Well,we're supposed to run a 10k tomorrow,so--

259
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,270
oh,on this leg? I doubt it.

260
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,170
Can you tell us when you first noticed the rash?

261
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,390
When we were climbing rainier yesterday.

262
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,500
wow,you go up the emmons glacier route?

263
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,970
Please,you can do that in an S.U.V.

264
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,150
We did liberty ridge.

265
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,230
Wow. That's hard core.

266
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,210
Hi,I'm sydney heron,
these guys' teacher.

267
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,040
Hi.

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,180
I'm claire.This is wade.
It's our honeymoon.

269
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,670
Wow. That's amazing.

270
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,240
God,and look at that rock.

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,140
Did you sustain any trauma on the hike?

272
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,960
Did you fall down or bang your leg
against something?

273
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,060
-No.
-Well,um,

274
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,670
she cut her foot on some oyster shells

275
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,110
at the beach a couple days ago.

276
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,880
We were windsurfing in puget sound.

277
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,090
Oh,wow. Sounds like you guys
are gonna need a honeymoon

278
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,590
to recover from your honeymoon.

279
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,570
Ow.

280
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,050
Right?

281
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,340
My leg's gonna be okay,
though,right?

282
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,960
Oh,yeah,yeah,it's probably just
a simple skin infection.

283
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,470
Uh,no it's not. Look.

284
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,830
-Oh,hey.
-Hey.

285
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,510
Your dog's fine.

286
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,630
He's your dog now.

287
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,350
Hmm.

288
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,530
I miss him.

289
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,670
he misses you,too.

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
you should come visit.

291
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,120
The dog,I mean.

292
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,300
I'm walking away now.

293
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,140
So,um...

294
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,860
I'm looking for a neurosurgeon
to consult on a fetal spinal tumor.

295
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,310
You know anybody good?

296
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,150
don't ask george.

297
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,020
-Why not?
-He's a doctor.

298
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,690
-I'm worried about--
-just ask.

299
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,080
Whisper and point.

300
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:06,930
I'm showing support,

301
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,090
-they whisper and point.
-George.

302
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,010
What?

303
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,020
We need a favor.

304
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,020
Ava jenkins in peds--room 4114.

305
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,540
It's almost time to change her dressing,
and it's scary for her.

306
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,630
But if you sing the alphabet or
the wheels on the bus song,

307
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,010
she can handle it.

308
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,730
And mrs. O'brien from 2412,

309
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,870
she'll have a major panic attack

310
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,800
if they don't check on her at least once an hour.

311
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
And there's this guy in 2924--

312
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,790
hang on!
Hang on here.

313
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,880
Wait,you want me to cross the picket line?

314
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,980
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

315
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,740
Why?

316
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,660
Because they're our patients,too,george.

317
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,730
And we can'T.

318
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,750
anyone care to probe the wound?

319
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,920
-I do.
-I do.

320
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,740
I'd really like to try your method of
healing with love.

321
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,240
I like the way you think,alex.

322
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,140
You do the honors.

323
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,240
cristina,looks like someone needs
to learn how to share.

324
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,470
okay,good. Just go ahead and slide it in.

325
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,460
Whoa. No resistance.

326
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,420
Let me see.

327
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,710
-dr. Heron.
-Let me see.

328
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,450
Yes.

329
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,030
No healthy muscle gives way that easily.

330
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,970
Oh,my god.
Oh,this poor girl.

331
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,840
Okay,everyone,
we're locking down the O.R.

332
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,930
All nonessential personnel must leave now.

333
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Is that pathology?

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,830
Is it--
it's necrotizing fasciitis.

335
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,490
The flesh-eating bacteria?

336
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,700
In the flesh.

337
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh,good.

338
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Somebody's in here.

339
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,650
How's she doing?

340
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,990
You intubated her?

341
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,870
Yeah.

342
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,990
You intubated her?

343
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,980
I had to--she was struggling to breathe,

344
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,740
her sats were in the 80s,
she was in a room all alone.

345
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,550
What?

346
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,460
One of the temp nurses found the paperwork

347
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,350
from her chart on the second floor and--

348
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,070
you put a tube in grace.

349
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,340
She put a tube in grace?

350
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,700
She put a tube in grace?

351
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,440
Mrs. Bickham was diagnosed with end-stage C.O.P.D.

352
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,230
She's on hospice.

353
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,870
End-of-life care?

354
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,980
D.N.R.--

355
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,330
Do not resuscitate.

356
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,340
You little schnook.

357
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,160
You were supposed to let her die.

358
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,820
"No machines," she said.

359
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,290
She did,I remember.

360
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,200
Because her daughter alice was
there with her girlfriend--

361
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,610
uh,she's a lesbian,

362
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,790
the daughter--

363
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,960
nice girls.

364
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,680
Stop with the rambling,agnes.
Make your point.

365
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm sorry.

366
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,950
Who are you exactly?

367
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,420
Mrs. Bickham's sisters?

368
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,630
Oh,no.

369
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,430
No,her sister rose died in '83.

370
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,590
May she rest in peace.

371
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,520
Influenza. Or croup.

372
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,340
Only babies die of croup.

373
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,970
Rose died with a cold in her chest.

374
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,940
Pneumonia.

375
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,130
Right,pneumonia.

376
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,230
And then there was her other sister harriet.

377
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,530
May she rest in peace.

378
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,060
They cremated her.

379
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,760
Gracie wanted to die.

380
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,470
She made us all promise.

381
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,640
This really is something that I need to speak

382
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,110
with her husband about.

383
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,530
Lenny never talked much when he was alive.

384
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,560
Good luck gettin' a word now.

385
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,820
Lenny's dead?

386
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,140
May he rest in peace.

387
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,940
But grace said she just saw him.

388
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,230
Because she was trying to cross over.

389
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,420
She almost died twice in the last month,

390
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,530
said she saw him each time.

391
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,580
You ask me,
that's a little meshugana.

392
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,520
It's not meshugana.

393
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,920
He was waitin' for her in the light.

394
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,360
Mm-hmm,which,thanks to you,

395
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,640
she can't reach now.

396
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,690
O'malley,I need you to round on room 20--

397
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,860
I'm not here.

398
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,490
Excuse me?

399
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm here,but I'm not here.

400
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,200
You won't be anywhere in about 30 seconds if you--

401
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,120
sir,all due respect,
no offense intended,uh...

402
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,610
but I won't cross a picket line.

403
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,510
And yet somehow,
you're standing in front of me.

404
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,910
Well,yeah,because some of the
nurses wanted me to check ontheir patients,

405
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,220
and so I am,but then I'm going right
back out there to join them.

406
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,150
You're a doctor.

407
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,070
Yes,sir.

408
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,480
But I'm also a union man.

409
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,020
All due respect.
There's no offense intended.

410
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,990
Fine.

411
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,430
Sir...
while I have you here,

412
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,610
I'm supposed to tell you that,uh,

413
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,410
mrs. O'brien in 2412
is allergic to chocolate,

414
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,240
but she pulls the allergy sticker
off her chart every chance she gets.

415
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,260
-Wonderful.
-And,uh,

416
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,020
that mister--you're supposed to watch
mr. Roberts in 2119

417
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,410
take and swallow his diuretics.

418
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,080
Apparently he likes to hoard them
under his mattress--

419
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,070
is that it?

420
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,970
40 to 50 hours of
mandatory overtime is extremely--

421
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,870
o'malley.

422
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,670
Yes,sir,I'm very sorry.
There's no offense intended.

423
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,850
What? Wait,

424
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,650
flesh-eating...

425
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,130
I mean,this is some kind of joke,right?

426
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,950
She put you up to this?

427
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,030
No,it's not a joke.
We have to amputate the leg.

428
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,450
Cristina...

429
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,680
we're on our honeymoon.

430
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,770
I'm sorry,wade.I know this is scary.

431
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,250
But amputation is not the only option.

432
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,540
It's the only sane op--

433
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,530
excuse me.If we don't get this infection
under control immediately,

434
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,030
she is going to die.

435
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,380
But there's another option?

436
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,950
well,we can try to save the leg
by cutting out the infection.

437
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,280
It won't be pretty,but we might
be able to keep it functional.

438
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Gold star for dr. Karev.

439
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,740
-I-I need to see her.
-There's no time.

440
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,630
By the time we take her out of
anesthesia and put her back under--

441
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,400
you need to make a decision now.

442
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,420
I mean,she runs marathons.

443
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,280
This is our adventure honeymoon.

444
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,080
It'S...

445
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,510
I mean, it's who she is.

446
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,740
Okay.

447
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,070
Then we'll do everything we
can to save the leg.

448
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,540
You seriously think this is
a good idea?

449
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,990
I seriously think this is
a way cooler surgery.

450
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,710
Cheyenne,the prognosis is very good.

451
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
So what we want to try to do
is go in and

452
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
get as much of the tumor out as
possible during your surgery.

453
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,360
So my baby will be fine?

454
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,020
Yes.

455
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,280
You may be able to take your baby
home by the end of the week.

456
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,970
That soon?

457
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,910
Absolutely.

458
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,470
She'll be all yours.

459
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,150
Oh.

460
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,010
-Okay.
-okay.

461
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,590
Now if you or your mother have any questions,

462
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,740
dr. Stevens will page me,all right?

463
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,210
see you later.

464
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,790
Wow. Shakespeare.

465
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,590
I was reading it to my baby.

466
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,590
It's really homework for english.

467
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,920
Was.

468
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,990
The baby wasn't due for another three more weeks.

469
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,240
But now I guess...

470
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,560
no more school.

471
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,620
It's weird.

472
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,390
It's like when you're in school...

473
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,050
you hate it.

474
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,480
Until you can't go anymore.

475
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,010
Have you made any plans?

476
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,340
Plans?

477
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,620
Bought a crib,

478
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,170
called about child care,
looked into assistance.

479
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
Not yet.

480
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,270
Are you gonna live with your mom?

481
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,340
I was supposed to be saving money
to get my own trailer home.

482
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,520
But I don't know,I guess i just thought
I'd have more time.

483
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,360
Nine months goes by fast.

484
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah.

485
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,330
Yeah,it does.

486
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,670
I'll see you later.

487
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,800
Bye.

488
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,000
So,sydney,have you seen
a lot of necrotizing fasciitis?

489
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,990
No,have you?

490
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,580
If the infection moves to her bloodstream,
she'll die.

491
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,600
If she wakes up without her leg,
she might wish she had.

492
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,630
Yeah,dr. Karev is right.

493
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,690
She's young,she's healthy,
she's a newlywed.

494
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,000
And your treatment plan is based on...

495
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
cuteness?

496
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,220
If she were an 80-year-old man,
you'd amputate in a heartbeat.

497
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,320
She's not 80.

498
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,130
Where's your compassion?

499
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,460
My compassion?

500
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,260
Trying to save a patient from death
is pretty compassionate.

501
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,400
I must say,
I'm disappointed in you.

502
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,280
Why can't you be more like alex?

503
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,960
Excuse me?

504
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,450
Yeah. This guy,
he's compassionate,he's warm.

505
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,370
He's fighting with me to save claire's leg.

506
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,620
And we're gonna win that fight.

507
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,670
Yes.

508
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,140
Um,excuse me. Restroom.

509
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,380
Burke.

510
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,160
Hey,I thought you were in surgery.

511
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,460
I was.
Necrotizing fasciitis.

512
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,880
You're kidding?

513
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,180
So why are you out here?

514
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,730
Because the new resident--

515
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,000
she's the new bailey,

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,680
except that she's the exact opposite
of bailey in the most absurd,

517
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,010
horrifying,
profoundly disturbing ways.

518
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,050
Cristina--

519
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,530
I think the new resident is killing our patient.

520
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,200
Dr. Heron,is it?

521
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,470
It is. And you are?

522
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,770
Preston burke.

523
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,890
Dr. Burke.
Wow. No kidding?

524
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm a huge fan.

525
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,580
Thank you.

526
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,630
I,um,

527
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,670
I heard you had a case of
necrotizing fasciitis.

528
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,930
We don't see a lot of those
around here.

529
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,660
Hmm,yeah,well,being a
cardiothoracic surgeon,

530
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,370
I wouldn't think you saw any.

531
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,000
Right.

532
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,470
Well,um...

533
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,240
I was just curious on what protocol
you were following here.

534
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,510
You were curious or cristina was concerned?

535
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,600
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion.

536
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,710
It's nothing personal.

537
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,070
It's just...

538
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,910
we haven't worked with you before,

539
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,530
and dr. Yang wanted to be sure that--

540
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,410
dr. Yang wanted to be sure that
the perky little

541
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,860
bimbo cheerleader wasn't in here
trying to kill a patient,

542
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,940
am I right?

543
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,470
Now with all due respect,
dr. Burke,

544
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,770
I know you don't know me very well,

545
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,540
but I'm pretty good at what I do.

546
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,340
And my patient is a 25-year-old marathoner,

547
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,620
and I've told her husband I'm gonna
try and save her leg.

548
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,940
So my plan is to stand here for
as many hours as it takes

549
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,030
to scrape away every last cell of necrotic flesh.

550
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,060
Now when I'm done,
if it's still spreading,

551
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,180
then we'll take the leg,
and if we do,

552
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,810
then our eager young intern here can hold the saw.

553
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,320
Now unlike dr. Karev,

554
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,760
kindness and compassion aren't
very high on her list of priorities,

555
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,670
but a little bone saw action--
well,

556
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,280
maybe that'll earn me some respect,
am I right?

557
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,090
Now,dr. Yang,
you ready to scrub back in?

558
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,290
Thank you.

559
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,810
You're the head of this whole hospital?

560
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,170
Just the surgeons.

561
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,490
Well,they should make you the head of everything.

562
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,960
She's batting her lashes.
You see that?

563
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,070
She's batting her lashes.

564
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,280
Dr. Webber,the point is,
grace wants to be with her lenny.

565
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,130
She misses him terribly.

566
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,870
You realize,if I pull out the tube,grace will die?

567
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,240
We're old,magpie, not daft.

568
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,320
Pull the plug already.
It's what she wants.

569
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,440
Ladies,I appreciate your concern for your friend,

570
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,040
but we need to contact the durable
power of attorney to sign the release.

571
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,120
That's alice. Call alice.

572
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,340
Grace's daughter.

573
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,440
She's a lesbian.

574
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,760
Well,that's okay,isn't it?

575
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,520
I mean,she could still have the power of attorney.

576
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,350
Uh,fine. But we'll need alice's signature.

577
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,110
Good luck.
She lives in oregon.

578
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,320
Oh,she could fax it.

579
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm sorry,we'll need her original signature.

580
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,510
Oh,can't we just skip that part?

581
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,510
Bat the lashes again.
I think it was working.

582
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,170
excuse me,ladies.

583
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,390
You're like the old lady whisperer.

584
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,700
They really cheer up when you come around.

585
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,700
Meredith,you understand if the daughter
shows up tomorrow,

586
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,570
confirms she's D.N.R. That--

587
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,130
I have to kill my patient,
I know.

588
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,950
How you doing?

589
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,290
Something I can do for you?

590
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,420
Oh,I'm fine,sir.
I don't need any help from you.

591
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,590
Thank you.

592
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,810
"Sir,fare you well:

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,530
"Hereafter,

594
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,520
in a better world than this,

595
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,010
"I shall desire more love and knowledge of you."

596
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,560
to dr. O'malley!

597
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,110
o'malley!

598
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,500
whoo!

599
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,770
she called me unkind--

600
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,810
unkind and lacking in compassion
in front of my boyfriend.

601
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,470
I am not unkind.

602
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,110
I think I have to kill a woman tomorrow.

603
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,810
I have to take out the tube that's
keeping her alive.

604
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,570
izzie.

605
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,830
This is the part where you say
what's wrong with you.

606
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,930
I have to kill a woman tomorrow.

607
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,660
You know,and that's a problem why?

608
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,830
I mean,if it's what she wants,
it's what she wants.

609
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,910
And that is not unkind or lacking in compassion.

610
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm a very compassionate person.

611
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm more compassionate than you,alex.

612
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,570
Oh,shut your pie hole,yang.

613
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,580
Hey,joe,could we have another round,please?

614
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,010
Yeah,give nurse o'malley a drink on me.

615
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,560
what'd you say?

616
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,760
Hey,uh,karev just called me a nurse.

617
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
at least nurses aren't butchers.

618
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,540
Is that the worst you could come up with?

619
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,940
Oh,wait, was that an insult
or was that,uh,

620
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,550
supposed to be funny?

621
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,530
Oh,whoops.

622
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,380
Are you kidding me?

623
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,430
I will kill you,you know that?

624
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,250
Bring it on.

625
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,300
Oh,jeez-- oh,"bring it on."
Okay,mama.

626
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,490
Let's bring it on.

627
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,590
Oh,look,there's your squad.

628
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,570
What,do you want to cheer it up,soccer mom?

629
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,290
Oh,soccer mom.

630
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,900
Are you gonna throw down some bed pans?

631
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,460
-whoa,whoa,whoa.
-Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey,hey.

632
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,200
Hey! If you're gonna beat each other up,

633
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,810
there's not gonna be anybody left
to set your broken bones.

634
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,870
That would be my job!
Am I right?

635
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,470
I'm right.
I'm right.Hey!

636
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,900
What hurts?
It's a little bitty bone.

637
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,270
we were just leaving.

638
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,010
Yeah,'cause I gotta go save lives.

639
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,870
Bye.

640
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,490
-pardon me.
-Excuse me. They're my ride.

641
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,250
You're awake.

642
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,360
Hey,yeah.

643
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,750
The baby jumps up and down in my belly all night.

644
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,580
Makes me have to pee all the time.

645
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
You work long hours,huh?

646
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,980
Yeah.

647
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,390
But I'm off work now,
only...

648
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,870
I just came back to talk to you.

649
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,940
I grew up in chehalis,too.

650
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,680
-Serious?
-Serious.

651
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,430
Um,forest park.

652
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,700
-The trailer park behind the church.
-Yeah,behind the church

653
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,940
on route 6,yeah.

654
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,680
My friend shelley lives up there.

655
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,230
Yeah,my mom still lives there.

656
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,990
-No way.
-Yeah.

657
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,030
can you keep a secret?

658
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,430
This is my daughter.

659
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,630
Then at in the picture,she's 6,
but

660
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,080
she's 11 now.

661
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
She lived in santa barbara,
but

662
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,480
they moved.

663
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,120
I don't know where.

664
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,560
But I know her name is hannah.

665
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,360
And she likes pigs.

666
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
-Pigs?
-Yep.

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
She collects them.Like figurines
or stuffed animals,you know?

668
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,980
I think it's probably because her
mom read her "charlotte's web."

669
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,080
I thought you were her mom.

670
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm her mother.

671
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,990
But I'm not her mom.

672
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,910
Look...

673
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,600
I know that where we come from...

674
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,920
this kind of thing doesn't get talked about.

675
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,050
But I wanted you to know

676
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,690
that there's more than one way
to be a good mother.

677
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,210
I wanted--

678
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,580
I wanted better for her than I could do at 16.

679
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,610
I love my baby.

680
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,330
Of course you do.

681
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,810
But you're reading her shakespeare.

682
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,360
When you're working 12-hour shifts at the diner

683
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,440
like our moms,

684
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,470
you won't be coming home and
reading her shakespeare.

685
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,650
I could hear you from six blocks away.

686
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,050
Sorry.

687
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,120
Don't be. I like it.

688
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,430
Um,I'm just not sure how the neighbors would feel.

689
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,250
Which...

690
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,520
by the way,

691
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,100
is not a thing someone lacking in
compassion would be concerned with.

692
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,930
How's your patient's leg?

693
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,090
Carved all to hell,
but still on her body.

694
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,830
Oh,we're watching it overnight.

695
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,870
What's going on?

696
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,920
Never in my career have I questioned
a fellow surgeon in their O.R.

697
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,250
I never understood what the problem was--

698
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,270
an intern dating an attending--

699
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,430
until today.

700
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,850
fair hours! Fair wages!....

701
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,660
And don't believe 2519 when she tells you

702
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,700
that she went to the bathroom.

703
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,770
She just wants to go home.

704
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,070
She just says she went to the bathroom,

705
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,700
and then she's back here two days later.

706
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,660
-Got it.
-Hey,I need sutures in 2602.

707
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,320
Can't help you.

708
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,920
What?

709
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,750
Fair hours! Fair wages!

710
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,680
Fair hours! Fair...

711
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,770
it's no offense.

712
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,240
None taken.

713
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,110
How's the strike going?

714
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,380
Do you know--

715
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,940
do you realize how

716
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,330
rarely doctors say "thank you"
and "please" to nurses?

717
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,600
How few surgeons even know the names of...

718
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,690
I shouldn't be seen talking to you.

719
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,730
excuse me.

720
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,130
I'm looking for richard webber.

721
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,220
Can I help you?

722
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,020
My name is alice bickham.

723
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,070
I'm here about my mother grace.

724
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,550
Sure. Um...

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,850
come with me,please.

726
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,780
You said you would look after her.

727
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,730
I'm sorry.

728
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,850
You told me to go to work,and you
said you would look after her.

729
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,040
Ms. Woods,um,can you--

730
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,010
just follow me.

731
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,420
She's a kid,you know?

732
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,160
She's scared enough without you
putting ideas in her head.

733
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,900
How do you tell a scared kid to
give her baby away?

734
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,350
I didn't tell her.

735
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,280
I didn't advise her.
I didn't pressure her.

736
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,790
I just... talked to her.

737
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,970
You're not a shrink.

738
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,090
You're not her mother.She's my kid,
and you crossed the line.

739
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,650
-I'm sorry.
-No,you're not sorry.

740
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,930
You're superior.

741
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,950
So what,you're a big-shot doctor,
and you get to judge us?

742
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,670
You get to tell my kid how to live her life?

743
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,280
Cheyenne is smart.

744
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,980
She's smart and she's thoughtful,
and she can have more.

745
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,350
She can have more than a
trailer park and

746
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,720
a graveyard shift at a truck
stop diner.

747
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,710
Don't you want that for her?

748
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,420
I mean,if you can get
past the fact that

749
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm superior and that I'm
judging you

750
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,610
and that I'm telling you
what's best for your family--

751
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,930
if you can just get past all of that--

752
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,700
isn't it possible that I'm also right?

753
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,600
pretty spectacular recovery,
claire.

754
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,980
Really?

755
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,360
Do you think it's gonna be okay?

756
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,590
I think we got almost all of the necrotic tissue.

757
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,240
A few times in a hyperbaric chamber,

758
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,280
and I'm thinkin' you'll be out of the woods.

759
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,190
Thank you for saving my leg.

760
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,370
My pleasure.

761
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,010
Now dr. Karev here will explain the
hyperbaric chamber.Dr. Karev?

762
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,470
Thank you,dr.

763
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,260
Heron.the hyperbaric chamber...

764
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,770
I'll take that apology anytime.

765
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,570
...Which helps kill all the bacteria.

766
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,620
This process is done over a couple of days.

767
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,480
So I'm going to give her a sedative,

768
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,180
which will ease her discomfort.

769
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,140
And then I'll remove the tube.

770
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,530
Okay.

771
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,600
are you ready?

772
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,220
Yes.

773
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,610
Wait.

774
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,100
Good-bye,mommy.

775
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,230
do you want to--

776
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,460
oh,no. No,we've already said our good-byes.

777
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,750
We just wanted to be here when grace crossed over.

778
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,490
I'm ready.

779
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,120
I can take care of this.

780
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,820
I did it.
I-I should undo it.

781
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,700
How long?
I mean,before...

782
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,540
it can take awhile.

783
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,370
She wants me to apologize.

784
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,570
-You crossed a line.
-I'm not apologizing.

785
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,030
You made me cross a line.

786
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,420
Oh,like I can make you do anything?

787
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,940
That's not your fault.

788
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,210
It's mine.

789
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,370
I'm your teacher.

790
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,870
I'm supposed to be.

791
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,200
But you came to me as your boyfriend,

792
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
and I responded that way.

793
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm not used to being wrong.

794
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,730
I know.

795
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,640
But you're an intern.

796
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,230
Second-guessing a resident is not your job.

797
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,410
How long has it been?

798
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,880
2 hours and 17 minutes.

799
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,610
I saw you there.

800
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,820
At the nursing home,
with my mother.

801
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,230
Oh.

802
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,610
They said you go two or three times a week.

803
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,320
Whenever I can.

804
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,590
Why did you keep it a secret?

805
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,980
I don't know.

806
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,860
Would you like me to stop going?

807
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,140
I'm gonna go check on grace.

808
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,270
Do you think she's lonely--

809
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,400
my mother?

810
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,350
Yeah,I do.

811
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,910
may she rest in peace.

812
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,720
Time of death...

813
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,010
12:42.

814
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,830
I don'T...

815
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,210
I can'T...

816
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,040
I don'T...

817
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,600
I can'T...

818
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,100
I don'T...

819
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,190
I don't want my mother to die alone.

820
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,370
Slow...

821
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,710
slow down.

822
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,290
Slow down. Shh.

823
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,070
Slow,deep breaths.
That's it.

824
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,220
Slow,deep breaths.
Breathe into this.

825
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,210
Breathe slow.
Slow down. It's okay.

826
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm okay.

827
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,830
You're okay.

828
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,950
Thank you.

829
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,350
You're welcome.

830
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,910
do you ever wish you hadn't done it?

831
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,990
No.

832
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,850
I really don'T.

833
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,610
If I give her up,

834
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,410
if I give her away,

835
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,290
do I still get to name her?

836
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,590
You can name her for yourself.

837
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,660
Did you name yours?

838
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
Sarah.

839
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,200
That's a pretty name.

840
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,210
Yeah.

841
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,930
I think you should keep visiting her.

842
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,610
You're sure?

843
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,900
Yeah.

844
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,820
She lights up when you're around.

845
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,260
She's alive.

846
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,640
Oh,she's with alex.
I can't do this in front of alex.

847
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,850
Well,you can and you will.

848
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,780
E-excuse me?
Why aren't you apologizing?

849
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,370
I-I'm an attending.
I don't apologize to residents.

850
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,780
You,on the other hand,
are an intern.

851
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,210
Sydney,I just wanted to...

852
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,190
uh...
just wanted to,um...

853
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,760
apologize...
for,you know,overstepping.

854
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,350
I'm--I'm sorry.

855
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,270
Well,that's the compassion I was looking for.

856
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,470
Apology accepted.

857
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,900
Okay,you want to hug it out?

858
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,690
Oh.

859
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,020
Go.

860
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,200
Hug.

861
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,250
-Oh,yeah.
-Come on.

862
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,130
we need them,patricia.

863
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,220
Yes,we need them.

864
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,060
So...

865
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,650
where do I find the spare change?

866
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,670
It's not like whatever's hiding underneath

867
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,700
the couch cushions is gonna do it.

868
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,820
Well,I seem to remember pushing
through paperwork

869
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,540
for a multimillion dollar surgery robot.

870
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,420
There was a 2-year waiting list for that.

871
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,990
It will bring in huge business.

872
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,520
And could you and the robot handle
that business without nurses?

873
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,590
We can't help ourselves.

874
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,210
We see a line...

875
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,420
we want to cross it.

876
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,410
Maybe it's the thrill of trading the familiar

877
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,620
for the unfamiliar,

878
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,340
a sort of personal dare.

879
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,680
Congratulations.

880
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,660
Only problem is,

881
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,910
once you've crossed,

882
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,450
it's almost impossible to go back.

883
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,830
are you okay?

884
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,400
Yeah.

885
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,770
You know,I am.

886
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,900
You okay?

887
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,310
Yeah.

888
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,410
What happened today?

889
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,440
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

890
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,910
