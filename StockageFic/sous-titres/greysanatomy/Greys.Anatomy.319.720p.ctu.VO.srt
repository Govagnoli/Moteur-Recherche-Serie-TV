1
00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:01,944
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,577
I was dead. Now I'm not.

3
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,239
Anybody come looking for me yet?

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,938
No hits from missing persons, plus--

5
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,136
My face is hard to identify.

6
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:10,995
Anyone know who
the new chief candidate is?

7
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:12,629
- Colin Marlowe.
- The one and only.

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,784
- He...
- Yes.

9
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,045
- With...
- Yes.

10
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:18,056
Your best friend violently disses
our marriage every chance she gets...

11
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,389
She has feelings for you!

12
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,033
Is she crazy?

13
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:35,435
<i>Surgeons always have a plan...</i>

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,018
<i>Where to cut, where to clamp,</i>

15
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:41,954
<i>where to stitch.</i>

16
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,752
<i>But even with the best plans...</i>

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,153
<i>Complications can arise,</i>

18
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,125
<i>things can go wrong...</i>

19
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:55,470
<i>And suddenly you're caught
with your pants down.</i>

20
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:59,123
Wow. You and George
were really going at it last night.

21
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,669
- What?
- Oh, the laughing,

22
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,266
the drinking, the music--

23
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:05,388
Okay, you know what?
Nobody, meaning me,

24
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,910
needs to hear
George's rendition of "Sexy Back"

25
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,107
at 3:00 in the morning.

26
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,042
Yeah.

27
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:14,051
You shoulda-- You shoulda just,
you know, said something or-- or...

28
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:15,811
Banged on the wall.

29
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,524
It's like living in a youth hostel.

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,568
Well, the important thing is,
is that she and George made up.

31
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:21,859
You did, right?

32
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,427
I need to use your bathroom.

33
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,929
- Why?
- Because O'Malley is puking in mine.

34
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,929
- Okay, youth hostel.
- George is still here?

35
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:29,530
Yes.

36
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:33,061
Yes, but only because he was
too drunk to drive home.

37
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,897
You know, just totally impaired,

38
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,057
like no-heavy-machinery drunk.

39
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,601
What's her problem?

40
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:40,944
Still drunk.

41
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,137
What's she doing here?

42
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,236
She's afraid she's ruining
her engagement to Burke,

43
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:46,316
so she's hiding from him.

44
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,082
Not anymore. I have a plan.

45
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,720
Burke doesn't want me
to marry him just to appease him--

46
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,307
- Which you are--
- So...

47
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:54,656
we don't get married.

48
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:55,839
Simple.

49
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,125
We go back to the way it was.

50
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:58,815
"Be kind. Rewind."

51
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,055
My plan has a name.

52
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:01,247
I gotta go.

53
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,118
Gotta get to work.

54
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:04,348
I'll see you guys there.

55
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,569
Is that George?

56
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,240
You said he was upstairs puking.

57
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,381
So now he's downstairs puking.

58
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,575
What the hell happened last night?

59
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,547
Callie is gonna kill me.

60
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,896
Did I at least call her before
I passed out?

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,710
You don't...

62
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,414
You don't remember?

63
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,517
I remember the bourbon...

64
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,053
And, uh...

65
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,139
I don't...

66
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:40,617
Where did you sleep?

67
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,277
- Big day.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,093
What time's your interview
with the board?

69
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:48,159
3:00.

70
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,876
Well, if you have any questions,
please--

71
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,150
Yes, thank you.
I think I have everything well in hand.

72
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,738
That's a big folder.

73
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,142
It's, uh, it's nothing.

74
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,470
It's, uh, just a few ideas
I have for Seattle Grace.

75
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,151
A 10-year plan,

76
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,303
which, uh, really is just a few...

77
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:04,956
tweaks.

78
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,834
What did, uh, Einstein say?

79
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:07,989
"Newton did the work,

80
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,613
"I'm merely standing on his shoulders."

81
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,430
And in this scenario, I'm Newton.

82
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:22,832
- Hey.
- Hey.

83
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:24,478
- You look nice.
- I look insane.

84
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,036
I'm-- I'm wearing pearls.

85
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,187
- Listen--
- Listen, about, uh, last night--

86
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,272
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I had--

87
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:32,319
we're gonna have to put a pin in that
for now, because as of this moment,

88
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,870
You and I are the perfect couple. Okay?

89
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:37,621
We are the perfect,
happily married couple who are perfect

90
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,917
and-- And never fight,

91
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,203
because, uh,

92
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,668
because my dad's in town.

93
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,346
- What?
- Yeah.

94
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,201
My dad is in town, and, uh,

95
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,691
he wants to meet my husband.

96
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:51,653
Oh, hey.

97
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,287
The O'Malleys.

98
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,392
Carry on. Do your stuff, your...

99
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,382
married stuff.

100
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:00,668
Yay!

101
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,262
You told her about our fight?

102
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:08,017
Just when exactly is he coming?

103
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,792
Today. Lunch. Cafeteria.

104
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,918
You know what,
I think I'm gonna change it to Joe's

105
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:14,243
so he might not be able to tell
that stink's coming from you.

106
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,955
No, it's-- It's okay.

107
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,504
It's gonna be okay.

108
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,574
Uh, I'm good with parents.

109
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:20,804
Parents love me.

110
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,792
Funny, funny, funny little man.

111
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:26,007
Funny little smelly little man.
Get in the shower, OK?

112
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,655
- It's gonna be OK.
- Get in the shower.

113
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,614
I know. You'll see.
He's gonna love me.

114
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,318
Oh! No.

115
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,147
What's this?

116
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:38,799
We bring each other coffee.
This is what we do.

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,524
No, it's what we used to do,

118
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,671
before you moved in.
We started making coffee at home.

119
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,112
You know, I'm not really interested
in going back to the way it used to be.

120
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,497
So unless you have something else
to say to me...

121
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,311
I've already had my coffee.

122
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,312
Good morning, Doctors.

123
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:09,363
Good morning.

124
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,713
Big day today, huh?

125
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,821
Good luck to all and sundry, hey?

126
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,996
He has a 10-year plan.

127
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,115
- What?
- He's presenting the board

128
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,991
with a 10-year plan
for the surgical wing.

129
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,241
He's only been here a day.

130
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,433
Did you see that folder?

131
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:27,748
It's full of plans,

132
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:30,445
"tweaks" for my hospital...

133
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:37,114
This is our computer-generated

134
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:39,725
approximation
of your original facial structure

135
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,260
based on the 3-D C.T. scans we did.

136
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:44,277
It's what you could look like after

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,978
reconstructive surgery.

138
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:47,923
Or you could look like this.

139
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:50,195
Or this.

140
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:54,839
You don't like them?

141
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,331
No, it's not that. It's...

142
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,959
How does this work exactly?

143
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:09,430
He'll make an incision
along your hairline, and then...

144
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,957
It's okay. I can take it.

145
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,342
He'll literally pull your face off.

146
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,135
It sounds a lot worse than it is.

147
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,323
Your face is extremely elastic,

148
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,771
and pulling it down allows me
to repair the bone fractures

149
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,816
underneath without
causing any scaring.

150
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:30,162
And once you've healed, no one
will ever know you had the surgery.

151
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:32,838
I'm that good.

152
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,394
He is. It's annoying.

153
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:38,164
The surgery won't affect my baby?

154
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,203
I'll be monitoring the baby throughout.

155
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:46,515
So...

156
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,758
Then I-I just have to pick one?

157
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,933
Do I have to pick one now?

158
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,648
Um, take a couple hours
and think about it.

159
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,277
Couple hours... yeah.

160
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,847
- Dr. Bailey.
- Chief,

161
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,781
our Jane Doe is getting
a new face today.

162
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:10,218
Well, that's exciting.

163
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:13,662
How are you doing, Meredith?

164
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,462
You didn't take
too much time off after--

165
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:17,300
I'm fine. Really, sir. I, uh,

166
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,083
I think working is
the best thing I can do.

167
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,596
Like mother, like daughter?

168
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,244
Dr. Grey, what can you tell me

169
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:24,954
about reconstructing
the orbital floor?

170
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,325
Uh, you can create
a new base for the eye socket

171
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,336
by harvesting bone from the skull.

172
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,694
Dr. Bailey,
Dr. Grey will be scrubbing in

173
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:34,242
on the Jane Doe surgery. Come on.

174
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,410
I'll show you how to do it
without breaking the bone graft

175
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:37,801
into a million pieces.

176
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,182
Congratulations, Dr. Grey.

177
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,384
Okay, let's go, people.

178
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,564
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I need to talk to you.

179
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:49,569
Why?

180
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,580
To prepare you guys
for what you're about to see.

181
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:52,620
You meant--

182
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,211
You meant "you" like "us",
not like "me".

183
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,466
You don't want to talk to me,
you want to talk to us

184
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:58,658
about a p-- About a patient.

185
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,188
That's what I just said.

186
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,366
Uh, this patient has a disease so rare

187
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,927
that you'll probably
never see it again--

188
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,315
- F.O.P.
- Oh, uh, fibrodysplasia

189
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,676
ossificans progressiva?

190
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,829
Yeah. It's a congenital disease

191
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,203
which turns muscle into bone.
You become a human statue.

192
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:14,716
So just, uh, try to learn.

193
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,471
Try not to stare, okay?

194
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,049
If you people are interns,
you need to stand back.

195
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:25,899
Nina, please don't be rude.

196
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,570
My mother still has movement in her...

197
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,736
face and hands. I would like to keep it
that way, so please be careful...

198
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:34,132
If you press too hard during an exam
or bump into her accidentally,

199
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,521
it causes a bone to grow
where a bone shouldn't grow.

200
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,132
So there can be no accidents.

201
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,262
Remember that
when you're dealing with her today...

202
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:42,352
It's just a stomach virus or a flu.

203
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,839
I'm sure it's nothing.
Nina insisted

204
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,568
- that I come in.
- She was vomiting blood

205
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,830
and going through her pain meds
like they were candy.

206
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,262
And she has new growths on her back,

207
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:52,968
no doubt caused
by some clumsy interns

208
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,151
on her last hospital stay.

209
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,174
Well, obviously you're having
a flare-up of the F.O.P.,

210
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,835
but what really concerns me
is the vomiting.

211
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,165
So I'm gonna need a C.T.,
see what's going on.

212
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,613
Wow. Did you build that?

213
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,876
- My mom did.
- No, Nina did it.

214
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,298
I used to do, I-I'm not able to.

215
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,303
It keeps her active.

216
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:12,374
When she's active,
she has fewer flare-ups.

217
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,609
Plus it makes her happy...

218
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,413
And relaxed.

219
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:19,803
Good. Okay.

220
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,413
Can I work in the clinic today?

221
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,934
You don't want the F.O.P. case?

222
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,516
Clinic, why?
What's going on in the clinic?

223
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,013
Nothing. I just feel clinic-y.

224
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,383
That's not a word. I'll take the clinic.

225
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:34,894
You both can go to the clinic.

226
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:37,927
The board is interviewing
the chief candidates all day today,

227
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,197
so we're light on surgeries.

228
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:41,705
Yes?

229
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,142
You're with Dr. O'Malley.

230
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,869
What am I supposed to do?

231
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,648
Find Dr. Montgomery.
See if you can help with Jane Doe.

232
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,900
I showered twice.

233
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,737
It's coming out of your pores, George.

234
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:56,829
You reek, you're trembling,

235
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,734
there's no way I'm letting
you near my patient right now.

236
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,137
- Dr. Bailey.
- Don't tell Bailey.

237
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:03,113
Bailey,
with Mrs. Rogerson's limited mobility,

238
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:05,413
I'm gonna, uh, need
an extra set of hands.

239
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:06,977
Fine.

240
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,228
Yang will handle the clinic.

241
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,059
You'll be with the O'Malleys today.

242
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:25,511
It's my foot.

243
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,685
It hurts like crazy.

244
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,469
I'm gonna need a painkiller.

245
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,572
Can't spend the whole day
propped on an ice pack.

246
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,679
Uh, you're gonna need
to take off your shoe.

247
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,701
No, no, no, no.
I've been down this route before.

248
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,771
Just slip me a couple painkillers,
and I'll be on my way.

249
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,875
Sir, uh, did you go to medicalchool?

250
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,138
I did. Take off your shoe.

251
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,134
You have type 2 diabetes.

252
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,420
Ten years now.

253
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,900
You inspect your feet every day.
Have you noticed anything?

254
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,930
I notice it hurts.
Look, I got 30 guys

255
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,520
sitting on their ass
waiting for me to show up.

256
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,929
Sir, I get it. You're in a hurry.
That makes the two of us.

257
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:57,218
Sock.

258
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,046
You need to call your guys
and tell them you're not coming in.

259
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,765
Did you choose a face?

260
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,901
Not yet.

261
00:11:21,502 --> 00:11:24,413
I was hoping I'd see one of 'em,
and, I don't know,

262
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:27,080
recognize myself or something, but...

263
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,314
I don't recognize any of these women.

264
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,286
What if I choose the wrong one?

265
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,539
What if my husband or boyfriend
or whoever's...

266
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,927
baby this is shows up tomorrow with a--

267
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,989
With a picture of what
I'm supposed to look like,

268
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:42,235
but it's too late, and I'm stuck with
the wrong face for the rest of my life?

269
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,463
Okay, that would suck,
but if you don't pick one...

270
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,956
This is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

271
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,564
Shouldn't you be preparing
for your board interview?

272
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:01,860
I am.

273
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:07,721
You're hovering.

274
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,063
No, I'm breathing you in.

275
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,148
You're hovering.

276
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:12,584
Fine. I'm hovering.

277
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,753
If Cristina would sleep in her own bed,
I wouldn't have to hover at work.

278
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:18,326
I could hover in bed.
A different type of hovering perhaps.

279
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,544
How bad is it today,

280
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,072
on a scale of one to ten?

281
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,857
- Seven. Maybe a six.
- Good.

282
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,183
You know what's gonna make it
even better than that?

283
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,570
- What?
- The calvarial

284
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,378
bone harvest I get to do
on Sloan's Jane Doe later.

285
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,303
Sloan's gonna let you do a harvest..

286
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:40,384
- By yourself?
- By myself.

287
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,962
Which makes me very cool in the eyes
of my dead mother, by the way.

288
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,028
Okay, then.
Well, I better let you study.

289
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:48,939
Better stop distracting me.
I will not be cool

290
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,859
in the eyes of my dead mother
if I maim Jane Doe.

291
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,767
We're gonna need you to lie very still,
Mrs. Rogerson.

292
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,455
I think I can do that, Dr. O'Malley.

293
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,667
Sorry about that, Mrs. Rogerson.

294
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:15,433
I'm never gonna drink again.

295
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,151
I can't believe I have to be
presentable for Callie's dad at lunch.

296
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,722
Oh, god.

297
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,264
Hours--

298
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,118
Hours of our lives--

299
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:33,429
Many hours that are
all I can think about,

300
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,999
and you seriously don't remember?

301
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,540
How can you not remember those many,
many hours?

302
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,448
Let-- Izzie, if...

303
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,201
Whatever I did, whatever I said,

304
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,239
I was drunk. I'm sure I didn't mean it.

305
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,880
George, I promise you, you meant it.

306
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:52,365
You meant it a lot.
You meant it more than once.

307
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:55,362
Do you see that?

308
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,235
Gotta page Callie.

309
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,845
You'll be pleased to hear
I'm proposing an expansion

310
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,337
to the hospital board this afternoon.

311
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,064
Give you quite
a few more places to hide.

312
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:13,082
I'm not going to hide.

313
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,610
I'm just trying to find my resident.

314
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,085
I come here to Seattle to see you,
and you don't even give me a moment?

315
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,767
You didn't come to see me.
You came to get a job.

316
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,902
- I came here for both.
- Well, you made a mistake.

317
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,430
Are you going to invite me?

318
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,688
- Where?
- To the wedding.

319
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,618
Will you stop talking about the wedding?

320
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,815
Most blushing brides to be love
to talk about the wedding.

321
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:29,930
What the matter?

322
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,481
Are we getting cold feet?

323
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:34,326
Please leave.

324
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,280
If he's rushing you,

325
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,763
you should tell him.

326
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,083
When you marry, you want to be ready.

327
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,214
He should understand that.

328
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,784
Good afternoon, board.

329
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,871
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen...

330
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:00,439
of the board.
I am so grateful for this opportunity.

331
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:01,669
Don't wear the glasses.

332
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:04,222
You fiddle with 'em.
It makes you look indecisive.

333
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,440
And stop stressing.
It'll be like any other job interview.

334
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,665
"What do you consider your strengths?
What do you consider your weaknesses?"

335
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:13,759
What do you consider your weaknesses?

336
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,547
I don't have any.

337
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:17,741
I'm that good.

338
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,004
What are yours?

339
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:22,173
I'm an easy Mark for evil redheads.

340
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,546
Trust me, you have other weaknesses.

341
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,489
Obviously...

342
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,067
you are a man-whore.

343
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,395
Correction. I was a man-whore.

344
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,968
Yeah, while you're bragging
about that to the board,

345
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:37,902
Colin Marlowe is pitching
his 10-year plan.

346
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,160
10-year plan?

347
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,284
Was that a requirement?

348
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:42,927
It is now.

349
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:45,857
Mrs. Rogerson, according to your C.T.,

350
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:48,289
you have severe internal bleeding.

351
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:51,171
It was probably caused by
your anti-inflammatory medication.

352
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:53,198
Does that require surgery?
Because she can't have any--

353
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,874
Obviously any surgical procedure
could cause more bone growth

354
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,531
or do more damage than good.

355
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,108
That's why Dr. Burke's here.

356
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:02,065
What we can do is insert
a line into your groin

357
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:04,715
and then float a catheter up
and embolize the area.

358
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,349
That's minimally invasive?

359
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:08,677
As minimally invasive as possible.

360
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:10,743
But with your condition,
even this is risky.

361
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,856
I'm 41 years old.

362
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,548
Most F.O.P. patients don't live to 45.

363
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,842
I'm down to the use
of my face and hands.

364
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,494
Pretty soon I won't have anything.

365
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:22,673
So what would happen...

366
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,142
If I refuse the surgery?

367
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,015
You will bleed to death...

368
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,493
Within a day or two.

369
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,113
Is that painful?

370
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,687
- Mom, stop, okay?
- Nina, please.

371
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,017
- Let me think.
- The reason you've gotten this far--

372
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,302
Our treatment plan works.

373
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:44,960
It will work.

374
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,826
Burke is using powerpoint.

375
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,915
He's doing a powerpoint presentation
for the board, which is...

376
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,479
cool if it's, like, 1998.

377
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:59,936
There's no swag, is there?

378
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,852
We're not allowed to give gifts?

379
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,157
Why did you ask Meredith

380
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,225
to do a bone graft on your Jane Doe?

381
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,462
Because I'm her teacher,
and that's my job.

382
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:14,010
You're doing it to impress the chief.

383
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,889
You're setting her up,

384
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,448
and she can't fail right now.

385
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,092
Why don't you let your girlfriend decide
what she can or can't do?

386
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,967
I will hurt you
if this goes wrong for her.

387
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,390
Is that a... dollhouse?

388
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:40,030
Yeah. The lights work and everything.
It's the perfect little home.

389
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,380
Did you have a dollhouse growing up?

390
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,570
I had sex last night...

391
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,616
with the wrong person.

392
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:50,973
But the thing is,
it didn't feel wrong at the time.

393
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,364
It felt like...

394
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,683
Something's falling into place.

395
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,403
So what do I do?

396
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,774
What am I,
the go-to person for adultery?

397
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,426
I just...

398
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,567
I just don't know what to do.

399
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:08,460
You stop.

400
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:11,296
That's what you do.

401
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:12,911
Are you sure?

402
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:14,742
I mean, how do you know

403
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,887
that it didn't feel so right because...

404
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,379
it's god's plan?

405
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,466
God wants you to be an adulter?

406
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,043
God got a virgin pregnant by magic.

407
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:27,489
God is not playing by the rules.

408
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,111
Uh, talk to paul.

409
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:31,538
Mr. Kendry.

410
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:33,952
No, Paul will get you drywall numbers.

411
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,970
- Mr. Kendry.
- Okay.

412
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,902
Let me just write
a couple notes about that call.

413
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,005
Mr. Kendry, we're gonna have
to amputate your foot.

414
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:46,885
- What?
- The infection is in the bone.

415
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,627
If we don't remove the foot,
it will travel to your blood,

416
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,181
and that will cause sepsis
and possible death. I'm sorry.

417
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:58,922
How can you be so...

418
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,635
I mean, I-I can't get around a...

419
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:04,472
No, no, no, no, no.

420
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:06,528
No, no. You're not cutting off my foot.

421
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,402
Sir, diabetes is a manageable disease.

422
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,355
If you had been here even a month ago,

423
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,073
- maybe we--
- Okay, so I screwed up.

424
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,859
But you're telling me
that this is my only option

425
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,373
because I'm late getting in here?

426
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,378
- That there is no way--
- Mr. Kendry--

427
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:24,783
Please.

428
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:27,510
There's gotta be a way for me
to get that month back.

429
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:30,003
Tell me what to do.

430
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,106
I'll do it. I'll do every line

431
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,677
of every plan you give me.

432
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,010
I'll do it.

433
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,635
Please.

434
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:41,247
You gotta find a way to save my foot.

435
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,458
What do you think of a robotics lab
as a goal for the hospital?

436
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,702
- Derek...
- You're harvesting.

437
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,007
I'm trying to be supportive
but this graft, it's really tricky.

438
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,236
You don't have to do it, you know.

439
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,539
I talked to Mark, and, uh--

440
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,051
You what?

441
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,079
I talked to Mark.
I mean, Meredith, this is a--

442
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,788
- It's a complex procedure.
- You don't think I can do it?

443
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,061
When has Mark Sloan,

444
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,469
allowed his interns to do anything,

445
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,037
let alone harvest a bone graft?

446
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:16,896
He's in the race for chief.

447
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,320
- He's trying to prove he can teach.
- By teaching you..

448
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:21,722
Your mother died, the chief
is gonna be watching you very closely.

449
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,633
And Mark is trying to gain points by--

450
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,712
Using me.

451
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:27,011
If it goes well, he gets the credit.
If it goes poorly,

452
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:28,310
he gets the save.

453
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,677
So this is about you onupping Mark.

454
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,029
He's using you.

455
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,320
I'm just trying to protect you.

456
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:37,921
You don't need to.

457
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,300
Close the door on your way out...

458
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,407
- Can I help you with those, Dr. Bailey?
- What do you want?

459
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,044
See, that's what I like about you.
You always get right to the point.

460
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,902
Make it quick.
I'm headed over to the clinic.

461
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:01,916
All right.

462
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:04,330
What would you change
about this hospital if you could?

463
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,907
Is this for your board interview?

464
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,120
You want me to do
your homework for you

465
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,876
because I'm not busy enough,
is that it?

466
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:14,613
All the other attendings are putting
together 10-year plans. I was...

467
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,324
just looking for some input.

468
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,432
Input? You want--

469
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:21,253
I have patients
in need of medical attention right now.

470
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:24,163
This guy here is about
to have one less appendage.

471
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,919
I don't have a 10-year plan for him.

472
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:27,797
I have a "right now" plan for him--

473
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:29,515
Cut off his foot to save his life.

474
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:33,170
So you need to get out of my way
right now so I can do my job.

475
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,982
- Right now?
- Right now.

476
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,513
Talk to me about blackouts.

477
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:43,921
Are they real?

478
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:46,054
Do you really not remember
anything afterwards?

479
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:49,265
Iz, I'm fine. Not drinking.
I'm not drowning my sorrows.

480
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:50,402
Fine.

481
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,824
Everybody needs to stop trying
to protect me.

482
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,382
Um, this isn't... really about you.

483
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:59,494
I'm asking, back when you had
a best friend named tequila, did you...

484
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,183
actually ever blackout?

485
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,244
Once. No, twice.

486
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:06,015
But the stuff
you don't remember is usually

487
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:07,528
the stuff you don't wanna remember.

488
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,012
Right.

489
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,504
Great. Thanks.

490
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:14,685
Hey, I have type 2 diabetes.

491
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,239
Patient let it go,
and the infection is in the bone.

492
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,164
I have to find a fix
or cut off the foot.

493
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:20,995
Anyone? Anybody?

494
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,497
You get to cut off his foot? Cool.

495
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,957
You think-- No, not cool.

496
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,421
The patient was neglectful.

497
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,915
He made a couple of bad calls.
Does that mean he has no hope?

498
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,332
Does that mean he can't have a do over?

499
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:34,123
But you get to cut
through bone and stuff.

500
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:35,945
We're talking about Burke now.

501
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:36,996
We are?

502
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:40,546
Operation "Be kind. Rewind."
not going so well?

503
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:41,928
You need to fix it.

504
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,542
Cause it seems like you guys
have a pretty good thing,

505
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,009
and pretty good things are rare,

506
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,224
and hard to come by,

507
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,285
unlike really screwed up,

508
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:51,003
complicated things, which...

509
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:52,995
seem to be freakin' everywhere.

510
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,544
You know what? Things are great.

511
00:22:54,864 --> 00:22:56,723
I'm gonna get things back
to the way we were.

512
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:58,235
Watch me.

513
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,504
Has Jane Doe picked a face?

514
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,110
No, not yet.

515
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,612
How cool would that be,

516
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,654
to get to pick your own face, just...

517
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,640
disappear and start all over?

518
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:18,963
How you doing?

519
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,831
How am I doing?
I'm freaking out, Alex...

520
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,568
That's how I'm doing.
I can't do this.

521
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:23,620
I can't pick.

522
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:24,981
I can't.

523
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:26,634
All right.

524
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:29,208
Well, let's, uh...

525
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,640
Let's meet the contenders, all right?

526
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,665
Let's see. This...

527
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:39,830
This is... Maggie.

528
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,956
Married her high school sweetheart,
has two kids--

529
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,575
Boy and girl...
Loves being a mom,

530
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,579
coaches her daughter's
basketball team and...

531
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,048
makes an insane bana cream pie.

532
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,578
Bana cream pie?

533
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,287
It's my favorite, so shut up.

534
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:59,328
And this is... um... Elizabeth.

535
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:01,253
Graduated from Northwestern.

536
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,601
Met her husband
at a political rally where they...

537
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,320
got arrested and fell in love.

538
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:07,217
She's all angry and fired up,

539
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:09,292
but everyone forgives her
because she means well.

540
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:14,834
This one...

541
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:16,759
This one's Ava.

542
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:20,327
She's funny, she's tough.

543
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,783
You know, little neurotic sometimes,
but you get used to it.

544
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:28,003
You can tell she's-- She's been
through a lot in her life, but...

545
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,671
It's only made her stronger, you know?

546
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:41,496
It's just, your daughter, the way she...

547
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:43,773
You know, she's sort of undeniable.

548
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,520
And, uh, after I lost my father, I...

549
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:50,318
realized, you know, that life is short.

550
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,782
And it's-- It's long, too....

551
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:56,321
Short and long...

552
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,302
Life....

553
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,077
He talks a lot.

554
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,288
No, no. He-- He-- He talks.

555
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:04,640
Like a-- Like a--

556
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,435
Like a person who talks, dad.

557
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,627
- Please.
- Do you have any idea

558
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:09,980
what you've done to your mother?

559
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,885
You make this decision,
the most important day of your life...

560
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:17,597
We didn't even know she was seeing
someone... Are you pregnant?

561
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:19,832
- Did you get my daughter pregnant?
- No. Daddy.

562
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,452
No, it is not--
No. This is George, okay?

563
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:24,374
He's not like the other guys
I've been with.

564
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,495
Clean as a whistle,

565
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,054
and a mathlete.

566
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,231
He has no money.

567
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:30,901
- You have money.
- Oh, come on...

568
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,086
I didn't know that Callie was well-off.

569
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,898
- She just told me.
- Really?

570
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,339
Really? Well, then,
you won't mind if the house,

571
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,227
the car and everything else
we'll provide

572
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:41,687
will be in Calliope's name.

573
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:43,781
- Uh, what house?
- You're a married woman now.

574
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:47,019
I'll find something suitable. It's all
here in the postnuptial i've drawn up.

575
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,509
- Dad!
- Sorry.

576
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,635
I've got it. It's all right. It's okay.

577
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:56,634
You know what? You--
You are not drawing up any...

578
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:08,538
- ...you can raise a family.
- No!

579
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,548
- What?
- No, that's not gonna happen.

580
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,475
There's no way I'm gonna
let you pay for anything. I can't--

581
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,075
We can't, uh... Callie, I'm so sorry.

582
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,442
Mr. Torres, I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

583
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:39,950
You remembered.

584
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,616
That's really coming along.
It looks great.

585
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:38,658
Thanks.

586
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,235
We've been working on it for months.

587
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,146
But when I say "we", I mean "she".

588
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:44,458
I just hold things and look pretty.

589
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,082
That can be hard work, too.

590
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:49,622
I'm gonna need to draw
some blood for, uh, your surgery.

591
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:51,519
Be careful.

592
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:54,148
You can only use one specific vein.

593
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,059
In this area here.

594
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,944
- I said be careful.
- I'm so sorry.

595
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:00,977
That's okay.

596
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:03,437
I's not. If she gonna be that clumsy,
she's not drawing your blood.

597
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:04,981
Nina, she's just doing her job.

598
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:06,877
Not very well. I'm going to get a nurse,
a senior nurse.

599
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,258
- Oh, Nina, stop.
- No, mom.

600
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,399
Do not let her touch you.
We can't be too careful.

601
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:12,495
You're not taking her blood.

602
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,765
She's not even a person anymore.

603
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:22,530
You know what I mean?

604
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:25,074
- Mrs. Rogerson--
- I know I'm gonna die.

605
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,356
You know, maybe not today, but soon..

606
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,994
I just need to talk, you know?

607
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:34,397
Nina won't let me talk.

608
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:38,654
I just need to talk.

609
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:44,645
No coffee.

610
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:49,313
One more thing for marlowe to tweak...

611
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:51,670
Please tell me you're not coming up

612
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,548
with a 10-year plan for this hospital.

613
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:57,585
You can me up with all the plans
you want, but in the end, it just...

614
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,502
Doesn't make one bit of difference.

615
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,103
- Things happen. People just--
- Drown?

616
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,866
You know, when I pulled her
out of the water, it was...

617
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,284
She was like ice.

618
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,472
She can swim.

619
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,232
Richard, she's...

620
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:22,227
She gave up.

621
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:25,750
I close my eyes for a moment,
it's like she's back in the water.

622
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:30,213
I'm up, and I just listen
to her breathe, you know? Just...

623
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,145
In case she stops.

624
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:36,325
So I can come up with plans
for the hospital, but...

625
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:41,321
But if they ask me where
I'm gonna be in ten years...

626
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:48,148
George.

627
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:53,822
Mr. Torres.

628
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,351
You want to take care of her
in your own way.

629
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:01,042
I understand that.

630
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:02,906
I respect it.

631
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:04,577
But you have to understand,

632
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:07,145
she's my only little girl, George.

633
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,574
And you need to promise me
that you will love her and protect her,

634
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:12,931
because the minute that you hurt her...

635
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:15,597
You understand?

636
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:20,249
Good. Then I'll tell Callie's mother
she can plan the party.

637
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,362
What pa-- What?

638
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,343
- Your wedding party.
- Oh, dad.

639
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:26,348
Oh, no, please, <i>mija.</i>
For my sanity, <i>mija</i>,

640
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:28,498
just let her plan a party.

641
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,162
All right, all right. Okay.

642
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:31,514
All right.

643
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,204
I have a plane to catch.

644
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:34,922
Come here.

645
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:37,580
George.

646
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,267
Bye, dad.

647
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,696
You stood up to him.
Nobody does that.

648
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,518
I was all proud.

649
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:54,017
So listen...

650
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,747
About last night,
I don't know about you,

651
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:59,332
but personally,
I'd like to take back about 90% of it.

652
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,426
Me, too.

653
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,125
Good.

654
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,337
Good. Okay. Then go--
Go find Izzie

655
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:06,671
and help her prep Mrs. Rogerson.
I'll see you in surgery.

656
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,406
You here to keep my baby alive?

657
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:16,910
I am.

658
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:19,182
Good.

659
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:20,948
So?

660
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,323
So...

661
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,218
Call me Ava.

662
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,133
You been practicing? You know
the chief will be watching today.

663
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:34,312
The chief. Right. Of course.

664
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,567
"Of course" what?

665
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,154
Derek was right about you.

666
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:40,999
You're using the memory
of my dead mother

667
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,793
to win points with the chief.

668
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:44,886
It's despicable,

669
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:46,457
and I'm not gonna play.

670
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:47,950
The chief--

671
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:50,175
The way he was looking
at you this morning--

672
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,509
Was like you were
some beaten down puppy

673
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,147
he picked up off
the side of the road.

674
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,038
You do this procedure

675
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:57,729
and you do it well,

676
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,567
he'll start looking at you
like a surgeon again.

677
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:02,811
But, you know...

678
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:05,785
You wanna think of me as despicable,

679
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:08,022
you wanna pass up this shot,
that's up to you.

680
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:24,340
They're doing a-amazing things
with prosthetics these days.

681
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,167
This doesn't mean your life is over.

682
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,939
Uh, take him up to the O.R.
I'll meet you there.

683
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:46,359
You've got your board thing now?

684
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:50,946
The chief picked you...

685
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,483
Originally. You were always
supposed to be the next chief.

686
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:54,494
That was the plan.

687
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,038
That was a long time ago.

688
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:58,641
A lot has happened since then.

689
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:00,059
But you're still that guy.

690
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:02,847
You're the guy the chief chose.

691
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,088
No, I'm not.

692
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,605
I'm not that guy, Cristina,
and I wouldn't want to be.

693
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:10,370
I want to be better than that.

694
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,658
I'd like to believe that I've grown.

695
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:14,982
I want to move forward.

696
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,442
I'm not interested in going back.

697
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,287
Dr. Burke.

698
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,661
You ready?

699
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,018
Osteotome and hammer.

700
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:42,745
All right, use the curved osteotome
to elevate the external table.

701
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:44,300
Gently.

702
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,678
- How's it looking?
- Still see bleeding.

703
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,847
The platinum microcoils--

704
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,012
They aren't holding.

705
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:00,440
What about using a gelatin sponge?

706
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,544
I've already tried polyvinyl alcohol,

707
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,459
glue, microcoils-- Nothing's working.

708
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,552
B.P.'s dropping to 62 systolic.

709
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,110
We'll have to open her up.

710
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,519
If you open her up, she's dead.

711
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:10,890
If we don't, she's dead.

712
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:26,309
Beginning amputation.

713
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:50,233
Fine amputation, Yang.

714
00:34:58,193 --> 00:34:59,197
Beautiful.

715
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,146
Wait.

716
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,836
- Now they're laughing.
- Laughing?

717
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:34,312
They're laughing.

718
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,695
They can't be laughing with him.

719
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,521
They have to be laughing at him.

720
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,451
I'm surprised
you don't have a shot glass

721
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,798
pressed up against that window.

722
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:43,485
- We weren't listening.
- Just listening.

723
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,831
Let me show you the new clinic.

724
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,040
Chief.

725
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:52,979
So?

726
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:55,270
If you ask me, you all could stand

727
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,420
to borrow a page from Dr. Sloan's book.

728
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,095
Sloan? You're kidding right?
That's a joke?

729
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:03,729
He didn't get caught up in
this whole 10-year plan foolishness.

730
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:07,107
He said he had a "right now" plan
for Seattle Grace.

731
00:36:07,108 --> 00:36:08,310
A right now plan?

732
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:10,122
A right now plan?

733
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,500
Is that right?

734
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:13,767
The board ate it up.

735
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,173
To tell you the truth, so did I.

736
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:27,035
I should've brought her in sooner...

737
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:30,359
The first time she threw up.

738
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:33,167
I knew better.

739
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,201
- There was nothing any of us could--
- No.

740
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,242
It was a mistake.

741
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:44,072
Your mother...

742
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,992
talked to me.

743
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,867
She wasn't ready to leave you,

744
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,764
but she was ready to leave her body.

745
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,797
Please.

746
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:56,688
I don't need you to explain the relative
comforts of death for my mother.

747
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,348
What she was afraid of...

748
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,658
was that you had taken
on so much of her disease

749
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,114
that you were freezing up, too.

750
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:10,961
You've spent so much time
planning and...

751
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,285
Helping her avoid risk--
God knows,

752
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,596
that's what you should've been doing--
But...

753
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:18,200
She was worried.

754
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:21,953
You have a healthy body, Nina.

755
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:23,943
If you fall down,
you won't turn to stone.

756
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:30,208
And your mom so wanted you
to just let yourself fall.

757
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:33,983
Messing up...

758
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:36,736
It's what makes a person.

759
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:39,675
It's how we learn...

760
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,679
Where we find joy--

761
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:46,682
In the things you don't plan for,

762
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,837
the things you never see coming.

763
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:01,812
It happened.

764
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,738
It was a mistake, and it happened.

765
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,309
People make mistakes.

766
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,964
We need to figure out
where we go from here.

767
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:11,795
We need to figure out
how to tell Callie.

768
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:13,081
I'm not gonna tell Callie.

769
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,420
Do you know how much
this would hurt her?

770
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:20,192
I'm not gonna clear
my conscience at her expense.

771
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,539
She has done nothing but...

772
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,746
support me, encourage me
and believe in me,

773
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,286
and this is how I pay her back?

774
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:29,567
I have to live with what I did.

775
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,771
This is our secret, okay?

776
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,973
<i>The thing about plans is,</i>

777
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:44,358
<i>they don't take into account
the unexpected.</i>

778
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:46,757
<i>So when we're thrown a curveball,</i>

779
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,965
<i>whether it's in the O.R. or in life....</i>

780
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:53,247
How are you feeling?

781
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,994
<i>We have to improvise.</i>

782
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:56,458
I'm a guy without a foot.

783
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,396
What do I do now?

784
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,147
You move forward, you...

785
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,075
You follow the plan and...

786
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,865
you try and keep your other foot.

787
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:10,358
My other foot.

788
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,011
Right.

789
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:18,407
<i>Of course,</i>

790
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:21,900
<i>some of us are better at it than others.</i>

791
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:28,379
I'm impressed, Karev.

792
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:32,003
You spent the whole day
watching a fetal monitor

793
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:33,318
and never complained.

794
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,731
Well, I, uh, I do what I'm told.

795
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:37,048
Since when?

796
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:39,352
Depends on who's doing the telling.

797
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:44,062
Good night, Dr. Karev.

798
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,003
What was that?

799
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:52,970
How's... Ava?

800
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:57,804
I don't think I'm gonna know
the answer to that for a little while.

801
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:01,751
What do you say we talk about you
and the redhead instead?

802
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:05,471
Well, the redhead's my boss, so...

803
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:08,729
- So?
- So, it's complicated.

804
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:11,227
- And?
- And...

805
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:17,374
<i>Some of us just have
to move on to plan B...</i>

806
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,369
<i>And make the best of it.</i>

807
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,610
It has to be small--

808
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:38,920
Just you and me...

809
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:40,943
And Meredith..

810
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:43,323
And-- And Shepherd, too, if you want.

811
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,900
But that's it.

812
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,196
And a justice of the peace.

813
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:50,746
I know you're...

814
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:52,839
spiritual and stuff, but...

815
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,595
I-I don't want any rabbis or ministers,

816
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,041
nothing religious.

817
00:40:57,936 --> 00:40:58,950
We'll just...

818
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,762
Make an appointment at city hall, and...

819
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,152
that'll be that.

820
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:06,311
And no veil.

821
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:08,156
Okay? I don't want
to get married with...

822
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:10,222
mosquito net all over my face.

823
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,637
I let Mark use
the memory of my mother

824
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:27,890
to win points with the chief.
You were right.

825
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:29,627
I'm sorry.

826
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,482
- You know what's weird?
- What's weird?

827
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,059
It's exactly
what she would have wanted.

828
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:37,800
Dead mommy's proud?

829
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,688
Dead mommy's proud.

830
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:45,106
How was your interview?

831
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,654
Not great.

832
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:50,889
It wasn't great.

833
00:41:52,297 --> 00:41:53,405
I was distracted.

834
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,285
By what?

835
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,806
Nothing.

836
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,623
I don't know.

837
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:07,321
On a scale of one to ten,
how bad is it?

838
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:10,220
Eight.

839
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,982
How about, now?

840
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:16,447
Seven.

841
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:21,736
<i>And sometimes...</i>

842
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:22,906
How about, now?

843
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:24,835
Six.

844
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,173
- <i>What we want...</i>
- Five.

845
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,854
- <i>is exactly what we need.</i>
- Four, three.

846
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,552
<i>But sometimes...</i>

847
00:43:01,563 --> 00:43:04,022
I can smell your clothes
through the closet door.

848
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,017
Did you tie them up
in a plastic laundry bag?

849
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,310
Yeah.

850
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:10,485
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,482
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

852
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,613
Well, I guess I can...

853
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,416
live with it.

854
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:26,354
<i>Sometimes what we need...</i>

855
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:28,651
<i>is a new plan.</i>
