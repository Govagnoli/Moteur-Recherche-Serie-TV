(Izzie) GEORGE'S DAD
I MET A SISTER
I NEVER KNEW I HAD.

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,601
(Izzie) CAN YOU IMAGINE--Y WHOLE
FAMILY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,034
I'M JUST ASKING
ABOUT YOUR DAD.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:12,634
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME,
REMEMBER?

6
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,100
MR. O'MALLEY HAS ELECTED
TO HAVE DR. HAHN

7
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,500
PERFORM HIS VALVE REPLACEMENT.
I CAN CLEAR YOU FOR SURGERY.

8
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,068
YOU'RE SURE?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,001
<i>I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME IN</i>

10
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:24,400
ON YOUR SURGERY.
I'M AFRAID
I JUST CLDLDN'T USE YOU.

11
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,500
I CAN'T SEE YOUR MOTHER
ANYMORE.

12
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:29,968
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO RETIRE, RICHARD.
(Preston) I'M GOING TO BE CHIEF.

13
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,801
I HAD A TREMOR AND I DIDN'T

THIS HAPPENED...
A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

THIS IS NOT HAPPENING NOW.

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,720
THIS ISN'T A COURT OF LAW.

62
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,287
BUT THEY'RE NOT
THAT RESPONSIBLE.

63
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,879

GOOD MORNING, MR. O'MALLEY.

73
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,772
JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
BEFORE THE SURGERY

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,244
AND SEE HOW THAT COLLARBONE
WAS HEALING.

75
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,532
GEORGE... YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY
HELLO TO DR. TORRES?

76
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,411
I'M GONNA SEE YOU
FOR ROUNDS, DAD.

77
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,233
HAD YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
DEVELOPING A TREMOR,

78
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,728
I COULD'VE RUN SOME TESTS.

79
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:48,347
THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT
THERE'S JUST SOME COMPRESSION

80
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,955
OF THE STRUCTURES
AROUND THE INJURY.

81
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:52,058
I CAN GO IN THERE--
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SURGERY.

82
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,917
IT COULD BE A SMALL CLOT.
I JUST GO IN--

83
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,580
SHEPHERD, I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER SURGERY.

84
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,665
THE FIRST ONE
CAUSED ENOUGH DAMAGE.

85
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,954
I CAN DO THIS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
THE LAST TIME.

86
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,362
NOW I HAVE A TREMOR.

87
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,198
MAYBE SHE'LL BE ON "LOOK
BUT DON'T TOUCH" PATROL, TOO.

88
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:13,472
AT LEAST I'D HAVE
SOME COMPANY.

89
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:15,968
WHATEVER SHE GETS,
I HOPE IT'S BAD,

90
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,848
REALLY BAD.
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

91
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,056
A MISTAKE?
WE ALL--

92
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,334
SHE WAS GONNA LET BURKE--
BURKE WITH THE SHAKY HAND--

93
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:24,406
OPERATE ON MY FATHER.

94
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,072
COULD YOU STOP LKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

95
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,696
IT'S CREEPY, AND IT MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FED.

96
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,281
HOW'S IT GOING?

97
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,341
HOW'S WHAT GOING?

98
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,748
YOU AND BURKE,

99
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:51,973
ARE YOU OKAY?

100
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,572
(exhales) WE'RE EXISTING
IN TOTAL SILENCE.

101
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:56,796
HE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU?

102
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:58,254
I'M NOT TALKING
TO HIM EITHER.

103
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,775
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

104
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:03,826
STOP ASKING ME THAT.
I'M MAKING AN EFFORT HERE.

105
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:04,840
PLEASE DON'T.

106
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,201
ROUNDS STARTED 30 SECONDS AGO.

107
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,663
THE CHIEF MAY BE CONFUSED
ABOUT PUNISHMENT FOR YOU,

108
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,231
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN,

109
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,527
YOU WILL FIND
ANOTHER RESIDENT.

110
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,478
DR. BAILEY,
CAN I HAVE GREY?

111
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,759
YOU CAN HAVE 'EM ALL.

112
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,997
SOMETHING YOU NEEDED,
DR. MONTGOMERY?
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

113
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,867
BUT I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO BE WARNED.
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW--

114
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,287
YOUR SISTER MOLLY'S
JUST BEEN ADMITTED

115
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,381
FOR AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.
MOLLY'S NOT MY SISTER.

116
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,173
OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY,
SHE IS,

117
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:35,272
YOU HAVE THE SAME FATHER.

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,087
AND, UH, SUSAN--
SUSAN GREY
IS DEFINITELY NOT MY MOTHER.

119
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,603
I APPRECIATE YOUE TRYING
TO BE NICE AND EVERYTHING,

120
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:42,244
BUT I REALLY DON'T EVEN
NEED TO KNOW THIS, SO--

121
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:43,740
ACTUALLY YOU DO.
(clears throat)

122
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,890
HELLO, MEREDITH.

123
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:53,835

00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,209
I HAVE A DAY. WHICH ONE
OF THE INTERNS IS MINE?
IT'S MINE.

132
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,984
HE'S FAMILY,
AND SHE'S A CANDY STRIPER.
I'M READY.

133
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,977
WHAT IF YOU DID PICK ME?
WHAT IF YOU PICKED ME?
(Ronny and Jerry) PICK ME!

134
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,218
GUYS, THIS IS SERIOUS.

135
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,436
YANG.

136
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,342
WHAT?
(Alex, Izzie and Cristina)
WHAT?

137
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,488
DR. HAHN, CRISTINA IS
VERY GOOD WITH CARDIO.

138
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,657
I'M SURE YOU CAN USE HER
FOR THE DAY.

139
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,794
UH...

140
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,359
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
YANG? PRESENT THE CASE.

141
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,519
HAROLD O'MALLEY, 63, DIAGNOSED
WITH ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

142

143
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,486
IS SCHEDULED FOR AORTIC VALVE
REPLACEMENT THIS AFTERNOON.

144
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:42,738
DUDE, I WANTED THAT SURGERY,
AND SHE HANDS IT TO YANG.

145
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,265
I HAVEN'T HAD
A CARDIAC CASE IN AGES.

146
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,398
IT'S MY FATHER.
IT'S NOT A CASE.
I GUESS THERE'S
A DOUBLE STANDARD NOW.

147
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,399
(Izzie)
YANG DOES SOMETHING WRONG,

148
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,824
AND SHE GETS REWARDED.
THAT'S FAIR.
YEAH.

149
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,507
IF YOU THUMB SUCKERS
DON'T STOP WHINING,

150
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,950
I SWEAR I WON'T SHOW YOU
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR,

151
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:59,885
AND TRUST ME, YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR.

152
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:06,468
EXCUSE ME, DOCTORS, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES.

153
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,054
HE'S GOTTA PEE. EVERY FIVE
MINUTES, HE'S GOTTA PEE.

154
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:11,811
A SMALL BLADDER.
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS
ANY LONGER.

155
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,907
YOU? I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO
PUT UP WITH YOUR WHINING.

156
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,115
LIKE THE WHINING
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW?

157
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,896
NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU THINKS
THAT YANG GOT THE BETTER CASE?

158
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,488
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

159
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,570
JAKE AND PETER WEITZMAN,

160
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:42,698
35-YEAR-OLD PYGOPAGUS
CONJOINED TWINS

161
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:45,089
ATTACHED AT
THE LUMBOSACRAL JUNCTION.

162
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,776
BUT NOT FOR LONG,
RIGHT, DR. WEBBER?

163
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,647
THE WEITZMANS CAME
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

164
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,184
FOR A SEPARATION PROCEDURE.

165
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:52,504
THEY OPTED OUT
BECAUSE OF THE RISK.
PETE CHICKENED OUT.

166
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:55,246
WELL, FORGIVE ME FOR WANTING
TO LIVE LONGER,

167
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,750
EVEN IF IT MEANT
LIVING WITH YOU.

168
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,239
YEAH? WELL, YOU WASTED
SIX MONTHS OF OUR LIVES...
OH, COME ON.

169
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,453
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STOP IT.

170
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:01,718
YOU GUYS CAME BACK
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

171
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,733
WE JUST SCORED NEW YORK'S
TOP PLASTIC SURGEON.

172
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,039
(Richard) MARK SLOAN, PLASTICS,
AND YOU REMEMBER DR. SHEPHERD,

173
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,631
YOUR NEUROSURGEON.
(Derek) JAKE.

174
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:11,469
WE, UH, WE USED TO WORK
AS A TEAM, ACTUALLY.
PETE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

175
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:12,987
WE WORKED TOGETHER. WE WERE
NEVER ACTUALLY A TEAM.

176
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:14,235
(Jake) I HEAR YA.
MR. WEITZMAN?

177
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,883
CALL ME JAKE.
CALL ME PETE.

178
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,769
JAKE, PETE, UM, WHY--
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING WHY NOW

179
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,150
WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE PROCEDURE
WAS TOO RISKY SIX MONTHS AGO?

180
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,077
WELL--
GUYS.

181
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:25,885
WHOA.

182
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,738
THAT'S A LOT OF DOCTORS.

183
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,641
I'M--I'M JUST GONNA
COME BACK LATER.

184
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,393
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
ELENA, COME IN, COME IN.

185
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,864
YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHY NOW.
THIS IS WHY--

186
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,264
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE--
ELENA.

187
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:39,224
JAKE, DON'T--I-I TOLD HIM
NOT TO DO THIS,

188
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,199
NOT FOR ME ANYWAY,
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

189
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,350
'CAUSE PETE SAID THAT
THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED.

190
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,126
THEY COULD END UP DEAD.

191
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:47,776
WHAT DO YOU TELL HER
THINGS LIKE THAT FOR?

192
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,832
<i>I WASN'T TELLING HER.
I WAS TELLING YOU.</i>

193
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,347
SHE JUST HAPPENS TO BE
THE ONLY ONE WHO LISTENS TO ME.

194
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:53,422
SHE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT.

195
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,187
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE TO BE STUCK

196
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,875
TO THE SAME PERSON--
HERE WE GO.

197
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,048
EVERY--THAT'S RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE--

198
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,942
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
HAVE TO BE WITH THE SAME PERSON

199
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,552
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY,

200
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,615
TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S JUST YOURS,

201
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,193
NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
ON YOUR OWN?

202
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,847
WELL, NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO
LIVE LIKE THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PETE?

203
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,606
I THINK, WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
ATTACHED TO SOMEONE

204
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,279
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE
ATTACHED TO ME?

205
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,333
(Alex) I'M CALLING IT.
IT'S MINE.

206
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,237
I HAVE TWO BROTHERS.
I FEEL THEIR PAIN.

207
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:26,612
I WOULD BE GREAT
AT WATCHING THIS.
ZIP IT, ALL OF YOU.

208
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,935
WE'RE ON THE CASE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,687
YES!
AWESOME.

210
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,403
STEVENS, YOU ARE TO--

211
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,455
LOOK AND NOT TOUCH OR SPEAK
OR BREATHE. I GOT IT.

212
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,990
SO THIS IS
THE CRACK TEAM, HUH?

213
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,036
FEEL FREE TO TAKE ONE.
HOW ABOUT I TAKE THE ONE

214
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,460
THAT DOESN'T TOUCH
OR SPEAK OR BREATHE?
(whispers) RIGHT.

215
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,315
DAMN IT.

216
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,285
THANK YOU...
FOR PICKING ME.

217
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,337
EVEN JUST OBSERVING
WOULD BE--

218
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:49,267
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE FUN
TO LOOK AT WHILE I WORK.

219
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,098
WILL YOU BE WORKING ON
BOTH THE NERVE GRAFT

220
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,387
AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION?

221
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,826
YES, AND I THINK I'LL
HANDLE THEM A WHOLE LOT BETTER

222
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,041
WITH A LITTLE CAFFEINE
IN MY SYSTEM.

223
00:09:57,105 --> 00:10:00,329
GET ME A BLUEBERRY SCONE,
A BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO

224
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,849
AND A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF.

225
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,347
THERE'S A CAFETERIA
ON THE SECOND FLOOR

226
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:09,382
AND A COFFEE CART
IN THE LOBBY.
FEISTY.

227
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:10,817
CAPPUCCINO.

228
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,154
YOU CAN KICK ME BACK TO BAILEY
IF YOU WANT. I DON'T DO COFFEE.

229
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:17,469
SO HOW WILL YOU BE HANDLING
THE NERVE GRAFT

230
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:18,854
AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION?

231
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:21,096
CONJOINED TWINS, DEREK.

232
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:22,745
(Derek) I KNOW, CHIEF.

233
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:26,984
CONJOINED ADULT TWINS.
MM-HMM.

234
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,081
I MEAN, IT'S RARE ENOUGH
TO SEPARATE CONJOINED INFANTS.

235
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,867
BUT CONJOINED ADULTS?
MM-HMM.

236
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,338
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PRESS,
WHAT A SURGERY LIKE THIS

237
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:35,638
COULD DO FOR THIS HOSPITAL?

238
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,625
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.

239
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,161
THEIR SPINES ARE FUSED TOGETHER
FROM THE L4 DOWN.

240
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:43,050
THEIR BLOOD FLOW
IS INTRICATELY CONNECTED.

241
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:45,242
THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED,
OR EVEN DEAD.

242
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:50,425
YOUR PATIENTS WANT
THIS OPERATION, DEREK.

243
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:52,552
WHY ARE YOU BACKING OUT?

244
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,105
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU.

245
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,857
UNLESS THERE'S
INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE

246
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:59,650
THAT THIS SURGERY CAN'T BE DONE,
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD.

247
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,171
YOUR FATHER'S NOT HERE.

248
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,039
THATCHER'S AT HARVARD MED
VISITING LEXIE.

249
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,562
WE THOUGHT WE HAD
A LOT OF TIME.

250
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,433
I MEAN, MOLLY'S ONLY
36 WEEKS,

251
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,805
AND DR. MONTGOMERY'S BEEN
TRYING TO STOP THE CONTRACTIONS,

252
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,270
BUT I GUESS THE BABY
IS READY TO COME OUT.

253
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,490
WELL, DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING ELSE OR...

254
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,222
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I COULD USE
AN INTERN FOR THIS.

255
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,954
CAN YOU ASK DR. BAILEY
FOR SOMEONE?

256
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:26,259
UH... I'LL DO IT.

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,404
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

258
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:30,555
OKAY.

259
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,305
IT'LL BE SO NICE TO HAVE
A FAMILIAR FACE

260
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,563
IN THE OPERATING ROOM.

261
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,622
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

262
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,079
IT'S MY JOB TO BE HERE, SO...

263
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,966
UH, DOES MOLLY KNOW
WHO I AM?

264
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:43,863
SHE DOESN'T.

265
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,662
I WANTED TO TELL HER,
BUT YOUR FATHER...

266
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,358
HE JUST--HE--
NO, IT'S--IT'S BETTER.

267
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,965
IT'S BETTER THAT SHE
NOT KNOW. IT'S GOOD.

268
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,109
SO I THINK, UH, MOLLY SHOULD
BE READY IN THE O.R.

269
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,261
SUSAN, YOU'LL NEED SCRUBS
AND A CAP.

270
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:57,980
I'M ABOUT TO BE
A GRANDMOTHER.

271
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:01,236
YES, IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR,
YOU WILL BE A GRANDMOTHER.

272
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,099
OH, MY. OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

273
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,082
HERE WE GO.

274
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,585
HERE WE GO.

275
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,349
WE'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING
YOUR AORTIC VALVE

276
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:10,890
WITH A PORCINE VALVE.

277
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:12,643
WELL, GEORGIE SAYS
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

278
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:14,715
HE SAYS THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

279
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,763
BESIDES, IF YOU DIE,
I'LL KILL YOU.

280
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:19,656
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY.

281
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,377
WE NOTICED YOU HAD A LOT
OF IRREGULAR HEART RHYTHMS

282
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,597
THIS MORNING.
DID YOU CHECK HIS DIG LEVEL?

283
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,764
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

284
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,332
THIS MORNING HIS POTASSIUM
WAS A BORDERLINE LOW.

285
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:32,523
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A HANDLE
ON THINGS HERE.
OH, I'M SURE YOU DO.

286
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,403
UH, GEORGE, I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD STEP OUTSIDE.

287
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,850
LIKE THAT.
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME
OH, SHE'S WAKING UP
THE BABY.

288
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,547
RONNY, SHUT UP.
BE CAREFUL, DR. HAHN,
HE MIGHT START CRYING.

289
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:47,337
<i>I SAID SHUT UP.
ALL RIGHT,
YOU ARE OUT OF HERE.</i>

290
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,401
NO, I'M NOT.

291
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,680
GEORGIE.
NO, UH, SHE CAN'T
KICK ME OUT.

292
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,352
SHE HAS NO RIGHT.
I HIREHEHER.

293
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,704
I'M STAYING.

294
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,959
(Addison)
HOW YOU DOING THERE, MOLLY?

295
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,622
OKAY. I'M JUST EXCITED
TO SEE MY GIRL.

296
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,647
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER

297
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,047
IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

298
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,800
A LITTLE MORE TRACTION, PLEASE?
DR. GREY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
(woman) VITALS ARE
HOLDING STEADY.

299
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,125
CAN YOU SEE HER YET?
(chuckles) NO.

300
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,580
I'M NOT GONNA LOOK
UNTIL THE BLOOD'S ALL GONE.

301
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,245
OKAY. YOU WANT TO CUT
THE CORD, DR. GREY?

302
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:22,647
@@
(woman) THE WARMER IS READY
WHEN YOU NEED IT,

303
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,044
DR. MONTGOMERY.

304
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,523
DR. GREY,
WILL YOU FOLLOW ME?

305
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,427
DR. KNOX, WILL YOU
CLOSE FOR ME, PLEASE?

306
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:31,907
BAG VALVE MASK.

307
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,474
WE HAVE TO STABILIZE THIS BABY
AND GET IT INTO SURGERY.

308
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:36,243
(woman) GET HER ON THE MONITOR.
THE PULSE IS WEAK.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

309
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,624
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
SUSAN, I NEED YOU TO STAND BACK
AND STAY WITH MOLLY, PLEASE.

310
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:42,683
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
(woman) NO RESPONSE TO
STIMULATION. LET'S TRY SUCTION.

311
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:44,091
(Addison) GREY, YOU WANT TO
TALK HER THROUGH THIS?

312
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,910
GR, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE.

313
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,103
THE BABY IS NOT BREATHING.

314
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,558
(Molly) WHAT?

315
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,422
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

316
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,126
YOU LEFT ME HANGING
IN THERE, GREY.

317
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,589
I'M SORRY. I WAS...
I'M SORRY.

318
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,460
DO YOU NEED ME
TO SCRUB IN ON THE BABY?

319
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,292
NO. I WANT YOU TO KEEP
MOLLY AND HER MOTHER

320
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,476
APPRISED OF THE BABY'S CONDITION
WHILE I OPERATE.

321
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,115
I'M SURE
THEY'D RATHER TALK TO YOU.

322
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:21,228
THE BABY'S GOT JEJUNAL ATRESIA.
SHE MAY DIE.

323
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,542
I GOT CONSENT, BUT I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR UPDATES.

324
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,428
I THINK I WOULD
REALLY LEARN A LOT

325
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,826
FROM OBSERVING
THIS PROCEDURE.
NO, IT WAS A MISTAKE

326
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,867
TO LET YOU IN THE O.R. WITH

IN YOUR LIFE, DR. O'MALLEY?
NONE.

NONE. AND HOW MANY
VALVE REPLACEMENTS DO YOU THINK

331
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:42,698
DR. HAHN HAS PERFORMED?
THAT IS MY FATHER!

332

AS HIS SON.

EVERYTHING OKAY

IS PROVING TO BE

343
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:12,612
AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE ASSET.

I HEAR SHE STUDIED UNDER YOU.
YOU TRAINED HER WELL.
YES.

I HAVE NOT YELLED.

I HAVE NOT YELLED

359
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:04,179
BECAUSE YOU WERE A GUY
IN TROUBLE,

360
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,602
AND I WAS SUPPORTING YOU.

361
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:09,417
BUT NOW...
I AM YELLING!

362
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:10,217
CHIEF.

363
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,203
I AM YELLING
VERY LOUDLY!

00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:15,065
I WANT TO RETIRE, BURKE!
I WANT MY WIFE BACK!

00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,651
AND I PASSED
THE TORCH TO YOU!

366
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,627
I PASSED THE TORCH TO YOU,
AND YOU BLEW IT OUT!

367
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,808
LOOK, I KNOW
I LET YOU DOWN.

368
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,841
I'M TIRED.

369

I'M TIRED OF YOU MEN

00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,126
YOU LET ME DOWN.

371
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:43,007
AND IF YOU DON'T LET DEREK
FIX THAT HAND,

372
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,773
YOU'RE LETTING YOURSELF DOWN.

373
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,918
22 SURGEONS--

374
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,131
IT TAKES 22 SURGEONS
TO DO THIS.

375
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:57,771
SO WHERE ARE WE?

376
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,876

OF THE PERINEAL FLOOR.

379
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,305
I'LL BE HARVESTING
THE SURAL NERVE FOR TRANSFER.

TO THESE NERVES ARE GONE.
I'I'M PRETTY SURE

383
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,732
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH NERVE TO
TRANSFER AND COVER THE DEFICITS.

384
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,388
WE CAN DEFINITELY DO THIS.

385
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,307
OH, DAMN IT.

386
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,120
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE
FRAGILE IN THE BODY.

387
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,298
IT'S ONE THING IF THIS IS
A LIFE-OR-DEH SITUATION

388
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,434

TO SAVE THEM.

389
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,705
BUT THESE GUYS ARE FINE.

390
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,369

NO, I'M NOT.

493
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,475
YOU'VE BEEN PICKING FIGHTS
EVERY CHANCE YOU GET,

494
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:11,508
AND THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

495
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:15,099
DAD... YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

496
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:16,842
OKAY, THEN TELL ME.

497
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:19,955
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD
AT DR. TORRES?

498
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,610
I SHOULD GO.
I HAVE PATIENTS TO SEE.
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

499
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,507
I'M GONNA GO.

500
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:25,283
NO! EVERYBODY STAYS.

501
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:30,873
YOU'RE ANGRY, GEORGIE...

502
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,752
AT CALLIE, AT YOUR BROTHERS,
AT DR. HAHN,

503
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:38,048
AT DR. BAILEY, AT DR. YANG,
AT DR. BURKE.

504
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:42,895
THAT'S A LONG LIST
OF PEOPLE TO BE ANGRY AT.

505
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:47,342
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PERSON
YOU'RE REALLY ANGRY AT...

506
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,518
IS ME.

507
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:50,877
DAD?

508
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:54,821
I-I DRINK AND I SMOKE

509
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,238
AND I DON'T EXERCISE

510
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,557
AND I EAT
ALL THE WRONG THINGS,

511
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:01,020
AND NOW I HAVE CANCER.

512
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,875
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

513
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:07,620
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF ME.

514
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,091
I DON'T MIND.

515
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,593
YOU DO.

516
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,041
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

517
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:23,946
AND THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE I'M MAD AT ME, TOO.

518
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:27,041
YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE
AND LEAVE MY BOY IN CHARGE?

519
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,696
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

520
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:40,640
WHAT'S GOING ON?

521
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,558
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN HERE, GEORGIE.

522
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,414
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA GET
IN TROUB, GEORGIE.

523
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:45,767
GEORGIE DOESN'T WORK HERE!

524
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,278
IN THIS HOSPITAL,
MY NAME IS DR. O'MALLEY!

525
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:51,196
DR. O'MALLEY...
(struggles for breath)
DAD.

526
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:53,475
(monitor beeping erratically)
HONEY!
DAD.

527
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,515
I-I CAN'T...
DAD, DAD,
DON'T TRY TO TALK.

528
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,145
(Louise) HE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK, GEORGIE!
WHY DON'T YOPUMP HIS CHEST?

529
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,969
THEY ALWAYS USE THE PADDLES!
GET THE PADDLES!
HE'S NOT HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

530
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,441
DAD. DAD, STOP!

531
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:08,729
I'M TRYING TO HELP.
YOUR HEART'S GOI TOO FAST.

532
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:09,848
RECYCLE HIS B.P.

533
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,976
UH, PULL, UH, VERAPAMIL,
5 MILLIGRAMS.

534
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,055
DAD. DAD!
STOP FIGHTING THE MASK.

535
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,137
O'MALLEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU SHOULD'VE PAGED HAHN.

536
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,290
I PAGED ANYONE
FROM CARDIOTHORACICS.

537
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:22,056
HE'S GOT A-FIB
WITH RAPID VENTRICLE RESPONSE.

538
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,651
I'VE ORDERED VERAPAMIL.
HE'S IN V-TACH.

539
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,326
THE VERAPAMIL IS GONNA CAUSE
MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES.

540
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,065
100 LIDOCAINE.
UH, PUT ON HIS 0-2 MASK.

541
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:44,848
(Erica) ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED?

542
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,192
HE WENT INTO V-TACH. O'MALLEY
IS GIVING HIM LIDOCAINE.

543
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,975
IT'S ALREADY PUT HIM
BACK IN, UH, NORMAL SINUS.

544
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,741
ALL RIGHT,
I NEED EVERYONE OUT OF HERE.

545
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:12,173
I GOT YOUR PAGE.
I NEED ANOTHER CAPPUCCINO.

546
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,508
DID YOU THINK
I WAS KIDDING BEFORE?

547
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:16,979
I AM YOUR ATTENDING,

548
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,115
AND IF YOU WANT IN
ON MY SURGERIES,

549
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:22,243
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
HOW TO FETCH AND STAY

550
00:25:22,763 --> 00:25:24,170
AND HEEL.

551
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,173
FINE.

552
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,172
DON'T FETCH ANGRY.

553
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,772
IF YOU THINK THIS MEANS
I RESPECT YOU,

554
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:32,460
IF YOU WANT ME
TO RESPECT YOU,

555
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:34,435
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
WORTH RESPECTING.

556
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:38,790
(Derek) ALL OF THESE CABLES
OF NERVES...

557
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:39,922
AH...

558
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:43,948
I CAN'T DO THIS SURGERY,
MIRANDA. IT'S--MNH-MNH.

559
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:49,188
I STARTED TO THINK
I SHOULDN'T BE OPERATING

560
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,422
ALL THE WHISPERS
AND THE TALK...

561
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,583
I LET THAT IN.

562
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,693
MM.

563
00:25:56,797 --> 00:25:59,869
I STARTED
TO QUESTION MYSELF.

564
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,484
I BELIEVED IT
WHEN I WAS TOLD, UH,

565
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:05,517
I WAS NO LONGER OF USE
IN THE O.R.

566
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,316
OH, SO WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WANTED JUSTICE,

567
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:09,348
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT--
I'M A SURGEON.

568
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:10,994
UH-HUH.
THERE ARE LIVES IN MY HANDS.

569
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,130
TO MAKE ME QUESTION THAT...

570
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,490
NO, THAT'S TO PUT
A LIFE AT STAKE

571
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,401
EVERY TIME I HOLD A SCALPEL.

572
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,887
WELL, I TOLD BURKE
I COULD FIX HIS HAND,

573
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:28,974
AND THEN...

574
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,096
WELL, YOU DID.
YEAH.

575
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:31,477
HE IS NOT PARALYZED

576
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,814
OR--OR DISABLED
IN ANY WAY.

577
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,966
HE HAS A TREMOR.

578
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:36,997
AND IF HE HAD BEEN HONEST
ABOUT THAT,

579
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:39,837
WELL, THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE

580
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,572
TO PREVENT IT.
MM-HMM.

581
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:43,212
WE CAN DO THIS.

582
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:48,739
HOLD ON TO MY WEDDING RING,
HONEY.

583
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:50,075
HOSPITAL RULES.

584
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:53,867
GEORGIE, ARE YOU GONNA
BE THERE IN THE OPERATION?

585
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:56,642
THEY DON'T ALLOW FAMILY IN,
BUT YOU'LL BE FINE.

586
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:58,058
I'LL BE FINE.

587
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,537
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOU.

588
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:07,656
(Louise)
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

589
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:09,895
(sobs) WHAT AM I GONNA DO
IF HE DIES?

590
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:18,175
I CHANGED MY  MIND.

591
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,406
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

592
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,750
DR. BAILEY, I'D LIKE TO BE
EXCUSED FROM THE TWINS

593
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:22,712
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU.

594
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,613
I'D LIKE TO BE
WITH MY MOM.

595
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:25,493
THAT'S THE RIGHT CALL,
O'MALLEY. GO.

596
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,878
PROMISE ME SOMETHING--
WHEN YOU SEPARATE US,

597
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:32,245
CAN YOU MAKE SURE HIS ASS
IS BIGGER THAN MINE?

598
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:34,481
I CAN HEAR YOU.

599
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,158
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

600
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,941
I WENT TO N.I.C.U.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE DONE.

601
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,668
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THIS ANASTOMOSIS,

602
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:43,500
AND I STILL HAVE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THE DISTAL BOWEL.

603
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:45,675
WHAT SHOULD I TELL MOLLY?
I DON'T KNOW.

604
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,179
TELL HER I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

605
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,361
I DON'T KNOW.

606
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,577
(Mark) DR. BAILEY,

607
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,696
I'D LIKE MY INTERN TO OBSERVE
FROM A BETTER VANTAGE POINT.

608
00:27:58,632 --> 00:27:59,888
DR. STEVENS?

609
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,064
<i>YES.
SHE'S MY INTERN TODAY,</i>

610
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:03,544
AND I'D LIKE HER NEARBY
DURING SURGERY,

611
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:07,679
<i>NOT UP IN THE GALLERY,
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
NO PROBLEM.</i>

612
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:10,800
DR. BAILEY, STEVENS IS
WITHOUT PRIVILEGES.

613
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:12,471
OH, 'CAUSE SHE MESSED UP?

614
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:15,807
DR. YANG MESSED UP, AND SHE'S
OVER IN O.R. TWO RIGHT NOW.

615
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,078
WILL YOU HIT THAT FOR ME?

616
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,854
STEVENS, I TAKE IT
YOU REMEMBER HOW TO SCRUB IN.

617
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,228
COME ON.

618
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,890
(Derek) THIS VESSEL'S
EVEN MORE FRAGILE

619
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:31,288
THAN IN THE BIOMODEL.
(Richard) HMM.

620
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,646
LET'S DO A MICROVASCULAR
BYPASS GRAFT.

621
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,130
I COULD HARVEST THE SAPHENOUS
VEIN WHILE I'M DOWN HERE.

622
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:37,648
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

623
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:39,491
GENTLEMEN, WE NEED
TO MAKE A DECISION,

624
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,916
AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT NOW.

625
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,978
DEREK, IT'S YOUR CALL.

626
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:47,586
DO YOU OR DON'T YOU
WANT TO PROCEED?

627
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:00,584
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A 10-BLADE.

628
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:03,889
(Richard) LET'S GET SOME
SUCTION IN HERE, PLEASE.

629
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:12,349
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

630
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,004
ME EITHER.

631
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:17,642
HOW'S IT GOING?

632
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,902
THEY JUST STARTED.

633
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,759
(Erica) THE SKIN INCISION
IS DONE.

634
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,451
LET'S GO.

635
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:42,818
SHE'S...
THROUGH THE STERNUM.

636
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,092
THERE'S A BIT
OF BLEEDING.

637
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,027
SHE'S STOPPING IT
WITH BONE WAX.

638
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,786
INSERTING THE RETRACTOR...

639
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:52,699
SHE'S OPENING

640
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,713
THE PERICARDIAL SAC.

641
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:58,533
TAKING A LOOK
AT THE ECHO,

642
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,888
SHE'S NODDING.

643
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,321
LOOKS GOOD.

644
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:07,058
THEY'RE LOOKING AT
YOUR DAD'S HEART NOW.

645
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,673
SHE'S PREPARING TO PUT IN
THE STAY SUTURES.

646
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:27,148
IS THE SAPHENOUS VEIN
GRAFT IN PLACE?

647
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,933
(Mark) YEAH.
YEAH, I'M READY.
DR. BAILEY?

648
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:30,115
I'M GOOD.
CHIEF?

649
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,219
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

650
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,386
ALL RIGHT,
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

651
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,696
REMOVING THE CLAMPS.

652
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,255
CHECK THE NERVE STIMULATOR.

653
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,005
S.S.E.P.ARE FALLING.

654
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:45,032
ALL RIGHT,
PUMP UP THE BLOOD PRESSURE.

655
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,866
WE NEED AS MUCBLOOD THROUGH
THE AREA AS POSSIBLE.

656
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,554
(Miranda)
I'M GOING UP TO 2 MILLIAMPS.

657
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,178
UP TO 3.

658
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,042
(Richard) WAIT A MINUTE.
UH, I SEE SOMETHING.

659
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,457
A FLICKER ON THE HAMSTRING
OF TWIN "A."

660
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,777
(Mark) ANYTHING ON TWIN "B"?

661
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,377
PUMP IT UP SOME MORE.
OKAY, UP TO 4.

662
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,504
A TWITCH. I GOT A TWITCH
ON TWIN B's GASTROC.

663
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:09,266
YEAH, IT'S SMALL,
BUT IT'S THERE.
WE HAVE A SIGNAL.

664
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,118
CONGRATULATIONS,
LADIES AND GENTLEM.

665
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,680
WE HAVE FOUR FUNCTIONING LEGS.

666
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:25,118
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ON THREE.

667
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,038
ONE...

668
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,820
TWO...

669
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,093
THREE.

670
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:44,825
IT'D BE NICE
IF EVERY LOVE TRIANGLE

671
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:46,153
COULD BE FIXED WITH A SCALPEL.

672
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,877
IF THEY COULD, YOU'D HAVE
STABBED ME WITH A 10-BLADE

673
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,283
A LONG TIME AGO. (ughs)
(laughs)

674
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,700
BYE. HOW IS SHE?

675
00:31:58,244 --> 00:31:59,395
PLEASE TELL ME GOOD NEWS

676
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:01,145
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO IN
AND TELL MOLLY,

677
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,922
AND I DON'T WANT TO TELL HER
ANYTHING BAD.

678
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,353
DR. MONTMERY IS ON HER WAY,
AND SHE WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

679
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,953
BUT THE BABY--
LAURA.

680
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,504
MOLLY NAMED HER LAURA.

681
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,608
OH, LAURA--WILL NEED
SOME RECOVERY TIME,

682
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,095
BUT SHE SHOULD BE
JUST FINE.

683
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:18,280
OH, THANK YOU.

684
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,822
OH, I WAS SO SCARED.
(laughs)

685
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,479
OH, THANK YOU. OH, GOD.

686
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:24,749
SHE'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY
TO HEAR THIS.

687
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,542
HEY, THIS IS YOUR NIEC
YOU KNOW?

688
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:31,646
I'M SORRY.

689
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,269
YOU'RE VERY NICE.

690
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:36,724
YOU BOTH SEEM...
SO NICE.

691
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:41,299
BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU.

692
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,363
AND YOU ARE NOT MY FAMILY.

693
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,616
I'M CLOSING THE AORTOTOMY.
WHAT'S NEXT?

694
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,488
PLACE THE NEEDLE
IN THE ASCENDING AORTA

695
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:05,328
TO REMOVE AIR AND THEN RELEASE
THE AORTIC VALVE CLAMP.

696
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,520
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS AN INTERN.

697
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:11,391
I DO?

698
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,062
FOCUSED, INTENSE...

699
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,721
COLD--AND I DON'T MEAN THAT
AS A BAD THING.

700
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,929
COLD IS GOOD.

701
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,883
THE DATING, THE FRIENDS,
THE FAMILY--

702
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:21,156
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S ALL OVERRATED.

703
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,649
(Erica)
ALL RIGHT, TUBES ARE OUT.

704
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:28,417
OH, THE ASCENDING AORTA
IS LOOKING DILATED.

705
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:30,223
(Erica)
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLEEDING

706
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:33,363
AROUND THE AORTIC SUTURE LINE.
B.P. IS 68 OVER 42.

707
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:34,652
GOD...

708
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,169
(woman) HE'S BRADYING DOWN.

709
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:41,241
GET ME ANOTHER T.E.E.
AND AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM, STAT.

710
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,849
LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE.
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

711
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,791
WE GOTTA GET CONTROL
OF THIS BLEEDING.

712
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,151
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM
BACK ON BYPASS.

713
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:57,151
I COULD PUT THE AORTIC CANNULA
INTO HIS RIGHT ATRIUM.
BY YOURSELF?

714
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,406
YES.

715
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,622
ALL RIGHT, DO IT.

716
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,014
REPLACE IT WITH A 2-STAGE
VENOUS CANNULA.

717
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:09,949
WHY IS SHE DOING THAT?

718
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,581
WH-WHY IS HAHN
LETTING HER DO THAT?

719
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,221
NO, IT'S OKAY. SHE'S DOING
A RUNNING WHIP STITCH.

720
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:15,812
SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE.

721
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,178
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WORK,
DR. YANG.

722
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,929
DR. HAHN'S WORK
WAS IMPECCABLE, O'MALLEY.

723
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,818
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT MYSELF.

724
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:38,448
IT'S JUST, UH...

725
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:41,070
YOU CAN NEVER TELL

726
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,800
HOW THE BODY
IS GOING TO RESPOND.

727
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:46,304
EVERY SURGERY...

728
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,214
EVERY BODY IS DIFFERENT.

729
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:53,926
YOU JUST...

730
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,117
NEVER KNOW.

731
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:00,998
BUT IT'S OKAY NOW.

732
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:02,868
THEY'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH.

733
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:08,788
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

734
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:19,634
(Miranda)
IT UNDERMINES EVERYTHING

735
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:21,521
FOR MY INTERNS TO SEE YANG

736
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,242
GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT,

737
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,969
FOR ME TO SEE BURKE
GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT.

738
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:28,920
TAKE A STEP BACK.

739
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,624
TRY AND GET
SOME PERSPECTIVE.

740
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,913
SO THERE WILL BE
NO CONSEQUENCES,

741
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:34,928
FOR EITHER OF THEM.

742
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,223
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,
FIRE THE BOTH OF THEM,

743
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,831
END THEIR CAREERS?

744
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:42,143
THEY MADE
A TERRIBLE JUDGMENT CALL.

745
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:43,927
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH DENNY DUQUETTE.

746
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,710
AND THEY DIDN'T KILL
ANYBODY.

747
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,453
AND I DID.
YOU DIDN'T KILL DUQUETTE,

748
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:49,926
AND I WON'T HAVE YOU
SAYING YOU DID.

749
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:52,228
I WAS RESPONSIBLEFOR IZZIE STEVENS.

750
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:53,796
I WAS RESPONSIBLE.

751
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,925
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR CRISTINA YANG.

752
00:35:56,317 --> 00:36:01,169
I...
AM THE COMMON THREAD HERE.

753
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:04,499
I... LOST THEM.

754
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,179
CRISTINA, IZZIE--

755
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:08,626
ARE NOT THE SAME.

756
00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:11,569
MIRANDA...

757
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:13,681
YOU RAISE THEM...

758
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:15,945
YOU RAISE THEM LIKE...

759
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,584
LIKE CHILDREN...

760
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,920
AND SOME OF THEM
MAKE MISTAKES

761
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,840
AND SOME OF THEM
DISAPPOINT YOU.

762
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,183
SOME OF THEM...

763
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,349
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF STRENGTH

764
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:31,887
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN YANG
TO COME TO ME,

765
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:35,934
TO REPORT ON AN ATTENDING,
ON HER BOYFRIEND?

766
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:40,029
DO YOU SEE
HOW MUCH SHE'S GROWN?

767
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:45,293
YOU RAISE THEM...

768
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,180
LIKE CHILDREN...

769
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,354
AND SOME OF THEM TURN OUT
EXACTLY LIKE YOU, DR. BAILEY.

770
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,026
WE'RE FINALLY ALONE.

771
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,409
(chuckles) YEAH.

772
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:06,712
PETE?

773
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,776
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

774
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,783
OKAY.

775
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:20,990
ALL RIGHT.

776
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,662
WELL, YOU GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

777
00:37:23,694 --> 00:37:27,486
AND, UH, I'LL, UM,
COME BACK IN THE MORNING.

778
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:35,589
<i>(Meredith) AT THE END
OF THE DAY,</i>

779
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,088
<i>WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,</i>

780
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:43,524
<i>ALL WE REALLY WANT
IS TO BE CLOSE TO SOMEBODY...</i>

781
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,934
COULDN'T STAY AWAY?

782
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,960
<i>SO THIS THING WHERE WE ALL
KEEP OUR DISTANCE</i>

783
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,705
<i>AND PRETEND NOT TO CARE
ABOUT EACH OTHER--</i>

784
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:19,728
<i>IT'S USUALLY A LOT OF BULL.</i>

785
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,463
DID YOU WANT TO COME IN?

786
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,686
NO. UH, I JUST, UH...

787
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,759
SHE'S AY?

788
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:27,437
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

789
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:29,862
GOOD.

790
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:35,616
WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY
IF YOU WANT US.

791
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:37,761
YOU HAVE A MOTHER, I KNOW.

792
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,151
I'M NOT SAYING...

793
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,024
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY, TOO.

794
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,035
<i>SO WE PICK AND CHOOSE
WHO WE WANT TO REMAIN CLOSE TO.</i>

795
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,736
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

796
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,695
(Izzie) WHAT?
LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

797
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,737
LET CRISTINA OFF
THE FREAKIN' HOOK.
MEREDITH...

798
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:09,577
IZZIE,
YOU CUT THE LVAD WIRE.

799
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,656
SHE STUCK BY YOU
AND DID DENNY'S ECHO.

800
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,631
YOU CHEATED ON IZZIE
WITH SYPH NURSE,

801
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,590
AND SHE HELPED YOU STUDY
FOR YOUR BOARDS.

802
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,803
AND, GEORGE, WHEN EVERYBODY
WAS CALLING YOU 007--

803
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,873
<i>SHE WAS CALLING ME 007.</i>

804
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:32,045
JUST LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

805
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,221
IT'S OKAY.

806
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:44,891
SORRY.

807
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,985
WHY CAN'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

808
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,754
YOU KNOW,
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

809
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,849
YOU'RE MY SISTER.
YOU'RE MY FAMILY.

810
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,265
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT.

811
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:04,519
<i>AND ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN
THOSE PEOPLE...</i>

812
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:07,423
I'M SO TIRED.

813
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,919
I KNOW. ME, TOO.

814
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:13,087
<i>WE TEND TO STICK CLOSE BY...</i>

815
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:19,070
UH, I WAS--I JUST--

816
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,117
I WANTED TO CHECK ON YOUR DAD
AND SEE HOW HE WAS DOING.

817
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:23,142
GOOD. HE'S RESTING,
BUT HE'S GOOD.

818
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,516
OKAY.

819
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,604
OKAY.

820
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:34,631
<i>NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE HURT THEM.</i>

821
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:39,110
HEY.

822
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:40,262
(Derek) HI THERE.

823
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,117
I'M GONNA GO BACK UPSTAIRS
WITH DR. BURKE.

824
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,342
HE WANTS ME TO TAKE
A LOOK AT HIS SHOULDER.

825
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:49,108
I'M GONNA BE A WHILE.
DON'T WAIT UP, OKAY?
OKAY.

826
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,076
<i>THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
STILL WITH YOU</i>

827
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:52,364
<i>AT THE END OF THE DAY...</i>

828
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,979
<i>THOSE ARE THE ONES
WORTH KEEPING.</i>

829
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:05,288
<i>AND SURE, SOMETIMES CLOSE
CAN BE TOO CLOSE...</i>

830
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:06,402
I COULDN'T STAY
