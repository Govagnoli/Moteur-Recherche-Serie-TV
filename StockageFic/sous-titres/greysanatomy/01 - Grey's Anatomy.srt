1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,635
[Woman] The game:

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,435
They say a person either
has what it takes to play

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,305
or they don't.

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,676
My mother was one of the greats.

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,649
Me, on the other hand...
I'm kind of screwed.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,591
[Grunts]

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,100
[Man] This is, uh...

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,538
Humiliating on so many levels.

9
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,802
You have to go.

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,970
Why don't you come back here,
and we'll pick up where we left off?

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,105
No, seriously. You have to go. I'm late.

12
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,810
Which isn't what you want to be
on your first day of work, so...

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,512
So, uh, you actually live here.

14
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,417
- No.
- Oh.

15
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,889
- Yes. Kind of.
- Oh.

16
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,693
It's nice. A little dusty,

17
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,559
odd, but it's nice. [laughs]

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,599
So, how do you kind of live here?

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,124
I moved two weeks ago from Boston.
It was my mother's house.

20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,330
- I'm selling it.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,838
For what?

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,999
You said "was."

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,043
Oh, my mother's not dead.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,874
She's... You know what?
We don't have to do the thing.

25
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,107
Oh, we can do anything you want.

26
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,083
No, the thing: Exchange
the details, pretend we care.

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,051
I'm gonna go take a shower,

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,716
and when I get back down here,
you won't be here, so, um...

29
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,420
Goodbye, um...

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,523
- Derek.
- Derek.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,464
- Right. Meredith.
- Meredith.

32
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,059
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Nice meeting you.

33
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,538
Bye, Derek.

34
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,633
[Rilo Kiley: Portions For Foxes]

35
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,555
[Man] Each of you
comes here today hopeful,

36
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,993
wanting in on the game.

37
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,897
A month ago, you were
in med school being taught by doctors.

38
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,730
Today...

39
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,464
...you are the doctors.

40
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,267
The seven years you spend here
as a surgical resident

41
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,470
will be the best and worst of your life.

42
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,672
You will be pushed
to the breaking point.

43
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,683
Look around you.
Say hello to your competition.

44
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,345
Eight of you will switch
to an easier specialty.

45
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,320
Five will crack under the pressure.

46
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,789
Two of you will be asked to leave.

47
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,419
This is your starting line.
This is your arena.

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,692
How well you play,

49
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,993
that's up to you.

50
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,762
[Thinking] Like I said...

51
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,634
...I'm screwed.

52
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,281
OK, Martin, Robinson, Bond, Hawkins.

53
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,624
Only six women out of 20.

54
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,718
Yeah. I hear one of them's a model.

55
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,162
Seriously, that's gonna help
with the respect thing?

56
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,326
- You're Cristina, right?
- [Man] Patton, Monroe...

57
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,893
Which resident are you assigned to?
I got Bailey.

58
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,634
- The Nazi? Me too.
- You got the Nazi? So did I.

59
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,869
At least we'll
be tortured together, right?

60
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,378
I'm George O'Malley.

61
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,244
Uh, we met at the, uh, mixer.

62
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,578
You had on a black dress

63
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,483
with a slit up the side,
strappy sandals and...

64
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,316
Now you think I'm gay.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,789
No, I'm not gay.

66
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,383
It's... it's just that, uh, you were...

67
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,691
You were very unforgettable.

68
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,062
[Man] O'Malley, Yang, Grey, Stevens.

69
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,930
And I'm totally forgettable.

70
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,436
- Bailey?
- [Man] End of the hall.

71
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,598
That's the Nazi?

72
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,767
[George] I thought
the Nazi would be a guy.

73
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,778
I thought the Nazi would be a Nazi.

74
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,542
Maybe it's professional jealousy.
She's brilliant

75
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,016
and they call her a Nazi
because they're jealous.

76
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,213
- Maybe she's nice.
- Let me guess. You're the model.

77
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,757
Hi, I'm Isobel Stevens,
but everyone calls me lzzie.

78
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,518
I have five rules. Memorize them.

79
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,688
Rule number one:
Don't bother sucking up.

80
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,891
I hate you. That's not gonna change.

81
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,491
Trauma protocol, phone list, pagers,

82
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,059
nurses will page you.

83
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,072
You will answer every page at a run.
A run!

84
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,108
That's rule number two.

85
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,440
Your first shift starts now
and lasts 48 hours.

86
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,377
You're interns, grunts, nobodies,

87
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,347
bottom of the surgical food chain.

88
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,044
You run labs, write orders,
work every second night

89
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,053
until you drop, and don't complain.

90
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,351
On-call rooms. Attendings hog them.

91
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,915
Sleep when you can where you can,
which brings me to rule number three.

92
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,326
If I'm sleeping, don't wake me
unless your patient is dying.

93
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,560
Rule four: The dying patient
better not be dead when I get there.

94
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,899
Not only will you have killed someone,
you woke me for no reason. We clear?

95
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,233
[Bailey] Yes?

96
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,706
You said five rules. That was only four.

97
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,265
[Pager beeping]

98
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,573
Rule number five:
When I move, you move.

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,114
Get out of my way!

100
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,962
What do we got?

101
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,692
[Man] Katie Bryce, 15-year-old,
new onset seizures,

102
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,495
intermittent for the past week.

103
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,126
IV lost en route,

104
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,603
started grand mal seizing
as we descended.

105
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,640
[Bailey] All right,
get her on her side.

106
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,268
Izzie, 10 milligrams Diazepam IM.

107
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,279
No, no. The white lead is on the right.

108
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,338
Righty, whitey, smoke over fire.

109
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,646
A large-bore IV. Don't let
the blood hemolyze. Let's go!

110
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,051
[Beeping]

111
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,151
- [Man] A wet fish on dry land?
- Absolutely, Dr. Burke.

112
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,093
Dr. Bailey, let's shotgun her.

113
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,825
That means every test in the book:

114
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,527
CT, CBC, chem-7, tox screen.

115
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,628
Cristina, you're on labs.
George, patient work-ups.

116
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,536
Meredith, get Katie for a CT.

117
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,802
She's your responsibility now.

118
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,366
Wait. What about me?

119
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,145
Honey, you get to do rectal exams.

120
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,048
[Jem: They]

121
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,891
What are you doing here?

122
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,797
Katie Bryce's labs came out clear.

123
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,735
There's nothing in the results
that explain her seizures.

124
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,738
OK.

125
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,173
Uh, I heard every year, the
attending on-call picks the best intern

126
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,303
and lets them perform
a procedure during the first shift.

127
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,412
I'm just saying it's what I heard.

128
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,246
Go away... now.

129
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,013
- Yeah, sounds good.
- He'll be fine? You'll be fine.

130
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,184
If you don't count the fact
that my bacon days are over, sure.

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,491
So bypass surgery tomorrow
with Dr. Burke. I hear he's good.

132
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,397
And, after that, you can have all the
bacon-flavored soy product you can eat.

133
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,435
Mmm. Kill me now.

134
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,993
I wish I could, but I'm a healer.

135
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,733
[Katie] You're lost.

136
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,677
I'm not lost. How are you feeling?

137
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,543
How do you think I'm feeling?

138
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,549
- I'm missing my pageant.
- You're missing your pageant?

139
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,914
The Spokane Teen Miss.

140
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,510
I was in the top ten
after the first two rounds.

141
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,580
This is my year. I could have won.

142
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,784
Hello.

143
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,192
You're so lost.
What are you, like, new?

144
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,691
OK, so I'm just gonna insert my fingers

145
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,735
into your rectum.

146
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,468
[Inhales sharply]

147
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,107
No.

148
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,175
Out. Out.

149
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,519
Bet you missed a lot
when you first started out.

150
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,449
[Scoffs]

151
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,516
I twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal.

152
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,755
I do rhythmic gymnastics,
which is, like, really cool.

153
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,852
Nobody else does it.

154
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,487
And I tripped over my ribbon.

155
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,056
And I didn't get stuck
with someone this clueless,

156
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,034
and that was, like, a nurse.

157
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,594
You and I are gonna
have so much fun together.

158
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,475
[Chattering]

159
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,137
This shift is a marathon, not a sprint.

160
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,648
- Eat.
- I can't.

161
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,207
You should eat something.

162
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,221
You try eating after performing
17 rectal exams. The Nazi hates me.

163
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,019
The Nazi's a resident.
I have attendings hating me.

164
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,787
You know Meredith is inbred?

165
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,294
Like it's uncommon
to be a doctors' parents...

166
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,297
Royally. Her mother is Ellis Grey.

167
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,662
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

168
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,327
- Who's Ellis Grey?
- The Grey Method.

169
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,302
Where'd you go to med school, Mexico?

170
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,566
She was one of the first
big chick surgeons.

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,803
She's a living legend. Yeah,
she won the Harper Avery twice.

172
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,309
So I didn't know one thing.

173
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,039
Talk about parental pressure.

174
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,549
I'd kill to have Ellis Grey as a mother.
I'd kill to be Ellis Grey.

175
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,345
All I need is one good case.

176
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,885
[Mumbling]

177
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,114
Katie Bryce is a pain in the ass.

178
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:20,124
If I hadn't taken the Hippocratic Oath,
I'd Kevorkian her with my bare hands.

179
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,585
What?

180
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,490
[Burke] Good afternoon, interns.

181
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,224
It's posted, but I thought
I'd share the good news personally.

182
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,670
As you know, the honor
of performing the first surgery

183
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,004
is reserved for the intern
that shows the most promise.

184
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,705
As I'm running the OR today,
I get to make that choice.

185
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,076
- George O'Malley.
- Me?

186
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,485
You'll scrub in for an appendectomy
this afternoon. Congratulations. Enjoy.

187
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,288
Did he say me?

188
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,194
[Bailey] I've seen his file.

189
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,234
George O'Malley barely made
the cut to get in this program.

190
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,496
- He's not your guy.
- He's my guy, all right.

191
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,094
Every year, you pick your guy,

192
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,732
and your guy suffers
more than any other intern.

193
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,969
Terrorize one,
and the rest fall in line.

194
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,444
I get it, I respect it,
but George O'Malley's a puppy.

195
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,775
Katie Bryce, 3604?

196
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,406
- Right there.
- Thank you.

197
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,542
Katie, honey, Mom and Dad are here.

198
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,282
They gave her a sedative for the
CT scan, so she's a little groggy.

199
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,880
[Mother] Will she be all right?

200
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,425
Our doctor said
that she might need an operation.

201
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,619
Is that true?

202
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,685
[Mother] What kind of operation?

203
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,789
She's, um... Well... You know what?

204
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,561
I'm not the doctor.

205
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,798
Um, I'm a doctor,
but I'm not Katie's doctor,

206
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,930
so I'll go get him for you.

207
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,307
- What?
- Katie's parents have questions.

208
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,314
Do you talk to them, or do I ask Burke?

209
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,679
No, Burke's off the case.

210
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,311
Katie belongs to the new attending now,
Dr. Shepherd. He's over there.

211
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,964
Meredith, can I talk to you
for a second?

212
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,300
Actually, I was...

213
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,331
Dr. Shepherd.

214
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,004
Dr. Shepherd?
This morning, it was Derek.

215
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,307
Now it's Dr. Shepherd.

216
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,780
We should pretend it never happened.

217
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,340
What never happened?
You sleeping with me,

218
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,284
or you throwing me out this morning?

219
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,288
Both are memories
I'd like to hold onto.

220
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,517
No, there will be no memories.

221
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,526
I'm not the girl in the bar anymore,
and you're not the guy.

222
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,495
This can't exist. You get that, right?

223
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,828
You took advantage of me,
and you wanna forget.

224
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,698
I was drunk and good-looking.
You took advantage.

225
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,170
OK, I was the one who was drunk,
and you are not that good-looking.

226
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,228
Maybe not today.

227
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,969
Last night, I was good-looking.
Had my red shirt on.

228
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,637
- You took advantage.
- I did not take advantage.

229
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,977
Want to take advantage again?
Friday night?

230
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,072
No.

231
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,912
You're an attending and I'm your intern.

232
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,524
- Stop looking at me like that.
- Like what?

233
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,151
Like you've seen me naked.

234
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,492
Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate.

235
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,330
Has that ever occurred to you?

236
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,290
[Sighs]

237
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,265
Open, identify, ligate,
remove, irrigate, close.

238
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,571
Open, identify, ligate,
remove, irrigate, close.

239
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,976
- He's gonna faint. A fainter.
- No, code brown, right in his pants.

240
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,210
He's about the flop sweat.
He's gonna sweat himself unsterile.

241
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,148
Ten bucks, he messes up the McBurney.

242
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,779
- Fifteen, he cries.
- I'll put 20 on a total meltdown.

243
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,016
Fifty says he pulls the whole thing off.

244
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:43,294
That's one of us down there,
the first one of us.

245
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,091
Where's your loyalty?

246
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,458
75 says he can't even ID the appendix.

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,093
I'll take that action.

248
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,138
OK, O'Malley, let's see what you can do.

249
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,639
Here it comes.

250
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,040
[O.A.O.T. S: Dance]

251
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,443
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

252
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,039
[Cheers, applause]

253
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,982
That Burke is trouble.

254
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,054
More pressure.

255
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,560
The human flesh
is a tough shell. Dig in.

256
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,857
- Pickups.
- Pickups.

257
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,104
- Clamp.

259

I'm there.

260
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,312
Damn, he got the
peritoneum open. I'm out.

261
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,320
I told you. He's gonna pull it off.

262
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,788
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

263
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,264
[Cheers, applause]

264
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,768
Appendix is out.

265
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,763
- [Burke] Not bad.
- Thank you.

266
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,604
Now all you have to do

267
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,372
is invert the stump
into the cecum

268
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:11,041
and simultaneously pull up
on the purse strings,

269
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,051
but be careful not to...

270
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,882
...break them.

271
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,220
You ripped the cecum.
You've got a bleeder.

272
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,452
You're filling with stool.
What do you do?

273
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,256
Uh...

274
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,318
Think.

275
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,864
You start the suction
and you start digging

276
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,332
for those strings
before she bleeds to death.

277
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,801
- Give him a clamp.
- BP's dropping.

278
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,203
- He's choking.
- Come on, George.

279
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,673
Today. Pull your balls
out of your back pocket.

280
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,404
Let's go. What are you
waiting for? Suction.

Get out of the way. Pansy-ass idiot.

285
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,054
Get him out of here.

286
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,181
Suction. Clamp.

287
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,420
He's 007.

288
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,224
- [Man 1] 007, yep.
- [Man 2] A total 007.

289
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,198
- What's "007" mean?
- License to kill.

290
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,042
007.

291
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,079
They're calling me 007, aren't they?

292
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,775
- [Both] No one's calling you 007.
- Murphy whispered, "007."

293
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,943
How many times do we
have to go through this?

294
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,351
Five? Ten? Give me a number,
or I'm gonna hit you.

295
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,548
Murphy whispered, everyone laughed.

296
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,955
- He wasn't talking about you.
- Are you sure?

297
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,857
- [Meredith] Would we lie?
- Yes.

298
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,123
007 is a state of mind.

Oh, man. It's 911 for Katie Bryce.

302
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,207
I got to go.

303
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,279
Maybe I should
have gone into geriatrics.

304
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,411
No one minds
when you kill an old person.

305
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,682
Surgery is hot. It's the Marines.

306
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,384
It's macho. It's hostile. It's hardcore.

307
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,953
Geriatrics is for freaks who live
with their mothers and never have sex.

308
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,230
I've got to get my own place.

Excuse me! Excuse me!

311
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,446
Took you long enough.

312
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,107
You're OK? The nurse paged me 911.

313
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,176
I had to go all Exorcist
to get her to even pick up the phone.

There's nothing wrong with you?

- You don't have to wig out.

doesn't get the channel.

with my crown, I have to see it.

OK. This is an actual hospital.

Go to sleep and stop wasting my time.

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,043
[Sighs] What is it?!

345
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,991
Next time you wake me,

346
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,052
he better be so close to dead
there's a tag on his toe.

347
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,863
Here. Take these to the lab.

348
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,003
[Man] 4-B's got post-op pneumonia.
Let's start antibiotics.

349
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,380
Are you sure that's the right diagnosis?

350
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,715
Well, I don't know. I'm only an intern.

351
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,119
Why don't you go spend
four years in med school

352
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,987
and then let me know
if it's the right diagnosis?

353
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,289
She's short of breath. She's got fever.

354
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,488
She's post-op. Start the antibiotics.

355
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,062
God, I hate nurses.

356
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:01,332
I'm Alex. I'm with Jeremy.
You're with the Nazi, right?

357
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,203
She may not have pneumonia,
you know.

358
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,072
She could be splinting,
or have a P.E.

359
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,544
Like I said, I hate nurses.

360
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,638
What did you just say?

361
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,581
Did you just call me a nurse?

362
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,551
Well, if the white cap fits.

364
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,916
Damn it, Katie.

365
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,517
- Is she seeing anybody?
- I don't know.

366
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,357
[Whistles] She's hot.

367
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,487
I'm friends with her.

368
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,691
I mean, kind of friends...

369
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,597
Not actually friends exactly,

370
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,966
but we're tight, and we hang out.

371
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,370
- Really, only just today...
- Dude. Dude, stop talking.

What took you so long?

374
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,686
[Man] She's having
multiple grand mal seizures.

375
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,819
Now, how do you want to proceed?

376
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,329
Dr. Grey, are you listening to me?!

377
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,700
She's got Diazepam.
Two milligrams Lorazepam.

378
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,702
I just gave the second dose.

379
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,637
Dr. Grey, you need to tell us
what you want to do.

380
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,968
Dr. Grey!

381
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,746
[Beeping]

382
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,838
OK, she's full on Lorazepam?

383
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,884
- Four milligrams.
- You paged Dr. Bailey and Dr. Shepherd?

384
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,544
Lorazepam's not working.

385
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,248
Phenobarbital.
Load her with phenobarbital.

386
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,155
- [Man] Pheno's in.
- [Woman] No change.

387

- You paged Dr. Shepherd.
- I just told you.

388
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,158
- Well, page him again, stat.
- What do you want to do?

389
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,861
Dr. Grey, you need to tell us
what you want to do.

- Get the crash cart.
- I'll get it, right away.

Wait.

395
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,717

- Charge. Clear.

- Charging.
- Nineteen seconds.

- 300. Anything?
- 27 seconds.

- Come on, Katie.
- [Woman] 49 seconds.

At 60 seconds, you're supposed
to admin another drug.

- All right.

She had a seizure
and her heart stopped.

- You're monitoring.
- I checked.

413

I got her. Just... just go.

you page me immediately.

to get to the emergency. Immediately.

it's my ass. Grey?

If you tell anyone, ever...

421
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,517
[Mr. Bryce] You said it
was a seizure disorder.

422
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,521
- Now you're saying it isn't?
- I'm saying that I don't know.

- What do you think it could be?
- I don't know.

- When will you?
- I don't have an answer.

- For now, Katie is stable, and...
- Wait one damn minute.

the best in Washington.

That's my kid in there. My kid.

And you have the audacity to stand here
and tell me, "I don't know."

but she's having grand mal seizures
with no visible cause.

00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,602
She's a ticking clock.

469
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,167
She's gonna die if I don't make
a diagnosis, which is where you come in.

I need your extra minds, extra eyes.

I need you to play detective. I need you
to find out why Katie's having seizures.

You're tired. You got more work
than you could possibly handle.

00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,324
Katie needs surgery.

Scrub in to assist
on an advanced procedure.

479
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,169

hand you Katie's chart.

- They should have worked by now.
- She's old. She's freaking ancient.

486
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,386
She's lucky she's still breathing.

487
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,293

492
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,299
You've been the intern on Katie
since the start. Want to work together?

493
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,074
Find the answer, we have
a 50-50 chance of scrubbing in.

494
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,581
I'll work with you,
I don't want in on the surgery.

495
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,118
It's the biggest opportunity
any intern will get.

496
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,312
I don't want to spend time
with Shepherd.

497
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,322
What do you have against Shepherd?

498
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,483
If we find the answer,
the surgery's yours.

499
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,891
- Do you want to work together or not?
- Deal.

500
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,226
[Cristina] She doesn't have anoxia,
renal failure or acidosis.

501
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,232
It's not a tumor, her CT's clean.

You're not gonna tell me why
you won't work with Shepherd?

No. What about infection?

504

No, there's no white count.

nothing in her spinal tap.

507
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,507
Just tell me.

508
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,447
You can't comment,
make a face or react in any way.

509
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,110

510
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,218
What about an aneurysm?

511
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,192
No blood on the CT and no headaches.

512
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,992
OK. There's no drug use,
no pregnancy, no trauma.

513
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,398
Was he good?

514
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,460
I mean, he looks like he'd
be good. Was it any good?

515
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,365
We're out of answers.

516
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,477
What if no one comes up with anything?

517
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,910
You mean, what if she dies?

518
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,242
Yeah.

519
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:01,116
This is gonna sound really bad,
but I really wanted that surgery.

520
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,150
She's never gonna get the chance
to turn into a person.

521
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,157
The sum total of her existence

522
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,921
will be almost winning
Miss Teen whatever.

523
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,223
You know what her pageant talent is?

524
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,928
- They have talent?
- Rhythmic gymnastics.

525
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,096
[Laughing] Oh, come on.

526
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,866
What is rhythmic gymnastics?

527
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,738
I can't even say it.
I don't know what it is.

528
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,300
[Laughing]

529
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,212
I think it's something
with a ball and a...

530
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,445
What?

531
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,281
Meredith, what?

532
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,981
Get up. Come on.

533
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,991
The only thing that she would
possibly need is an angiogram.

534
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,028
Oh. Oh, Dr. Shepherd, just one moment.

535
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,995
Katie competes in beauty pageants.

536
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,726
I know that, but we have
to save her life anyway.

537
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,667
She has no headaches,
no neck pain, her CT is clean.

538
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,638
There's no medical proof of an aneurysm,
but what if she has an aneurysm anyway?

539
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,643
- There are no indicators.
- She twisted her ankle practicing.

540
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,442
- I appreciate you trying to help...
- When she twisted her ankle, she fell.

541
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,881
It was no big deal,
not even a bump on the head.

542
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,578
She got up, iced her ankle,
and everything was fine.

543
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,588
It was a fall so minor,
her doctor didn't think to mention it

544
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,557
when I was taking her history,
but she did fall.

545
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,720
You know what the chance is that
a fall could burst an aneurysm?

546
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,388
One in a million, literally.

547

549
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,268
- Let's go.
- [Meredith] Where?

550
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,570
To find out if Katie's one in a million.

551
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,376
[Sighs]

552
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,325
I'll be damned.

553
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,089
There it is.

554
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,893
It's minute, but it's there.

555
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,898
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

556
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,666
[Derek] She's bleeding into her brain.

557
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,777
She could have gone through her entire
life without it ever being a problem.

558
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,612
- One tap in the right spot...
- [Cristina] It exploded.

559
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,948
Now I can fix it.
You two did great work.

560
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,682
Love to stay, but I got to tell
Katie's parents she's having surgery.

561
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,954
- Katie Bryce's chart, please.
- Here you go.

562
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:26,019
Dr. Shepherd, you'd said that you'd
pick someone to scrub in if we helped?

563
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,826
Oh, yes, right. Um...

564
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,800
I'm sorry I can't take you both.
It's gonna be a full house.

565
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,427
Meredith, I'll see you in OR.

566
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,505
Good. Thank you.

567
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,383

[Butterfly Boucher: Life is Short]

569
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,447
Wow, that was quick.

570
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,353
[Burke] His heart had
too much damage for a bypass.

571
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,220
I had to let him go.

572
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,125
It happens, rarely, but it does happen.

573
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,890
The worst part of the game.

574
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,061
But I told his wife...

575
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,797
I told Gloria that he would be fine.

576
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,170
- I promised her that...
- You what?

577
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,368
They have four little girls.

578
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,775
This is my case.
Did you hear me promise?

579
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,814
The only one that can keep
a promise like that is God,

580
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,578
and I haven't seen him
holding a scalpel lately.

581
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,518
You never promise
a patient's family a good outcome!

582
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,911
I thought...

583
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,254
You make promises to Mrs. Savitch?

584
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,987
You get to be the one
to tell her that she's a widow.

585

Izzie.

586
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,938
- Maybe Meredith couldn't...
- Izzie.

587
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,945
I'll tell him I changed my mind.

588
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,352
Don't do me any favors. It's fine.

590
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,355
You did a cutthroat thing. Deal.
Don't come to me for absolution.

591
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,894
Want to be a shark, be a shark.

00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,260
- I'm not...
- Oh, yes you are.

00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,891
Only it makes you feel bad
in your warm, gooey places.

594
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,960
No, screw you. I don't get picked for
surgeries 'cause I slept with my boss,

595
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,098
and I didn't get into med school
'cause I have a famous mother.

Tony's heart had a lot of damage.

600
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:49,399
We tried to take him off bypass, but...

601
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,801
...there wasn't anything
we could have done.

602
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,442
What are you talking about?

603

that happened
in the history of the world.

614
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,132
Did you choose me for the surgery
because I slept with you?

615
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,730
Yes.

616
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,841
I'm kidding.

00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,142
I'm not gonna scrub in for surgery.

618
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,477
You should ask Cristina.
She really wants it.

619
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,983
You're Katie's doctor.
And on your first day,

620
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,520
with little training,
you helped save her life.

621
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,250
You earned the right to follow
her case through to the finish.

622
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,792
You shouldn't let
the fact that we had sex

get in the way

You know, my parents tell everyone
they meet that their son's a surgeon,

630
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,790
as if it's a big accomplishment.

When I told my mother
I wanted to go to medical school,

634
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,677
she tried to talk me out of it.

635

Said I didn't have
what it takes to be a surgeon,

636

of post-op fever.

Can anybody name
the common causes of post-op fever?

wound, walking, wonder drugs.

654
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,532
Most of the time, it's wind,
splinting or pneumonia.

655
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,702
Pneumonia's easy to assume, especially
if you're too busy to do the tests.

Do exactly as she says,

then tell your resident
that I want you off this case.

00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:56,406

the spitting image of your mother.

[Meredith] I can't think of any one
reason why I want to be a surgeon...

reasons why I should quit.

and then you say something,

683
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,955
and then somebody cries,
and there's a moment.

684
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,624
- Yuck.
- Good.

685
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,003
You should get some sleep.
You look like crap.

686
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,973
I look better than you.

687
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,805
That's not possible.

688
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,410
[Sighs]

689
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,184
That was amazing.

690
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,956
Hmm.

691
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,729
You practice on cadavers,

692
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,204
you observe

693
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,934
and you think you know
what you're gonna feel like

694
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
standing over that table, but...

695
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,875
...that was such a high.

696
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,116
I don't know why anybody does drugs.

697
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,157
Yeah.

698
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,794
Yeah.

699
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,325
I should, uh, go do this.

700
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,599
You should.

701
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,701
I'll see you around.

702
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,769
See you around.

703
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,576
See you.

704
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,451
[Meredith] So...

705
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,854
...I made it through my first shift.

706
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,485
We all did.

707
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,495
The other interns are all good people.

708
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,928
You'd like them...

709
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,363
...I think.

710
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,769
I don't know, maybe.

711
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,663
I like them.

712
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,534
[Bell jingles]

713
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,002
Oh, and I changed my mind.

714
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,777
I'm not gonna sell the house.
I'm gonna keep it.

715
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,649
I'll have to get a couple of roommates,

716
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,656
but it's home, you know?

717
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,522
Are you the doctor?

718
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,893
No.

719
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:45,531
I'm not your doctor, but I am a doctor.

720
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,474
What's your name?

721
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,247
It's me, Mom. Meredith.

722
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,709
All right.

723
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,158
I used to be a doctor, I think.

724
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,200
You were a doctor, Mom.

725
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,209
You were a surgeon.
