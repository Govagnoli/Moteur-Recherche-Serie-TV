1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,583
<i>Previously  on "Grey's Anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:03,761
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

3
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,231
- I have to.
- Give me my husband back.

4
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,345
- Chief resident?
- The one 5th year resident

5
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:09,643
that rules all residents.

6
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:11,475
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

7
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:13,917
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,914
What happened
to our small ceremony?

9
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:18,298
What happened to
you and me at city hall?

10
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,888
There's no guarantee the surgery's
gonna bring back your memory.

11
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,791
- Is there a man in my house?
- I'm so sorry, Richard.

12
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,378
And I'm finally ready to have a baby,
and I can't.

13
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,190
We're losing her pulse.
She's coding!

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,664
We did everything we could.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,684
<i>A surgeon's education never ends.</i>

16
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,626
<i>Every patient, every symptom,
every operation...</i>

17
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,739
<i>is a test.</i>

18
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:51,911
<i>A chance for us to demonstrate
how much we know...</i>

19
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:54,386
<i>And how much more
we have to learn.</i>

20
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,574
How do you treat pancreatic divisum?
Izzie?

21
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:00,199
Oh, Cristina.
If you're not gonna let us sleep,

22
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,350
you at least have to let me
put coffee in my cup.

23
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,077
- Okay, so go. No one's stopping you.
- I'm too tired to go.

24
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,751
- Pancreatic divisum.
- Dorsal duct sphincterotomy.

25
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,375
Not your turn, but correct.
You do me.

26
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:11,821
Can't believe O'Malley's missing this.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,743
- How's he gonna be ready?
- You're kidding, right?

28
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,327
- We have Callie's cards but George has-
- George has Callie.

29
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:20,975
What's the most frequent cause
of diarrhea in hospitalized patients?

30
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:22,702
Is she coming to
this bachelorette thing tonight?

31
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,691
Rotavirus. Yes.
No, no, no. Uh, salmonella.

32
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:27,475
Diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

33
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:31,914
The most frequent cause of diarrhea
in hospitalized patients is C. diff.

34
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:36,562
Which can lead to toxic megacolon,
perforation, sepsis and death.

35
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:38,877
That's what killed Susan.

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,607
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

37
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:48,067
- Dude, she's messed up.
- Of course she's messed up.

38
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:49,992
Susan was basically
her surrogate mother.

39
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,236
Yeah, her fake mom
was better than her real mom.

40
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:54,937
Is she going to the hospital first
or the funeral?

41
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:57,238
First to the hospital,
then to the funeral,

42
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,115
then to the test this afternoon.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,327
- Has she even studied?
- Yeah, she studied. She's fine.

44
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:03,354
She just needs
to be left alone, okay? So...

45
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,421
what's inside the carotid sheath?
Izzie?

46
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,654
<i>The internal carotid artery,</i>

47
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,855
<i>the internal jugular vein
and the vagus nerve.</i>

48
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,447
Ah, that was too easy.
Let's find you a hard one.

49
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,727
Uh, what is this?

50
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>Uh, what is what?</i>

51
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:22,659
Yeah.
That just came this morning.

52
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:26,245
You got a spot at Mercy West!
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:28,480
Because it's pending the results
of the intern exam.

54
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,329
Oh, you know what this means,
don't you?

55
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:34,009
You, you got,
you got into Mercy West...

56
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,931
I haven't told the chief yet.

57
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:38,764
You'll tell him today.
He'll understand.

58
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,042
It's a smaller program,

59
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,699
fewer residents,
fewer distractions,

60
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,211
more surgeries.

61
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:49,062
And when I come home
and ask you how your day went,

62
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,535
you can actually tell me
because I won't already know.

63
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,545
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,671
Look, I...

65
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,943
I know this is a...
an impossible day for you.

66
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,231
So...

67
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:28,133
I'm just want to say one thing.

68
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,654
I brought a black suit, just in case.

69
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:34,990
Thank you.

70
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:37,457
But I think this is something
I need to do by myself.

71
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,345
If you need me, just...

72
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,397
let me know.

73
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,279
- Oh, Cristina.
- What is M.E.N. syndrome?

74
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,378
Don't answer that.

75
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,802
The minister needs to see a copy
of your vows before the wedding.

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,393
Multiple endocrine neoplasia. Yes.

77
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,109
Look, I know it's test day,
and I'm not supposed to be

78
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,948
talking about the wedding
on test day.

79
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,802
- But since tomorrow's our wedding day--
- You have five seconds. Go.

80
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,190
Bill Adams can't make it.
I have no best man.

81
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,299
Oh, no. Baby, I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,237
- And I need your vows by--
- Okay, time's up.

83
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,001
Test day.

84
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:21,731
What am I supposed
to tell the minister?

85
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:23,327
Test day.

86
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:27,707
They paged you guys, too?

87
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,407
- Well, I think they paged all of us.
- That can't be good.

88
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,529
Sure it can. He could be letting us
know I won the race for chief.

89
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:34,742
Not today, he isn't.

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,967
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

91
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:39,164
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

92
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,214
Why were we all paged?

93
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,449
Oh, because search and rescue
found those lost

94
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,195
climbers who were up
on Mount Rainier.

95
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,708
- People, the climbers are on their way.
- Any specifics?

96
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,761
They found only 3 so far.
One's still missing.

97
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,812
They're reporting
severe dehydration

98
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,972
with traumatic head
and chest injuries.

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,566
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres,
you'll be my trauma team.

100
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,688
- Bad day not to have interns.
- What?

101
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,087
Today's the intern exam.

102
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:01,435
You'll all have to do your
own heavy lifting today.

103
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,024
And if you see an intern,
which you will,

104
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,634
because they can't help themselves,

105
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,699
turn them away
until after the exam.

106
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,316
The ambulances
are 5 minutes away.

107
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:10,182
It's time to do what we do best,
people. Let's roll.

108
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,902
What is a gerota's fascia?

109
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,996
Uh, the fascia surrounding the kidney.

110
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,440
Which is longer, the left...

111
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:19,524
- or the right renal vein?
- That's right. The left one.

112
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,805
- Looks and smarts-- Not bad.
- You think?

113
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,815
She's got my dad's nose, though.

114
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,312
Girl's gotta have a big personality
to pull off that nose.

115
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,853
What?

116
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,609
You-- You remember your dad?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,746
No. I don't-- No.

118
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,540
- You just said--
- I know, but I...

119
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,793
I have no idea
where that came from.

120
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,925
That was a memory.
That's what it's like sometimes.

121
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,654
It doesn't always come back all at once.
It can happen in bits and pieces.

122
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:45,191
- Don't-- Don't get all--
- Dude, your memory's coming back.

123
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:55,830
How you feelin', Preston?
You ready?

124
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,434
I'm always ready for surgery.

125
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,847
I think he's talking
about the wedding.

126
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,330
Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:03,060
And apart from the fact that
Cristina hasn't written her vows,

128
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,459
my best man just canceled,

129
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,327
- and it's still raining...
- He's not ready.

130
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,067
You're never ready.

131
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:09,448
I certainly wasn't.

132
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,796
But then... the minute I saw
Adele coming down that aisle...

133
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:19,594
Well... have you picked
your best man?

134
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:24,189
- Actually, chief, I--
- You can't be his best man.

135
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:25,977
- Why not?
- Because it's unethical.

136
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,093
It's a conflict of interest.
The man wants to be chief of surgery.

137
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:30,929
- Actually, Derek--
- Not that that's why you're asking.

138
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:35,024
- I was... going to ask you.
- Ask me what?

139
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:42,300
- Really?
- We have been through a lot this year.

140
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:43,922
And everybody else turned you down.

141
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:46,398
Oh, what do I have to do?

142
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,262
Well, traditionally the best man
plans the bachelor party.

143
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,607
- Drinks at Joe's after work?
- Yeah.

144
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,391
I knew you were
the man for the job.

145
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:01,993
Dale winick, 32.
B.P. 90 over 50, tachy to 110.

146
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,693
Severe frostbite,
but no obvious internal injuries.

147
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,751
Got it.

148
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,009
My god.

149
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,647
Yeah, those aren't gloves.

150
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,725
Please someone tell me
if they heard the others guys are okay.

151
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,533
They're right behind you.
We'll let you know.

152
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,683
Get him a tet-tox
and push a gram of cefazolin I.V.

153
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:28,583
And let's get some warm, circulating
water to start thawing his hands.

154
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:30,965
I'll get someone on it.
Callie.

155
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,308
We're supposed to be studying.
If Bailey finds out we're down--

156
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,366
We are studying.
How do you treat frostbite?

157
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:38,246
Rewarm, avoid early surgery unless

158
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:41,128
there's a deep infection
due to autoamputation.

159
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,391
See? Studying.

160
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,362
Okay, okay,
Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer,

161
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,362
I'm gonna need you
to save your breath, okay?

162
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,537
We're gonna give you
some pain meds.

163
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,850
You have several broken ribs,

164
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,250
which are compromising your breathing.
You understand?

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,400
- Did you see that?
- That is freaky.

166
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:59,020
I think that was a flail chest.
I've never seen one before.

167
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,329
Come on. Come on.

168
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,221
Why, oh, why does today
have to be test day?

169
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:04,461
Oh, I know.

170
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,715
Look... I bet you
if you talk to the chief,

171
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:11,447
he'll let you take the test later
with the funeral and everything.

172
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,710
I don't need to take the test later.

173
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:20,399
- Can I get a little help here?
- I can't feel my legs!

174
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:21,707
Sir, you have a spinal injury.

175
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,472
You need to stop fighting me
and stay calm, okay?

176
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:24,831
You're only making it worse.
Where we going?

177
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,969
- You guys are going to trauma 3.
- All right. Trauma 3.

178
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:30,739
- You okay?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,227
I got accepted at Mercy West.

180
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:39,142
Wow that's...
Are you gonna go?

181
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,001
Well, I kinda have to now, right?

182
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,520
What are you fools doing here?

183
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,714
In a few hours,
you people are taking a test

184
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,428
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers

185
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,718
because the five interns
with the lowest test scores

186
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,060
will be cut from the program.

187
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,177
But are you studying for this test?
No, you're not.

188
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,531
Are you helping out in the E.R.?
You are most certainly not!

189
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,263
Are you getting the hell out of here
before I throw you out?

190
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:04,878
I think you are.

191
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,507
- Whoa, Dr. Shepherd.
- Aren't you supposed to be studying?

192
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:10,585
- Yeah, I just have a quick question.
- Yeah.

193
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:13,415
Could the craniotomy you performed
on Ava-- On Jane Doe-- Could--

194
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,592
- Could that have affected her memory?
- Uh, it's doubtful.

195
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,309
I was mostly working
in the speech center of her brain.

196
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,582
- But you never know. Why?
- I think she remembered something.

197
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,601
Can we test her to see
if anything's changed?

198
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,235
Yeah, you can run another W.M.S.R.

199
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,108
But we're gonna have to wait,
see if she remembers anything else.

200
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,742
- It's a good sign, though.
- Thanks.

201
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,200
- Nice work, Dr. Montgomery.
- Oh, thanks.

202
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,557
- I was just directing traffic.
- I was being sarcastic.

203
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,698
Oh, like brain surgery
is so impressive.

204
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:35,468
- It is, actually.
- Addison.

205
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,694
Yes? Oh, Joe, Walter.

206
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,932
What are you guys doing here?
Everything okay?

207
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,289
Yeah, we came to see you, actually.

208
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,287
- We need a consult.
- Don't tell me you're pregnant.

209
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,991
- Uh, no, but--
- Our birth mom is.

210
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:50,513
The potential birth mom.

211
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,034
She hasn't actually picked us yet.

212
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,207
You're adopting?

213
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,249
Well, we filed an application,
but we never thought we'd get picked.

214
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,029
You know, bar-owning gays
don't get picked very often.

215
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:01,405
I guess having a baby
is easier than we thought.

216
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,825
Yes, I guess so.

217
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,600
So I was hoping
you could take a look at her?

218
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:09,200
You know, kicking the tires,
checking underneath the hood?

219
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,740
Car metaphors? No.

220
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,777
I'd be happy to.
Just, uh, give me a call

221
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,016
and we'll set up an appointment.

222
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,515
Well, see, that's the thing, uh...

223
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,008
She lives in Portland,

224
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,185
and she's only gonna be
in Seattle for one day, so...

225
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,218
She's kind of here now.

226
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,023
Now, as in...

227
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,210
now.

228
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,047
- George, wait. Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

229
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,511
You don't have to do this.

230
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,175
You don't have to transfer
to Mercy West.

231
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,379
- Yeah, I do.
- No.

232
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,348
Just forget about you and me
for a second, OK?

233
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:43,714
What about Meredith?

234
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,094
What about Alex and Cristina?

235
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,100
Who's gonna hold us together
if you're not here?

236
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,168
You're the glue. You're George.

237
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,745
- I can't stay here. I can't...
- No one's making you go.

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,066
stay here
and see you every day...

239
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:57,987
and not...

240
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:01,930
I can't keep kissing you
in elevators.

241
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,705
I know. I know that.

242
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm married.

243
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,286
I'm a married man.

244
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:16,114
- You busy?
- Cute. What are you doing here?

245
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:17,643
- Isn't the exam in like--
- I know, I know.

246
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,906
I just want to run
a quick neuro-psych test on you.

247
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,664
No. No! Go take your test.

248
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,420
I-I have a baby to feed.

249
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,558
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

250
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,061
You've been sitting in this bed
for weeks wishing

251
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,807
you could remember who you were
now suddenly you can.

252
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:31,793
I can't. It was something I said.

253
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,403
Well, you remember
your father's face.

254
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,187
Why are you acting like
it's no big deal,

255
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,274
- like it happens all the time?
- Alex, come on. I-I--

256
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:38,570
It-- That's not...

257
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,712
Unless it does happen all the time.

258
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,303
Tell me the truth.
Do you remember?

259
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,210
Do you know who you are?

260
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:55,316
- What is biloma?
- Cristina, I really don't have time.

261
00:11:56,555 --> 00:12:00,132
A biloma is an intraperitoneal
bile fluid collection.

262
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:01,850
- Excellent.
- Okay? I'll be fine.

263
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,305
- George, I gotta go.
- Your dad.

264
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,638
Hey.
I was just on my way to--

265
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:12,577
No, I-I came here to tell you,
you're not wanted.

266
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,915
I don't want you at any funeral,
Meredith.

267
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:17,059
- Thatcher, why don't you come--
- She trusted you!

268
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,738
She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

269
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:23,297
You did. You killed my wife.
You took her from me.

270
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:24,433
Dad!

271
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,654
So I don't--
I don't want to see you.

272
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,269
I don't want to hear from you,

273
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,144
and I do not want you
anywhere near her funeral.

274
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,058
- Do you understand me?
- Dad, dad, come on.

275
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,734
This-- Lexie's waiting in the car.
We have to go, dad.

276
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,407
She was everything to me,
all I had.

277
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,094
She was all I had.

278
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,221
She was all I had.

279
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,954
I can sit here all day.

280
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,198
I'll miss my test,
but I will sit here all day.

281
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:12,889
I don't-- I...

282
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:17,312
It happened a few days ago,
and I-I just...

283
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:19,565
I just woke up, and...

284
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,002
- it was all there again.
- And you didn't tell me?

285
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,109
Becau-- Because there's...

286
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,832
There's nothing to tell.

287
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,298
Why don't I believe that?

288
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:34,787
I was a pregnant woman,

289
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,015
in a lousy marriage,

290
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,659
to the nicest guy
anyone's ever met.

291
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,984
End of story.

292
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,848
Who-- who is he?
What does he do?

293
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,613
Wh-where--
Where did you meet him?

294
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:51,976
College.

295
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,379
We got married the year
after we graduated.

296
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,483
He...

297
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:57,483
I wanted--
I wanted to move to New York,

298
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,307
and he wanted to live
on the side of a mountain

299
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,538
and take over his dad's shop.

300
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,897
And he's a woodworker.
He makes beautiful furniture.

301
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,315
It's-- It's-- It's...

302
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,821
quiet, and he's quiet and...

303
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,846
- I was going out of my mind.
- So you just...

304
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:11,994
- took off?
- No, I...

305
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,475
No, I need-- I need-- I need--

306
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,019
I needed to think
and to be around other people.

307
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,447
So I came to Seattle, and I...

308
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:21,729
Thought I'd see the sights,
ride the ferry.

309
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,072
- Have you even called him?
- No.

310
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:24,744
- Why not?
- I left him, Alex.

311
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,509
So? He's your husband.

312
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:28,743
You should call him.
You want me to call him?

313
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:31,490
I mean, what's his name?
What's your name?

314
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,569
I'm not telling you that.

315
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:40,496
- We've got everything taken care of.
- You don't have to worry about a thing.

316
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,617
I've got number 2 pencils
and bottled water.

317
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,529
Oh, and-- And powerbars.

318
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,021
And you know the material.

319
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:48,725
You're gonna get a high score--
Not as high as mine--

320
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,200
But everything's gonna be fine.

321
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,473
What are you guys
all standing around for?

322
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,125
Don't we have a test to--

323
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:56,022
What happened?

324
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,576
You people need to head upstairs.

325
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:59,116
Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.

326
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,904
You're not to blame for Susan Grey's
death, and you know it,

327
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,565
and your father knows it, too.

328
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,257
He's just...

329
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,901
Well, he's never been
the best communicator,

330
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,325
and he just lost his wife.

331
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,637
Stop acting
like my surrogate father.

332
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:25,076
- Meredith, I've...
- Just Because you slept with my mother,

333
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,033
that does not make you my father.

334
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,258
Follow my finger. Up.

335
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,100
Okay. Good.

336
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:39,166
Let me know
if you can feel this, okay?

337
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:43,647
Yeah, I'm not enjoying that.

338
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,403
Good. That's a good sign.

339
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,314
It means I'm not paralyzed?

340
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,797
Well, the M.R.I. will show us
the full extent of the injuries.

341
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:50,918
But, uh...

342
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,261
can we ask you
what happened up there?

343
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,008
It was my fault.

344
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,767
- Dale--
- It wasn't your fault.

345
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:04,532
60 ways to get up Mount Rainier,
and I had to pick Liberty Ridge.

346
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,053
It wasn't the route.

347
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:07,438
It was the storm.

348
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,662
On a clear day,
you don't think about storms.

349
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:14,251
A minute later, the wind's pasting you
to the side of the mountain,

350
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,087
and you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

351
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:18,115
Is that why you fell,
because of the storm?

352
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:23,052
All I know is I felt the rope tug,
and...

353
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:25,700
- I was in midair.
- We all were.

354
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,007
We were tied together.

355
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,397
Must have been a 100-foot drop.

356
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,977
And when we came to,
Lonnie wasn't moving.

357
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,334
Lonnie?
He's your friend who's still missing?

358
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:37,366
Well, this Lonnie,
is that why he didn't make it back,

359
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,671
because he was hurt?

360
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:41,834
Because he was dead.

361
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:44,463
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,645
We had to leave him.

363
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,519
We had to get to the other side of
the mountain, or we'd be dead, too.

364
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,827
We had no choice.

365
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,559
You always have a choice.

366
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:57,534
You never leave a man behind.

367
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,775
Please take your seats,
doctors,

368
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:05,545
and put all study materials away.

369
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:08,533
Okay, if you don't know the answer,
choose "B." It's always "B."

370
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,017
And write your name in the upper
right-hand corner of your answer sheets.

371
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,861
You may open your test booklets...

372
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,121
Now.

373
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,041
W-we don't have to be here
if you're uncomfortable.

374
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,424
Oh, no, it's fine.
Unless you're uncomfortable.

375
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,846
- Actually, uh, I-I--
- He's fine.

376
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,293
So, Rina, how are you feeling?
Any problems?

377
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:38,540
Just the fact that I'm huge,

378
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,723
and I have, like, the worst heartburn
I've ever had in my life.

379
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,516
I can prescribe an antacid for that.

380
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,680
The first thing we're gonna do
is take a look at the baby.

381
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,493
This might be a little cold.

382
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:52,025
This baby deserves parents
who are gonna make it

383
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:53,387
their whole world, you know?

384
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,779
You know we're gay, right?

385
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,254
I figured, with you both
being boys and everything.

386
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:01,937
The other couple I'm considering,

387
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,294
they're, like, oh, 40.

388
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:07,770
She's been trying
to get pregnant for ten years.

389
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,310
It's so sad.

390
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,300
There's the heartbeat.

391
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:15,808
Oh, my god.

392
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,089
There's, like,
a person inside of me.

393
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,305
Actually... there are two people.

394
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,979
Twins.

395
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,195
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

396
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,209
Oh, my god.
I think I'm gonna pass out.

397
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:34,253
Doctors, we are halfway
through our allotted time.

398
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:38,378
You only have 60 minutes left
to complete the exam.

399
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,517
She didn't write anything on the test.

400
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,198
She didn't answer a single question.
She just sat there.

401
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,181
Wait, George, just--

402
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,293
Just give her a second.

403
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,434
I've got an extensive
antero-lateral flail chest.

404
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,145
He'll need surgical stabilization.

405
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,917
Dr. Torres, if you're available--

406
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,870
She's not.
My guy has bone fragments

407
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,823
in his spinal cord,
internal fixation.

408
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:43,518
Dr. Torres is gonna scrub in
with me.

409
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:46,198
Uh, we have more than one
orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.

410
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,674
And you'll need 'em,
because Dr. Torres and I are looking

411
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,064
at possible multiple amputations.

412
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:52,599
Guys, I can be there for all of you.
We just have to figure it out.

413
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:53,754
Dr. Burke asked first.

414
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,801
- Well, I mean, with all due respect--
- okay, you all want Torres. Fine.

415
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,358
Rock, paper, scissors.

416
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:02,188
One, two, three.

417
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:03,879
All rocks. Very typical.
Ready?

418
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,015
And...

419
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,935
Rock smashes scissors.

420
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,399
- See you in the O.R.
- Best two out of three.

421
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,526
Dr. Burke!

422
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,168
What?

423
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,168
I just wanted to know
how it feels...

424
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,733
to not have to spend
the next 24 hours

425
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:23,212
wondering if Richard picked you
to be chief resident.

426
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:25,643
How's it feel to be the chosen one?

427
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,057
Feels just fine.

428
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:39,871
How'd it go?

429
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,899
Meredith.

430
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:43,946
Don't worry. I've got it.

431
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:49,597
It's not like
she actually flunked.

432
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,501
She-- She just
didn't write anything.

433
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:53,571
It's kinda like
she actually flunked.

434
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:55,873
One guy two years ago,

435
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,688
he was on call three nights
before his test.

436
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,463
He slept through the whole thing.
He had to repeat his intern year.

437
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,365
She can't repeat her intern year.

438
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:03,821
It's pathetic.
We have to do something.

439
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,896
Cristina.

440
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,940
What? Okay, I don't know.

441
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,372
Mredith and I don't fail things.
This is not in my book.

442
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:15,586
It's Bailey. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

443
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,027
- We can't just leave her here.
- You got a better idea?

444
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:31,774
Okay, it's showtime, people.

445
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,473
Yang,
you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.

446
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,537
Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.

447
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,003
- You paged me, too.
- Mercy West.

448
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:42,339
Callie told you.

449
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:45,944
You're in the best surgical program
in the country,

450
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,934
the toughest, most competitive
most respected.

451
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,779
You want to leave
this for Mercy West?

452
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:53,520
- Mercy west--
- Is not Seattle Grace.

453
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,928
Are you trying to...

454
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,782
After all the work
that we've put into you,

455
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,655
are you trying to throw
your career away?

456
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm trying to...

457
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:03,298
do what's best for me right now.
I've had some personal issues.

458
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:06,168
I-I don't know what your personal
problems are, and I don't care.

459
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,020
I do care about your career,
so let me make myself clear.

460
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,048
This is a mistake.

461
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:42,117
It's like we're on a train
that's going 200 miles an hour,

462
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:44,504
and it would just be
so nice to get off,

463
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,801
and just...

464
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:50,026
stand on the platform
just for a minute.

465
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,373
Looks like I'm off the train.

466
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,181
Our parents died.

467
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,687
When a parent dies,
it doesn't make any sense.

468
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,708
So you make...

469
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,890
a lot of really terrible decisions...

470
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:15,540
that you're gonna end up having
to live with for a long time.

471
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:23,096
You should go.
You are still on the train.

472
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,431
It's okay.
You have to go.

473
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:40,165
Go.

474
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:42,606
Go. Go, go.

475
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:56,835
Addison.

476
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,180
Adele.

477
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,781
What are you doing here?
What happened?

478
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,771
A fender bender. I'm fine.

479
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,428
I told the E.R. resident I'm fine,
but...

480
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,054
All right, I'm gonna page Richard.
I'll let him know you're here.

481
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,079
Oh, you will do no such thing,
Addison.

482
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,816
Richard cannot know I'm here.

483
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:14,005
We're separated.

484
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,647
My life is none of his business.

485
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:18,835
I'm serious.

486
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,526
Uh, all right. Well...

487
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,151
let's get you checked out.

488
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,642
Do you have any, um,
any pain, any...

489
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:31,027
anything?

490
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:32,290
Well...

491
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:35,191
there's one thing
I should probably mention.

492
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,470
I'm pregnant.

493
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:51,921
The baby looks fine on the ultrasound
but you are spotting a little.

494
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,249
It's nothing severe,

495
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,450
but I would like to hold you
overnight for observation.

496
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,736
Overnight? Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

497
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:00,892
- But--
- For just a couple of hours at least.

498
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,150
Look, it could be nothing.

499
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,013
But a pregnancy at your age is--

500
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,802
Terrifying? Embarrassing?

501
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:09,827
I was going to say a miracle.

502
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:12,925
I don't know. I resigned myself
to the fact a long time ago

503
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,534
that I would never have kids,
and...

504
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:18,302
here I am, 52,
about to be divorced and...

505
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:19,827
pregnant.

506
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,870
May I ask who... the father is?

507
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:26,237
You may ask.

508
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:27,785
Look, all I'm saying...

509
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:31,080
is that if Richard finds out that
you're walking around this hospital

510
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,153
carrying another man's baby...

511
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,209
Richard is not going to find out

512
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:38,721
because neither one of us
are going to tell him.

513
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,903
- Chief.
- Addison.

514
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,252
I just heard the news.

515
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,707
You-- You heard?

516
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,668
Who told you?
What-- What did you hear?

517
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,912
That Joe and Walter are adopting.

518
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,156
Is the birth mom here?
I'd love to put in a good word.

519
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,114
Chief, you don't want to go in there.

520
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:03,257
It's a young girl...

521
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,233
in the stirrups, you know,

522
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,378
her equipment exposed, right?

523
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:08,914
You don't want to see that.

524
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,539
No, I-I don't want to see that.

525
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:25,871
Are you going to give me
an inspirational speech, too?

526
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,134
I can't talk.
I have a patient to prep.

527
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:38,822
This isn't about you and me.
This is about Meredith.

528
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,859
- What are we gonna do?
- There's nothing to do.

529
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,979
What?

530
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,473
I'm not even gonna be
here in a week, so...

531
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,830
So your transferring
to another hospital

532
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,592
means we're not gonna be
friends anymore?

533
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,503
Why are you doing this, George?

534
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,196
Didn't you hear a word
of what Bailey said?

535
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:55,539
<i>What were we supposed to do,</i>

536
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:57,826
<i>carry him down the mountain?</i>

537
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:00,119
<i>He was our friend,
and we left him there.</i>

538
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,873
If we hadn't, we'd be dead, too.

539
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:03,515
You know that.

540
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,218
Dale was right.

541
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,977
<i>You don't--
You don't do that.</i>

542
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:12,433
<i>You don't...</i>

543
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,733
<i>climb all the way up there together
just to leave a man behind.</i>

544
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,809
I am being stalked by pregnant women.

545
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:21,964
You're an obstetrician.

546
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:24,546
And barren.
You know, apparently as a healthy,

547
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,574
successful woman in her 30s,
I don't deserve to have a baby.

548
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:30,014
Maybe I'd have a fighting chance
if were gay,

549
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,531
or a teenager
or a member of the A.A.R.P.

550
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,047
Oh, that sucks.

551
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:37,897
It really...

552
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,699
No, no, not you, too.

553
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:46,821
Oh, no, no, I'm not. I'm just--
I'm thinking about it.

554
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,277
That's all.

555
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,874
Oh, I don't know.

556
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,859
I don't even know.
It's just that with George...

557
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:57,212
- going to Mercy West next year...
- He is?

558
00:27:57,402 --> 00:28:00,243
Yeah, they have a spot for him,
and we need a fresh start.

559
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,285
We need to get away
from all this crap.

560
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,468
It might be a good time.

561
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,963
It's a great time.

562
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,521
Don't let me and my fossilized eggs
discourage you.

563
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,023
Are we gonna be friends still
if I get pregnant?

564
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,309
Absolutely not.

565
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:26,597
- Hi, chief.
- O'Malley.

566
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,213
Finally coming to see me
about that letter from Mercy West?

567
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,165
No, sir.

568
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:34,150
I'm here about Meredith.

569
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,803
I have to say, I don't get it.

570
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:42,450
Why would anybody
waste their time freezing

571
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,705
and climbing up
the side of a glacier?

572
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:48,884
It's a way to test yourself, you know,
your strength and endurance.

573
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,268
You put yourself through
a situation like that,

574
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:53,221
and you know exactly
who you are,

575
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:54,774
what you made of.

576
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,581
Have you done it before,
Dr. Burke?

577
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:58,850
No. You?

578
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,845
I used to, all the time,
in college.

579
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,207
- Really?
- Really?

580
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:05,214
Yeah, it's, intense.

581
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,176
I mean, it's painful and hellish,

582
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:09,101
and you think your lungs
are shredding, but...

583
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:12,166
Man, when you get to the top,
there is nothing like it.

584
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,940
Makes the whole climb worth it.

585
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:28,859
How's it going?

586
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:30,756
Worse than I thought.
There's nothing here.

587
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,214
We're gonna amputate both?

588
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:33,689
You can't amputate
both of his hands.

589
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,172
I-Isn't the left hand less damaged?

590
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,291
I don't want to take
the man's hands, Dr. Stevens.

591
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,674
Once the infection gets that deep,

592
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,732
the only way to save his life
is to make the cut.

593
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:47,160
The patient's laminotomy happens
at what level, Dr. O'malley?

594
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:50,300
The level of maximal neural
compressions between

595
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,216
the pedicles
of the fractured vertebrae.

596
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:53,389
Very good.

597
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,220
You must have aced
your exam today.

598
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:57,378
I don't know about aced.

599
00:29:57,758 --> 00:29:59,035
How did Meredith do?

600
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,668
Yeah, she was kinda...

601
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:04,091
Don't worry, though.
I talked to the chief.

602
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:06,887
About what?

603
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,239
She didn't tell you?

604
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,846
All right, here's the thing--

605
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,409
The Seattle police department's
been on this for weeks.

606
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,384
They've been in contact with
missing persons from all 50 states...

607
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,928
Canada, the FBI--

608
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,215
You know how many people
are trying to find you?

609
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:26,867
- Yeah, yes.
- That's right. You do know.

610
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:28,942
You know exactly
how many relatives you have.

611
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,520
You know if your parents
are dead or alive.

612
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:33,070
You know if you've got a sister
somewhere who cries every day because

613
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,667
- she has no idea what happened to you.
- Stop it!

614
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:36,030
What do you think
it's like for your husband?

615
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,516
He didn't come looking for me, okay?

616
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,559
He obviously
doesn't want to find me.

617
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:44,203
- Besides,it's my life.
- No, not just yours.

618
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:45,680
What about your daughter?

619
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,121
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna lie for you.

620
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:48,563
If you're not gonna tell anybody,
I will.

621
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:49,718
What are you gonna say?

622
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,880
You don't know my real name.

623
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:53,646
You don't know anything about me.

624
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,219
It'll be my word against yours.

625
00:30:58,221 --> 00:31:00,904
You're right. I have absolutely
no idea who you are.

626
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:12,073
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

627
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,810
I think I figured out
a way to help Meredith.

628
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,931
But I've got shepherd's post-op,
and...

629
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:17,866
I can't do it without your help.

630
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,328
And I won't leave
the program without...

631
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:21,896
knowing that she's still in it.

632
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:27,827
You're not leaving the program.

633
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,822
Listen... we made a mistake.

634
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,523
We had sex.

635
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:34,880
But that's all it was.

636
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:38,393
I think we both wanted it
to mean something because...

637
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,921
you didn't want to have to feel like
that guy that cheats on his wife,

638
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,367
I didn't want to have
to feel like that girl

639
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:44,776
who put you in that position
in the first place.

640
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,121
But the truth is...

641
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,947
It didn't mean anything.

642
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,700
I know you think
I have feelings for you,

643
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:54,672
but I don't.

644
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:57,700
So you can stay.

645
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,497
You're not leaving the program.

646
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:35,805
Nice work today Torres...
Three surgeries at the same time.

647
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:38,946
I performed four osteosyntheses,
amputated two hands

648
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,135
and stabilized
one spine in two hours.

649
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:43,319
Impressive.

650
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:46,689
Looks like Bailey's not
a shoo-in for chief resident after all.

651
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:53,897
Uh, you're in the running
for chief resident, too?

652
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,132
Why wouldn't I be?

653
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,550
No. Uh, it makes sense.

654
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:03,038
I just... I hadn't thought about it.
That's all.

655
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,365
I'm good at what I do, Bailey.

656
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,122
I'm focused,
I'm disciplined, I'm--

657
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,834
I'm more than qualified
to be chief resident.

658
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,059
Look, we all know
that you're the chief's favorite,

659
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,733
but that doesn't mean
I can't take a shot.

660
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:23,859
Here she is.

661
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:26,873
Thank you, Stevens.
You can go now.

662
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,475
We'll be waiting right outside.

663
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,230
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

664
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,199
If you called me here
to lecture me--

665
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,880
There's a copy of
the intern's exam on the table,

666
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,589
some number 2 pencils,
a bottle of water

667
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,208
and a sandwich if you get hungry.

668
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:48,957
I'll send a proctor in,
and I'll come back

669
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,412
in a few hours and check on you.

670
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,620
You are not my father.

671
00:33:58,505 --> 00:33:59,622
I know that.

672
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:23,427
I know.

673
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:49,380
Well, at least test day
is almost over.

674
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,314
Speak for yourself.

675
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:53,413
I'm getting married tomorrow.

676
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:11,136
This is what you invited me to?

677
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:12,982
This is your big bachelor party?

678
00:35:13,018 --> 00:35:14,962
It was last-minute.
I needed some warm bodies.

679
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:16,900
Which would explain
why I'm here.

680
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:19,016
Why am I the only girl,
by the way?

681
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,960
What am I, the entertainment?
I am not stripping.

682
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,631
That's okay.
We've seen it already.

683
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,321
- True.
- I haven't.

684
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:28,794
Yeah, well, why don't I buy you
a drink instead?

685
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:30,362
First round's on me.

686
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:32,062
I'll give you a hand with those.

687
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:36,291
Cristina write her vows?

688
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:38,283
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

689
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,413
How's Meredith doing?

690
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:42,933
I have no idea.

691
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,467
Shouldn't be this difficult,
should it?

692
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:48,758
Probably not.

693
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:51,161
Then again...

694
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,287
when I see Cristina walking down
that aisle tomorrow...

695
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,602
It'll all be worth it?

696
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:11,323
So how was L.A.?

697
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:16,116
L.A. was... different.

698
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:22,016
Look, Mark...

699
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,786
Things don't have to be
awkward between us.

700
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:28,467
We tried.

701
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,305
We tried, and we did our best

702
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:33,178
and just because we failed
as a couple, it doesn't mean--

703
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,344
I know.

704
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,668
So we're still friends?

705
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,260
With benefits?

706
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,482
Don't push it.

707
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,066
Thanks, Joe.

708
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:52,672
So hey, how'd it go with Rina?

709
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:56,090
Oh, well... Walter took her
to the bus station,

710
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:59,106
and I'm pretty sure he was wishing
it was me he was dropping off.

711
00:36:59,124 --> 00:37:00,514
That bad, huh?

712
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,364
If I can't even make it
through an ultrasound

713
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:03,998
without breathing
into a paper bag,

714
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:05,470
how am I gonna handle a kid?

715
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:06,935
Forget about twins.

716
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:10,098
You two are gonna make
great parents, okay?

717
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,521
Whenever that happens.

718
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:14,272
You... ever think
about having kids?

719
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,222
All the time.

720
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:26,581
Adele?

721
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:35,763
Oh, come on.
I know you saw me.

722
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,823
Now this is just silly.

723
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,738
You don't have to hide.

724
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,025
I've moved on.

725
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,861
I'm dating now.

726
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,146
Okay, I'm not actually dating,

727
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:51,874
but I intend to...

728
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:54,381
at some point.

729
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,220
What the hell am I supposed to do
about the stupid vows?

730
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,553
You still haven't written anything?

731
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,469
- Well, it's stupid crap.
- No, it isn't.

732
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,779
Well, what am I supposed to say?

733
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,718
I swear to love and cherish you every
moment of every day of my life?

734
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,288
I mean, that's not real.
That's not how it works, right?

735
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,156
It does, at first...

736
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,278
- but then it...
- It passes.

737
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:14,593
No, it doesn't.

738
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,441
You guys are just used to it.
That's all. You already have it.

739
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,761
You have that thing
everybody else wants.

740
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,326
You can take it for granted.

741
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,205
But let me tell you,
if you didn't, if you couldn't...

742
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,435
be with the person
that you love,

743
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:25,763
I guarantee that...

744
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:28,570
hearing him promise
to love you and...

745
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,528
honor you and cherish you,

746
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,865
no matter what, it would be
pretty much all you could think about.

747
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,446
Wait, can you say that again,
just slowly?

748
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:49,971
You're talking about Denny,
right?

749
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:52,068
Yeah.

750
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:15,172
Hi.

751
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:16,562
Hi.

752
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:18,824
Can I buy you a drink?

753
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,005
Wow, you're forward.

754
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:24,676
Bad day.

755
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,225
I get to be forward today.

756
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:28,535
Yeah, I had a bad day, too.

757
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,041
So what do you say, one drink?

758
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:38,886
I'm with some friends.
It's a bachelor party. So...

759
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,384
I'm gonna...

760
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,121
I'm gonna say no.

761
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:51,053
That's too bad.

762
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:57,005
Maybe you're right.

763
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,995
Rebecca Pope.

764
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:33,667
That's my name.

765
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:47,080
Adele, come on.

766
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,874
Now you've got me
in this ladies' room.

767
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,153
The least you could do is an--

768
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:00,021
Oh, my god. Adele.

769
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,329
- What are you doing here?
- Sweetie, get Rina some water.

770
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,250
I thought you guys were
going to the bus station.

771
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:08,330
- We were.
- It's this heartburn.

772
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,648
It's like it's--
It's ripping through...

773
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,742
Call an ambulance.

774
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:19,968
Tucker, uh, since he's awake,
can you put him on?

775
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,208
Let me call you back.

776
00:41:24,726 --> 00:41:25,787
Nicole, what have you got?

777
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:29,580
We got the fourth climber.
Pressure's 70s, last pulse 135.

778
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,385
Severely hypothermic.
Started two large-bore I.V.S.

779
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:34,611
Oh, and, uh, obvious head trauma.

780
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:38,969
Is that an ax in his head?

781
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:43,179
What the hell happened up
on that mountain?

782
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:44,386
Let's go!

783
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,235
Somebody help me!
Please!

784
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,106
Somebody help!

785
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,756
Please, somebody help me!

786
