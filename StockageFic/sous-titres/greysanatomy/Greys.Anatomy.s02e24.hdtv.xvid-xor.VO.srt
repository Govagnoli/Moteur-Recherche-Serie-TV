00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,200
i slept with george.It was a horrible mistake.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,500
I have no interest in obstetrics or gynecology, dr. Shepherd.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Your ass is mine until i say otherwise.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,900
So we spent the night at callie's last night.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,700
So i figured we'd just spend the night here.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,100
Oh, hi.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,600
You're falling for a vet.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,900
I'm also dating. You.If you still want to.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
I got home. He was listless and hadn't eaten all day

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
oh, no. Let's have a look.
Hey.

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey. Is he sick again?

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,300
Yeah.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>We all go through life</i> <i>like bulls in a china shop...</i>

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>a chip here, a crack there,</i>

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
<i>doing damage...</i><i>to ourselves,</i><i>to other people.</i>

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
So, uh, i don't cook.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Nobody asked you to cook.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
I know.I'm just saying that,you know, i don't cook.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,500
So you don't have to cook.I don't expect you to cook for me.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,600
Okay. You... sit there.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,400
Sit down.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,600
I wa you to drink this and try <i>really</i> hard

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
to act like you aren't scary and damaged.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm not scary and damaged.
Yeah, you are.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,400
No!I'm not scary or damaged.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,700
Mm-hmm. All right.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,600
Then why don't you tell me about your family?

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Okay...

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,700
me not wanting to talk about my family

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,700
does not make me scary or damaged.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,800
Okay.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,300
Tell me about the last guy you slept with.

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>The problem</i><i>is trying to figure out</i>

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,700
<i>how to control</i><i>the damage we've done,</i>

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,100
<i>or that's been done to us.</i>

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,600
What did you say to him?

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
Nothing. I fled the scene.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
(muffled voice) you didn't tell him about george or derek?

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,800
Nope.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
Hmm. You like him.

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
I could like him.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,300
Is the sex any good?

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,400
I don't know.

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,700
Four dates and two sleepovers at his place, and no sex?

46
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,600
Not even a kiss good night.

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Oh, i am proud.

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm like a proud mama.

49
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Shut up.

50
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,800
Mornin'.

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>Sometimes the damage</i><i>catches us by surprise.</i>

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,400
Oh, my god.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,300
Did that just happen?

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm having a seizure.I'm <i>clearly</i> mid-seizure.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm seizing.
Oh, my god.

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,700
She didn't even wash her hands.

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,000
oh, my god.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
<i>Sotimes we think</i><i>we can fix the damage.</i>

59
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,500
All i'm saying, george,is if she needs to pee, she could at least wear a bra.

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,200
Or maybe wait till she's alone.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,900
And for the love of everything sanitary,could she just washer hands?She's a surgeon.

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,600
You said yourself you guys were blocking the sink.

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,700
Anyway, i think you're exaggerating.
She peed. Naked peeing.Ask meredith.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,900
Oh, that's right, i forgot.You're not talking to her.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,300
If you were, she would tell you that callie crosses the line.

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,900
So across the line.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
It's so freakin' crossed.

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh! We're still pretending that you're not seeing a patient, right?

69
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,000
People, what's with all the evil misery, huh?

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Live and let live.

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,900
You're cheerfu

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,300
oh!

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,700
You are.
Come on.

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
How's that possible?

75
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:25,700
I scrubbed in on a 4-hour paraesophageal hernia last night,

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,800
then i got laid,

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,400
and now three ambulances are coming in full of bloody,broken car crash victims,
all who need to be<i>cut open.</i>

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,200
So i'm cheerful.I'm cheerful...

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>and sometimes the damage</i><i>is something we can't even see.</i>

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Sorry, sir.

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey.How's my dog?

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,900
Much better.Finn's running tests.
Good.

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Our dog.

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
What?

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,300
Our dog. You said "my dog."

86
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
He's our dog.

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,900
Yeah, whatever.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,900
Are you mad at me or something?

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,300
Now is not the time.

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,500

I'm still alive, baby.

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
My wife's side took all the impact.

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
Her parents were in the other car.

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Some jerk slammed into them and then they slammed into us.

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,400

Mercy, no, i am fine, really.The air bags went off.

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
If you could just check on my baby and the rest of my family and my husband.

106
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Noah, you saw mama breathing, right?

107
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
And daddy...where the hell's daddy?

108
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Mama and daddy are still alive, right?

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400

Sir, i need to clear your spine.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
My spine is fine and you can sew up my head later.

126
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't call him big jim.

179
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,100
The family,they call him big jim.

180
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Stupid hicks.

181
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,900
Really? Being southern makes you stupid?

182
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,600
Do you know that he owns half of alabama?

183
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, i bet he even washes his hands after he pees.

184
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
That's uncalled for.
Hey, this is a place of business.

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
Uh, discharge the mother,discharge the father.
Yes, dr. Bailey.

186
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Karev, get the husband to the o.r. For surgery.

187
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Dr. Karev, there you are.You're supposed to be up on o.b.g.y.n. Rounding on my patients.

188
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, yeah, i got paged.9-1-1.

189
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Pregnant mom. Car accident.Very serious.

190
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
Pity. I've got three surgeries on the board.

191
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,500
I was gonna ask you to scrub in, but...

192
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,700
i guess you should stay by that pregnant lady's side all day.

193
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,500
You' see to it,dr. Bailey?

194
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Karev, go find your patient.

195
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,700
Stevens, scrub in on noah's patella fracture.

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,300
The she-shepherd just walks in here and pulls me off surgery?

197
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,400
You burn the she-shepherd, she burns back. Go.

198
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,900
The c.t. Won't hurt the baby or nothin', right?

199
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,600
No, it won't hurt the baby or nothin'.

200
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, on three.One, two, three.

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
I was havin' a shower today.A baby shower.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
That's why mama and daddy are in town,

203
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,000
'cause i'm having a baby.

204
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,700
How nice is that?

205
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,100
Nice.

206
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,500
Isn't it?

207
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,700
Mm-hmm.

208
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,600
What are you doing here?

209
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm captain of the vagina squad.

210
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh, this nice man is gonna take care of you now.

211
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,300
And he really likes to talk,so chat away.

212
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,800
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Not cool, yang.

213
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,200
What does she mean, "captain"?

214
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
And what kind of squad are you on?

215
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,600
Uh, you shouldn't be reading your own chart.

216
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,300
Well, i want to find out what caused me to swerve my car into oncoming traffic

217
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,000
and not be able to remember it.

218
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,700
Hey, those people, the ones i hit,they're gonna be okay, right?

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
No serious complications?

220
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,900
They're still checkin'em out.

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Dr. Torres.
Yeah.

222
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I was told you're performing the noah reynolds' surgery.

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,300
Yes.

224
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,700
Well, i'm your intern.So whenever you're ready...

225
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,100
okay, well, head up and prep the o.r.I need to put on  splint.

226
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,700
did you wash your hands?
hat?

227
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,500
You washed your hands, right?

228
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Of course i washed my hands.

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
No, no, of course you did.

230
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,100
Uh, marshall, this is gonna hurt a little bit, okay?

231
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,200
My e.t.o.h. And tox screens were pristine, so i wasn't drinking...

232
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Or under the influence.Ow.

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, we get the c.t. Result back yet?

234
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,100
Not yet.

235
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,800
My g.c.s. Was 13.Why haven't i had a c.t.?

236
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Dr. Grey.

237
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,700
C.t. Was backed up.And he's lucid now, so...

238
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
so get it done, now.

239
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Hey.

240
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,600
Daisy duke's case was boring me to tears.

241
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
So, um, you got any good hearts that i can cut open?

242
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,600
Or, you know, bad hearts that we can make good?

243
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Burke...

244
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,700
use words.

245
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,200
You fell asleep.

246
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,700
When?

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
This morning in the on call room.

248
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,500
I fell asleep after we,you know.

249
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,300
Not after. <i>not</i> after.

250
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Oh.

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh, l-i'm... sorry.

252
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,000
L-i was really tir...seriously, seriously,my bad.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm really sorry.

254
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,600
Don't let this threaten your manhood or any...
oh, this is not...

255
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,400
i am very confident in my manhood.

256
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,900
Thank you very much.
Well, good, you should be because, i mean...

257
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,900
i fell asleep because i had already finished.

258
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Twice.

259
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,100
I hadn't finished.

260
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,900
I was tired.

261
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,800
It's not like i did this on purpose.

262
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh, did you stay in the hospital last night on purpose?

263
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,000
Because you weren't even on call.

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,400
It was a paraesophageal hernia.I had never seen one.

265
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,100
You know what? I'm a surgeon first, just like you.

266
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
No, no, not just like me.I am a <i>person</i> first.

267
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Someone paged me.

268
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,200
Denny!

269
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,500
He collapsed.

270
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,200
What happened?

271
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Too far, too fast.

272
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,300
What were you doing?

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,700
Stairs.

274
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,900
Real bright, huh?

275
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,700
Okay, your lvad battery is almost dead.

276
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,500
Um, get him to his room.I'll get dr. Burke.

277
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay, let's get him up.

278
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,400
Nice and easy on one, two, three.

279
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,800
Denny, you knew the lvad wasn't a cure.

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,700
I want to go home.

281
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,100
I want to go home yesterday.

282
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,300
I know this is hard to hear,but that's just not an option at this point.

283
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Since when do you get to decide what's an option in my life and what isn't?

284
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,300
My heart may be on your battery packs,

285
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,700
but it's still my heart.

286
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,500
It's my decision.It's my damn life.

287
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,800
That's right.

288
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,100
It is your life.

289
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,600
And it is your life that is at stake.

290
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,300
And it is your life that will end

291
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
if you continue to push like you did today.

292
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,400
You said the lvad would make me better.

293
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,200
I told you the lvad would buy you more time, nd it will

294
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,800
if you respect its limitations and your own.

295
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,900
I wanna go home.

296
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,400
What do we do?

297
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,700
Put him on a tight leash.

298
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,900
And tell the nurses to keep an eye on him,

299
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,400
make sure he doesn't take any more endurance hikes in the stairwell.

300
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah. But...

301
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,600
preston, what do we do?

302
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,900
The damage to his body we can try to control,

303
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,400
but the damage to his spirit...

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
for a man like denny

305
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,700
to lie on this bed for years on end?

306
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
That's not something we could really understand.

307
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,200
And his feelings about it

308
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
aren't something we should try to control.

309
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,900
Give him room, izzie.

310
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Just give him room to grieve.

311
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
you finally got melanie to shut up.

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
Finally. Thanks for that,by the way.
How's she doing?

313
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Images coming up now.

314
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
oh, is that a teardrop fracture?

315
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah, no head bleed though.That's good.

316
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,100
Look at her lungs.
Is that her liver?

317
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,900
whoa.
How is she alive?

318
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,800
Karev, page shepherd, burke,montgomery-shepherd, the chief

319
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,200
and every surgeon with an available hand and get an o.r. Opened. Go!

320
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Melanie. Me...

321
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
Get me a stretcher and let's pull her outta there now.

322
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,500
(miranda) melanie.

323
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,200
Hey.

324
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
Have you seen izzie?

325
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,500
She was supposed to prep an o.r. For noah's surgery,and she completely bailed.

326
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
What?

327
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Mr. And mrs. Johnson.

328
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,100
Dr. O'malley.

329
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,900
Oh! That little girl right there says she's gonna fix noah's leg all by herself.

330
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Dice que ella sola arreglar* la pierna de noah.And she just gave him a big ol' shot for his pain.

331
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,500
I really like her.

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,800
Mr. And mrs. Johnson.Big jim.

333
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Is it... mel?

334
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes, ma'am, it is.

335
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,100
What? What?

336
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
When your daughter came into the e.r.

337
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Her body was over-pumping her bloodstream with adrenaline,

338
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
which kept her conscious and alert and, uh, pain-free.

339
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,300
During the c.t. Scan,she was lying still for an extended period of time,

340
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
and so her body relaxed

341
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
and the adrenaline stopped flowing, which...

342
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,300
allowed her to succumb to the full extent of her injuries, which...

343
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
they're catastrophic.

344
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Excuse me?

345
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,500
Good. Bovie.

346
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,600
More suction here.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,600
Clamps.

348
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,900
Internal saw.

349
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
Karev, sit down.I can't see.

350
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,700
The only thing i want you to do is sit at that fetal monitor

351
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,000
and watch that baby's heartbeat.

352
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
So now i'm a baby-sitter?

353
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,500
Retractor.

354
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,900
Addison,

355
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
we're ready for you.

356
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,200
We are going to do absolutely everything we can.

357
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,700
Uterus is protected.Baby's heartbeat?

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
146.

359
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,400
Okay, the baby's safe.

360
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,400
You can proceed with the mother.

361
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Lungs are damaged pretty badly.

362
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,400
Pressure just bottomed out.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's transfuse.

364
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
4-quadrant packing.

365
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
Come on, people.Get me some lap pads.

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
cross-clamp the aorta.
clamp.Got it.

367
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,600
There's too much bleeding.She'll never last. Shepherd?

368
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,900
Damage control.
addison?

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,600
If you want the baby to live, damage control.

370
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,000
Burke?

371
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
Damage control.
Everyone knows the rules...

372
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,900
we're going to move as rapidly as possibl

373
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,300
don't worry about finishing repairs.

374
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,100
For now, we're on crisis management, people.Just get it done.

375
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,700
Once she reaches the triangle,we stop, no exceptions.

376
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,700
What is he talking about,"triangle"? What triangle?

377
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,000
Blood stops clotting,her muscles produce acid and her organs get cold.

378
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
We're talking about the triangle of death.

379
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,200
A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

380
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,600
What?

381
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
I scrubbed in on a...an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

382
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,700
It's a 12-hour surgery.

383
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,200
I'd already worked 30 hours, but l...

384
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
i didn't want to miss it.

385
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,400
I fell asleep for...a second behind the wheel.

386
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,100
Closed my eyes for a second at the red light...

387
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
a second.

388
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Was only 12 hours.

389
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
I've done it before.

390
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
We've all done it before.

391
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Dr. Grey.

392
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,300
Meredith.

393
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,300
Meredith.

394
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Does this mean, uh...

395
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,600
are we actually saying that, uh...

396
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,400
today, this morning,

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,800
because i stayed in the o.r.To save a life...

398
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
i may have killed a pregnant woman?

399
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
dr. Grey.

400
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
You ordered a c.t. On marshall stone?

401
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,800
We're gonna need a moment here.

402
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm backed up here with five patients.

403
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
We need... a moment.

404
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
marshall?

405
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Marshall?

406
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Izzie, please.

407
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,500
Come on, denny, just...izzie.

408
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,100
Smell. Smell.

409
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,900
Chocolate. And not the crappy,processed waxy kind,

410
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,300
but the really good swiss chocolate that you get at the gift shop that costs way too much money,

411
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,400
<i>but</i> is totally worth it.Try it.

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,800
And exhibit "b"...tabloids.

413
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Good, old-fashioned, trashy celebrity gossip rags

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
that are guaranteed to take your mind off your troubles.
Damn it, izzie,stop it.

415
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Just stop it.

416
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,700
You think i'm feelin' sorry for myself, right?

417
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,300
Poor sad-sack denny just needs a little perspective.

418
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,800
You do need a little perspective.

419
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
You have no idea

420
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,300
what is to lose what i have lost.

421
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
I know loss, denny.

422
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,100
No, you don't!

423
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm a man.

424
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm a strong, virile,horse of a man,

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
stuck in the body of some weak, sick bastatard

426
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,100
that i don't know, like recognize.

427
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,900
Now if you knew what that feels like,

428
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
you would've never convinced me to let a battery run my heart.

429
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
If you knew what it feels like, izzie...

430
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,300
you woulda let me go.

431
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,500
systolic's 82, folks.It's not getting any better.

432
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,900
how's the spleen,chief?

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
unsalvageable,i'm afraid.

434
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,800
Karev?

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Frequent decels and loss of variability.

436
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
the baby's fading.

437
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
ph is down 7.1.Core temp, 93 degrees.

438
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,500
Okay, we've reached the triangle, people.

439
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Hands out.

440
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,700
Damn it, stop.Everybody, stop.

441
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Cristina.

442
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Slow, erratic,but it's a heartbeat.

443
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
The baby's holding steady.

444
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Bring out the plastic.

445
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Plastic?We're not gonna close?

446
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,900
No, we're gonna keep her open,

447
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,600
cover her with plastic and get her to the i.c.u.

448
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,900
and then what?

449
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,000
And then we're gonna see if she survives.

450
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,900
How in the hell do you let a patient get that far off your watch?

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
I turned my back for a second.

452
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,100
He was in the damn gallery!

453
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,100
He's a surgical intern at mercy wt, and he...
i don't care if he is the surgeon general.

454
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
In this hospital,he is a patient

455
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
with a head injury who needs a c.t.

456
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
In this hospital,he is a scared guy

457
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,700
who does not need to see the massive internal injuries of the woman he rammed with his car!

458
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,800
This is your fault.You had him and you lost him.

459
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,700
You gotta take responsibility for your actions for <i>once</i> in your life.

460
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,200
Derek!

461
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,800
we've given her medications to help her blood clot and to help counteract the acid buildup.

462
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,300
We're slowly raising her body temperature with warming blankets,

463
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,700
warmed i.v. Fluids and blood products.

464
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
How long is she gonna have to be like that?

465
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,600
You know with...open like that?

466
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,700
We want her to regain as much strength as possible before we operate again,

467
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,400
but at the same time,we want to repair the damage as soon as possible,

468
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,300
so it's a balancing act.

469
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Uh, i'm sorry.

470
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I don't quite know what you mean.

471
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
Melanie will die

472
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
if we don't get her back to surgery soon enough,

473
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,100
and melanie will die if we take her back to surgery too soon.

474
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,600
A balancing act.

475
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,700
A balancing act.

476
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
yang, call me if she starts actively bleeding.

477
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
Karev, where are you going?

478
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,900
What? She's in i.c.u. There's nothing i can do.

479
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,400
You can sit there with her and watch that fetal monitor.

480
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,100
You can't be serious?She's circling the drain.

481
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,700
You know how long a baby can survive inside its dead mother?

482
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Four to five minutes.Minutes, not seconds, karev.

483
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Look at melanie.

484
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,700
Look at her.

485
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,300
And now look around.You see all the doctors and the nurses,even her parents?

486
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,600
Their sole job is to take care of melanie.

487
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
My job is to care for that baby.

488
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,100
Now i've got a surgery scheduled,so when i step foot on that elevator and leave,

489
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,700
you are gonna be the only person on this entire floor responsible for that baby.

490
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>Do not</i> let me down,karev.

491
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,800
her organs are bleeding,damaged, exposed

492
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
and covered in plastic wrap.
Poor marshall.

493
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,200
I mean, one minute,you're a surgeon,the next, you've destroyed an entire family?

494
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Last month, i fell asleep in the parking lot on a bench. I literally couldn't even make it to my car.

495
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,800
I fell asleep at a restaurant

496
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,200
at a table while i was on a date.

497
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,900
Yeah, well, i fell asleep <i>during</i> sex.

498
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,700
Izzi

499
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Callie's looking for you.

500
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,500
You blew off her surgery.

501
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,400
No, l-i had a patient.Denny. L-i had to go.

502
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
You were hanging out with denny?

503
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Oh, please, do not even talk to me about standards.

504
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,300
The girl can't even wash her hands.

505
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,800
Don't worry about bambi.

506
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,000
If burke can forgive me for falling asleep during sex,

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
then george can forgive you for crying.

508
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
But burke hasn't forgiven you.

509
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I fod izzie.She said she had a patient.

510
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
I knew you'd take her side.

511
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,300
What?

512
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,600
He needs an i.v.

513
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Are you...

514
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,300
she's mad at you.

515
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
L-i didn't know you were awake.

516
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
What'd you do?

517
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,800
Uh, has...has anyone talked to you about your wife,about what's happening?

518
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,100
"What's happening"?Uh...

519
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,200
yeah, you know i can't really,uh, wrap my brain around what's happening.

520
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,100
You know,i'm... i'm from here.

521
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,700
Uh... seattle.

522
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:57,000
And, uh, you know,i go away to college,and i come back married to this big-haired,

523
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
drawlin' southern girl.

524
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
And everyone i know thinks i'm crazy,

525
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
but i love her.

526
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,500
And i just...

527
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,100
i love her.

528
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,200
And, uh...what's happening

529
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,000
is that my...

530
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,300
big-haired, southern girl

531
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
could be dying.

532
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,400
And... i can't think about that.

533
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,400
You know, i need to...i need to think about something else,

534
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:37,200
something that doesn't matter so much, something that doesn't... doesn't have me burying

535
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,600
my 22-year-old wife and baby.

536
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,500
So, uh, so...what the hell did you do?

537
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,900
I believed my friend when she told me that dr. Torres doesn't wash her hands.

538
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,700
Well, i hope that's not true,

539
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,800
seeing as she just, uh,

540
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
performed surgery on me and all.

541
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

542
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,200
You paged me?

543
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,300
C.t. Results.

544
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
Good. Thank you.

545
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,800
All right, let's see what we got here.

546
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Marshall,everything checks out fine.

547
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,000
The short-term memory loss was a result from the concussion.

548
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,900
To be safe, i want to keep you here overnight for observation, all right?

549
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,100
I have to apologize.

550
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,400
What?

551
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,100
To the woman's family.

552
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I have to tell them i'm sorry for what i did.

553
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,400
You should get some rest.

554
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,500
I never should've told you about george.

555
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
No, it's fine.I'm glad i know...

556
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,800
about him and the vet.You really get around.

557
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,000
What did you just say to me?
It's unforgivable.

558
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,500
I don't remember ever asking you to forgive me.

559
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,800
So was the knitting a phase?Who's next... alex?

560
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
Cause i hear he likes to sleep around.

561
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
You two have that in common.

562
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
You don't get to call me a whore.

563
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
When i met you, i thought i had found the person

564
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
that i was going to spend the rest of my life with.

565
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,700
I was done.

566
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,900
So all the boys and all the bars

567
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,600
and all the obvious daddy issues... whcared?Because i was done.

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
You left me.

569
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,800
You chose addison.

570
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm all glued back together now.

571
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,600
I make no apologies for how i chose to repair what you broke.

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
You don't get to call me a whore.

573
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,100
This thing with us is finished.

574
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,500
It's over.

575
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,600
Finally.

576
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Yeah. It's done.
It is done.

577
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,500
her temperature is 95.4 degrees. And her ph is 7.28.

578
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
Definitely clotting better.

579
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
But some of the wounds are still oozing.

580
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,600
Still a fine line.

581
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,200
she may not be quite stable enough.

582
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Y'all don't have to whisper.

583
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm sitting right here.I can hear you anyway.

584
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,200
And she's my baby.

585
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,100
She's my little girl.

586
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
It's a big decision like this,

587
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,200
uh, goin' back in and sewing up her... organs.

588
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,400
It's the kind of decision that a mama oughta be involved in.

589
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,600
I mean, all her life,she's asked me everything...

590
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,300
from... what color dress she oughta wear to her kindergarten dance 
to what she oughta name her baby.

591
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,400
'Cause i'm her mama.

592
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,700
And it's my job to have an opinion, and... it's my job to have an answer.

593
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,600
Well, i may not have an answer here, but i'm still her mama.

594
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,400
Y'all just don't have to whisper.

595
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,300
All right.

596
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,500
what do you think,dr. Bailey?

597
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think...if we wait much longer,she'll go into multiple organ failure.

598
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Okay.

599
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,300
If it's all right with you,mrs. Johnson,

600
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,000
we think it's time to get back in there and finish what we started.

601
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,500
okay. I'm done.

602
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,900
yang, get in here and start washing out the abdominal cavity.

603
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
Bleeding is controlled in the chest.

604
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,700
I had to resect a part of her lung, but...
fetal heart rate's down to 80.

605
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,700
Uh, mom's heart rate's slowin' down.

606
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,700
ruptured retroperitoneal hematoma.

607
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,600
She's bleeding out.
Idioventricular rhythm.

608
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Do we have a b.p.?

609
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,900
Trying to run it.

610
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,800
Nothing's registering.
yang, get your hands in here and hold pressure.

611
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,300
Fetal heart rate down to 60.

612
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Heart's fibrillating.
dr. Webber, can you see the source of the bleed?

613
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,300
Give me the internal paddles.

614
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
We're losing the baby.
Charge to 20. clear.

615
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,100
we're chasing our tails here.Get addison shepherd.

616
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Melanie's crashing.
It's right there.

617
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,400
You hear me?She's crashing.

618
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I'm elbow-deep in a pient's uterus, karev.

619
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
What do you want me to do,leave this womanand her child to die?

620
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
I'm doing my job.

621
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,600
And i'm doing mine.

622
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,200
Do what you can. I'll be there as soon as i can.

623
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,400
Okay, people,let's speed it up.

624
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,600
they'll know where to find us...

625
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
when there's news?

626
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,100
They'll know we're in here?

627
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,500
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay. Okay.

629
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,500
I mean, is there something i should be doing,someone i should talk with or something?

630
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,500
You're doing everything you can do, big jim.

631
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,700
i know this isn't the best time,

632
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,500
but marshall would very much like the chance to apologize to the family

633
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,700
if they'll let him.

634
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,300
He's one of us, george.

635
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
shepherd's still in surgery.I told her to hurry.

636
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,700
how's her heart?

637
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,600
Asystole.

638
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,500
How long has she been down?
Five minutes.

639
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,400
we need to do a c-section.Glove me.

640
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,600
I need to get that baby out.

641
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Tell me what to do.

642
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,100
Yang, you're going to...

643
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,400
hold the intestines.

644
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,100
I'll expose the uterus.
Call pediatrics.

645
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
Open the uterus with a midline vertical incision.

646
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,700
Make sure you don't cut the fetus.

647
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,500
okay, go.

648
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,500
Baby doesn't look good.

649
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
How are we doing on the mother?

650
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,900
Oh, she's still bleeding pretty profusely.

651
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,100
I can't get it controlled.

652
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,100
Burke?

653
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
She's not coming back.

654
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,400
Let's stop.

655
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,600
time of death... 1948.

656
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,500

please...

661
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,900
you're gonna get in trouble.

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
I don't care.

663
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,100
I'm not gonna cheer up for you.

664
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,100
You don't have to cheer up.I'm not here for me.

665
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm here for you.

666
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,100
Okay?

667
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay.

668
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,300
<i>We're all damaged, it seems.</i>

669
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
<i>Some of us more than others.</i>

670
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,400
You must be tired.

671
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,800
Yeah.

672
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
i'm tired, too.

673
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,900
<i>We carry the damage with us</i><i>from childhood.</i>

674
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,900
<i>Then as grown-ups,</i>

675
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,800
<i>we give as good as we get.</i>

676
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
good work, karev.

677
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,200
Yeah.

678
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,400
Kid's alive...without a mother.

679
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,100
<i>ultimately,</i><i>we all do damage...</i>

680
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,400
see you at home?

681
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,300
Yeah.

682
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,900
Okay, see you.

683
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Okay.

684
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,200
<i>And then we set about</i><i>e business of fixing</i>

685
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,600
<i>whatever we can.</i>

686
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,400
izzie.

687
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Hmm?

688
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,300
Would it be wrong for me to feel you up right now?

689
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Mm, not so much.

690
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,100
you're such a dirty boy.

691
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
i know.

692
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
i washed my hands.

693
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,400
L-i went down to the kitchen and i washed my hands.

694
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
I didn't wash my hands in the bathroom

695
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,200
because those girls were staring at me like i was a rodent or something,

696
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,900
like i was in high school,like i was having the naked dream,

697
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,600
only it was actually happening.

698
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,000
I didn't even know they were home.

699
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
I washed my hands.

700
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
you have to stand up for me.

701
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,600
You have to say i washed my hands.

702
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,100
i'm sorry.

703
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,300
you're driving me crazy with the hovering.

704
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,000
This could be a mistake.

705
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,300
This. Us.

706
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,600
You... you're...

707
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,800
you're a really nice guy, and... and, well...

708
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,200
you... you don't want to get involved with me.

709
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,300
If you knew me...

710
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,200
scary.

711
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Finn.

712
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
And damaged.See, i told yo

713
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
if you knew me,

714
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,700
if you knew my family,

715
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,300
if i told you the guys that i've slept with lately,

716
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,300
the scary and damaged may actually be more than you can handle.

717
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
my mother's dead.

718
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,100
She got cancer when i was 10,

719
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,800
and she suffered for a really long time,

720
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,500
and then she died.

721
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,100
My father never recovered.

722
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,400
It was kinda like he died with her,

723
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,200
except his body's above ground

724
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,600
and permanently placed in front of the tv

725
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,500
with a bottle of scotch in his lap.

726
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
The last woman i slept with was my wife.

727
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,200
But she died, too.

728
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,200
It was a car crash, so it was quick.

729
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
She didn't suffer, which i appreciated.

730
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Don't worry.

731
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm thinking my luck is beginning to change because... i've met you.

732
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,600
And you like dogs and you enjoy pony births

733
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,900
and you have the ability to save lives.

734
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,700
i never said i wasn't scary and damaged, too.
