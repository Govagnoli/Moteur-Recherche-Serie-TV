1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:01,869
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:03,972
I had sex last night,
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,479
But the thing is,
it didn't fell wrong.

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,962
This is our secret, okay?

5
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,174
We heard about your mother.

6
00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:10,714
We're here to make sure
you're okay.

7
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:13,093
What if my husband shows up
tomorrow with a picture of

8
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,328
what I'm supposed
to look like, but it's too late,

9
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,397
I'm stuck with the wrong
face for rest of my life?

10
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:20,193
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,694
- Are you gonna invite me?
- Where?

12
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:23,168
- To the wedding.
- Please leave.

13
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,315
<i>A patient history,</i>

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>is as important
as their symptoms.</i>

15
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:32,435
<i>It's what helps us decide
if heartburn's a heart attack,</i>

16
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>if a headache's a tumor.</i>

17
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,064
<i>Sometimes patients will try
to rewrite their own histories.</i>

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,457
<i>They'll claim they don't smoke</i>

19
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,991
<i>or forget to mention
certain drugs,</i>

20
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,258
<i>which, in surgery,</i>

21
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,244
<i>can be the kiss of death.</i>

22
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:55,844
<i>We can ignore it all we want...</i>

23
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,044
<i>But our history...</i>

24
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:02,716
<i>eventually always comes back
to haunt us.</i>

25
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,569
Meredith, she'll accept
a certain amount of help,

26
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,254
and then she start
to feel suffocated.

27
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:15,188
Oh. Is this...
Am I suffocating?

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,885
No. The groceries are just right.

29
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:19,618
It's... It's me.
I sometimes overdo it.

30
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,364
Well, who could blame you
with everything?

31
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:22,780
After Ellis died,

32
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:25,034
I gave her some time,
but I want to be here.

33
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:27,676
- I want to help make things easier.
- Good. Yeah. That's great.

34
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:29,751
I just try to keep it light.
You know, be helpful.

35
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,045
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:33,820
- Want some coffee?
- Yes.

37
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,337
This all you?

38
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,562
I just picked up some things
to restock your fridge.

39
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,140
Well, you bought groceries last week.

40
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:42,403
Yeah, you have to get it
every week if you want more.

41
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:45,700
Well, thank you.

42
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,705
It's unexpected, and you
didn't need to do all this.

43
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,834
- Is this for everybody?
- Absolutely.

44
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:53,226
I gotta run.
I'm gonna go talk to Richard

45
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,953
before things get too busy
in the hospital.

46
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,207
- See ya.
- Are you gonna talk to him about the...

47
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:58,972
Yeah. Wish me luck.
You don't need it.

48
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,578
Just make him listen to you.

49
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,090
You deserve to be chief.

50
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,855
Nice sweater.

51
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,423
Uh... my wife.

52
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,675
- What?
- My wife,

53
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:17,926
she gave it to me.

54
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,259
The sweater.

55
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,061
Actually, it's my ex-wife.

56
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:25,763
- It's amicable.
- I'm sorry?

57
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,650
The divorce, it's... it's amicable,

58
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,946
very friendly.

59
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:31,542
I'm a friendly guy.

60
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,928
- "I'm a friendly guy"?
- Sloan.

61
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:44,115
She pressed five
and got off at three.

62
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:47,008
She'd rather walk up two flights
of stairs than flirt with you.

63
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,318
Hell, she'd rather climb up
the outside of the building.

64
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,478
- I wasn't flirting.
- You're telling me.

65
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,359
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

66
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:58,861
Time for you
to shake off the rust

67
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,016
and get back in the game.

68
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,645
- You need a wingman.
- I have patients to see.

69
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,517
We'd make a great team.

70
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,849
Nothing like a quick
ventricular reconstruction

71
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,182
to jumpstart your morning, eh?

72
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,315
Okay, you're officially
becoming creepy,

73
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,319
creepy and... stalking.

74
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,746
Burke and I have set our date.
We're getting married next month.

75
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,282
We both know that
you are not the marrying kind.

76
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,288
You don't know that.
You don't know me anymore.

77
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,656
Well, just to be sure you're...

78
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,661
fully aware of
what you're passing up.

79
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:26,875
I'd like you to assist me

80
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,401
on my heterotopic
heart transplant today.

81
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,696
What, a piggyback transplant?
Seriously?

82
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,409
Burke will want to scrub in,
too, I imagine,

83
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:37,551
see how it's done.

84
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,340
Heterotopic transplant.
He is upping his game.

85
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:43,883
I need a gambit.

86
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:45,904
I need to force him
into the defensive.

87
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,000
Take his queen.

88
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,456
- You've never played chess?
- I'm not a geek.

89
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:51,813
I've gotta crush him.

90
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,381
I've gotta annihilate him
at his own game.

91
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,395
So it's weird, right,

92
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,160
that susan keeps stopping by
like this?

93
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,739
I mean, we just became friends
or semi-related

94
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,796
or whatever you call
your estranged father's wife.

95
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:03,030
You may be confused since you
were basically raised by wolves,

96
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,351
but this is what mother's do.

97
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:06,276
They stop by,
they stock the fridge.

98
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,152
Dude, you think
she might do our laundry?

99
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,861
Hey, get your own fake mom.

100
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:11,885
Hey.

101
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,530
- Bad night on call?
- Oh, god.

102
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,918
Yeah, when my patient's
gooey abscess

103
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,571
exploded all over me
at 4:00 A.M.,

104
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,051
- that was a highlight.
- Holy mary, mother of god...

105
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:23,974
Pray for us sinners now and at the...

106
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:25,409
Iz, you look nice.

107
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:28,258
Did you just come from
confession in a church?

108
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,448
Shut up.

109
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,380
Izzie Stevens does penance.
You did something bad.

110
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,976
Oh. I feel like poo.

111
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,044
I hope I can make it through
the day without falling asleep.

112
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,771
Do you want to make a coffee date?

113
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,893
3:00 P.M.
You could use a little pick-me-up.

114
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:45,814
Yeah. That sounds nice,
really nice.

115
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,382
- Good
- Okay.

116
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,625
Smile.

117
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:57,460
Oh, come on, man.
That's not a smile.

118
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,530
Can I see?

119
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,539
That's me?

120
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,180
Oh, my god.

121
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:06,372
I know this is gonna sound terrible,

122
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,562
but I'm not bad-looking.

123
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,909
I think beautiful
is the word you're looking for.

124
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,569
I was gonna say hot.

125
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,437
I was too
but I would've gotten in trouble.

126
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,390
- You would've.
- Still a little swelling.

127
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,483
In a day or two,
I'll raise that hot to smokin'.

128
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,754
Then shouldn't we wait
to take the "after" pictures?

129
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,493
We could,
but the sooner we take them,

130
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:22,620
the sooner we get them
out there.

131
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:25,288
Your picture's gonna be everywhere.
The police, the news, the internet.

132
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,188
But my face looks
completely different,

133
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,991
then what good
would pictures do?

134
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,122
I was able to maintain
aspects of your bone structure,

135
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,730
so your face bears some
similarities to your old face,

136
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:36,081
plus, your... your hair
and your eyes are the same.

137
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,497
You think... Do you really think
someone might recognize me?

138
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,906
I think you should smile.

139
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,150
I'm telling you,
this confession thing,

140
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,774
it... it really works.

141
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:49,812
It's like we have a do over.
Our sin is gone.

142
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,512
So you don't have to keep avoiding me.

143
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,418
Yeah, I do.
Until this thing blows over, I do.

144
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,118
Javier Ruggero?

145
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:59,073
Javier, uh, Ruggero?

146
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:00,779
Blows over?

147
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,488
What does that even mean?

148
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:03,622
When Meredith and I, uh...

149
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,009
eventually, you know,
it blew over. It passed.

150
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,408
You mean the sad sex?

151
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,285
The sad, tragic,
depression-inducing sex

152
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,962
you had with Meredith is the same

153
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:11,979
- as what...
- I can't.

154
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:15,903
Okay? Back off.
Just for now, back off.

155
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,140
Javier... Ruggero?

156
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:21,924
You're Dr. Isobel Stevens?

157
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,388
Yes.

158
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,974
Uh, if you're Mr. Ruggero, though,
you're with Dr. O'Malley.

159
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,140
Uh, Dr. Stevens...

160
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,314
We, uh...

161
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,102
Our d... Our daughter has leukemia

162
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,215
and needs a bone marrow transplant.

163
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,200
You, uh,
you're looking for hematology.

164
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,255
It's third floor west.
Through these double doors,

165
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,003
second set of elevators on the...

166
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:41,099
on the right.

167
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,886
I'm so sorry
about your daughter.

168
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,501
But Seattle Grace
has one of the best

169
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,698
bone marrow transplant centers
in the country.

170
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,444
If you'd like, I can
take you up there myself.

171
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:51,581
No, no, it's just that...

172
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,327
You look so much like
our daughter.

173
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,138
We're Dustin and Caroline Klein.

174
00:06:58,783 --> 00:06:59,976
We're Hannah's parents.

175
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,374
We're her...

176
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,180
We're your daughter's parents.

177
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,446
You're Hannah's birth mother.

178
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,568
Hannah was diagnosed
a few months ago

179
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,995
with acute
myeloid leukemia.

180
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,897
We, uh, we looked you up,

181
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,289
and we know that
that's wrong, but...

182
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,479
She needs the transplant.
We... We were set to go.

183
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,622
- We had a donor.
- Yeah, her donor died.

184
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,737
The registry called
Hannah's oncologist last night.

185
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,061
'Cause apparently
Hannah hasn't had enough bad luck.

186
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,276
And we'd never ask.

187
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,041
We had no intention
of bothering you, ever.

188
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,797
But last night,
everything changed.

189
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:37,700
No. Of course.

190
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,212
Of course I'd donate. It's just...

191
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:46,045
A biological parent
isn't usually a good donor.

192
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,332
I'm only a half match.

193
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,772
Hannah would probably do better

194
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,655
getting back on the donor list
and waiting.

195
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:54,670
I know...

196
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,068
When you gave her up,

197
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:59,962
we promised
to take care of her,

198
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,211
to keep her safe,

199
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,469
but I-I can't protect her
from this.

200
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,320
It's genetic.

201
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,555
You have to take care of her.

202
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,761
Every day we wait,
she gets sicker.

203
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:12,358
And... And if we're lucky,

204
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,537
you... you could be better
than a half match.

205
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:19,689
Is she...

206
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,301
She's here?

207
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:26,943
God, she must be scared.

208
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:28,971
She's upstairs
with my mother.

209
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:31,537
Can I...

210
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,470
I'd... I'd like to meet her.

211
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,790
We... We'd have to check with Hannah.

212
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:41,823
But if she agrees,

213
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,029
of course we'd be okay with it.

214
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,964
Isobel...

215
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,346
Our daughter could die.

216
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,219
Charles...
This is Dr. Burke.

217
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,381
I've invited him to assist
on the surgery.

218
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,198
- How do you do, Dr. Burke?
- Oh, you're playing yourself?

219
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,947
It distracts me from the fact
that you're going to have

220
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:08,994
your hands in my chest
in a few hours.

221
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:11,937
And this, Charles, is
a former student of mine...

222
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,720
A formidable chess player
herself... Dr. Cristina Yang.

223
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:16,495
Soon to be Dr. Cristina Burke.

224
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,013
we're getting married next month.

225
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,750
Congratulations.

226
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:21,877
Thank you, sir.

227
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,785
Perhaps you'd like to explain...

228
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,386
The procedure, Dr. Yang.

229
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:27,437
Absolutely.

230
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,083
Mr. Redford,

231
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,115
instead of replacing
your current heart,

232
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,030
we're going to attach it
to the new heart,

233
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,383
essentially piggybacking it.

234
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:38,220
The two hearts pump together,
share the workload.

235
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,252
It's, uh...

236
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:40,790
It's a perfect team.

237
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,762
More accurately,

238
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,768
the new heart will circulate
blood to the body,

239
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,747
while the native heart
will pump blood to the lungs.

240
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,841
More of a divide-and-conquer
approach.

241
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,099
Wouldn't you say, Dr. Yang?

242
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,168
Sounds risky?

243
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,290
All surgeries carry
a degree of risk,

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,296
but Dr. Marlowe pioneered
the procedure.

245
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:00,407
And Dr. Burke is one of the foremost
cardiothoracic surgeons

246
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,896
- in the country.
- I'll be the one on point, of course.

247
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,529
So you've nothing to worry about.

248
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,553
You've picked the best man
for the job.

249
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:10,814
What was that?

250
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,890
That was my smug,
passive-aggressive,

251
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,003
limey ex-boyfriend
trying to show me

252
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,356
I picked the wrong guy.

253
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,106
I-I know,
and I'm fine with it

254
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,702
as long as I'm learning something.

255
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,420
I was actually talking about you.

256
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
What was that?

257
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,981
You're gonna have to put up
with me

258
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:26,896
being nice and sweet
for a little while.

259
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,208
That'll be a nice change of pace.

260
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,854
Shut up.

261
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,197
That's more like it.

262
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:34,974
Hey, I saw Ava.

263
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,383
She looks terrific.

264
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,927
Yeah, yeah, she does.
Sloan kicked it out.

265
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:41,215
Yeah, well, you had something
to do with that, too.

266
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,445
Just doing my job.

267
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:45,552
Jeez.
You cannot take a compliment.

268
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:48,566
Well, I just don't want
people thinking...

269
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:50,539
What, you're trying to build
the perfect woman?

270
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,545
Dr. Montgomery,
the police just called.

271
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,315
They're on their way over.
They think they found Jane Doe's family.

272
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,824
I'm sure you felt that you need to be
even-handed when you announced

273
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,903
you were looking for someone
to take over as chief.

274
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,730
Give everybody a shot
at the brass ring.

275
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,195
I did.

276
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,487
- Can we drop that ruse soon?
- It's not a ruse.

277
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:07,948
You promised me the job
when I came here.

278
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,176
- It's why I came here.
- No you came

279
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,449
'cause your marriage fell apart,
you'd to get the hell outta dodge.

280
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,105
We had an understanding,
now you're having me

281
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,110
jump through hoops with
other attending in this hospital.

282
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,917
And I hear you're giving
Marlowe special privileges

283
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,990
to do a piggyback surgery.

284
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:19,652
This is a teaching hospital, Derek.

285
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,965
My interview didn't go
as well as I had hoped.

286
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,530
I would like your support
with the board.

287
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:29,070
You know my credentials.
You know I'm ready.

288
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,961
- I only have one vote.
- It's a strong vote.

289
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,435
I'm not feeling well.

290
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:40,299
What's wrong
with that girl?

291
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,637
Look, I can't talk to you
when you're making all that noise,

292
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:55,805
so pull it together
and get out here.

293
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,011
Now.

294
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:13,929
I have an 11-year-old daughter.

295
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,619
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

296
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:22,469
I'm potentially a good match.

297
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,259
Please don't tell anybody.
Please.

298
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,128
This isn't a chapter
of my history that...

299
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:29,183
I understand.

300
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:36,537
She's here...

301
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:38,790
My kid...

302
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,961
And I'm supposed to go
up to pediatrics

303
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,961
and meet her right now,
and...

304
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,945
I mean, I've thought
about this moment...

305
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,823
what I would look like...

306
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,769
What I would say.

307
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,081
But I thought I would be older,

308
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,297
more together, more mature.

309
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,381
I thought she would be older.

310
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,795
And I never thought
that she would be sick.

311
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,567
Oh, god.
I don't know what to do.

312
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,985
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

313
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,394
We love our Shannon,

314
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,521
but we never got along
wither husband.

315
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,203
- So she has a husband?
- Had.

316
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:31,227
One day while she was at work,
he packed up and disappeared.

317
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:34,163
He didn't want a baby.
But she went after him,

318
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,602
even pregnant like that.

319
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,058
We hadn't heard from her
in months,

320
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,794
and then today
we saw her picture on TV.

321
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,153
Mr. and Mrs. Waring, uh,
the woman we found,

322
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:43,870
- if she is your daughter...
- Well,

323
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:47,026
her nose is different,
and her chin, but they said that

324
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:49,966
they said that her face had been,
you know, changed.

325
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:52,051
Do you happen to know
your daughter's blood type?

326
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,901
She's B-positive.

327
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,963
Any medical conditions,
surgeries we should know about?

328
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:59,780
Um, she had her tonsils out
when she was 12.

329
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,550
It's her, isn't it?

330
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,124
It's Shannon.

331
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,362
Susan.

332
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,930
Meredith, hi.
I'm so glad I found you.

333
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,867
- Twice in one day.
- Is this a bad time?

334
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,173
I know you're always busy, but...

335
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:17,356
Yeah, no, I'm busy.
I'm at work.

336
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,036
Okay, I was, um...

337
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,537
You know I'd really
just love to talk with you.

338
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,751
I would love to find a time
for you and me to sit down...

339
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,967
I'm sorry. This is too much.

340
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,225
Way too much.
You keep showing up.

341
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,535
I cannot be your daughter
or your charity case

342
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,288
or the thing that you need to fix.

343
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,330
- I'm not trying to...
- No, no.

344
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,945
Stop talking, okay?

345
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,212
Stop mothering.

346
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,658
Just stop.

347
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:44,105
<i>She is mid-30s,
brunette and 8 months pregnant.</i>

348
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:46,095
<i>If you recognize her, please...</i>

349
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,046
My glamour shot's
been on the news

350
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,406
at least a dozen times already.

351
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,549
Admit it...
You're gonna miss me

352
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,467
when my fancy family
shows up to take me away.

353
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,370
You don't know they're fancy.
Open up.

354
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,331
Why, what's wrong
with my throat?

355
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,068
How would I know?
I haven't even seen it yet.

356
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,002
- Now open up.
- No, not till you tell me...

357
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:03,560
Wait.

358
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,668
Someone has recognized me,
haven't they?

359
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:10,943
Alex... Alex, you have
to tell me who it is please.

360
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,049
Their daughter's blood type
is B-positive.

361
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,694
She's your age.
She's pregnant.

362
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,243
Your height, your hair color,

363
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:17,961
and she has no tonsils.

364
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,928
So now are you gonna open up?

365
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,710
Yes. Please tell me
I have no tonsils.

366
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:22,912
- Say ah.
- Ah.

367
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,599
No tonsils.

368
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:28,595
Shannon?

369
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:31,398
Mr. and Mrs. Waring,
I asked you to wait.

370
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,192
- I have tests to complete...
- Alex...

371
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,155
It's okay.

372
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:36,959
Your name...

373
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:40,594
Is Shannon Marie.

374
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:43,127
Marie was my mother's name...

375
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,257
Your grandmother.

376
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:48,769
Shannon Marie.

377
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,915
Okay, discharge
beds one and three.

378
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,183
Two needs a social worker.

379
00:15:58,202 --> 00:15:59,610
Hold this down for me,
O'Malley.

380
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,450
- I'm gonna be out for a while.
- Why?

381
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,593
- What's going on with Iz?
- What's going on with Stevens

382
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:05,936
is none of your concern.

383
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,859
What is your concern?
Sick people...

384
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:10,432
All these sick people...
until I get back. Understand?

385
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,317
Dr. Bailey, just did
a consult in trauma one.

386
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,649
The guy has a perf.
Can I scrub in?

387
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,160
No, you cannot scrub in.

388
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,963
Uh, you're here
with O'Malley for now.

389
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:24,677
Hey, what's wrong with Izzie?

390
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,655
Beds 7 through 13.
Start with number 8.

391
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,233
He doesn't have
much bladder control.

392
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:31,891
First, Mr. Redford,

393
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,088
while Dr. Marlowe is
preparing the surgical area,

394
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,806
I will be examing
the donor heart.

395
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,066
Actually, I'm sorry.

396
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:38,503
I'll examine the donor heart.

397
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,573
I want to be sure
the I.V.C. Orifice is oversewn.

398
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,153
Well, carry on.

399
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,711
Then I'llopen your chest
and put you on bypass,

400
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:52,285
at which point we will
connect the left atrium

401
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,764
- then the right atrium...
- Superior vena cava.

402
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,412
It simplifies the subsequent
cardiac biopsies.

403
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,200
You didn't read my article
in the...

404
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,435
"cardiothoracic monthly" last year.

405
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,061
Did you? Huh?

406
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,986
Well, I think Cristina
has a copy of it.

407
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,967
- Cristina, may i?
- Oh, of course.

408
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,772
Oh, what on earth is that?

409
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,054
Oh, testing colors.

410
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,736
For the big day, I assume?

411
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:19,167
I'm thinking, um...

412
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,008
coral.

413
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:24,156
Chief, come here.
I want to show you something.

414
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,358
I'm busy, Sloan.

415
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,626
I need an update on my patient
in room 3129.

416
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:28,894
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

417
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,688
Okay. I have that right here.

418
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,544
I like those sneakers.
You a runner?

419
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,016
Yeah.

420
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,161
Me, too.

421
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,720
Maybe we should
go running some time.

422
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,415
Sure.

423
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,957
Anything else I can
help you with, Dr. Sloan?

424
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,919
No. All good.

425
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,334
Wingman.

426
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:54,888
Wingman.

427
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,976
Hannah is in there right now?

428
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,112
She is.

429
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,235
You see her,
you'll know what to do.

430
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,613
Must be nice to know
she has parents like this,

431
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:13,721
who fight for her,

432
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,198
think about what she wants,

433
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:18,198
try to make her happy
like you would've.

434
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:24,792
Doesn't mean you don't want
that girl to want you.

435
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:38,937
I'm...

436
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,870
She's so, so tired.

437
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,637
We left it up to Hannah,
and, uh, she's just not ready.

438
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,440
- I'm sorry.
- We don't want to force it.

439
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,251
Maybe another time?
When she's feeling better.

440
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,264
No, of course.

441
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:51,780
I understand.

442
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,864
I'm sorry,
but... the transplant?

443
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:00,487
Stevens.

444
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:04,480
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

445
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,523
Your girl...

446
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,814
You can want her
to want you all day long,

447
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:09,988
but she has to be here

448
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,772
if she's ever gonna have
that chance again.

449
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,247
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,772
Of course. Yeah.
I'm ready. Let's get started.

451
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:25,112
Hey, guess what.
I'm a teacher.

452
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,233
I teach second grade
at north bend elementary.

453
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:30,867
- Oh
- Or at least I did until...

454
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,907
You can get your job back
whenever you want.

455
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,621
They love you there. When will
we be able to take her home?

456
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,726
You want to take her
back to...

457
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,829
North bend.
We've got a room all setup for her.

458
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,953
Your mom's got all of your books
and your letters and diaries.

459
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,697
- I kept diaries?
- About 800 of them.

460
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,883
So even if you don't
remember everything now,

461
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:49,300
you will.

462
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,200
Hear that?

463
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,086
I can go, right?

464
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,937
Well, you're still getting
I.V. antibiotics,

465
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,150
and we're monitoring the baby
very closely right now.

466
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,073
Yeah, but you can
make it happen, right?

467
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,638
Come on, Alex. Don't doctor me.
Help me get outta here.

468
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,332
Dr. Montgomery's got you
on strict bed rest until your delivery.

469
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,400
But I'll ask. Maybe...
Maybe you can do it from home.

470
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,672
Home. Wouah.

471
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,459
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:22,370
- You okay? You look...
- Horrible. I'm in a horrible mood.

473
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:23,417
I yelled at Susan.

474
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:25,859
I think I scared off
my fake mommy forever.

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Mm. Need cheering up?

476
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,389
No.

477
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,587
Me either.
It's gonna be ok.

478
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,558
- You think?
- Yeah, Susan will be okay.

479
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:42,806
How'd it go with the chief?

480
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,364
Uh, about as well
as you and Susan.

481
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:45,745
Wow. We make a good team.

482
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,461
I've been waiting for you

483
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,390
in really-old-guy's room
for 20 minutes. What gives?

484
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,417
Sorry. We decided
to eat down here today.

485
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,097
- Nobody told me.
- Anybody...

486
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,229
Move.

487
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,051
Anybody know
what's going on with Izzie?

488
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,070
Something's going on.

489
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,941
Why don't you
just ask her yourself?

490
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:07,861
Fine. I would if I knew
where she was.

491
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,180
I brought you lunch.

492
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:14,951
You've got stuff
on your hands.

493
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:16,955
I'm trying to scare away
cardio god.

494
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,175
With pretty, pretty fingers?

495
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,988
He takes my rook,
I take his bishop.

496
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,372
Hey, pouty head.

497
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,603
Oh, are you so sad 'cause no-face
girl's family is taking her home?

498
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:26,837
- Really? Someone claimed Ava?
- Yeah, her parents.

499
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,129
- She must be so relieved.
- Yeah, unless they suck.

500
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:31,768
Can you imagine, you can't remember
a family and they show up,

501
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,909
and it turns out
they're psycho killers?

502
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:35,086
Or over sharers.

503
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,495
Whatever. She's a patient.

504
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:38,805
I don't give a crap who her
parents are, where she goes.

505
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:39,960
Can we move on?

506
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:41,979
One second.

507
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:44,926
What's up with Izzie?

508
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:47,207
- I told you, it's none of your concern.
- No, it is my concern.

509
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:48,259
I demand to know.

510
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,406
I hope I didn't just hear you
say youdemand.

511
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,950
Well, are you her father?
Are you her husband?

512
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,152
Then stay here and keep
yourmind on your job.

513
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:58,185
You hear me?

514
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,117
Grey.

515
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:04,271
Uh, look, I need to be upstairs,
so...

516
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,069
do not let this
out of your sight.

517
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:10,181
Walk this to the lab,
watch the lab run the test,

518
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,102
bring the test results
directly to me, nobody else.

519
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,153
It's Izzie.
What's the matter?

520
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:21,167
You will be discreet and not ask
a bunch of questions.

521
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:25,129
Now this is a private matter.
She needs these results now.

522
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,735
Okay.

523
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:38,169
Wow.
That's a big needle.

524
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,093
It's standard.
You should start to feel

525
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:43,074
numb about ten minutes after
I inject the lidocaine, okay?

526
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,677
Yeah. No, I know.
I've given epidurals before.

527
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,142
I know that's the needle.

528
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,035
It's just that somehow
it seems so much bigger

529
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,419
now that it's going into my spine.

530
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,182
- Little stick.
- Oh, my god.

531
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,529
You sure I can't call someone?
One of your friends?

532
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:57,408
You're gonna need somebody
to hold your hand.

533
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:00,451
No. Thank you.

534
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,953
Look, you sure?

535
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:09,705
Yeah, well, I can take
a lot of pressure,

536
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,034
just...
It's rough as sandpaper.

537
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:15,792
A little pressure.

538
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,618
Tell me where she is.

539
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,280
I can't. If she wanted you to know...

540
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,388
She does. She just...

541
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:28,416
We're just having
one of our stupid fights.

542
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,582
You know how wrong it is
if she's really in trouble

543
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,460
and I'm not there
because we're being idiots?

544
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:36,296
Come on.

545
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:37,972
Meredith, please.

546
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,777
She's upstairs in procedure room "A."

547
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,541
- That's all I know.
- Thank you.

548
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:50,852
So...

549
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:53,049
Dr. Montgomery says
you can take your daughter home.

550
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:55,216
But she wants to talk to
her local O.B.-G.Y.N.

551
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,659
There are some things
she wants to go over

552
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,559
- before we release her.
- I can't.

553
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,483
Okay. Well, I can go through
all this with your husband if...

554
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,182
No, you don't understand.

555
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:06,748
I can't take her home.

556
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,548
That girl is not my daughter.

557
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:19,727
She does look
an awful lot like shannon.

558
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:23,373
Sometimes
she even sounds like her.

559
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,544
You know, with the surgery
and, uh, the loss of memories...

560
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:30,344
A mother knows her own child,
Dr. Karev.

561
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,006
And that is not my child.

562
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,463
- But your husband, he's...
- Look,

563
00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:36,897
if that's not Shannon,
we still don't know

564
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:39,019
where our girl is.
Do you understand?

565
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:41,132
He needs it to be her.

566
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:44,854
How am I supposed to tell him?

567
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,356
How do I tell either of them?

568
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,389
- Mrs. Waring...
- Dr. Karev...

569
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,623
Would you ask my husband
to meet me in the lobby?

570
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,668
- You need to face her.
- Please...

571
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,443
Tell her I'm sorry.

572
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:03,143
Things have changed.

573
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,984
No, no. Nothing has changed.

574
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,354
I deserve your support, Richard.

575
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,336
Tell me I have it. That I didn't move
to Seattle for nothing.

576
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:10,339
You moved to seattle to start
a new life,

577
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:12,364
and you did.

578
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:14,308
You have a fantastic woman

579
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:15,875
- who love you.
- It's not bout my personal life.

580
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:17,356
- But my career.
- You know what being chief

581
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,380
will do to your life?

582
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:20,793
Why the hell do you think
I'm getting a divorce

583
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,027
or dyeing my hair?

584
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:26,295
You can't do it all,
not if you want to be chief.

585
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:27,891
- You couldn't do it all.
- Neither can you.

586
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,335
Don't put your mistake on me.

587
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:31,256
Don't. I am the best candidate
for this job.

588
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,492
You know it and I know it
and that is the only factor

589
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,003
you need to take
into consideration.

590
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:37,153
I don't need your protection,
Richard and I don't want it.

591
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:38,844
I'm not trying
to protect you, Derek.

592
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,205
I told Ellis...

593
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,343
I promised her that I would
look after her daughter.

594
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,540
O'Malley,
did Stevens ask for you here?

595
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,977
No! No, I did not.

596
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,275
- Then you need to turn yourself...
- You're giving bone marrow?

597
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,246
- This is a private matter.
- I'm not leaving.

598
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:07,116
- George.
- No.

599
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,161
Make me.

600
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,832
Sorry, I'm starting now.

601
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:15,376
Just let me know when you're
gonna do stuff, okay?

602
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:18,555
You're okay.

603
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,390
I got it here.

604
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,508
Fine. Stevens, I'm going.

605
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,143
Unless you need me
to call security.

606
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:33,040
I'll manage.

607
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,886
Thank you.

608
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:45,222
You said back off.

609
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:48,005
You didn't tell me you were having
a hole drilled in your damn hip.

610
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,270
For who?

611
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,570
What's this private matter?

612
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:59,937
Okay,
I'm going in when you're ready.

613
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,369
Yeah?

614
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:13,018
Hey, Callie.

615
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,957
So if you could
just take these two,

616
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,566
- then that'll free me up...
- Oh, no.

617
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,030
I'm not here to work. I'm...

618
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:20,690
I'm, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

619
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,950
I haven't slept in like 2 days,

620
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,263
and,
I'm actually looking for George.

621
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:24,803
We're supposed to meet up
for coffee.

622
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:28,522
- So...
- He's, uh, with Izzie, I think.

623
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,790
So if you're not here to work,

624
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,630
I'm st gonna take these back.
Thanks.

625
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:37,674
15-blade.

626
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:40,586
Suction, please.

627
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,258
Dr. Burke, you're not using

628
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:47,310
the superior-transseptal approach
for the atriotomy, are you?

629
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:48,508
Is that a problem?

630
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,344
Not at all unless your intention
is to kill the patient.

631
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:55,598
Dr. Marlowe, from what I've read--

632
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,967
Reading about a procedure is one thing

633
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,633
and performg it,
is quite another.

634
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,650
It was my mistake.

635
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,468
I should never have allowed
you to scrub in.

636
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,200
I think it best
from this point on

637
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:05,533
that you simply observe.

638
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:12,724
Suction, please.

639
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,545
Hurry up.

640
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,544
You should use the wheelchair.

641
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:23,929
- You're gonna be sore.
- I'm aware.

642
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:26,370
I'm fine now. Thank you.

643
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,696
Uh, you mean pantless but fine?

644
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:31,236
Crap.

645
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,815
Stand.

646
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:04,055
- I got it.
- Okay. Okay.

647
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,089
Hannah...

648
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:20,352
An 11-year-old girl.

649
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,164
That's the private matter.
She's mine.

650
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,402
Don't...

651
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,834
Don't look at me.

652
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:34,946
My mother wanted me
to keep her.

653
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:39,739
But I knew... even at 16...

654
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:41,880
I knew that baby
deserved better

655
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:45,488
than life...
at a Chehalis trailer park.

656
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:49,018
And now she's here and...

657
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,655
And she might be dying and
she doesn't want to meet me.

658
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,124
Oh, crap.

659
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:07,073
I didn't think I really cared
until she said no.

660
00:30:10,297 --> 00:30:11,313
How about that?

661
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,312
I can say hail marys until...

662
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:29,028
Until I turn into mary,
but I still miss you.

663
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,245
Not the...

664
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:35,957
the sex.

665
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:40,068
It was not tragic,
George.

666
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,856
But I'll live without it.

667
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,201
I won't make it
if you can't be my friend.

668
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,051
If we can't...

669
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,087
What you did today...

670
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:03,418
You should be proud.

671
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:09,985
I'll get an orderly
to take you downstairs.

672
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,516
But I have to go.

673
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,758
You understand?

674
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,329
Some surgery.

675
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,932
- And Colin was...
- Brillant.

676
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,506
He's a gifted surgeon.

677
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,214
Listen, I had a question.

678
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,528
When you moved the atrium
to the vena cava,

679
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,796
why did you switch
from 3-0 to 5-0 sutures?

680
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:13,397
You want to use
the finest sutures you can

681
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,725
for vascular structures.

682
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:18,594
A delicate tissue
demands a delicate touch.

683
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:21,153
Right.

684
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:22,890
That makes sense.

685
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:24,374
Thank you.

686
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,073
Of course.

687
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:29,283
- I'll see you at home?
- Yeah.

688
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:41,978
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

689
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:44,269
We've been playing
our little game all day long.

690
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,632
But what I just saw...

691
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:49,036
that was real.

692
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,905
The question you asked him
about the sutures,

693
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,083
that was from my paper
the paper you helped me write.

694
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:54,516
You already knew the answer.

695
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,129
The Cristina Yang I knew...

696
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,273
was concerned with excellence.

697
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,143
She would never play the part
of the helpless girl

698
00:33:05,144 --> 00:33:07,096
trying to build up
a grown man's ego.

699
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,902
- What has become of you?
- I have learned that sometimes

700
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:11,692
you have to think about
other people.

701
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,896
You've compromised yourself.

702
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:14,976
No.

703
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,043
I'm going home.
You're right.

704
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,080
It's senseless,
coming here,

705
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,726
chasing after a job
that was beneath me

706
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,451
just so I could be near
a woman who...

707
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:28,036
a woman who apparently
no longer exists.

708
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:35,407
Best of luck...
With the wedding.

709
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:50,586
No, there they are.

710
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:55,272
- Come on.
- I can't. I-I can't.

711
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,427
You look. Please.
You look for me.

712
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:58,591
Okay.

713
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:05,136
she's getting the infusion.
You did it.

714
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:06,930
Is she, um...

715
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:09,208
How does she look?

716
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:11,537
You can...
You can see for yourself.

717
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,368
It's okay.
She can't see us from here.

718
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:22,647
She's got your eyes...

719
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,844
And your mouth.

720
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:30,433
That means she probably
talks a lot and eats a lot then.

721
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,272
If she's in pain,
she's not letting on.

722
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:41,853
Man, she's tough.

723
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:05,077
That's her, George.
That's Hannah.

724
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:11,381
She's beautiful, don't you think?

725
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,860
She's really... beautiful.

726
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,937
Yeah, she's a heartbreaker.

727
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:30,049
Need some help with that?

728
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:32,068
I know you didn't
just wander in here

729
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,552
to help me change
pillowcases.

730
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:36,652
You warned me
she could become a problem.

731
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:37,769
Who, Meredith?

732
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,073
You know, you love somebody,
you think you can handle it all.

733
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,735
You've done all right.
Both of you.

734
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:45,331
I came out here to be chief,

735
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:47,928
and Meredith complicates that.

736
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,196
Well, if this turns
into an either/or,

737
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:53,093
you pick the person you love,

738
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:54,297
end of story.

739
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:58,364
Look, all of this means nothing
if you're alone.

740
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:11,166
Oh, crap!

741
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,778
Our coffee.
I'm... I'm sorry.

742
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:15,668
I've... I forgot.
I got...

743
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:18,703
- I got so busy...
- Oh, yeah? With what?

744
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:20,777
Oh, j... the clinic,

745
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,871
patients and...
Well, you know how it is.

746
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:27,350
Oh, man.

747
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:31,484
Yeah, I know how it is, so...

748
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,072
I'm really tired.
I'm really, really tired.

749
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,724
So I'll just...
I'll see you at home.

750
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,220
Solitaire.

751
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:46,830
My dad taught me.
That sounds so weird.

752
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,378
"My dad."

753
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:50,442
Good weird, though.

754
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:53,175
So you and the redhead
gonna let me go home?

755
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:55,795
Or were you too busy making eyes
at each other to even ask?

756
00:36:58,155 --> 00:36:59,160
What?

757
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,267
- Ava...
- No.

758
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:02,910
It's Shannon.

759
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,519
- Listen...
- My name is Shannon.

760
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:06,886
Shannon Marie.

761
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:10,249
I'm sorry.

762
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,117
Those are supposed to be
my people.

763
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:21,196
I belong with them, Alex.

764
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,404
I'm supposed to go with them.

765
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:25,306
Your people, we... we don't
even know who they are yet.

766
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,863
You don't want to find them.

767
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,695
You want to keep me
all to yourself.

768
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:29,785
Well, here I am,

769
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,735
your pathetic
captive audience.

770
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:35,571
Isn't it sad that I'm
the best you can do?

771
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,307
- Ava...
- My name is not Ava!

772
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,458
You made it up!
It's not me!

773
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,227
Get out!

774
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:43,570
Get out!

775
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:50,078
<i>Some people believe
that without history,</i>

776
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:52,436
<i>our lives amount to nothing.</i>

777
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:56,504
Sloan, you brought me to a bar.

778
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,648
- You know I don't drink.
- Which is perfect.

779
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:01,719
Better to keep your mind sharp.
Let the ladies do the drinking.

780
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,920
You think if you get me laid,

781
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,601
I might make you chief.

782
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:11,482
<i>At some point,
we all have to choose.</i>

783
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,829
<i>Do we fall back on what we know?</i>

784
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:21,506
I hear Dr. Marlowe is going home.

785
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:23,318
About time.

786
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:25,221
The fingernails,
the hand holding,

787
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:26,583
well played.

788
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,997
Now you can get back
to being Cristina.

789
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:34,346
<i>Or do we step forward
to something new?</i>

790
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:43,456
<i>It's hard not to be haunted
by our past.</i>

791
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,385
<i>Our history is what shapes us,</i>

792
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:05,699
<i>what guides us.</i>

793
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,065
Seriously?

794
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,790
Okay.
That stops right now.

795
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,068
It's just, I'm... I'm waiting
for Derek, and I'm very tired.

796
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:21,695
I don't care. Let me in.

797
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:23,514
- Excuse me?
- It's freezing out here,

798
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:26,134
and I have been working
myself up to saying this,

799
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:27,633
well, for a while now,

800
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,811
so I need you
to let me in now, please.

801
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:41,224
It's my fault your father
didn't fight harder for you.

802
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:42,689
I knew about you.

803
00:39:42,832 --> 00:39:44,807
I could've pushed him to be
a part of your life.

804
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:47,483
I should've pushed him.
You were a child.

805
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,051
We were the adults.

806
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,871
But we were just married,
and it was new and...

807
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:54,880
That's what I cared about.

808
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,447
And I know the groceries
and everything

809
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:59,578
are a little much,
but that's just what I do.

810
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,903
I mean, quit looking at me
like I'm crazy 'cause that's not fair.

811
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:05,072
I'm just trying to find a way
to be there for you

812
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,649
the only way that I know how,

813
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,698
and if you can't accept that,
fine.

814
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,309
But just stop being so rude.

815
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,905
And I...

816
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,984
Okay.

817
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:19,660
I'm overstepping again,
aren't I?

818
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:21,775
As mothers go,

819
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,780
I've only ever known
overbearing,

820
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:26,517
never overprotective.

821
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,315
This is all new.

822
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:32,640
- It's okay.
- It is?

823
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,019
Yes.

824
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:38,272
<i>Our history resurfaces
time after time after time.</i>

825
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:41,630
Not just surgery,
but chief of surgery.

826
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:43,354
Really?

827
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,058
Oh, well, not for much longer,
really.

828
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:48,442
I'm gonna go...

829
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,737
Over there.
Hold down the fort, chief.

830
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:59,228
So, um, you come here often?

831
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,110
Oh, sometimes. It's on my way
home from bio class.

832
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,496
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

833
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,642
No.

834
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:12,112
Um, it was, uh,
it was nice talking to you.

835
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,177
You, too.

836
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:18,113
The last time I tried
to pick up a woman,

837
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:20,283
I had a harvey wallbanger
in one hand

838
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,038
and an afro pick in the other.

839
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,643
Oh, Richard.

840
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,028
Well, you think about it.
I mean, when you're married,

841
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,683
you'd like to think
you still have game.

842
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:30,946
Practice on me.

843
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:32,741
I'm sorry?

844
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:34,393
Mark's right. I mean,

845
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:35,928
he's wrong about
so many things,

846
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,599
but he is right about this.

847
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,595
You need to get back out there.
So...

848
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:41,529
practice.

849
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:43,578
Addison,
I wouldn't know where to start.

850
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:44,679
Ask me to dance.

851
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,148
Well, there's...
There's no dance floor.

852
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,270
So? Ask me anyway.

853
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,250
<i>So we have to remember...</i>

854
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,158
<i>Sometimes the most important history</i>

855
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,023
<i>is the history
we're making today.</i>
