1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,933
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,531
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

3
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,058
- Are you saying yes?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:07,396
We're married.

5
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:09,533
Adele and I are getting a divorce.

6
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:12,363
Has it even occurred to you
that maybe I'm not interested?

7
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:14,823
I raised you to be
an extraordinary human being.

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,968
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up

9
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,154
after five years and discover
that you're no more than ordinary.

10
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,814
You want to know why
I'm so ordinary?

11
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,061
You want to know what happened to me?

12
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,319
You. You happened to me.

13
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,777
<i>Disappearances happen in science--</i>

14
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,415
<i>Disease can suddenly fade away,</i>

15
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,286
<i>tumors go missing.</i>

16
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,422
<i>We open someone up to discover
the cancer is gone.</i>

17
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:45,846
<i>It's unexplained,</i>

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,644
<i>it's rare, but it happens.</i>

19
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,557
<i>We call it misdiagnosis...</i>

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,299
<i>Say we never saw it
in the first place...</i>

21
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,937
<i>any explanation but the truth.</i>

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,242
<i>That life is full of vanishing acts.</i>

23
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:07,716
<i>If something that we didn't know
we had, disappears,</i>

24
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:09,742
<i>Do we miss it?</i>

25
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:16,196
Meredith.

26
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,776
Meredith!

27
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,438
What are you doing?

28
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,035
- I was taking a bath.
- That's not a bath.

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,595
- I know what a bath looks.
- Drop it.

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,364
Look, your mother--

31
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,938
- Drop it.
- Your mother--

32
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,417
Look, your mother was lucid,
and she said things,

33
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:42,675
- and now she's--
- Gone,

34
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:45,286
and everything's back to normal.
It's not a big deal.

35
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:47,243
Yeah, except she's having
heart surgery today.

36
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:49,327
Hey, do you want me
to talk to the chief?

37
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:52,355
I know you have the triage thing today,
but he'll give you the day off.

38
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:54,302
Stop. I do not need rescuing.

39
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,029
Oh, you would have drowned in
the bathtub if I had not been there.

40
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,226
I'm a surgeon.
I do the rescuing.

41
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,905
You are not my knight
in shining... whatever.

42
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,322
So we're gonna fight because
I pulled you out of the tub?

43
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,279
You have a place.
You could sleep at it.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,484
And then you don't have to
pull me out of the bathtub.

45
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,511
You're everywhere,
all the time, saying things.

46
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:13,881
This is the happy ever after part.

47
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,360
And in the happily
ever after part,

48
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,360
the guy is there,
all the time, saying things,

49
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:18,581
and the girls love it.

50
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,141
Go to work.
I'll see you there.

51
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,841
Just for the record, I am
your knight in shining whatever.

52
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,774
Morning.

53
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,523
I did not try to drown myself
in the bathtub.

54
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:32,631
Hey,

55
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:35,393
I ate everything out of the fridge
last night, everything.

56
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,328
Including a tub of butter.

57
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,564
There's no judgment here.

58
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,659
You ever feel like
you were disappearing?

59
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:45,161
All the time.

60
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:48,203
Why can't I just be that
happily ever after person?

61
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:49,828
Why can't I believe in that?

62
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,872
I don't know what
I believe in anymore.

63
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,064
We're not telling people.

64
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,069
I haven't told anyone.

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,866
I know, I know. Just don't.

66
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,483
I'm not going to, yet.

67
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,774
No, I just-- I-I need to tell
my friends he first.

68
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:13,680
But I have friends here.

69
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,333
Shepherd.

70
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:19,977
No, you can't tell Shepherd.

71
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,080
You cannot tell Shepherd
until I've told Meredith.

72
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:23,188
It would be a thing.

73
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:25,835
You act like this is a disaster.

74
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,904
The world won't implode
if people know.

75
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,387
I will tell them,

76
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:32,638
today.

77
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:33,755
Just...

78
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:35,540
wait.

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,276
Good morning.

80
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,756
Morning. Morning.

81
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,198
What's different?

82
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,466
- Nothing.
- Leave him be.

83
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,356
What happened to your hair?

84
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,552
Nothing.

85
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,637
I'm just saying... Watch.

86
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,144
What happened to your hair?

87
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,430
Leave him be.

88
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,057
He dyed it.

89
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,085
But why?

90
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:28,620
- Leave him be! What--
- What am I doing?

91
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,351
- What?
- Okay, but why?

92
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:37,709
Men who have gray hair are noticed
less than men who don't.

93
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,413
By who?

94
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,293
- Well...
- By the ladies?

95
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,342
- Looks good, chief.
- Oh, very natural.

96
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,009
Ladies will love it.

97
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,654
He is alone...

98
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,485
All alone.

99
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,410
Do any of you even know
what that's like?

100
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:06,058
Lives with Cristina,
dates the perfect 12 year old...

101
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,402
Man-whore...

102
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,462
His wife left him

103
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:12,369
after 25 years of marriage.
So if the man wants

104
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,942
to dye his hair for the ladies,

105
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,679
let him dye his hair
for the ladies.

106
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,628
Leave him be.

107
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,835
It's-- It's weird.
It's weird. It's weird, right?

108
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:27,638
I need more triage tear tags.

109
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,952
Living with somebody
I'm married to is weird.

110
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:32,111
I mean, I'm his boss and his wife.

111
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,635
At work, I'm giving him orders.
In bed,

112
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,588
- he's giving me--
- Stop right there.

113
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,659
I don't need to know this.

114
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,048
I'm tired. I'm busy.

115
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,349
While I will concede you
and O'Malley have some

116
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,606
challenges to overcome,

117
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:45,649
I'm asking you to remember
that this day is a marathon

118
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,616
and my mind can only hold
what it needs to know.

119
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:49,614
Your sex life cannot be held
in my mind today.

120
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,765
Ever. It cannot be held
in my mind ever,

121
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,398
- never.
- Whatever.

122
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,353
Sydney Heron here to lend a hand.

123
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,879
Hey. Hi. Hello.

124
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,176
Oh, Miranda, hey.
Nice clinic. Very nice.

125
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:01,993
Hey, Sydney.

126
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,922
I mean real, real nice.
I mean...

127
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:04,964
Cheerful.

128
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:08,099
No better way to distinguish
yourself for chief resident

129
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,615
than to open
a multimillion-dollar clinic.

130
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,166
Smart thinking.
Strategic.

131
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:13,515
Chief resident?

132
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,354
I myself have used
the time to master

133
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,158
several complex
surgical procedures.

134
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,055
But this is, um,
another way to go.

135
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,445
What is she talking about?

136
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,289
- The chief resident.
- The chief resident.

137
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:24,402
Yeah, for next year.

138
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,069
The one fifth-year resident
that rules all residents.

139
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,819
Oh, she--
Okay, she's cute.

140
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:32,214
She's acting like
she didn't know about it. Cute.

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,735
- I'm not cute.
- I'm on to you.

142
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,416
Okay, I'm a competitor.

143
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:37,643
I bite.

144
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,788
Okay. Well, I'll just
wait for you in the pit.

145
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:10,633
What?

146
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:12,840
Nothing.

147
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:24,730
What?!

148
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,994
Okay, cranky.
Fo-Forget it

149
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,656
Am I the only one who thinks
this triage test is a waste of time?

150
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,225
There's a platysmaplasty
on the board.

151
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,145
I had Sloan all prepped
to let me scrub in.

152
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,138
George, hey.

153
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:36,800
- How's it going?
- Good.

154
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:38,706
You like living in a hotel?

155
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,302
Yeah, it good.

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,888
'Cause your room's still there...

157
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,722
Next to mine.

158
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,077
- Oh, Izzie.
- I'm just saying, if you don't like...

159
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:47,548
the hotel,

160
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:49,766
you can always
just move right back in.

161
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:50,808
You think I'm this

162
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,174
boy that you need to save.
I get that, but--

163
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:57,298
And it-- It would be sweet if--
If it weren't so condescending.

164
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,007
Seriously, is it too much to ask

165
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,871
to be performing actual surgeries?
We are actual surgeons.

166
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:07,413
What?

167
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,206
Nothing.

168
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,682
A lot of arm swelling,

169
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,964
but good distal pulses, so...

170
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,114
We can rule out
compartment syndrome.

171
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:20,090
I suspect a radius fracture,
so I'd splint,

172
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,064
and get an ortho follow-up.

173
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:23,247
Anything else?

174
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,233
- No.
- Okay.

175
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,928
- Then I guess this means--
- Time.

176
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,620
- And I'm dead.
- Dead?

177
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,292
You sent her home. The bone
punctured through her skin.

178
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,647
Yeah, but she had multiple wounds

179
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,491
- and abrasions--
- A puncture over a break

180
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,288
is an open fracture
until proven otherwise.

181
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,598
Yeah, I got septic, and I
died at home thanks to you.

182
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,703
- Oh, whatever.
- Not "whatever" to dead

183
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,806
"minor puncture wound that's not" guy.

184
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,600
You have to be quick
and thorough

185
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:50,933
while using your instincts.

186
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,792
You can't be fooled
by what your eyes see.

187
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,490
If youssess wrong,
your patient could die

188
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,492
while waiting for treatment.
Karev, you're next.

189
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,777
Just think, I've already killed her.
You can't do more damage than that.

190
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,399
People, triage is one of
the most important tools a doctor has.

191
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,151
In a real emergent scenario,
you'll have only minutes.

192
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,613
And it's something you'll be
tested on in your surgical ex--

193
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,542
- Sorry.
- George.

194
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,159
I was just recording the drill.

195
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,409
All right, we're working
George, okay?

196
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,981
- I'm your boss right now.
- Yes.

197
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,674
- All right?
- Yes. A very sexy one.

198
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,801
No. You cannot undermine my authority
in front of the other interns,

199
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:25,294
in front of my peers.

200
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,080
O'Malley, take that back to
the clinic where it belongs.

201
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,065
Sorry.

202
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,842
People. Look, I'm sorry.

203
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,691
I have to interrupt
the session for a moment.

204
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,089
Chief, I like your new hair.

205
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,742
It really brings out your eyes.

206
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,441
Do you need something, sir?

207
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:41,267
We just received word of
a mass casualty incident nearby.

208
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,066
All available level one trauma centers
have been asked to respond.

209
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,235
I need to send a team
into the field immediately.

210
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,658
Is this a part
of the exercise?

211
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,118
Are we supposed to act
appropriately, uh, tense?

212
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,175
This is not an exercise
or a drill, Yang.

213
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:55,116
This is an emergent situation,
and I need all hands on deck.

214
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:56,354
- Seriously?
- What happened?

215
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,057
I don't have details, just orders.

216
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:06,359
Meredith,

217
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,786
I have a thing, news.

218
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,498
You aren't pregnant again,
are you?

219
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,676
'Cause I can't handle
the extra months of bitchiness.

220
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:15,460
We're catching a ride
with seattle 34.

221
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,866
Space is tight,
so hold your kits on your lap.

222
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:18,931
Where are we going?

223
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,077
We'll know when we get there.

224
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,726
Fire, flood, volcano? I'm not
really dressed for a volcano.

225
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,099
- Stevens.
- Sorry. Inappropriate. Sorry.

226
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,854
I'm hauling supplies.
I only have room for five.

227
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,325
- Yang.
- Yes?

228
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,302
Stay with the chief.

229
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:34,836
Take care of the incoming wounded.
The rest of you, come on.

230
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:36,490
Stevens was inappropriate.

231
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,478
Hey, what was your, uh, news?

232
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,802
Just forget it. Forget it.

233
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,178
Oh, everybody, move your I.D's
to the outside of your jacket.

234
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,608
When we get there,
remember, triage.

235
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,502
Karev.

236
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,769
Green tags-- Nonemergent.
Yellow-- Delayed care.

237
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,298
Red tags-- Needs immediate treatment.

238
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,201
Good. Assess carefully,

239
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:21,164
tag and get all the critical patients

240
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,056
into the ambulances
as fast as possible.

241
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,251
Don't get in the way of search
and rescue, and stay calm.

242
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,626
Any word yet on what happened?

243
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,670
All we know is there are
multiple traumas.

244
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:55,516
Holy mother of...

245
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,002
Dr. Bailey,
where do you need us?

246
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,429
Where should we start first?

247
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:43,748
Dr. Bailey--

248
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:45,682
I don't have time
to hold your hands.

249
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,268
You know the protocol.
Go do it.

250
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,372
- Do what?
- Go help people.

251
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:10,589
You need some help?

252
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,306
There's nothing more
I can do here.

253
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:13,809
How did this happen?

254
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,675
It was a fog bank.
Container ship clipped the ferry.

255
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,855
Okay. Take a deep breath for me.

256
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,726
Okay, you're gonna be okay.
Your injuries are minor.

257
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,190
An E.M.T. is gonna come
and take you to the hospital, okay?

258
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,004
Is this your mommy?

259
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:42,833
Who are you with?

260
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,385
Okay, I want you to stay
right here, okay?

261
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:50,418
Stay right here.

262
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:55,747
Did you...
wet your pants?

263
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,734
- That's okay. It happens sometimes--
- Coming through!

264
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,101
It just doesn't make sense.

265
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,607
Ferry boats don't get in accidents.

266
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,214
They're safe.
They're reliable.

267
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,470
The moment
you take one for granted,

268
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,044
along comes a container ship and....

269
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,150
Boom.

270
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,821
I have a thing for ferry boats.

271
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,241
Reschedule, uh, Swanson's,
uh, valve replacement.

272
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,574
We're gonna need the O.R. for
the incoming from the ferry accident.

273
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,906
I mean, this whole day
had just been...

274
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,370
There's something wrong
with Meredith.

275
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,484
I asked her what's wrong.

276
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:45,527
She says nothing.

277
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,579
Then she tries
to drowned herself in the tub.

278
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:48,532
N-Not...

279
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,289
actually drowned,

280
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,242
I don't think.
But something was going on,

281
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,089
and she won't talk about it.

282
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,213
We were fine,
and now it's like...

283
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:59,363
I'm living with a ghost.

284
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,708
- You're confiding in me.
- Yes.

285
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:07,597
Cristina and I are engaged.

286
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,146
Congratulations.

287
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:14,136
I mean, she doesn't want
to tell anyone.

288
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,627
At least not until
she tells Meredith first.

289
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:18,651
Yeah, they're different
than other women.

290
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,514
Pfft, yes, these women...

291
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:22,310
Yes, they are.

292
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,311
You know, maybe we'll never know them.
I mean, really know them.

293
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:26,718
And now you and Cristina are engaged,

294
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,435
- you've got a lot of work to do.
- Right.

295
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,312
You and Yang are gettin' hitched?

296
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,731
There's a mass

297
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,920
casualty incident rolling in, okay?

298
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,166
There'll probably be
some burn victims.

299
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,379
You should be prepared.

300
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,846
Sydney. I-I thought I could take
a few patients off your...

301
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,004
hands.

302
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:00,849
I appreciate the gesture,
Dr. Callie O'Malley.

303
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,330
But the chief asked me to roll
the nonemergent

304
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,621
E.R. cases into the clinic
and take care of them,

305
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,607
so I've triaged these patients,
and so far it looks like a--

306
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,060
A sore throat, a sprain
and a tummy ache--

307
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:11,979
Easy breezy.

308
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:13,392
So the clinic and I are fine.

309
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:16,727
Okay, I'm not, uh, trying
to take the clinic--

310
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,897
Uh, Bailey's clinic,
by the way-- Away from you.

311
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,483
I'm offering to help, so...

312
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:23,181
Your offer to help is duly noted
and very much appreciated,

313
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,376
but I promise you--

314
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,900
Got it all under control.

315
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,208
So... Jason Kaye?

316
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:28,499
<i>Yeah.</i>

317
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:29,569
Fine.

318
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,461
I'll leave you to it
and, uh, find myself

319
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,856
a recently traumatized emergency
surgery to scrub in on while...

320
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:40,658
You stay down here with
your sore throat and your sprain and--

321
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,265
What was the other one?

322
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:43,981
Tummy ache.

323
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:51,925
Jason Kaye?

324
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:04,702
Excuse me, are you a nurse,
a doctor, m-medical something?

325
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,563
- I'm a doctor, but--
- All right, come with me.

326
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,218
Um, no, you-- You need
to get checked out.

327
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,633
There's a treatment area
right over there.

328
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:10,442
Follow me, please.

329
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,756
You've got some really bad burns.

330
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,611
- They need to be treated.
- My buddy's trapped.

331
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,076
He's trapped under a car.

332
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,480
If he's trapped under a car,
you need search and rescue.

333
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,755
They have personnel, their med--

334
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,714
I called them. They're backed up,
and he can't wait.

335
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,950
He's in a real bad way.

336
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,867
Please. He's my best buddy.

337
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:25,569
Please.

338
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:32,076
Shepherd, I need you in the next rig.

339
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,606
- Okay.
- I want you at that scene.

340
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,158
You don't need me here?

341
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,124
They're reporting
lots of closed head injuries.

342
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,223
I want you get in there
and bring 'em back alive.

343
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:41,929
Okay, what's the news?

344
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:43,788
Shepherd and Grey
are on the rocks.

345
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,042
Burke and Yang got engaged.

346
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,630
You need highlights.

347
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,376
In your hair--
That's why it looks so odd.

348
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:01,710
I'm gonna go save lives.

349
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,749
Take him to the treatment area.

350
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,243
They'll fix you up there, okay?

351
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,403
Come on, let's go.

352
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:21,900
I got somebody down here.

353
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,231
Hey!

354
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,930
That's not secure.

355
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:33,827
Hey!

356
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:44,052
Doctor, I need you
to get back up here.

357
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,122
There's a pregnant woman
down here! Just shut the...

358
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,594
Oh, hell.

359
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:48,826
She dead?

360
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:52,535
Yeah.

361
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:10,877
One second.

362
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,962
Hold on. Hold on.

363
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:18,826
Hold on.

364
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,652
Immediate! Immediate!
I need help down here!

365
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,515
He's back. He's got help.

366
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,207
You hear that, Rick?
We got help.

367
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,137
We got a doctor.

368
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,019
You'll be okay now, man.
He's gonna be okay?

369
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:44,535
Right?

370
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,578
<i>... know at this time--
What we can tell you,</i>

371
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,061
<i>is that there have been deaths.</i>

372
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,214
<i>We don't know how many
and we may not know that</i>

373
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,712
<i>for hours or even days.</i>

374
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:04,040
<i>We also know that passengers
are still being evacuated.</i>

375
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,908
<i>A ferry of this size can carry
anywhere up to a thousand or...</i>

376
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,177
All right, you're gonna need
these to handle the influx.

377
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,570
We're gonna need plenty of
available open chest trays,

378
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:12,791
central line kits,

379
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:15,055
- and a difficult intubation cart.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,666
<i>... the smoke and who knows
what damage to the interior.</i>

381
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,282
<i>We don't know
how many people could...</i>

382
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,370
Oh, Yang.

383
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,869
I-I know. Um, communicate
with the scene as need.

384
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,664
No.

385
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:26,514
I heard you were engaged.

386
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,091
Congratulations.

387
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:30,119
Thank you, sir.

388
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,253
All right, go, and remember,

389
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:35,053
We're hoping for the best,
but preparing for the worst.

390
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,742
Right.

391
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,798
You got anyone for me?

392
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:49,384
Uh, yeah, those two need
to be transported, uh...

393
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:50,859
These five didn't make it--

394
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,267
Four adults and one child.

395
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,497
A child?

396
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,971
You found a dead child?

397
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,696
- A boy or girl?
- Ma'am, you're injured.

398
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,461
You need to lie down.
Get a stretcher, now.

399
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,155
Is the child a boy or a girl?

400
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,735
I can't find my son.

401
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,108
We got separated.

402
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,343
I-I need to know
if my little boy is alive.

403
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,244
She was a girl.

404
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,715
The child was a little girl. No, no.

405
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,929
I need to examine you. I'm gonna
have to take you to the hospital.

406
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,080
No, I can't leave!

407
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,859
He's only 7. No! And--

408
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,141
- And he's all alone.
- No.

409
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:16,063
No, I will not leave
my son behind.

410
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,292
No, I will find him.

411
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:18,413
Listen to me.

412
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:19,990
I will find him.

413
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,569
If you let me
take you to triage,

414
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,824
I promise you
I will find your son.

415
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:27,408
- He's so scared.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

416
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,663
I'll find him.

417
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:31,382
Okay?

418
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,452
He's a mechanic. We--

419
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:40,141
We work together. We--
We drive together to work, and--

420
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,894
And suddenly
there was this huge jolt.

421
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:42,702
It was awful.

422
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,735
We're just trying to get outta there.
But Rick went back--

423
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,889
Figured we could help.

424
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,852
We should help.

425
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,248
He went back.
There were people trapped.

426
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,178
He was trying to help.

427
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,894
We were behind him.
We were right behind him.

428
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:53,602
There's injuries to his chest and leg.
It looks like his arm is broken,

429
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,288
and I'd guess there's damage
to his spine and pelvis. I can't--

430
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:59,302
There's-- There's not much that
I can do until we get him out of here.

431
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:03,765
You gotta do what you can.

432
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,764
I mean, we'll, uh...

433
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:09,652
Greg, go find some more guys.

434
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,103
Hey, go find search and rescue, okay?

435
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,529
Give them this.

436
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:15,350
Tell them I said he can't wait.

437
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,787
He has to get to a hospital.

438
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,008
All right, I'm going.

439
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:23,288
Let 'em know he needs a C.T.

440
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,506
Make sure to keep his neck stable.
I felt a step off.

441
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:28,945
Ask for Waller. If Waller's
not available, ask for Krychek, okay?

442
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,245
Keep him stable.
What do you got?

443
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,958
Oh, hey, nurse, let me have some
bandages. Thank you. Stop here.

444
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:34,475
Derek.

445
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,178
Hey, Meredith, you got a free hand?
Hold this bandage for me, will you?

446
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:40,616
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just a lot.

447
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,325
Do you want to get married?

448
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:46,125
And you haven't told me and I haven't
asked, so now we have a problem.

449
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,181
What?

450
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,113
No, I don't want to get married.

451
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:50,146
You want to get married?

452
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,882
No. Good.

453
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:53,615
So if that's not it, what is it?

454
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:55,249
It isn't anything.

455
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,135
Are you good?
'Cause I gotta get this kid triaged.

456
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:01,464
- Okay.
- Let's go. She all right?

457
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,004
Yeah, she's good. She's just lost.

458
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:07,028
Hang in there. You gonna reach
the hospital soon, okay?

459
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:13,517
All the nonemergent surgeries
have been postponed.

460
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:16,231
- Good.
- I'm gonna go check on discharges.

461
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:19,827
I'm trying to free up as many beds
as I can in the surgical wing.

462
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:23,275
- Oh. I was gonna do that, but--
- I can do it.

463
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:25,182
Sure. Good.

464
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,377
- Unless you want to.
- No, no. Go ahead.

465
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:29,681
You're still the chief.

466
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,249
I know that.

467
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,735
It just seems so quiet, you know?

468
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:36,660
Yeah.

469
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,392
We're expecting the first wave
from the scene soon.

470
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,688
I dyed my hair blonde...

471
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:54,493
The day after Derek moved out.

472
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,107
Change is good.

473
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,174
Your marriage is over. You're--

474
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,293
You're starting over.

475
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,664
So am I.

476
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:10,575
Right.

477
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:18,300
I specifically told you

478
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,583
I needed to tell Meredith first.

479
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,332
I was talking to Shepherd, and...

480
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,783
It just came out.
It was no big deal.

481
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,528
It-it is a big deal.

482
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:30,872
Because now she's not even gonna care
about the fact that I'm getting married.

483
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:33,651
All she's gonna care about is
the fact that I didn't tell her myself.

484
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:34,903
Then why didn't you?

485
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,041
There was a major disaster.

486
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:41,761
That was 45 minutes after
we discussed it.

487
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,571
You were with your friends
for 45 minutes,

488
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:47,500
running triage drills, and you weren't
compelled to mention it?

489
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,625
The chief says they're
rolling in soon, so...

490
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:57,692
Her pressure's low--
Barely registering--

491
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,428
And I don't see
any good veins for an I.V.

492
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:02,150
She's all clamped down from hypothermia.
That's why I couldn't find a pulse.

493
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,350
I've never seen a crush injury
so bad and survive.

494
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:07,137
- God, she's a mess.
- She needs to stay on her left side.

495
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,435
We gotta move her on her left side.
It's gonna take both of us.

496
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,626
We gotta get that B.P. up.

497
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,027
On my count.

498
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:16,619
One... Two...

499
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,978
Your baby-- Your baby's okay.

500
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,406
For now it looks okay.

501
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,465
Just try to breathe.

502
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,082
We need to move you to help
with your circulation, okay?

503
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,415
One, two, three.

504
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:37,953
Pulse is already better.

505
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,501
I'll attempt I.V. access again.

506
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,081
Just breathe through the pain.

507
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,603
What you can do for your baby
right now is take care of yourself.

508
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,639
Good girl. I know it hurts.

509
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,627
Come on now.
Keep breathing for me, okay?

510
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:49,073
That's it.

511
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,210
Keep breathin'.

512
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:06,123
Good...

513
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:08,655
Um, what do we...

514
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:10,396
So, what do we do?

515
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:12,123
We wait.

516
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,728
We wait?

517
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,625
We wait.

518
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,905
Okay, we need to find  grown-up--

519
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:35,140
Another grown-up, to help you

520
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:36,797
find your mom.

521
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:46,825
Hey,

522
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,571
uh, Ineed you to take this little girl
to the triage tents.

523
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:50,668
I gotta get back to my unit.

524
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,524
No, I need you to take
this little girl.

525
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,402
To the triage tents for me, please.

526
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,418
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

527
00:26:57,841 --> 00:26:59,436
I promise, okay?

528
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:00,475
Thanks.

529
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:09,047
Help! I need some help over here!

530
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:10,968
Stay right here.

531
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:20,783
How we doing?

532
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:23,900
It's bad. A lot of survivors,
so that's something.

533
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:24,703
Yeah, it is.

534
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:26,290
- Have you seen Stevens?
- No.

535
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:28,269
What about O'Malley, Grey?

536
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:30,101
Grey was-- I saw grey
about ten minutes ago.

537
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:31,654
She was on her way
over here with a kid.

538
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,963
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

539
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,064
No. I gotta head out
with this one, so...

540
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,391
Keep an eye out
for my interns, all right?

541
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:38,884
I'll do my best.

542
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:52,376
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant,
found under a pile of rubble.

543
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,037
She sustained crush injuries
to her right torso

544
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,189
and upper extremities
as well as severe trauma to the face.

545
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,162
B. P. Initially low,
but now up to 90 over 60

546
00:27:58,163 --> 00:28:00,041
after a liter of fluid and
placing her on her left side.

547
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,046
What do we do?

548
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:02,193
Karev?

549
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,996
ABC-- Her airway
needs to be protected.

550
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:08,710
Her breathing will be compromised
because of the crush injury,

551
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:10,158
and we need to have blood available.

552
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,123
I would do a trauma panel,
type and cross,

553
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,759
- ad C.T. of her head and neck.
- Excellent. Let's get her started.

554
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,512
- Trauma room two. Let's go.
- Right away.

555
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,468
One, two and three.

556
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,372
Let's see what we have here.

557
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,222
The baby--
The baby's gonna--

558
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:32,338
Make sure that you shield
her in radiology.

559
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:33,814
We've got to get her stabilized first

560
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,450
before you start worrying
about the baby.

561
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,782
The amount of rads are negligible.

562
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:39,402
Right, but she's gonna need a lot
before all of this is over.

563
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,815
We need to protect them both.

564
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:42,597
Yang, you're on this.

565
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,118
Alex, go to the clinic.

566
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,325
The victims' families are there.
They need answers.

567
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,618
This is my patient. I pulled
her out of the damn water.

568
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,973
Which is heroic and manly,
and you still need to talk

569
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:52,356
to those families right now.

570
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,690
- Why can't Yang do it?
- This is all hands on deck.

571
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,488
Yang can handle this. Now go.

572
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,506
Let's check them and see...

573
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,287
Okay.

574
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,918
He likes fire trucks...

575
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:16,082
And police cars--
Anything with flashing lights.

576
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,751
Carlee Heit, 45-year-old female,
found at the scene.

577
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:21,211
Open abdominal wound
with omental evisceration.

578
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,634
Okay, we need to get her
to an O.R. as soon as possible.

579
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,564
He won't respond
if you call him Christopher.

580
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,807
- He hates that. Just Chris.
- Okay.

581
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,897
- He likes Chris the best.
- O'Malley, what is she talking--

582
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,645
She lost track of her son
in the accident.

583
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,411
Dr. O'Malley and I made a deal.

584
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,019
He's gonna find my son.

585
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:36,727
So I know that chris is okay

586
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:38,004
before I go into surgery.

587
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:40,080
Mrs. Heit, your injury's
extremely serious.

588
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,967
We need to tend to it
as soon as possible.

589
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:44,470
As soon as he's located.
I can't go into surgery

590
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,270
- before I know about my son.
- I'm sure he's here.

591
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,528
- All families are being directed--
- O'Malley, just find the boy

592
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,156
in a hurry,
and we'll start the workup.

593
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,279
I need more gauze.

594
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:18,988
There's no more here.

595
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:23,091
Maybe you could find,
some, uh, paper towels the head?

596
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:24,195
I'll find something.

597
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:25,189
Vince..

598
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,083
Vince, it hurts like hell.

599
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,892
Can you do anything about that?
I mean, can--

600
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,792
- You got anything for the pain?
- I've given him everything I've got.

601
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:34,665
- Where is search and rescue?
- It hurts.

602
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:36,729
What hurts, man?

603
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,699
E-Everything.

604
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,234
Maybe if-- Maybe if
I try to set his arm,

605
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,468
It'll help some with the pain.

606
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,741
What are you waiting for?

607
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,403
I, uh...

608
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:49,750
What?

609
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:52,789
Nothing, just, uh, just stay there
and hold his hand.

610
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,611
Hold his hand?

611
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:55,730
You think he's in pain now?
He's not. Hold his hand.

612
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:59,410
Place both hands on opposite
sides of the fracture...

613
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,385
distract,

614
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:02,896
exaggerate,

615
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:07,119
and reverse the mechanismin
one continuous motion.

616
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,949
You are a doctor, aren't you?

617
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,668
Shut up. All right.

618
00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:14,475
All right. Rick, you ready?

619
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:17,173
Yeah.

620
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:22,875
One...

621
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:28,957
Two...

622
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,684
What happened?

623
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,769
Some metal--
Something in my leg...

624
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,606
Thrown off.

625
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:44,867
- God, it hurts. It hurts.
- Okay.

626
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,342
I started swimming.

627
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:48,314
I need to go...

628
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:49,995
I got a meeting.

629
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:54,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:56,592
But try to stay still.

631
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,618
Don't look, turn around.

632
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:16,653
I need you to be brave for me.

633
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:18,352
Just stand right there

634
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,939
and don't move and don't look.

635
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,022
- What do we got?
- Oh, we just got started.

636
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,191
All right.

637
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:39,618
But I got this.

638
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:42,413
There's nobody covering my service.

639
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:44,066
I'm gonna need you
to get up to telemetry

640
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,122
and check on my patients,
pre-op and post-op.

641
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,049
And then I should join you
in surgery?

642
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,805
No. And then you should
report to the pit.

643
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:54,725
Uh, the chief assigned me to Jane Doe.

644
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,105
Yes. Now I'm reassigning you.

645
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,516
To do what, sutures?

646
00:32:58,614 --> 00:32:59,469
Yes.

647
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,741
Okay, so-so you're saying, you don't--
you don't want me to scrub in.

648
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:05,443
Dr. Yang, I'm saying

649
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:08,315
that I have an unattended
cardiothoracic wing

650
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,093
and a pit full of patients

651
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,764
that you have the ability to help.

652
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:14,572
I don't need you in the O.R.,
I need you on the floor.

653
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:16,309
Do you have a problem with that?

654
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:19,315
No.

655
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,587
Thank you.

656
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,401
No, not-- Chris Heit.

657
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,021
He's 7 years old.
He's got brown hair.

658
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:33,796
I don't know if he's injured.
I'm...

659
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,326
Could you at least
check to see if he's there?

660
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:40,329
Yes, I know all the families
were directed here.

661
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,464
Could you just check?

662
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,335
Thank you. Yeah.

663
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:44,415
Callie,

664
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,861
I need some help.

665
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,589
- I can't. I'm busy.
- Yeah.

666
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,479
Okay. It's just, uh, I'm trying

667
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,786
- to find this--
- George, I'm busy.

668
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,042
I'm about to go into surgery, okay?

669
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,892
I can't be your wife
right now. I'm working.

670
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:55,933
I'm working, too. I have
a patient who needs surgery.

671
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,830
So do I.

672
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:00,852
Yes, any luck?

673
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:03,369
Thank you.

674
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:08,150
Damn it.

675
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,727
Can I get some help
over here?

676
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:18,594
Sweetie,

677
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,880
listen to me.
I need you to turn around.

678
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,579
I know I told you
to face away from me,

679
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,624
but we have to work together
to help this man.

680
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,789
I don't talk either
when I get scared.

681
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,659
I don't...

682
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,447
talk when bad things happen.

683
00:34:37,471 --> 00:34:38,748
You don't have to say anything.

684
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:40,729
But I need your help.

685
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:51,940
Okay, don't look down.
Don't look at the blood.

686
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:52,822
Look at me.

687
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,127
Look at me.

688
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:56,935
Can you be my assistant?

689
00:34:58,778 --> 00:34:59,855
Okay, good.

690
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:02,091
I can't move my hands
off where they are right now.

691
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,651
So I need you
to go over to my kit

692
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,144
And pull out, uh,

693
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,743
the things--
They look like, um,

694
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:07,669
like tweezers.

695
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,174
You know what your mommy uses
to pull a splinter out with?

696
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:20,153
Hey, what was the site like?

697
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,822
Was it gory?
Was it a trauma bonanza?

698
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,585
I mean, obviously terrible.

699
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:27,883
I don't talk with thieves.

700
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:28,908
What?

701
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,789
You stole my Jane Doe
right out from under me.

702
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,813
I am not a thief.

703
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,304
You balked. You're a balker.

704
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:34,189
I was thinking.

705
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,253
Well, again, not my problem

706
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:37,452
that thinking is such
a time-consuming process for you.

707
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:38,818
I rescued her.
I climbed down.

708
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:40,703
I pulled a massive pylon off of her.

709
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,437
- I got her here alive.
- Pylons? There are

710
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:43,470
pylons on people?

711
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,111
Whatever.
Now I get stuck

712
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:46,980
babysitting the patients' families

713
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,501
when you get to scrub in.

714
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,871
Well, I'm not scrubbing in.

715
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:52,989
I'm stitching up patients
in the pit.

716
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:55,011
Who did you piss off to get that?

717
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:57,152
I happen to be pulling

718
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:59,209
gaping pieces
of flesh back together.

719
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:00,617
You're stitching.

720
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:02,711
You're just one step closer to

721
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:04,026
knitting your grandma, a sweater.

722
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:06,280
- Well, at least mine's medical.
- Well, you're knitting.

723
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:07,820
I pull pylons off people.

724
00:36:10,814 --> 00:36:12,837
Orange juice?
Orange juice?

725
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:13,781
Orange jui--

726
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,767
Oh, sweetie.

727
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,697
Yeah, h-his color's not good.

728
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:19,629
Do you want
some orange juice?

729
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:21,463
Maybe I have
some wheat crackers,

730
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:22,852
something to put in your belly?

731
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,168
No.

732
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:28,158
Everybody, if you're--
If you're waiting to hear

733
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,701
about your families,
we should be hearing something

734
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,841
very soon.

735
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:33,896
I'm sorry.

736
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:37,932
Hang in there, buddy.

737
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:41,651
He must have saved
at least a dozen people

738
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,092
who were stuck under cars.
We told him not to go back.

739
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,500
That's the kinda guy he is.

740
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:47,357
He's the guy that goes back.

741
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,987
He's got kids, too, five of 'em.

742
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:53,993
I'm committed to the project.
I don't need to hear about the kids.

743
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:58,589
- Leave the girl alone, Vince.
- Sorry.

744
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:01,114
You're doing
a real great job there, doc.

745
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,745
Hey, how's he doing?

746
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,179
- He's doing all right.
- No,

747
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,430
no, he's not.

748
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:08,768
I can't do anything more until
we get him out from under this car.

749
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,899
Can you please tell me why
you've come back by yourself?

750
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,278
Search and rescue--
They're buried.

751
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,544
They said they'd come
when they can.

752
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,504
Did you show them the red tag?
He's a red tag?

753
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,560
They said they got 15 red tags.

754
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,403
Come on, guys.
Don't worry about me.

755
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:25,552
I'll be fine.

756
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:27,206
No, no, no, no.
Don't do this, man.

757
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:29,270
- S-Stay with me. Stay with me.
- What happened?

758
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,359
He-- He-- He let go of my hand.
He's gone limp.

759
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,856
- Rick!
- Wake up, rick!

760
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:46,433
Hey.

761
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:50,117
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to your surgery.

762
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,927
But here's the thing...

763
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,064
You were crushed underneath
a cement pylon.

764
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:01,383
Now dozens of people
on that ferry boat died.

765
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:03,621
But you're still alive.

766
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,439
So when I come back to check
on you after the surgery,

767
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,773
you better still be alive.

768
00:38:09,084 --> 00:38:09,892
All right?

769
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:11,663
You hear me?

770
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:13,734
All right.

771
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,781
Her B.P.'s stable.
So is the baby's.

772
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:26,856
You did good, Karev.

773
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:29,031
Is she gonna be okay?

774
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:32,913
You know, we're gonna...

775
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,918
We're gonna do
everything we can.

776
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,544
What about the baby?

777
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:38,615
I mean, is she gonna
be able to carry it to term?

778
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:43,762
You should get back down
to the clinic.

779
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,891
Look, Mrs. Heit, it's time.

780
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,453
We really need to operate

781
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:02,879
before you lose any more blood

782
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,436
or your bowels start to die.

783
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,199
Just... wait...

784
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,582
till Dr. O'Malley finds my son.

785
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:10,591
Please.

786
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,412
Dr. O'Malley... George...

787
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,410
Did you find him?
Is-- Is he okay?

788
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,208
Is he awake? Is he--

789
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,665
One of his pupils is blown.
We don't have a lot of time.

790
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:35,830
What are you gonna do?

791
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,348
God, you can't let him die.

792
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:38,456
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,956
I'm doing what I can.

794
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,252
It's not enough. Please just--

795
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:45,296
Just look, they're not gonna get him
out of here any time soon.

796
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:48,107
So you gotta figure out a way
to help him right here, right now.

797
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:03,459
Finally.

798
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:05,574
- Kelly Winter.
- Fatima?

799
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:06,555
Fatima's a little girl--

800
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:09,399
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm-- I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Karev.

801
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:11,702
This is a very rough situation,

802
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,096
and I can sure you, we're doing
everything that we can.

803
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:18,204
The following are the patients
we've identified at this time, uh...

804
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:20,861
"John J. Anders,
Kirk Demorast"--

805
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,788
This is the same list
they gave us a half-hour ago.

806
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,204
It's posted over there.

807
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:27,249
- I-I understand, but--
- Please, just, Kelly--

808
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,600
She's got brown hair.
She's about 5'4".

809
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,120
Okay, look, we had a lot of
people who came in without I.D.

810
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,825
Just take us over to the E.R.,
and we'll look for ourselves

811
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:36,684
We can't let you do that.

812
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,552
<i>- Why not?
- Those are our kids in there!</i>

813
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:56,916
Okay. Let's see.

814
00:40:57,113 --> 00:40:59,714
Now I have to deflate

815
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:02,217
the blood pressure cuff
and see if he bleeds.

816
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,228
Okay. We saved him.

817
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:06,711
You helped.

818
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,347
We just have to bandage him up,

819
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,340
we're gonna find someone
to take him to the hospital,

820
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:12,094
and then we're gonna
find your mom, okay?

821
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,359
I can't stand it. The pain!

822
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,189
- I gotta get outta here!
- Sir, don't move!

823
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,231
Don't move!

824
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,906
