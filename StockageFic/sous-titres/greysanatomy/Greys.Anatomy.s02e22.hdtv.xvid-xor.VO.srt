00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
i told thatch i'm leaving him.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,700
You left thatcher, ellis.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,100
If you could just hold...

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,700
i'm in the middle
of my workday, thatch.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,500
Thatch?

7
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
I look like meredith's dad?

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,400
Why didn't you stay
and fight for us?

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Why didn't you try harder?

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,400
I just saw my father for
the first time in 20 years.

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,700
I slept with george.

12
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,000
Can we please just go back
to everything the way it was?

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,300
I don't know how to go back.

14
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,900
At some point, you are going to
have to talk to me.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,500
Want to see something
really cool?

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,500
nice!

<i>on the edge of our seats.</i>

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,500
<i>Games are all about the glory,</i>

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,500
dude...

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is she knitting?

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>The games we each play</i>
<i>all by ourselves.</i>

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,200
you know, as a...
as a friend,

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
i gotta tell you,
you look a little weird.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
I am making a sweater.

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,200
You're knitting...
in a bar.

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,600
You can't knit in a bar.
You're scaring the customers.

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Come on. Have a drink.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
I can't have a drink.
I'm celibate.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
You mean sober?
She means sober.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
No, celibate.

33
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm practicing celibacy,

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,600
and drinking does not go well
with celibacy

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,500
because it makes everything
and everyone

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
seem kind of porn-y,

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,900
and then my head gets
all cloudy,

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,600
and then the next thing
you know, i'm naked.

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,500
And my point is,
i'm celibate,

40
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,900
and knitting is good
for surgical dexterity,

41
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,300
so i'm making a sweater.

42
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,000
You celibate?
I just don't buy it.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,100
No more men.

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,800
No more men, really?

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,400
You? And i'm asking
because we are friends.

46
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Every guy i meet
turns out to be married...

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
ooh, ouch.
Sorry.

48
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Or mark...

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,700
okay, i'm gonna go
over there now.

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,400
Sorry.

51
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,300
Or remember the horrible thing
i did? Remember george?

52
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,500
you're making a sweater.

53
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,600
I am making a sweater.

54
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>The social games,</i>
<i>the mind games...</i>

55
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,100
<i>we use them to pass the time,</i>
<i>to make life more interesting,</i>

56
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,100
<i>to distract us</i>
<i>from what's really going on.</i>

57
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,800
He's not george anymore.
He's broken george.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,700
First he chopsff his hair,

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,900
then he starts hanging out
with this callie.

60
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,400
That is not a name... callie.
Who is she anyway?

61
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm his best friend.

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,200
Not that
he talks to me anymore.

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Triple word score.
69 points.

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Woman, i'm beating
the pants off you.

65
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Pay attention.
What the hell are you doin'?

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm knitting a sweater.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,100
Actually, meredith...
that's my friend,

68
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,000
the friend that broke george...
she is knitting a sweater.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
She's not <i>really</i>
knitting a sweater

70
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,900
because she cannot knit.

71
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,100
But i want her to think
she is knitting a sweater

72
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
because she and i took
a celibacy vow

73
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,900
so she's replacing sex
with knitting,

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,700
and so i am knitting pieces
of meredith's sweater

75
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,400
so that i can
switch them out with hers

76
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,500
so that she can really believe
she is knitting.

77
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,200
'Cause if anybody needs
to be celibate, it's meredith

78
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,900
'cause she broke george,
you know?

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,700
You took a vow of celibacy?

80
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,800
Yes.

81
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,300
How am i supposed to get
in your pants

82
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,600
if you took
a vow of celibacy?

83
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,100
That is a very inappropriate
thing to say to your doctor.

84
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,300
Oh, you know
what's inappropriate?

85
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,400
Promising sexual favors
to a patient

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
in order to get him to live
and then backing out.

87
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,300
<i>Dennyduquette,</i> i so never,
ever promised...

88
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,000
in my head, you did.

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
In my head, you delivered.

90
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,500
Well...

91
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,500
but don't worry.

92
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,400
You weren't very good.

93
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,300
okay.

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,700
You know what?
I was being nice.

95
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,500
I was letting you win

96
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,600
because you're "mr. Sick
needs a new organ guy,"

97
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,900
but just for that comment,

98
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,200
i'm gonna kick your ass.

99
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,500
Yeah, i'm gonna...
you put down "mount," denny?

100
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,100
<i>There are those of us</i>
<i>who love to play games...</i>

101
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
okay, uh...
<i>any game.</i>

102
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
<i>And then there a</i>

103

104
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
nice!
<i>A little too much.</i>

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Disastrous fema director.

106
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,600
poo is...

107
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
brown. Poo is brown.
Michael brown!

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
Yes!
Time! Time!

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,700
yeah, thank you.
Impressive, o'malley.

110
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,800
thanks.
"Poo is?"

111
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,300
Apparently we think alike.

112
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,000
Wow. I can't believe
you're proud of that.

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Hey, are you supposed to open
the papers ahead of time?

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Hey!

115
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
It's called strategy.
Cristina, it's a game.

116
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,400
I know that.

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Well, you just seem
a little intense.

118
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,100
We're just trying to have
some fun.

119
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm having fun.

120
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,900
Let's do this. 

121
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,300
Okay.
Are you ready?

122
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,500
Mm-hmm.
Go!

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Blonde ambition tour.

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Blonde ambition tour.

125
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,300
"Vogue."

126
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Oh, are you kidding...
okay, she's blonde.

127
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,500
She's a blonde,
she's ambitious.

128
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,100
She's ambitious and... and with
the tour and the vogueing

129
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,800
and... honey, look at me.
Okay, i am... shut up!

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,700
Cones, cones.
Uh, blonde ambition.

131
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,100
Boob cones and... and vogueing.
Honey, vogueing.

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Sean penn! Sean penn!
Time!

133
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Zero points for madonna.

134
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,500
Oh! Madonna. Right.

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,300
Who doesn't know madonna?

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,700
 sore loser.

137
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,800
I am not a sore loser.

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,700
You know,
and so what if i am?

139
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,600
See, the whole point of games
is that there is a winner,

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,500
a first place.

141
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,100
You want a second best surgeon
operating on you? No.

142
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
You want the very best.

143
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
And second best is mediocre.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,900
And to settle for mediocrity
is... is...

145
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
it's frankly, you know,
a sign of self-loathing

146
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
and substandard work ethics.

147
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
i've gotta get george
out of my apartment.

148
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
You know,
you could sleep with him,

149
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,900
and then right in the middle,
start crying.

150
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,500
It's painful and humiliating

151
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,800
and unbelievably cruel,
but apparently,

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,100
it works.

153
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,000
Would you just keep knitting?

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Kick him out so that he can
come back home to us.

155
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,700
No, l-i can't kick him out.
He's burke's puppy.

156
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,000
It's gotta be burke's idea.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,900
I just gotta figure out
a way to make him do it.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,700
Got a lot
of metastatic disease here.

159
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,600
How do we proceed?

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
Definitely excise the endobronchial mets 
for symptomatic palliation.

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,900
You've been doing
your homework, karev.

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
A lot of late nights.

163
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,300
Look at this.

164
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
The mets have adhered
to her chest wall.

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,300
Dude, she's toast.

166
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,900
Don't you think that's a little 
insensitive,dr. Karev?

167
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,300
She can't hear me.

168
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,200
You don't know that.

169
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,700
Bedside manner
is part of the job, karev.

170
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,900
Late nights
won't get you anywhere

171
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,200
if you can't figure that out.

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,900
Thank you.
Good morning.

173
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,200
Hey, you goin' into surgery
ocomin' out?

174
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,700
Goin' in. I had to
push it back. C's sick.

175
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,000
Doc's sick?
What are his symptoms?

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Polydipsia, lethargy
and vomiting.

177
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,300
Any sign of fever or dehydration?

178
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Uh, it's unclear.

179
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
I was considering running a course of
i.v. Antibiotics and a saline drip.

180
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,000
Seriously?

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
No, addison, he's a dog.

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
I dropped him off at the vet.

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,700
They're gonna run some tests
and observe him overnight.

184
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Meredith will
check on him tonight.

185
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,900
I gotta run. I got a transfer
in from mercy west.

186
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,100
Will you wait for me
to go home?

187
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,700
Yeah.

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Today we'll be covering...

189
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
yes.

190
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,500
Cristina yang,
first year surgical intern.

191
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm just wondering
if wre going to be covering

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
both intra and extracorporeal
knots today in the seminar.

193
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,200
We'll be training
in all aspects

194
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
of laparoscopic
general surgery.

195
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Starting with basic
instrumentation

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
and camera operation...
dr. Yang.

197
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Chief.
We'll move through
several complex procedures,

198
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,600
including tissue approximation.

199
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,200
The suggested task time
for bead transfer is...

200
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
you're taking the class?

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
It's a good refresher course.
Should be fun.

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,300
And 240 seconds for dominant
to nondominate transfer.

203
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Good. Yeah.

204
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,400
Now who would like to volunteer
for our first...

205
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,200
dr. Yang.

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Molly thompson, 22 years old,
32 weeks pregnant.

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Transferred here
from mercy west

208
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
when an ultrasound diagnosed
the baby

209
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,300
with congenital
diaphragmatic hernia.

210
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Hello, molly.
I'm dr. Addison shepherd.

211
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
You're supposed to be
the best.

212
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
And not to put any pressure
on you or anything,

213
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
but this is my baby
carrying my grandchild,

214
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,900
so i really hope
that you are.

215
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
The best, i mean.

216
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,000
Mom, you're kind of
threatening the doctor.

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Don't threaten the doctor.
It doesn't help.

218
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,100
Sorry.

219
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,700
My husband tells me
i have to try

220
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,100
not to be
such a mother lion

221
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,700
because molly's a grown woman

222
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
and has her own life
and everything,

223
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,400
but... roar.

224
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
it's okay.
I can take it.

225
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,000
I am the best.

226
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
You can fix this,
though, right?

227
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
We'll insert a scope
into your uterus

228
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,700
and then inflate
a little balloon

229
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,000
in the baby's airway,

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
which should help stimulate
the lungs to grow.

231
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's not gonna be easy
on either of you,

232
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,400
but i do have a strong record
with this surgery.

233
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,400
Make sure you get her
to the m.r.i.

234
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
And get me the results
as soon as you can.

235
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
I will.

236
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
Sir, can i help you
find something?

237
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh... is...

238
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,600
is there a dr. Meredith grey
working today?

239
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,300
Yes.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,100
Sh-she's here
in the hospital right now?

241
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,400
I can have someone page her
for you if you want me to.

242
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
No. No. That's...

243
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
thank you.

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Wait. Excuse me. Sir?

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,300
Are... are you...
what's your name?

246
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Thatcher.

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
You're...

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
grey, yeah.

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300
You're meredith's father.

250
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
Yeah.

251
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,100
Are you sure you don't
want me to page her for you?

252
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,100
No. I'm sorry.
It's complicated.

253
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Thatcher, honey.

254
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,200
We're right here.
Oh.

255
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh, there you are, susan.

256
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,700
Did you tell him?
I roared a little.

257
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
I couldn't help it.

258
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh. Oh, well,
i knew you would.

259
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,200
i'm sorry.
I'm dr. O'malley.

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm, uh, o'mall...

261
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
l... well, excuse us.

262
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,900
Uh, we're gonna check
on our daughter.

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
ah, dr. Bailey!
Do you have an extra intern?

264
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm available.

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,900
No, no, no, no.
I said "intern."

266
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,200
Shepherd, look at the board.

267
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Okay. What am i lookin' at?

268
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
My name isn't up there.

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,500
It wasn't up there yesterday
and it won't be tomorrow.

270
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,400
What'd you do,
piss off the chief?

271
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah, i pissed off the chief.

272
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,800
I went and had a baby.
I gave birth.

273
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
I created a human life.

274
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm a surgeon.
We don't do that.

275
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,500
He's mommy-trackin' me.

276
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,800
He's just goin' easy
on you.

277
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,700
No. I change diapers,
l-i clean spit up,

278
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
i sing the a-b-cs...
i'm covered in mommy.

279
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,400
But that does not mean
i will be mommy-tracked.

280
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,300
You're freaking out.

281
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,000
I just need a surgery.
I need a surgery now.

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
So for today,
i'm your intern.

283
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,600
i have not begun
to freak out.

284
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,400
All right, come on.

285
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Cristina told me that george
had a date with ortho chick.

286
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Games night. She didn't even
take him home afterwards.

287
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,700
She hinted that she wanted to
and then said she couldn't.

288
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
That's weird, right?

289
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
George made it perfectly clear

290
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
that i am not
in his life anymore.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
You think ortho chick
is hiding something?

292
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
She could be hiding something.

293
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,900
Stevens... hold this.

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
George mentioned
you're not big on ortho.

295
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
Grey, take the osteotome
and the mallet.

296
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,400
Follow me.

297
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,500
ms. Carver,
unfortunately we found

298
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,000
that the cancer has metastasized
to your chest wall.

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
We took out a small tumor
obstructing your airway,

300
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,700
which will help
with your breathing, but...

301
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,500
it's not a cure.

302
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
So this is
the end of the line?

303
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,500
That's what you're saying?

304
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,900
This is it, i die now?

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Beatrice...
i want you to go back in.

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,500
I want you to cut out
everything that you can...

307
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,700
as much as you can.

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
I want as much time as you
can give me, you understand?

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Well, unfortunately,
any additional surgery is...

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
excuse me.

311
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Mom, i'm not eating any of
that crap in the cafeteria.

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,600
I mean, we're gonna have to
order in thai food or something

313
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
because i'm starving
and the food here blows.

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,100
I'll have the nurse
bring a menu by

315
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,400
and we can have
a picnic in bed.

316
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,500
God, mom. How many doctors
do you have?

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,300
They were just leaving.

318
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,800
<i>(man) after trailing by 10</i>
<i>at the half,</i>

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,100
<i>the offense stepped up,</i>
<i>leading a 13-0 run</i>

320
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,600
<i>to begin a seesaw battle</i>
<i>up to the end.</i>

321
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
In five to ten years,

322
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,500
cutting as we know it
will be virtually obsolete.

323
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,800
Very nice, dr. Yang.

324
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,700
Thank you, sir.

325
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
A little less tension there,
chief.

326
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,200
Watch your grip.
There you go.

327
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,100
I wasn't copying you.

328
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,400
Of course not, sir.

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Done! I'm done.
I totally finished first.

330
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,100
I'm done.

331
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,700
So, dr. Torres...
hold it steady, grey.

332
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,800
Did you always know you wanted
to specialize in orthopedics?

333
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Did you always know
you wanted to model?

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Oh. Okay.

335
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,200
Grey, i mean it.
Watch your grip.

336
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
And your husband,
is he a doctor, too?

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,900
what are you trying
to ask me, dr. Stevens,

338
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,500
my history, my marital status,
my deep, dark little secrets?

339
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
I'm george's best friend.

340
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, i see.
Well, it's just funny.

341
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
'Cause from what i understand,
as his best friend,

342
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
you haven't been
the best matchmaker in the past.

343
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Hi.

344
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Hey.

345
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,500
Your hair is growing out,
which is nice.

346
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,400
I still think you should cut it.
I could cut it for you...

347
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
if we still lived together.

348
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,200
Or we could just hang out
and talk about... stuff,

349
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,900
like your new friend...

350
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,200
callie.

351
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,200
She's, uh...
she's very, um...

352
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,400
you know, if you like her,
i will like her...

353
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
eventually.

354
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,500
I can't escape her.

355
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,100
What?

356
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,600
All i want to do
is forget her,

357
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,500
all i want to do
is just escape her,

358
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
and, you know, i can't.

359
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
You want to escape callie?

360
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh, thank god.

361
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,500
'Cause she is, like,
a total freak,

362
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,300
and i was starting to get
really worried about you.

363
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,800
Not callie.

364
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
Sorry. 

365
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,700
.

366
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,400
Who? Or, oh...

367
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,100
meredith again.

368
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm gonna
tell you something,

369
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,100
and the minute i tell you
what i'm about to tell you,

370
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,500
this officially becomes
your problem, not mine.

371
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Okay.

372
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Meredith has a sister.

373
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,500
How are we doing?

374
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,700
I turned the skull flap.
Patient's sedated.

375
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,500
very nice.

376
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Nicely done.

377
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
He... he's a kid.

378
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,700
Yes.

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,900
I just didn't think
it would be a kid.

380
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,100
A tumor that size...
well, what happens now?

381
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,000
Now we wake him up.

382
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,400
We're doing
<i>awake</i> brain surgery on him?

383
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,700
Yes. Thank you.

384
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,100
Andrew.

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,800
A little more.

386
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,500
Andrew, can you hear me?

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Hey. Want to count
for me?

388
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,300
One...

389
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,200
good, keep going.

390
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,900
(derek) since the tumor
is located

391
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
near the language center
of the brain,

392
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
it's important
that we don't damage it.

393
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Andrew, i need you
to keep talking.

394
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Can you do that?
can you talk to me?

395
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
L-i'll try.

396
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,700
Okay, great.
Now what grade are you in?

397
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Um... seventh.

398
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,800
You into sports?

399
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Not really.

400
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,900
How about baseball?

401
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,000
Um... baseball's a sport.

402
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,000
Right.

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,700
Okay.
What about, uh, girls?

404
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,900
Do you have any girlfriends?

405
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,400
No.

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Um... you probably
don't have time

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
for girlfriends
right, andrew?

408
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,600
Probably too busy, right?

409
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,900
Y-yes, ma'am.

410
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Uh, what are you busy doing?

411
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Um... getting ready
for the national spelling bee.

412
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,600
I won the greater regionals
last month.

413
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,300
Oh, well, in that case,

414
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,700
you need to spell
some words for us.

415
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Uh, can you do that?

416
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,500
Sure.

417
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Uh, good. Uh...

418
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,500
you usually provide
the word, dr. Bailey.

419
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't hear you
coming up with one.

420
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,500
Uh, let's see.

421
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
All right, uh,
acetaminophen.

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
Acetaminophen.

423
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,500
Origin of the word?

424
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,400
Heck if i know.

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey, do you have
molly's m.r.i. Results?

426
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
No. I-i haven't...
not yet.

427
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
What the hell
have you been doing then?

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I was just gonna...

429
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
when i assign you
to a case of mine,

430
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
i expect you to give it your
full and undivided attention.

431
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
Give me one good reason

432
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
why l-i shouldn't
take you off this case.

433
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
Molly thompson's maiden name
is grey.

434
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Her father is thatcher grey.

435
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,700
Thatcher grey is also
meredith's father,

436
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
which means that molly
and meredith are sisters,

437
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,900
but i don't think meredith
even knows molly exists.

438
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,400
And i don't care.
I don't.

439
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Except i'm on this case
and...

440
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,600
apparently, god hates me.

441
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Okay.

442
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,700
Okay, thanks.

443
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I want all this out now.

444
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm getting out
of the hospital.

445
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, we can't, beatrice.
You just had major surgery.

446
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Tomorrow is
my daughter's birthday.

447
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Apparently it's the last one
i get to celebrate,

448
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
and i'm not spending it
in here.

449
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,100
Okay, i'm so sorry,
but if we remove this tube,

450
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,500
your lung will collapse.

451
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm sure you don't want
to spend

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
your daughter's birthday
this way, okay?

453
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,400
M a quick healer.

454
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm breathing better
since the surgery.

455
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,200
That is because we removed
some of the tumor

456
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,100
to open up your airway.

457
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,000
That doesn't mean that you
are well, all right?

458
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,900
If you try to leave, you are
at risk of infection

459
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,000
or hemorrhaging.

460
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
Your kid doesn't even know
you have cancer.

461
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,400
You really want to risk
dropping dead on the street

462
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,500
outside the hospital?

463
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Dr. Karev...

464
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,500
so you thought scaring her
back into bed

465
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,200
was the way to go?

466
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
It worked, didn't it?
She's lying to her kid.

467
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,100
She's frightened.
She's in shock

468
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
it is not your job
or your place

469
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
to take a tone like that
with a patient, not ever.

470
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
Are we understood?

471
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
Yes, sir.

472
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
so what are the sister
and the father like?

473
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,400
Like?

474
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,700
They're like people
meredith is related to

475
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,300
and never met.

476
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
They're nice.
Can you imagine...

477
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,000
a sister, a whole family
you know nothing about?

478
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
You think she's gonna
freak out?

479
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,300
It's not my responsibility
to care.

480
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,700
Oh, heads up, heads up.

481
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,300
Hey, chief.
How you doin'?

482
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,300
Seems i'm a little rusty

483
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,200
on my bead transfer
and rope pass.

484
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Dr. Yang here's been
kicking my ass all day.

485
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh, no.
Oh, i can't imagine...

486
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,100
no, really, she has.

487
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,000
Of course,
speed and precision

488
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
aren't the most important
surgical skills, dr. Yang.

489
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,100
Basics are the key.

490
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,900
You need a solid foundation
before anything else.

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,700
okay, um... well, i'll see you
back at the lab.

492
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,000
Sir.

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,100
Enjoy your lunch.
You, too. Bye.

494
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,200
Have a nice day, sir.

495
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,600
Okay, i really am
kicking the chief's ass.

496
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,700
George.

497
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,000
Not my responsibility.

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Well, who's gonna...
see you guys.

499
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,700
It's okay.
I can accept rejection.

500
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
I've got my knitting.
Mer...

501
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,400
the weird thing is...

502
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
i thought i just saw
my father.

503
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,100
Oh! That's good.
That's so good.

504
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,800
Hmm. Did you meet
your sister, too?

505
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,100
appoggiatura won last year.

506
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Year before that...

507
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,300
akshay buddiga...
he fainted,

508
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,800
then got up anspelled
the word alopecoid.

509
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Kid's a major legend.

510
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
all right.
Now it's my turn.

511
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,500
Fibromyalgia.

512
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,800
Fibromyalgia?

513
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Yeah, what's wrong
with fibromyalgia?

514
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,100
Andrew <i>won</i> the regionals.
He's going to d.c.

515
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
He's probably insulted
by fibromyalgia.

516
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,800
Fibromyalgia...

517
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,800
suction.

518
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,000
F-i-b-r-o-m-y-a-l-g-i-a.

519
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Fibromyalgia.

520
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,600
She's right.
That was kind of easy.

521
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Okay. You want me
to bring on the heat?

522
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm gonna bring on the heat.

523
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,900
Omphalocele. 

524
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Omphalocele.

525
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,900
More suction in there.

526
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,500
omphalocele.

527
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
C-a...

528
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
okay.
Andrew...

529
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
f...

530
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,000
what's happening?
F...

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
mark that. We've hit
the language center.

532
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,900
We just have to pull back.

533
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
andrew.
F... s...

534
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,800
andrew.

535
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
Andrew, andrew,

536
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
uh, spell it again
for me.

537
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,700
E...

538
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
give me the stealth probe,
please.

539
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,400
Dr. Shepherd's working on it.
I don't want you to be scared.

540
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,900
I-i want you to wait.

541
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,500
Just wait.
I want you to hold on.

542
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Mark that as well, please.

543
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay, try now.

544
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,700
Okay. All right.

545
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Andrew, spell omphalocele
one more time for me.

546
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,900
Omphalocele.

547
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Mark that, please.

548
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,800
O-m-p...
(derek) good. Okay.

549
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
H-a-l-o-c-e-l-e.

550
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,700
Omphalocele.

551
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,600
That's it! That's perfect.

552
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,700
Dr. Bailey, are you crying?

553
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,800
Oh, i got something
in my eye.

554
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,400
You're doing great, andrew.
We're almost done.

555
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,100
Stop lookin' at me
like that.

556
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,600
It's my hormones.
Mm-hmm.

557
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm still a surgeon.

558
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm just a surgeon
with an excess of estrogen.

559
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Deal with it.
Andrew, can you spell estrogen?

560
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,700
E-s-t-r-o-g-e-n.

561
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,400
Here's a word for you.
Delusional.

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,700
delusional...

563
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
(man) today's final assignment
will show how well

564
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,700
you can take the skills
you have learned

565
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,100
and apply them
to a single operation.

566
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
You may begin.

567
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,700
so i'm gonna do
the surgery with a small scope,

568
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,000
and it'lbe minimally invasive.

569
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,100
And then you should be able
to do the rest of your recovery

570
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,600
from home.

571
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Thank you.

572
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,300
Yeah, okay.

573
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,700
uh, molly, this is doctor...

574
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,400
uh, this is meredith.

575
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,000
She's gonna be continuing
your prep work

576
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,200
and taking your vitals.

577
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Okay?

578
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay.

579
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Hi.

580
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Hey.

581
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,400
Uh, do you mind if i, um...

582
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
no, it's fine.

583
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm getting used to being
poked and prodded.

584
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
That's a... pretty ring.

585
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Oh, thanks.

586
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
It was my grandma's
and then my mom's.

587
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,400
You think i'm too young
to be married.

588
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
No, l...

589
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,700
that's okay.
Everybody thinks i'm too young.

590
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
If i saw me, i'd think
i was too young.

591
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Um... how... how old are you?

592
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,400
22.

593
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,500
Eric's 23,

594
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,300
and he's in the army,
and he was getting shipped out.

595
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,100
And... i just love him
so much, you know?

596
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,000
Anyway, i proposed.

597
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Oh. And your, uh, parents,
they approve?

598
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Oh, my parents are amazing.

599
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
I mean,
you know how dads can be.

600
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,900
Mine's pretty overprotective,

601
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,500
but... you know, at my wedding,
when he gave me away,

602
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,300
my dad cried, which was...

603
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,100
i had never seen
my dad cry before.

604
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
But... i think it was also
kind of weird for him

605
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,900
'cause i'm his little girl.

606
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,000
You know, i'm the youngest,

607
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
and my sister is, like,
nowhere near ready for marriage.

608
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,700
But it was good crying.

609
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Like he was proud of me,
you know?

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm sorry.

611
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm just... i'm nervous,
so i'm talking.

612
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,600
no, that's okay.
So you have a sister?

613
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah, lexie.
She's in medical school.

614
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Harvard.
She's the smart one.

615
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,400
You should see
how my dad is about her.

616
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,300
He's, like, crazy proud.

617
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,800
Well, i'm gonna go.

618
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Meredith.
Mm-hmm.

619
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,900
Do you think my baby
is gonna be okay?

620
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,100
Oh. Well, i hope so.

621
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Me, too.

622
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Okay.

623
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,000
i need some bones to break.
What?

624
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,900
Some bones to break,
something to smash.

625
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,300
Can you help me
with that, please?

626
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,700
Um, you can clean up
this cast crap if you want.

627
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,900
is she freaking out?

628
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,700
No. Unh-unh. She's fine.

629
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
she's great.

630
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,700
so george...

631
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
he's really...
really your type, huh?

632
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,100
You don't see him.

633
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Either of you,
you don't see him.

634
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,300
He's just...
he's just george to you.

635
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,900
He's... he's just o'malley.
He's your roommate.

636
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,000
You don't have to get all...

637
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
he makes my world stop.

638
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,300
George o'malley is sweet


639
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,500
and kind

640
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,800
and smart and strong.

641
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,300
And he makes my world stop
so you shut up about him.

642
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,300
don't forget to clean it up

643
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,300
when you're done smashing.

644
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,300
Holy crap.

645
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
George is her mcdreamy.

646
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,400
i'm done! I'm done!
I'm done!

647
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
(man) flawless, chief webber.

648
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,100
Absolutely flawless.

649
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
They call me dr. Webber.

650
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
that's why
i'm the chief.

651
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
that's why i'm the chief.

652
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
* that's why
i'm the chief *

653
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,400
* the chief *

654
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,300
so when is my mom
getting out of here?

655
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm sorry, honey,

656
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,100
but it's gonna be
a few days.

657
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,600
Can you call aunt sue,
see if she can pick you up?

658
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
So i get to spend my birthday
hanging out with aunt sue.

659
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
Perfect.

660
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,000
I promise you, next year,

661
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
next year, we'll do something
really special

662
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
for your birthday.

663
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
You name it, it's done.

664
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,900
I promise.

665
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Whatever.

666
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,100
So this whole lying thing,

667
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,400
this is working out
for you?

668
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,100
Excuse me?

669
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Look, you're going to die,
and soon. You get that, right?

670
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,300
There's no rosy picture
to paint here.

671
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,100
You're not a mother.

672
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,500
You don't know what it's like

673
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
to hold your newborn baby
in your arms

674
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
and smell the top of her head

675
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,600
and know that your only job
in the world

676
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
is to protect her.

677
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,300
You think
you're protecting her?

678
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
I am protecting her.

679
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
Well, i guess you can
call it what you want.

680
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,600
But you should just know that
you're leaving behind a kid

681
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,300
that'll probably hate you
the rest of her life.

682
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Dr. Karev...

683
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
no, i'm talking this time.
Excuse me?

684
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,800
I tell the truth.
It's what i do.

685
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,100
It doesn't make me
a bad doctor.

686
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,800
Everyone walks around
this place lying.

687
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,500
Look, we tell a patient
that's dying that there's hope

688
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,400
when there is no hope.

689
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,900
Maybe i'm a pig,
maybe i'm an ass,

690
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,600
maybe i'm a vermin
like everybody says.

691
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,100
But i tell them the truth.

692
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,000
It's the one thing
that i've got goin' for me.

693
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,900
And you don't get to
take that away from me

694
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,900
and call it a lesson, sir.

695
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,700
l-i saw a picture once
from a long time ago.

696
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,100
You look just like her...
your mother.

697
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
You look a lot like
my girls,

698
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,000
especially molly.

699
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
You were talking to her?

700
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,100
I didn't say anything
about anything.

701
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Oh, she knows about you.

702
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,100
Or she knows that her father
was married before

703
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
and had another daughter.

704
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
<i>Has</i> another daughter.

705
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,100
No, had is right.

706
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,500
Your father thinks about you.

707
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,500
He thinks about you
a lot.

708
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,100
He just...

709
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,300
your mother...

710
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
your mother...

711
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,500
she broke him.

712
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Ahem. Uh, excuse me.

713
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,500
L-i have to work.

714
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,800
i spent years studying
this board,

715
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,000
holding a crying baby,

716
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
trying to get an idea

717
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,600
when my wife
would get out of surgery.

718
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
"Appy" takes about an hour.

719
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Anything
with the word "cardio,"

720
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,900
and i knew not to plan on
seeing her at all that day.

721
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,300
thatcher, are you aware
of what's going on with ellis?

722
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,000
U have no right...
no right...

723
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,700
to talk to me about ellis.

724
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,300
I'm sorry.

725
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But i was trying to talk
to you about meredith.

726
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,900
thatcher, ellis has
early-onset alzheimer's.

727
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's advanced.

728
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,500
And it's hard on meredith,
as you can imagine.

729
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,900
And i thought you'd want
to know.

730
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,700
hey, andrew.

731
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
It's dr. Bailey.

732
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,300
Remember me?

733
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,000
I was in surgery with you.

734
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm... i'm sorry.

735
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,700
No, no, don't worry.
Don't worry.

736
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,000
A lot of times, kids who are
awake during surgery

737
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
don't remember afterwards.

738
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Anyway, your operation
went <i>really</i> well.

739
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,800
We got all that tumor
outta there,

740
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
and you're gonna be
just fine.

741
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,400
I... thanks.

742
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Okay.

743
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
You know
i have a son, too.

744
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,000
And i'm going home right now
to tell him that today,

745
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,500
i met
the best speller in seattle.

746
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,600
oh, hey. Dr. O'malley.

747
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,200
Hi.

748
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,100
I was looking for you.
You were...

749
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,000
before, when i was
asking about meredith...

750
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,700
you know her.

751
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,000
You're her friend.

752
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,500
I used to be her roommate.

753
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,600
So you know her
really well.
Pretty well.

754
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
she... she came to see me
a couple of weeks ago, and...

755
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,500
a couple of weeks ago?

756
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
Yeah. L... and i didn't know
what to say to her.

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,500
She looks so...
so much like her mother.

758
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
Ellis was cold.

759
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,600
I mean, i was a coward.
I was. L-i left.

760
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
But her mother would never
let me know her, and...

761
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,500
now i don't know how
to know her.

762
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,300
well, meredith
is anything but cold.

763
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,900
She smiles...
not that often...

764
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,600
but when she does...
you know, because she's...

765
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,000
really going through a lot...

766
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
but... it's...

767
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
it's like you feel warm.

768
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,900
She's kind.

769
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,300
I mean, she can be
a little selfish.

770
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,600
Oh, she can be...

771
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,100
she's flawed,
but she's kind.

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
She cares out people.

773
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,000
And, uh...

774
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,900
she cares a-about her patients.

775
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,500
I think she's gonna be
a brilliant surgeon.

776
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,700
You know, around here,
she's known as the one to beat.

777
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
So, l-i don't know,

778
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,000
i guess she has that
in common with her mom,

779
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,500
but...

780
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,600
i think the rest of her...
i think, uh,

781
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,900
i think the rest of that,
she gets from you.

782
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,700
hmm. Do... do you know...
where she is?

783
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,400
i think she left already.

784
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
I could tell her you're...
you were here

785
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
if you want me to.

786
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
Yeah. Okay.

787
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,800
Thank you.

788
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,700
thank you, george.

789
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,700
hey

790
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,400
Hey. Still knitting?

791
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh, yeah.
I'm getting so good at it.

792
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I did a craniotomy on a kid
today while he was awake.

793
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,600
I met a sister
i never knew i had.

794
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,400
And i saw my father,
which was, uh...

795
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,700
i don't know what it was.

796
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
You okay?

797
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,300
I have my knitting.

798
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Study hard.
Keep your grades up.

799
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,700
Starting next year,

800
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,600
you're gonna want to take
two a.p. Classes a semester

801
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,300
if you want to get into
a decent college.

802
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,200
Mom, this is really morbid.

803
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,500
And your aunt sue
is kinda lazy

804
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,400
when it comes to
personal hygiene.

805
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,700
so you may have to be the one 
who remind her when she next time

806
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,400
to get your eyebrows waxed
or get your hair cut,

807
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
but eventually,
she'll get the routine down.

808
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,700
Can we not have
this conversation?

809
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Oh, this might sound random,

810
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,100
but wear underwear
with pantyhose.

811
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,500
I know it might feel
a little bulky,

812
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,700
but honestly,
it's a little slutty not to,

813
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,100
and also, that's how
you get yeast infections.

814
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,300
Mom... (laughs)
This is totally gross.

815
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,200
And marry a kind man,

816
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,500
one who's nice to his mother.

817
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,600
Now if he lives
with his mother,

818
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,900
you run the opposite way.

819
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,400
Mom, i'm not getting married
anytime soon.

820
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,300
You will someday.

821
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,400
And when that day comes,

822
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,500
just have
one glass of champagne

823
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,300
and then you drink water
for the rest of the night

824
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,200
because there's nothing tackier
than a drunken bride.

825
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,500
Mom, i don't wanna...

826
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,300
why are you telling me
all this?

827
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,300
Honey, i've been sick
for a long time,

828
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,900
and the doctors don't think
that i'm gonna get better.

829
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No.

830
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,900
Amelia, listen to me.

831
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,000
Look at me. Amelia.

832
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,800
This is important.

833
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,600
This one is... is really
the important one.

834
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,200
Someday,
you're gonna have a baby.

835
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,300
And you're gonna feel
overwhelmed

836
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,200
by this little life
that you're responsible for.

837
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,100
And you're gonna think...

838
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,900
worry that everything you do
is wrong,

839
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
and that's normal.

840
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,700
You're gonna obsess
about what to feed it

841
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,500
and where to send it
to school

842
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,600
and whether it should take
violin or piano.

843
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,200
But i'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

844
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,400
It doesn't matter.

845
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,800
Whether your kid is
a concert pianist

846
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
or a math genius,

847
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
it just doesn't matter.

848
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,600
Because at the end of the day,

849
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,700
all that matters
is if your kid is happy.

850
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,300
So you're gonna feel sad
for a little while.

851
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
And that's okay.
That's... that's fine.

852
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,700
But don't feel sad forever,
okay?

853
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
You can promise me that?

854
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,400
You promise me that you won't
feel sad for too long.

855
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
I promise.
Okay.

856
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
Thank you.

857
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
'Cause you're making me feel
much better.

858
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,700
<i>Life is not</i>
<i>a spectator sport.</i>

859
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
<i>Win, lose or draw...</i>

860
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,100
<i>the game is progress...</i>

861
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,500
<i>whether we want it to be</i>
<i>or not.</i>

862
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,400
You made me a sweater...

863
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,100
today?

864
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,500
In one day,
you made me a sweater?

865
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah, well, you know,
i just, i had some time, so...

866
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,700
wow. That vow of celibacy
must really be something.

867
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,500
You know what? Just accept
your gift and say thank you.

868
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
Does this mean i don't get
any sexual favors?

869
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Sweater instead of sex?

870
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,900
Smell it.

871
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,300
Go on. Smell it.

872
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,500
It smells like izzie.

873
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Yeah, i wore it
for three hours.

874
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,700
So that is the closest
you're gonna be gettin'

875
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,800
to this body, mister.

876
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,400
You wanna play some scrabble
or are you too tired?

877
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,000
Scrabble, please.
Okay.

878
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Just show me one boob.

879
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,800
Chief, sir.

880
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,700
Nice work today, yang.

881
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Hopefully,
your fellow interns

882
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,400
will be as adept
on the scope as you.

883
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,900
Thank you, sir, but, um,
you weren't even looking.

884
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,300
You actually had
your eyes closed, so how...

885
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,700
um, i was watching you,

886
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
and you didn't even
need the...

887
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,000
well, you didn't even need
the screen

888
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,600
to help you guide
the needle holder.

889
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,900
Old school, yang.

890
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,700
Muscle memory.

891
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,300
You want to win?

892
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Always go back
to the basics.

893
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,700
It's my move?

894
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
Cristina, what the hell
are you doing?

895
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
being comfortable
in my apartment.

896
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,000
I didn't see anything.
I did not see anything.

897
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,100
Get out.
Yeah.

898
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
Basics.

899
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,800
<i>So go ahead...</i>

900
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,100
<i>argue with the refs,</i>

901
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,800
<i>change the rules,</i>

902
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,400
<i>cheat a little...</i>

903
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,200
<i>Take a break</i>
<i>and tend to your wounds.</i>

904
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,600
<i>But play.</i>

905
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
hello?

906
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,600
<i>Play.</i>

907
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,200
hi.

908
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,900
Hi.

909
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
you live here?

910
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah.

911
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,100
I'm not...
crazy or anything,

912
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,300
i just spend so much time
here in the hospital...

913
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,300
it's just...
it's easier. So...

914
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,900
i'm not... i'm not crazy
or anything.

915
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,500
do you know how to cut hair?

916
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,000
<i>Play hard...</i>
<i>play fast...</i>

917
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,100
<i>play loose and free.</i>

918
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,000
<i>play as if</i>
<i>there's no tomorrow.</i>

919
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,600
come on, bubbles.

920
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,700
Dandridge veterinary clinic.

921
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,700
We certainly do.

922
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,900
Yes. Thank you.

923
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
You're getting
the hang of it?

924
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,700
Not really.

925
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,900
You give up men?

926
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,800
No.

927
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
Yes.

928
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,400
You know, i don't actually
need to see the vet.

929
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,300
I really just wanted
to sit with doc.

930
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,000
I just want to spend time
with my dog.

931
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,800
hi. I'm finn dandridge.
I'm doc's vet.

932
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,100
And you are dr. Grey,

933
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,800
doc's other owner.

934
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,600
We finally meet. Hello.

935
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,900
<i>Okay... so... it's not whether</i>
<i>you win or lose,</i>

936
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,200
<i>it's how you play the game.</i>
