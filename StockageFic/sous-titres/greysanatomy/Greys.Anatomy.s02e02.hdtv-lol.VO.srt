1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,400
Previously,on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,540
derek's married

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:06,450
Addison

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,820
what are you doing here

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,090
You had a life in manhattan.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,460
had

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,450
Bringing addie out was

8
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,570
a business decision

9
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,230
Nothing personal.

10
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,350
It is personal to me

11
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,020
Don't sweat it,shepherd. I'll

12
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,720
only be you boss a few days

13
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,500
I have a girlfriend.

14
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,260
olivia

15
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,430
You and alex?

16
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,490
You gave me syphilis?!

17
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,950
Aah!

18
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,220
I think it's best

19
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,830
to make a clean eak.

20
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,730
Oh,you 'rending this.

21
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,180
I'm pregnt.

22
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,400
Have you ever bothered to tell

23
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,430
burke about the baby

24
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
I've had this thing for my

25
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,180
roommate since,like day one,

26
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,430
and i just can't tell her.

27
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,610
My husband didn't cheat on me.

28
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,720
I cheated on him

29
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,680
It's like i was drowning,

30
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,340
and you saved me.

31
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,290
It's not enough.

32
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,570
I have an aunt who,

33
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,290
whenever she poured anything

34
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,200
for you,would say,"say when."

35
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,970
It's not us. It's them.

36
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,470
Them and their stupid boy... penises.

37
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,960
They didn't tell me they had a wife.

38
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,510
They gave absolutely no warning

39
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,640
that they were going to break up with you.

40
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,200
It's not that burke broke up with me.

41
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,180
It's how he broke up with me... like it was business,

42
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,410
like it was a business trans... like he's the boss of me?

43
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,710
He is the boss of you.

44
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,240
And what's worse is that i care.

45
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm gonna throw up again.

46
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,290
my aunt say,say when

47
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,820
and of course,we never did

48
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,490
No. Wait. False alarm.

49
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,220
The problem is estrogen.

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,880
No,the problem is tequila.

51
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,180
I used to be all business.

52
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,790
And then he goes and gets me pregnant.

53
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,430
With his stupid boy penis.

54
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,020
now I'm having hormone surges.

55
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,380
He ruined me. I'm ruined.

56
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,710
He turned me into this fat,stupid pregnant girl...

57
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,620
who cares.

58
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,400
Estrogen.

59
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,080
Penises. Penises,izzie.

60
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,430
Estrogen,george.

61
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,130
Okay. What did i miss?

62
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,020
I came home to full-on vomit drama

63
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,420
apparently,she dumped derek. And her?

64
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,490
she's been sleeping with burke.

65
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh,i knew that.

66
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,130
We don't say "when" because

67
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,420
there's something irresistible

68
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,570
about the possibility of more.

69
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,920
So you really broke up with shepherd?

70
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,670
I feel empty.

71
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,840
Two hours of vomiting will do that to you.

72
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,450
More tequila. More love.

73
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,570
more anything.More is better.

74
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,620
No. I feel

75
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,440
empty

76
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,740
You're lucky. I feel pissed off.

77
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,180
stop.

78
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,850
What?

79
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,800
You're stalking me. Stop it.

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,540
Did we not communicate last night?

81
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,360
yes

82
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,610
Did you hear what i was saying?

83
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
Your wife screwed your best friend.

84
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,400
And then from that point on,

85
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,400
she no longer existed to me anymore.

86
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,620
You had marital amnesia.

87
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,740
No. I bared my soul to you last night.

88
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,200
It's not enough.

89
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,190
How can that not be enough?

90
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,390
When you waited two months to tell me,

91
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,360
and i had to find out by her showing up,

92
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,900
all leggy and fabulous,and telling herself?

93
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,530
You pulled the plug.

94
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,210
I'm a sink with an open drain.

95
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,350
Anything you say runs right out.

96
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
There is no"enough."

97
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,480
She probably could have picked a better metaphor.

98
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,770
Give her a break.

99
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,630
She's got a hanover.

100
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,290
Dr. Shepherd.

101
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,850
Dr. Burke.

102
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,030
We have an organ donor coming in

103
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,490
this afternoon from wilkeson general.

104
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,870
We're doing the harvest... commendable.

105
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,050
In o.r.1 at 4. I'm in o.r.1 at 4.

106
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,110
Your surgery's non-critical.

107
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,750
You can't bump me

108
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,850
You'll be first up tomorrow. As chief...

109
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,650
interim chief.

110
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,620
I can. Bump somebody else.

111
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
You're in the o.r. We need.

112
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,730
Why don't they do the harvest at wilkeson?

113
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,670
Small facility in the boonies... a doc in the box.

114
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,380
We have the location,the airport nearby

115
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,090
and the staff.

116
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,150
Your surgery is rescheduled.

117
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,730
"Mine's bigger than yours."

118
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,200
Whip it out. I'll measure.

119
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,730
Shut up,alex. Shut up,alex.

120
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,440
Male,55,victim of a head-on collision.

121
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,730
G.c.s. Is 3,depressed skull fracture,

122
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,350
multiple internal injuries,a.c.l.s. Protocol started,

123
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,390
but his vein's blue so we've been pushing meds down the tube.

124
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,760
P.e.a. On arrival.

125
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,520
How long's he been down?

126
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,550
We've been doing c.p.r. For about 20 minutes.

127
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,280
It took fire 20 minutes to get him out of the car.

128
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,310
He's pretty much gone.

129
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,270
No,he's not gone until we say he's gone.

130
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,770
Keep coding.

131
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,600
O'malley,get him into abay and save him.

132
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,790
But he's dead.

133
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,170
Did you not hear me?

134
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,910
He's not dead until

135
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,170
we say he's dead.

136
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,430
You know what to do,so do it.

137
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,260
Grey,you're on this,too. Move.

138
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,580
We've got three more victims in the other car coming in.

139
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,790
Let's move,people.

140
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,820
He's dead.

141
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,360
Hey,olivia.

142
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,540
Pulseless v tach.

143
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,580
Line's in.

144
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay,charge to 200.

145
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,380
200. Clear.

146
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,500
(monitor beeps)

147
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,950
Push one of epi. Let's go again. Charge 300.

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,320
Seriously?

149
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,800
I thinthat's what dr. Bailey wants you to do,george.

150
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,000
Dr. O'malley.

151
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,120
It's what she wants,dr. O'malley.

152
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,290
Okay,then let's charge to 300.

153
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,180
300. Clear.

154
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,810
Male,46,unrestrained driver of the car that jumped lanes.

155
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,880
B.p. 80 over palp,tachycardic,last pulse... 138.

156
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,990
Got 2 liters l.r. Running wide open.

157
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,150
Significant abdominal tenderness. Any history?

158
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,750
Wife says he's got a bad liver. He's on the transplant list.

159
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,310
Abdomen's rigid. Okay,hands off.

160
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,930
We need to page burke and domner.

161
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,070
Prep this guy for the o.r. Who wants it? I do!

162
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,860
I do! I do!

163
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,200
No,you're too late. Stevens,take it. Yes!

164
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,910
Karev,take the boy.

165
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,100
Yang,the mom.

166
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,500
I wanna be looking at their films in 15 minutes.

167
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
We got one more for you.

168
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,930
What is it?

169
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,320
That guy.

170
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,610
He was in the accident?

171
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,830
No,bowel obstruction.

172
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,650
He's not telling us what he ingested,

173
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,930
but the films look like he's packing.

174
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,270
Can't people figure out a better way to move drugs?

175
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,970
Grey? Oh,pericaiocentesis,good.

176
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,850
Any response?

177
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,270
Okay,uh,all right,you guys,can...

178
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,990
should i call it?

179
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,300
Well,what would you do next,o'malley?

180
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,920
I would call it.

181
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,620
To save him.

182
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,410
Uh,um... a pericardial window?

183
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,940
Excellent. Do it. Grey,you're done here.

184
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,440
I got a bowel obstruction for you.

185
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,830
Fun.

186
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,290
At least your patient's still alive.

187
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,670
What next,doctor?

188
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,100
* nobody knows where they might end up *

189
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,140
* nobody knows *

190
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,840
* oh,oh *

191
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,230
* suppose you'll never know **

192
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,390
Okay,stop,That's it.

193
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,440
That is not it.

194
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,040
Come on,will you stop it? That's it.

195
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
That is not it,richard,hold still.

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,470
How can i hold still when you're poking me?

197
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,920
I have to poke you to discharge you

198
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,330
What makes you think he wants to be discharged?

199
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,790
Derek,don't you know this hospital will crumble

200
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,350
unless richard's here holding up the walls?

201
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,400
Adele,you're supposed to be in the virgin islands.

202
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,330
Oh,you are in five kinds of trouble,mister man.

203
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,850
You had brain surgery and didn't tell me?

204
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,770
It was just a small procedure.

205
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,720
It was brain surgery.

206
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,050
I didn't want to ruin your vacation.

207
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,100
You don't know what a vacation is.

208
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,570
How would you know how to ruin it?

209
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,670
Well,anyway...

210
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,570
how did you find... you called my wife?

211
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,830
You called mine.

212
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,680
Look,having someone home with you is the only way

213
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,940
i'm letting you out of here today.

214
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,400
Fine.

215
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,280
I thought i saw a fabulous looking woman walk by.

216
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,460
Addison,yes,see! Hi.

217
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,770
I told richard i knew you and derek

218
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,930
would get back together.

219
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,830
Uh,actually,I'm here on a case.

220
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,140
Addison and i are over,adele.

221
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,090
It's not like we're divorced.

222
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,130
Practically divorced. You've had counseling?

223
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,810
We had adultery. That was enough.

224
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,740
I'll call you later,okay? Mm-hmm.

225
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,140
You should give her a chance,derek.

226
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,310
It's good to see you. Keep him in line.

227
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,620
My mom's okay,right?

228
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,660
Yeah,yeah,i think so.

229
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,060
They'd been fighting at breakfast.

230
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,450
Dad gets ugly when he gets like that.

231
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,340
Ran three stoplights before we even got on the freeway.

232
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,840
My husband bob's a really good driver.

233
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,480
Some guy in a pickup cuts us off.

234
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,230
Safe,you know? I think he saw something in the...

235
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,200
in the middle of the road and... my dad just lost it.

236
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,670
And swerved to avoid it. He started chasing the guy.

237
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,930
The crash... it just... it just came outta nowhere.

238
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,410
Blasting through traffic.

239
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,010
We'd been having a really nice morning.

240
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,550
One minute,everything's fine. And the next... screaming at him.

241
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,990
I could see the guy's face before we hit. Next thing i know...

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,450
we're upside down on the other side of the freeway.

243
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,370
Do the surgeons know that bob has a bad liver? They know.

244
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,190
How's scotty?

245
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,140
Your son's in the next room getting x-rayed.

246
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,390
My dad... he...

247
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,700
he's in surgery. It's pretty serious.

248
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,680
Yeah,well...

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
i guess the son of a bitch got what he deserved.

250
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,660
What makes people think they don't need seatbelts?

251
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,960
My end is done.

252
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,070
Well,the bowel's a mess,but it's repairable.

253
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,530
It's a lot of work,but i don't see the point with this liver.

254
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,470
What do you see,dr. Stevens?

255
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,800
Uh,deep laceration,bleeding. What else?

256
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,500
It's hard and pale... cirrhotic.

257
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,960
They said he's on the transplant list.

258
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,410
Does he have family here,stevens?

259
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,140
A wife and son.

260
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,580
Okay,i'm just gonna roll you over. Gently.

261
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,070
Oh!

262
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,140
This looks pretty bad. How did you get this?

263
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,820
Well,we hit so hard.

264
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,890
I don't think this is from the collision.

265
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,200
It looks a couple of weeks old.

266
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,330
Where are you?

267
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,020
I can see his heart.

268
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,520
His heart that's not beating.

269
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,130Okay,open the pericardium and aspirate.

270
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,190
If the heart's still not beating,close and call it.

271
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,460
What? You think we're defiling this man's body?

272
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,270
Well,we're certainly doing more...

273
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,020
than what?

274
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,370
If they're dead or dying when they come through those doors,

275
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,580
you hump,and hump hard. Why?

276
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,090
For the experience.

277
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,950
No,what else? There's something more.

278
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,680
You think on that. It'll come to you.

279
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,570
You know,mr. Hubble,

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,840
you might make things a little easier on yourself

281
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
if you would just tell us what you've ingest.

282
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,220
We'll know anyway once we see your films.

283
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,600
You have the most beautiful features.

284
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,800
They're delicate.

285
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,120
Almost porcelain.

286
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,340
Mr. Hubble,whatever you've ingested could kill you.

287
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,610
Are you sure you don't want to tell me

288
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,050
what's got you blocked up inside?

289
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,550
It might offend you.

290
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,940
Is it drugs? It's not drugs.

291
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,760
Mr. Hubble...

292
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,600
i promise.

293
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,110
It's not drugs.

294
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay.

295
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,570
Well,good,i'm glad it's not drugs.

296
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,970
It's drugs.

297
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Looks like at leasten balloons in his bowel.

298
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,150
My guess cocaine.

299
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,550
Scott seibert,18,no fractures or internal bleeding.

300
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,350
Got pretty lucky. Recommendation?

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,740
Keep overnight for observation.

302
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,320
Damn. Lea seibert,43,multiple healed fractures

303
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,180
on her clavicle and humerus,her third and fourth rib.

304
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,930
She's either a bull rider or she's abused.

305
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,440
Kid said the accident was road rage.

306
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,890
His old man got cut off in traffic,went ballistic.

307
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
Well,that's not the story i got.

308
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,950
She has a large,yellowing bruise over her right kidney

309
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,850
tender to palpitation.

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,640
Said she got it from a fall last week. She's bleeding.

311
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,920
Perinephric hematoma. What do you do?

312
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,320
It should take care of itself. We'll keep an eye on it.

313
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,880
She needs,uh,bed rest and a shrink.

314
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,210
It's drugs.

315
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,470
Stupid,stupid,stupid.

316
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,890
One burst and he's dead in five minutes.

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,150
Okay,what do we do? Run his bowel.

318
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,870
And what does that mean? Yang?

319
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,100
Uh,running the bowel entails removing all 36 feet

320
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,910
of the intestine from the body cavity,

321
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,290
hand searching for the balloons and then cutting them out.

322
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,450
Grey,book an o.r. Yang,karev,you're in.

323
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,740
Need all the hands i can get.

324
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,200
Are you sure they're balloons?

325
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,260
You have reason to believe they're not balloons?

326
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,710
This one here's got a face.

327
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,650
So does that one.

328
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,450
They all do.

329
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,070
I'll be damned. They're judys.

330
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,520
Judys?

331
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,490
He swallowed the heads of ten judy dolls.

332
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,330
Eww.

333
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,760
My mother used to buy me judy dolls...

334
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,730
manhattan judy,surfer judy disco judy. I always wanted one.

335
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,890
I dissected them,cut off their arms,

336
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,880
and shaved their heads.

337
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,070
Sounds like there's a sick and twisted story behind this.

338
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,950
They're sexist,distorted devil toys

339
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,370
that create unrealistic image expectations

340
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,760
catering to the porn-driven minds of men.

341
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,280
You swallow a bitter pill this morning,yang?

342
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,590
They're dolls.

343
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,060
Grey,call for a psych consult.

344
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,680
And then see if he has family. Do i still book the o.r.?

345
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
Blocked bowels become necrotic bowels.

346
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,140
Check with dr. Burke,see if we can bump someone.

347
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,090
Those judy's gotta come out today.

348
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,160
Hanging another b-neg.

349
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,970
He's going through a lot of blood.

350
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,130
What's the word from u.n.o.s.?

351
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,460
He's on the list,but they don't have a liver for him.

352
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,570
The list won't help him now.

353
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,000
We can work all day,

354
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,320
but this liver won't stop bleeding.

355
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,230
And it won't support his recovery from surgery.

356
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,890
What about the donor from wilkeson that's coming in?

357
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,640
That liver's already been committed.

358
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,460
Mr. Siebert's only hope is a family donor.

359
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,780
Maybe we should call it. No use in tying up an o.r.

360
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,010
If we're just postponing the inevitable.

361
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,300
How much work do you have here to complete,dr. Domner?

362
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,700
Oh,mabe six hours.

363
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,060
Then that's how much time we have to find him a new liver.

364
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,260
You're the chief.

365
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,680
any family members waiting?

366
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,190
Still trying to reach them. Good.

367
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,290
I mean,not good that we haven't reached them.

368
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,100
It's just good i don't have to...

369
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,620
it's always hard.

370
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,290
yeah

371
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm sorry about alex.

372
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,450
That's fine. It's good,you know.

373
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,180
No need to talk about it.

374
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,680
You do understand that i had sex with him before you,not during.

375
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,920
Because when you and i were having sex...

376
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,640
i understand.

377
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,660
I just wanted to clear the air. Oh.

378
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,940
It's clear.

379
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,510
Perfectly clear... okay.

380
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,700
And about the syphilis.

381
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,670
We really don't have to talabout this.

382
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,140
It's just,i mean,i didn't... i didn't know i had it.

383
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,560
I should've. I'm a nurse. I mean,there was the sore.

384
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,040
And i was all itchy.

385
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,140
Okay,you know,i,uh,got it.

386
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,800
You know,things happen.

387
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,040
They... they really do.

388
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,830
Things you wish you could change.

389
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,350
Yeah. (pager beeps)

390
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,430
It's the chief.

391
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,320
I gotta take this. Sure.

392
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,820
George.

393
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,550
You have to call it.

394
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,700
Call it?

395
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,770
Him.

396
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,980
Oh,um,time of death 1:48.

397
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,110
I got it.

398
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,370
This guy came in this morning

399
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,380
with ten judy doll heads in his abdomen.

400
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,350
Is that some kind of sick or what?

401
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,860
I mean,when you think about it

402
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,430
those things can't be that easy to swallow.

403
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,980
If they still got their hair on them,

404
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,820
that's some bad spaghetti.

405
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,420
That dude's crapping toys.

406
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,270
U know,when you're little you can hide.

407
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,710
Ignore the shouting,the screaming,

408
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,060
pretend like youe someplace else.

409
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,010
Then when you get older,bigger,

410
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,390
you feel like you should be doing something.

411
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,970
Something to stop it. You know,to protect her.

412
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,660
And when you can't,

413
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,800
you don't know who to be angrier at...

414
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,510
your old man or yourself.

415
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,400
Usually it's yourself.

416
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,240
Did she tell you?

417
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,060
She didn't have to it's all over her films.

418
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,310
He's not beating you,is he?

419
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,760
No,just her.

420
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,800
(elevator dings)

421
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,770
So what do you do about the anger?

422
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,380
Me? I think about the guy who eats doll heads.

423
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,090
He's got problems.

424
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,450
Hey,i've been looking for you guys.

425
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,050
It's my father.

426
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,830
Bob liked his beers.

427
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,830
His liver started to fail a couple of years ago.

428
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,320
He quit drinking,and we put him on the transplant list.

429
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,470
But his blood type... "b" negative.

430
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,110
There just aren't that many available.

431
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,500
They suggested a family member.

432
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,690
Any luck?

433
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,610
My son.

434
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,110
They said scotty's a good match. He's 18.

435
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,650
Family members shouldn't do it out of obligation.

436
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,840
It's a risky operation.

437
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,150
Scotty's had counseling.

438
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,110
You know,they just don't let you do it.

439
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,750
He hasn't made his mind up yet,you know.

440
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,560
I mean,we actually have a date set for the surgery.

441
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,230
I just... i just don't... i don't want to pressure him.

442
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,500
Well,then you shouldn't.

443
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,060
Oh,god. Oh,god,i don't wanna lose bob.

444
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,450
Look,we'll give your son as much time as we can

445
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,870
to make a decision,okay?

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,990
Would you care to explain?

447
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,210
Seibert is a wife beater. Her films show years of abuse.

448
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't know that. Multiple fractures.

449
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,910
She has a kidney bleed from a beating she took last week

450
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,610
plus it was... it was his road rage

451
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,120
that caused the accident. The guy in the other car died.

452
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,240
And that means what?

453
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,840
No heroic measures? We leave him on the table?

454
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,430
Well,if it were up to me... think like a surgeon,dr. Yang.

455
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,760
We have a dying patient and a liver that could save him.

456
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,000
Well,this is more complicated than that.

457
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,810
For social workers,yes. For the family. Not for you.

458
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,140
It isn't up to you.

459
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,370
Yeah,you made that perfectly clear.

460
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,710
Well,i'm glad we have an understanding.

461
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,860
Yeah,i'm sure you are.

462
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,960
R from wilkeson?

463
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,400
Should be here at 3. Harvest team's on their way in.

464
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,730
I also need to touch base with the transplant center

465
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,110
about seibert's getting his son's liver.

466
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,180
Dr. Burke.

467
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,980
Dr. Bailey needs an o.r. And they're all booked. For?

468
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,740
An emergent bowel obstruction.

469
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,170
Drugs?

470
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,980
Ten judy doll heads.

471
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,430
Seriously? Yes.

472
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,460
I can see their little faces.

473
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,550
"Help! Let me out!"

474
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,230
Bump warner's hernia in 1.

475
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,750
But don't tell him what we're removing.

476
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,740
Thank you.

477
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,570
If he can't be here obsessing,

478
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,860
he wants stuff to obsess with at home.

479
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,180
I'll be done and out of your way in a moment.

480
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,360
Intern time cards... sign.

481
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,310
It's always something,isn't it?

482
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,080
Some emergency surgery,some annoying administrative problem.

483
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,760
Being chief is a lot like being an intern.

484
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,810
The work never stops.

485
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,730
When i found out richard had a tumor,

486
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,000
you know what i felt?

487
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,070
Relieved.

488
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,260
I was hoping he would finally be forced to retire.

489
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,200
Ah,that has your attention,doesn't it

490
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,580
how we both would like for that to happen.

491
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,230
I could finally book a vacation for two.

492
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,270
You know,you're perfect for this job,preston...

493
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,730
unattached,obsessive. This hospital,this job...

494
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,950
it's enough for you,isn't it?

495
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,400
It has to be today?

496
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,060
He won't make it off the table with his own liver.

497
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,470
He's bleeding a lot.

498
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,250
When you get counseling,they tell you not to force it...

499
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,540
the decision,you know?

500
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,960
One day,one moment...

501
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,580
you'll just know the right thing to do.

502
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,040
It should be easy,right? He's my father.

503
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,890
Well,it's a tough operation.

504
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,510
I mean,it would be a big change in your life.

505
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,820
The upside is that the liver's

506
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,390
the only organ that regenerates itself.

507
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,450
I mean,they're gonna only take half of yours

508
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,130
and it'll be back to normal size in two months.

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,650
You probably won't brunning any marathons anytime soon...

510
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,490
dr. Stevens,can i see you outside for a moment?

511
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,270
What is your problem? You're doing a sales pitch.

512
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,970
The recipient is your patient.

513
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,540
You shouldn't even be talking to the donor.

514
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,480
The recipient is his father,

515
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,420
who he's gonna lose if he doesn't make a decision.

516
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,760
And he understands that,all right?

517
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,470
Believe me,he understands that.

518
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,930
You have no idea what's going on in that kid's head.

519
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,090
None.

520
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,760
Call three times a day.

521
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,000
Do not call three times a day.

522
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,960
And if my wife doesn't put you through... i won't put you through.

523
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,300
Keep calling until she does. Yes,sir.

524
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,960
He's not talking. It could be pica.

525
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,380
But doubtful for a man his age.

526
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,940
Maybe an oedipal complex

527
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,090
or idolization of the dolls as partners.

528
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,590
Or it could be that he simply enjoys it.

529
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,500
You know,i've seen a lot of strange things

530
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,620
in strange places,but how does he enjoy this?

531
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,400
He 'd enjoy then when they came out.

532
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,930
I didn't need to hear that.

533
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,950
Dr. Grey,may i speak with you for a moment?

534
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,500
Don't look at me for help.

535
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,540
I assume he told you why he left me?

536
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,290
Dr. Shepherd,with all due respect,

537
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,690
this has nothing to do with me.

538
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,780
Really?

539
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,430
So you didn't take him back? Good girl.

540
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,200
And in the future,i'd appreciate it if we could

541
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,310
keep our relationship strictly professional.

542
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,340
Meredith?

543
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,060
Sometimes people do desperate things

544
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,510
to get someone's attention.

545
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,800
There are two sides to every story.

546
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
(cristina) the father's an alcoholic wife beater.

547
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,490
I mean,it shouldn't even be a question.

548
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,410
Yeah,but if you could save somebody and didn't,

549
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,930
wouldn't you feel like you were committing murder?

550
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,230
Oh,yeah,like the guy did when he crashed into george's d.o.a.?

551
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,160
He's the killer,not the son. Oh,that is sick.

552
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,380
Who would do that?

553
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,570
Ugh. Look,see judy fly.

554
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,600
Hey,george. Hey.

555
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,520
what?

556
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,180
Geor...

557
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,280
she was trying to make up with you.

558
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,300
You should go eat with her. No. No,i shouldn't.

559
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,390
She's cute and she likes you.

560
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,500
You shouldn't let a little syph get in the way.

561
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,580
It's not the syph.

562
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,720
Oh,so the syph.

563
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,170
It is not the syph.

564
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,850
Then what is it?

565
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,020
Oh.

566
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,970
What?

567
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,360
What is it? Out with it.

568
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,020
The's this other girl. Izzie!

569
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,670
Other girl? You have another girl?

570
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,090
He hasn't told her yet that he likes her.

571
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,920
Izzie,we are not in high school.

572
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,050
George has a little crush.

573
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,970
I do not have a crush. It is a thing.

574
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,630
A thing that is very personal.

575
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,330
One day,i'd like to build on this thing

576
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,730
with this other girl... woman. She's all woman.

577
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,810
What are you doing?

578
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,770
I'm just playing with...

579
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,110
no,george,with olivia? What are you doing with olivia?

580
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,260
Oh,nothing.

581
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,170
You're letting her think you're emotionally available.

582
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,920
You're letting her think she has a chance.

583
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,970
And there is nothing worse in the world

584
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,440
than thinking you have a chance,when you really dot.

585
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,650
Meredith is right. Tell her there's someone else.

586
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,340
Tell her why,george. I mean,at least give her the chance

587
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,520
to have some feelings about it for god's sake!

588
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,630
why are you yelling at me ?

589
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,600
Because i've got estrogen,george.

590
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,210
Because of all the estrogen.

591
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,680
so,new subject?

592
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,980
It's a mess. No,it isn't.

593
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,350
I think i know a mess when i see a mess.

594
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,380
You've got the harvest tying up o.r. 1.

595
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,920
siebert tying up o.r. 2. Bowel obstruction,o.r. 3...

596
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,790
it's simply a bit crowded.

597
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,140
Well,your "crowded" is my "seriously overbooked."

598
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,260
And in my book,"seriously overbooked" is a mess.

599
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,820
(pager beeps)

600
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,050
They need to know if there's any word on the seibert liver.

601
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,750
How much work do they have left? A couple of hours.

602
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,330
Well,tell him i'll be in to see them.

603
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,810
You bumped me for a bowel obstruction?

604
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,260
Oh,uneasy lies the head that wears the chief's cap.

605
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,880
Was it an act of desperation?

606
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,550
Not at all.

607
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,570
Something to attra attention?

608
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,550
Of course not.

609
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm just trying to understand here,mr. Hubble.

610
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,590
Why ten doll heads?

611
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,030
Well,'cause eleven would've been too much.

612
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,400
I think it has something to do with his mother.

613
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,030
Maybe she always wanted a girl and gave him judy dolls

614
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,230
for his birthday presents.

615
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,170
Aha,i got another one.

616
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,040
Doyen clamps to yang.

617
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,900
Grey,push the head up to the incision.

618
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,730
Maybe his mother looked like judy and he was into voodoo.

619
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,860
Instead of sticking pins in...

620
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,930
ah,black judy.

621
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,880
Before they gave her long hair.

622
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,560
Back when she had the afro.

623
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,170
She came with go-go boots and a leather jacket.

624
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,720
That's a shame. It's a real collector's item.

625
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,510
Collectible dolls... a new twist.

626
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,120
Seriously,you can identify these dolls by their heads?

627
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,440
You got a problem with that,yang?

628
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,360
I like judy dolls. I own judy dolls.

629
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,510
The only problem i have with judy dolls

630
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,190
is that they're in the bowel of this man.

631
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,740
Bailey,i need an intern in the e.r.

632
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,520
To meet the harvest donor. O'malley.

633
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,970
See ya,turbo. You good here?

634
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,720
A couple of more heads to go.

635
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,860
Then karev,stevens,yang,scrub out.

636
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,550
You need to get an answer from seibert's son.

637
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,920
Okay.

638
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,530
Ah,yes,mod judy. She came with a yellow vespa.

639
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,760
You know what's strange?

640
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,450
We haven't had enough strange?

641
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,090
She looks a little like you.

642
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,040
This is the donor from wilkeson general.

643
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,940
Just put her in here until the harvest team comes down.

644
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,740
Thanks.

645
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,440
Well,at least this one's heart is still beating.

646
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
I think bailey would want me to...

647
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,110
we finally reached the family of the dead motorist.

648
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,660
They live in portland. Should be here in a few hours.

649
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,270
Want me to page you when they get here? Yeah,do they know?

650
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,020
Only that we were still working on him.

651
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,990
I thinit's better to hear bad news first hand.

652
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,440
I know i'd like to talk to the doctor who called it.

653
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,200
Get some answers.

654
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,260
So that i could get on with my life.

655
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Uh...

656
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:17,970
george...

657
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,130
d you...

658
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,160
did you see that?

659
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,080
She's decerebrate. Her brain's...

660
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
her brain stem's still alive. Um...

661
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,680
okay,we'll take it from here. Thanks.

662
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,480
Would you look at this?

663
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,030
She's decerebrate. Okay.

664
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,730
Yeah,she can't really be declared brain dead.

665
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,030
It's a small reaction. They probably just missed it.

666
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,730
The cortex is dead. The brain stem will follow.

667
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,760
Death is imminent. We just have to wait it out.

668
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,260
Yeah,but don't you...

669
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,680
she'll be dead by the time we get to the o.r.,doctor.

670
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,580
But she's...

671
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,810
she's alive now.

672
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,970
(knocks on door)

673
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,230
It smells like a hospital in here.

674
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,950
What are we doin' with this guy,preston?

675
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
Is this just an exercise? I don't need the practice.

676
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,000
The transplant committee gave us the green light.

677
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,230
I'm tryin' to get an answer from the son.

678
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,250
Well,this guy's goin' through blood

679
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,520
like there's no tomorrow,and i mean that literally.

680
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,800
How much work do you have left now?

681
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,930
mabe an hour and a half.

682
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,990
But without a liver,

683
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,220
i don't think this guy's gonna last that long.

684
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,360
I need to speak to scotty.

685
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,780
I can talk to him. I need to talk to him.

686
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,930
I think they want him to make the decision on his own.

687
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,070
You think i'm sick for wanting to save my husband,

688
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,750
don't you?

689
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,820
I think...

690
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
your feeling very emotional,

691
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,530
and when we're feeling emotional,

692
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,290
sometimes it's... sometimes it's hard

693
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,470
to keep a vel head and consider all the facts.

694
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,110
Your husband killed a man on the highway today.

695
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,290
He almost killed you and your son.

696
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,340
Those are the facts.

697
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,330
Have you ever been in love,doctor?

698
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,000
Have you?

699
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,270
Love has its limits.

700
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
dr. Shepherd.

701
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,140
Dr. O'malley.

702
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,660
I was just in i.c.u. With the harvest donor.

703
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,890
And dr. Bailey,she has us

704
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,060
do exams and procedures on patients,

705
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,450
even if they're dead.

706
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,760
What'd you find?

707
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,140
Uh,she's decerebrate.

708
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,260
The donor... her brain stem is still alive.

709
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:46,850
excuse me.

710
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,050
I'm derek shepherd,head of neurosurgery.

711
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,020
You mind if i take a look?

712
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,360
Okay,yeah,uh,she's still posturing.

713
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,870
We have every intention of waiting until she's dead.

714
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,600
She's in an irreversible coma.

715
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,860
Hines,the neuro at wilkeson ran the protocol.

716
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,440
They missed decerebration. What else did they miss?

717
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,360
She has a tumor on her,uh...

718
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,400
brain stem,right?

719
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,530
I don't see an m.r.i.

720
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,340
Did you do an e.e.g. To confirm brain death?

721
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,790
Yeah,according to hines. I don't know dr. Hines.

722
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,930
We have six patients

723
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,410
in three states waiting for this woman's organs.

724
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,360
Yeah,and i'm sure they'd all be happy to know that

725
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,400
the organs they're receiving are from

726
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,050
somebody who's actually brain dead.

727
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,080
No one's gonna touch her while she 's alive.

728
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,500
For you to imply otherwise...

729
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,500
is there a problem here,dr. Orsen,dr. Shepherd?

730
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,510
Yeah,we have a donor who's still decerebrate. And?

731
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,300
And I wanna do an e.e.g. and  an  m.r.r.

732
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,700
(orsen) An expensive waste of time.

733
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,920
I insist on it.

734
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,120
You insist on it?

735
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,840
I do.

736
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,410
Well,if my head of neurosurgery

737
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,780
says he needs an e.e.g. And an m.r.i.,

738
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,890
he needs an e.e. G and an m.r.i.

739
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,280
You realize we have six patients waiting?

740
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,770
That is not my call,dr. Orsen.

741
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,910
Who gets the organs is up to u.n.o.s.

742
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,040
Who donates the organs is up to the families.

743
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,110
Hell,i got a guy in the o.r. That's waiting for a liver

744
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,710
that may not even deserve to be saved,

745
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,200
and agai that's not my call.

746
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,780
But you wanna know what my call is?

747
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,940
Everything else.

748
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,210
The patient is yours,dr. Shepherd.

749
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,540
Thank you,dr. Burke.

750
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,370
Dr. O'malley,you want to assist with this m.r.i.?

751
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,650
First thing we'll do is an e.e.g.

752
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,150
George,you with me?

753
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,780
(scott) what if he goes back to hitting her?

754
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,970
You can't make that call,but whatever you do,

755
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,240
you can't make the decision out of anger.

756
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,570
Alex, 

757
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,030
So what do you do with it?

758
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,740
What'd you do with yours? Alex!

759
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Hey,you shouldn't be out here. Dr. Burke needs...

760
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,780
can you just back off,please?

761
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,140
My anger had a life of its own.

762
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,590
I bulked up,became a wrestler,

763
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,780
and the next time he laid a hand on my mother,

764
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,890
i beat the living crap out of him.

765
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,330
When he got out of the hospital,

766
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,060
he took off.

767
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,370
He just took off and never came back.

768
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,580
I mean,he was a cold,mean-tempered bastard,

769
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,120
but he was still my old man,you know?

770
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,680
And then now...

771
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,670
now i can't stop wishin'

772
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,960
that i'd never laid a hand on him...

773
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,790
that we somehow could've worked it through.

774
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,290
What is it?

775
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,470
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. L...

776
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,830
what? What does burke want?

777
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,590
I'm sorry,scott. He needs a decision now.

778
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,100
When would it happen?

779
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,240
We would take scotty to pre-op immediately.

780
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,260
The transplant surgeon is on call and waiting.

781
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,590
There isn't much time.

782
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,030
Scotty...

783
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,860
scotty...

784
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,670
yeah,okay.

785
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,790
I wanna do it.

786
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,130
(burke) let's get him to pre-op.

787
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,850
I'll call the surgeon. But i have a couple of conditions.

788
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,600
You're gonna tell the cops the truth about

789
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,720
what happened in this accident,mom.

790
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,590
And... as soon as we get back home,

791
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,920
you and i are moving out.

792
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,150
Enough is enough.

793
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,010
(burke)... donor,no transmittable diseases.

794
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,330
E.t.a. About ten minutes.

795
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,970
You know she's just gonna go back to him.

796
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,120
No,i don't know that. And that's not my...

797
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,800
this is not our call.

798
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,470
Look,cristina...

799
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,800
i was wondering,uh,i mean,uh...

800
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,670
i was hoping that we can,uh...

801
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,050
i know we didn't...

802
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,550
you're asking me...

803
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,600
are you okay?

804
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,480
Can i scrub in?

805
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,470
Then,yes,dr. Burke,i'm okay.

806
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,600
Karev,let's get him to pre-op.

807
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,330
You see the tumor on her brain stem right here?

808
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,910
It looks pretty bad.

809
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,540
U ever had a crappy day,o'malley?

810
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,680
I mean,really,really crappy.

811
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,950
I have had many crappy days.

812
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,680
This one just got better.

813
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,180
You might as well go home,gentlemen.

814
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,290
I will be the only one of us performing surgery here today.

815
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,620
My friend here has a viable brain.

816
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,470
Okay.

817
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,330
Do you really think she'll be okay?

818
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,800
If i get the tumor out,

819
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,880
she's got a good shot at recovery.

820
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,310
Look out for her.

821
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,560
Meredith?

822
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,890
Yeah.

826
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,200
is that the family of the dead guy?

827
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,570
Yeah.

828
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,130
Look,maybe i'm not over the alex thing

829
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,270
or the syph thing yet.

830
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,500
That... that's not really the problem.

831
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,320
There's a girl who i,uh...

832
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,920
and it doe't matter that there's this other guy,

833
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,840
and frankly,i wouldn't care if she gave me the ebola virus.

834
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,940
I like you,olivia.

835
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,550
But...

836
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,740
i just don't like you enough.

837
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,770
I gave it a shot,right?

838
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,980
And you were honest.

839
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,370
That's good.

840
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,140
You know what you're gonna tell them?

841
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,590
Why do we hump on every dead or dying patient

842
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,600
that comes through those doors?

843
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,900
Experience?

844
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,140
So we can tell their family that we did everything we could.

845
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,100
Are you ted's family?

846
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,480
yeah,yeah,we're ted's family.

847
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,340
just when the day was improving.

848
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,570
You told meredith what happened.

849
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,460
I did. What'd you tell her?

850
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,490
Sometimes people do desperate things

851
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,970
to attract attention. What?

852
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,780
Wow. So that's your side of this,

853
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,420
that i didn't pay you enough attention?

854
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,350
Was that what you were thinking

855
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,720
when you got naked with my best friend?

856
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,980
No,by that point,i wasn't thinking at all,derek.

857
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,620
By that point,i was just scratching an itch.

858
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,180
We got successful,you and me.

859
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
We got busy and we got lazy.

860
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,570
We didn't even bother to fight anymore,derek.

861
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,880
And mark was there,and i missed you.

862
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,440
And now i'm sorry.

863
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,510
I'm more sorry than you could possibly imagine,

864
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,130
but at least i'm talking to you about it. Derek...

865
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,490
i'm a sink with an open drain,addie.


867
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,680
did you get them all?

868
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,260
Yes. It wasn't easy

869
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,040
or very pleasant.

870
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,420
How do you feel?

871
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,650
Empty.

872
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,880
I feel empty now.

873
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,040
Yeah,i've been feeling

874
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,140
a little bit of that myself lately.

875
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,130
I could see that.


877
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,810
mr. Hubble,

878
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,470
why does eating doll heads fill you up?

879
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,720
What's the satisfaction?

880
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,770
Do you really wanna know?

881
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,360
Would it be too much information?

882
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,030
It might.

883
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,020
Maybe i'm better left in the dark.

884
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,760
There's something to be said

885
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,000
about a glass half full...

886
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,580
about knowing when to say when.


888
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,560
i think it's a floating line,

889
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,610
a barometer of need and desire.


891
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,640
it's entirelyup to the individual...

892
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,850
and depends on what's being poured.


894
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,800
sometimes...

895
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,250
all we want is a taste.

897
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,160
other times,

898
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,070
