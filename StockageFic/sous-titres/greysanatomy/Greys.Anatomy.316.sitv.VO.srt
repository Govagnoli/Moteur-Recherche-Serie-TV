1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,367
...viously on Grey's Anatomy.

2
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,009
We just received word of
a mass-casualty incident nearby.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,081
You cannot tell Shepherd
until I've told Meredith.

4
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:07,845
Cristina and I, are engaged.

5
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,414
Immediate! Immediate!
I need help down here!

6
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:12,405
My buddy's trapped.
He's trapped under a car.

7
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:14,054
Dr. O'Malley and I made a deal.

8
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:16,627
He's gonna find my son.
Before I go into surgery.

9
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:17,824
I just have to bandage him up.

10
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,638
We're gonna find someone
to take him to the hospital

11
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,252
- and then we're gonna find your mom.
- I gotta get outta here.

12
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:30,893
<i>Like I said,</i>

13
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:34,874
<i>disappearances happen.</i>

14
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:37,590
<i>Pains...</i>

15
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,332
<i>Go phantom.</i>

16
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:42,360
<i>Blood...</i>

17
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,613
<i>stops running.</i>

18
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>And people,</i>

19
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:50,617
<i>people fade away.</i>

20
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,587
<i>There is more I have to say.</i>

21
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,403
<i>So much more.</i>

22
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:35,810
<i>But...</i>

23
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>I've disappeared.</i>

24
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,348
Did you check on Kramerin on 2309?

25
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,491
Because his x-rays are done,
and I don't know what to do.

26
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,106
Higgins in 2312 needs

27
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,126
- diet orders before he can eat.
- Done and done.

28
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,600
I need you to monitor Collins in 2323.

29
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,775
Page me if his systolic drops below 90.

30
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,543
I gave him a loading dose of dig
to lower his heart rate. right now.

31
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,979
Have either of you seen, Dr. Grey?

32
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,294
I checked on her earlier,

33
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:22,008
- but she's a little sedate today so--
- Not Dr. Ellis Grey.

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,158
Dr. Meredith Grey.

35
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,191
- No.
- Not since this morning.

36
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,470
Fine, if there's anything
emergent, page me in the pit.

37
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,127
George...

38
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,117
Did you find him ?

39
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,709
Is Chris okay ?
Is he awake ? Is he...

40
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,387
Answer Mrs. Heit, O'Malley.

41
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:50,871
Chris is fine.

42
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:55,147
He's glad you're okay and
he'll be waiting for you after surgery.

43
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:56,990
He's being very brave.

44
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,512
That's my Chris. That's my boy.

45
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:03,002
Thank you, Dr. O'Malley,
so much.

46
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,365
Dr. O'Malley.

47
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:10,159
Hold up a second.

48
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:15,015
So what happens when
the happy mother in there

49
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:18,105
wakes up after surgery and her
son isn't there to greet her ?

50
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,231
What then?

51
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,269
How you gonna explain that, O'Malley?

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,796
If she wakes up after surgery because

53
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,472
my lie helped to save her life,
I'm okay with that, Dr. Bailey.

54
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:33,301
- Find that child.
- Yes, Ma'am.

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,895
Her echo showed cardiac tamponade.

56
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,195
So our first priority is stabilize

57
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:45,923
the traumatic pericardial effusion.

58
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,186
Well, keeping mom alive
means keeping baby alive.

59
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,972
I'll monitor the surgery
while he operates.

60
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:51,634
I'll notify the O.R.

61
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:03,037
Chief, we got a mob scene
in the clinic

62
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:04,670
of people looking for
missing family members

63
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,558
and nothing but
a 2-hour-old list of patients.

64
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,727
No one has any more
information than you do.

65
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:10,940
The police are asking us questions.

66
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:12,706
Search and rescue can't track it.

67
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,679
We'll have to do it ourselves.

68
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,247
Is there some kind of system that--

69
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,721
You're the system, Karev.

70
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:19,748
Figure it out.

71
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:26,396
How's she doing?

72
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,138
Well, we won't know until
we get her up to the O.R.

73
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,135
Is she still a Jane Doe?

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,487
Yeah.

75
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,703
Oh, to be in that condition and have
no one who knows you even know...

76
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,440
What?

77
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,084
I mean, she's all alone.

78
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:41,884
It makes you think.

79
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,597
You know, if I went missing, would...

80
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,029
anyone notice I was gone?

81
00:04:58,002 --> 00:04:59,035
Do something.

82
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:00,924
He's still seizing.
There's nothing more I can do.

83
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,282
You're supposed to put
something in his mouth

84
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,325
so he doesn't bite his tongue?

85
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,902
Nobody's putting anything
in his mouth.

86
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,301
We just have to let him ride it out.

87
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,621
Wh-What are you gonna do?
You just can't let him die.

88
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,266
Th-They're gonna come soon--
In a little while, and they...

89
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,437
get him out.

90
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,626
You said we don't got much time.

91
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,417
What if they don't get him out
from there before he--

92
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:20,289
I don't know.

93
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,015
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

94
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,583
I don't know. Please, you can't
quit on us now. You just--

95
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,199
You just gotta try something else.

96
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,274
I'm out of practice.

97
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:31,877
I've been watching.
For weeks, I've just been...

98
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,239
watching. I...

99
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,882
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,297
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,450
You stopped the bleeding.
That was good.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,138
Come on. Please, Doc.

103
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,403
I know this guy.
I believe in him. I...

104
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:53,911
believe he can make it.

105
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,230
You gotta believe in it, too.

106
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,688
You gotta believe
you can do this. Please.

107
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,214
Don't stop now.

108
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,117
Who's got a cell phone?

109
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,060
You guys good?

110
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:18,471
You okay?

111
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,193
- Yeah, what do you got?
- Nearly severed leg,

112
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,771
but he had his artery tied off, so...

113
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,201
- that's something.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,335
Who tied off the artery?

115
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,448
Was it Dr. Grey?
This is her jacket.

116
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,397
We found him like this.

117
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:30,556
She must have moved on.

118
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,030
Yeah, okay.

119
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,521
- Doc.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:39,507
What is it?

121
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,250
Yeah, just stabilize the fracture

122
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,790
and get him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

123
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,065
Hey.

124
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:57,474
You okay?

125
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,984
Hey, did--

126
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,763
Did the doctor bring you here?

127
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:05,337
Meredith?

128
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,149
Is Meredith okay?

129
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:49,599
Hi, my name's George.

130
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:51,007
Is your name Chris?

131
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,577
No.

132
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,437
Is he yours?

133
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,484
Thank you. Thank you very much.

134
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:09,362
- Do you have a new list?
- Not yet.

135
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,214
Nothing? How can there be
no new information?

136
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,719
Isn't there someone you can call?
Someone who knows something?

137
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,504
Uh, nobody knows anything
right now, so...

138
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,715
- <i>Please!</i>
- Quiet!

139
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,706
All right, that list is all have
for you, and it sucks, but that's it.

140
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,341
I can't believe you don't have
some kind of a system. I mean--

141
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,828
Give me a minute to think.
I'll come up with a damn system.

142
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:44,691
I just want you to know

143
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,370
that I understand you're
under a lot of pressure.

144
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,031
If you-- If you just need
to sit for a minute...

145
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,116
or if you need a hand...

146
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,022
or a hug...

147
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,167
This is chief Webber.

148
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:17,878
<i>Oh, chief, I got a guy here,</i>

149
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,821
<i>and-- And we--
We can't extricate him.</i>

150
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,594
- Hold on. Hold on. Who's this?
- <i>And I've tried everything.</i>

151
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,600
<i>It's Izzie Stevens.</i>

152
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:26,229
I'm at the dock. I've got a patient
with a depressed skull fracture

153
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,758
and probably an intracranial bleed.

154
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,561
<i>Is he showing signs
of increased pressure? </i>

155
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:32,096
<i>Yes. His left pupil is blown.
He's gone limp. </i>

156
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,735
He's seizing, and now
his right pupil is dilating.

157
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,969
He could be herniating. What's
your E.T.A. to the hospital?

158
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,882
<i>That's what I'm saying.
We can't get him out. </i>

159
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:40,872
He's stuck under a car,
and we can't get him out.

160
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,704
Okay, first you've got to stay calm.

161
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:43,840
<i>I can't stay calm. </i>

162
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,133
Calm was over minutes ago.
Calm is gone. Calm...

163
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,307
is an impossibility.

164
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,427
<i>I've got his best friends here,
and I can't let him die. </i>

165
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,706
So please just tell me
what I need to do.

166
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,979
You need to do some burr holes.

167
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,491
Burr holes?

168
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,829
I can't do burr holes out here.

169
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,529
<i>Do you want to save
his life, Stevens?</i>

170
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,902
- Yes.
- <i>All right. </i>

171
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,019
I need a mine to check
something out in the book,

172
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,169
and then I'll talk you through it.

173
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,473
<i>You're looking it up in a book? </i>

174
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,436
<i>I'm not a neurosurgeon, Stevens, </i>

175
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,464
<i>and I want to make sure
we get this right. </i>

176
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,765
Somebody find me a copy
of boardman's neurosurgery!

177
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:20,851
Everything okay?

178
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,639
You know anything
about making burr holes?

179
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,085
Done it a couple of times.

180
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,128
Good.

181
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,592
Don't go anywhere.

182
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,649
Stevens, listen to me.

183
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm gonna need a drill.

184
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,611
- There's one in my truck.
- What do you need a drill for?

185
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,519
I've gotta drill holes
in your friend's head.

186
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,886
Watch, your back!
Come on, come on, go.

187
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,621
Uh, hello.
I'm suturing here.

188
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,554
- Sorry. I'm--
- What, you-- Oh, you just got back?

189
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:14,870
Yeah, Um, I'm looking--

190
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,863
Have you, uh, seen any
lost children down here?

191
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,233
Is Meredith back, too? 'Cause
I need her, it's really important.

192
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,466
This is important. This kid's missing.
His mom's in surgery.

193
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,229
- What kind of surgery?
- This kid's lost.

194
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:27,439
You didn't see it today, Cristina.
You weren't out there.

195
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:28,397
I know.

196
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,505
Have you seen any lost kids
down here or not?

197
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,082
- Not.
- Okay.

198
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,242
- Do you know where, uh, Meredith is?
- I'm leaving.

199
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,375
Yeah, I know.

200
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,458
All right, if you can identify
the patient,

201
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,965
please write their name on the picture.

202
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:46,972
I've got markers.

203
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:49,509
These patients are in surgery,

204
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:51,584
and these patients
are in the I.C.U.

205
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,551
This is Fatima!

206
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:54,157
Is she okay?

207
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,392
Uh, yeah. She's in--
She's in the O.R., stable.

208
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,059
Okay, all these people have been
transferred from other hospitals.

209
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,351
Oh, and I have the details.

210
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,210
No.

211
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,642
If it's okay, I got--

212
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,295
I got a case I need to check on.

213
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,524
My husband's not on that board.

214
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,903
Kelly winter-- She's not either.

215
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,853
What does that mean?

216
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,280
It's, uh, it's, uh, they could...

217
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:24,849
be in shock or...

218
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,348
- walked away from the site or--
- Just say it.

219
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,780
A lot of people died. They're dead.

220
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,301
W-We don't know that.

221
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,649
So how can we know?

222
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:35,772
My wife,

223
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,753
she wasn't in these photos either.

224
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:38,870
But she's pregnant.

225
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,039
Is-- Is it possible
you just didn't see her?

226
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,016
She's pregnant?

227
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:04,707
What?

228
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,842
It's okay. Just think.

229
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,969
Where is she?
Which way she go?

230
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,565
It's okay, take your time.

231
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,400
Take all the time you need.
You're doing great.

232
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:18,102
What is it?

233
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:19,529
Good

234
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,328
Okay.

235
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:43,807
Use your words

236
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,976
Where exactly is Meredith?

237
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,304
The leak in the heart is coming
from the right atrium.

238
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,341
Are you gonna put her on bypass?
'Cause that could compromise the baby.

239
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,524
No, I can fix her heart
while it's still beating.

240
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,666
Push 40 milligrams of esmol.

241
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:25,742
I found her husband.

242
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,557
I found him.

243
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:29,602
She's not a Jane Doe.
Her name's Casey.

244
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,420
Casey Clark.

245
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:32,119
What?

246
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:33,659
How do you know?

247
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:35,105
What?

248
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,255
How do you know, it's Casey Clark?

249
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,950
Well, she's pregnant and--

250
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:42,290
There were hundreds of people
on that ferry, Alex, hundreds,

251
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,684
and chances are that more
than one was pregnant.

252
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,139
Now do not give that man hope

253
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,527
unless you are certain.
Do not give him hope

254
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,240
until you've checked every
last body in the morgue.

255
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,815
- Dr. Burke, can I, uh...
- yes, make it fast.

256
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,653
I gotta tell you,
this group of interns...

257
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,456
- Emotional.
- Headstrong.

258
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,827
Hotheaded, stubborn.

259
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,573
They think they know everything.

260
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,785
You can only give them so much rope
before they hang themselves with it.

261
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,288
It's like they lose all rationality,

262
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,650
don't want to listen to reason.

263
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,913
Jeez, preston. Don't hold back.

264
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,141
She's getting hypotensive.

265
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,531
I'm seeing some late decels
on the fetal heart monitor.

266
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,187
The baby is not getting
enough blood.

267
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,763
Almost... just got... one...

268
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,588
more stitch.

269
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:44,853
Got it.

270
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:45,933
Turn on the echo.

271
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,980
Baby's heart re is stabilized.

272
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,571
Then we've seen the worst of it.

273
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:03,366
What's the deal?

274
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,252
Do you know how massive
this hospital is?

275
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:09,187
How many people--
Not just sick people...

276
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,112
Not to mention, if I'm a little kid,

277
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:13,225
how many places can I hide?
He's little.

278
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,926
A little kid can hide anywhere.

279
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,728
What, you're looking for a kid?

280
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:20,053
Yeah.

281
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,607
His mom's in surgery, and I, um...

282
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,918
If I don't find him, Bailey will...

283
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,200
Well, to start, she'll change her

284
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,857
son's middle name to... Elvis or...

285
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:31,707
Tupperware or...

286
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,083
I'm not kidding. Anything
will be better than George.

287
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,186
I know a place a kid might be.

288
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:41,839
Really?

289
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,594
You coulda warned me.

290
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,007
Well, you didn't check down here, right?

291
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:57,918
No.

292
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,998
So stop whining and tell me
if you find a pregnant chick.

293
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,615
You know, you're not the only one
with a detail that sucks.

294
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:05,910
You know,

295
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,408
I'm supposed to deal
with these freaked-out families.

296
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm not good with people. They should
just let me stick to patients.

297
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:14,729
Patients are people, especially kids.

298
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,083
- You know what I mean.
- He's facedown.

299
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,524
How does that...

300
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,632
Come here and help me
turn his body right.

301
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,097
- Dude...
- Don't tell me it doesn't matter.

302
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:33,139
- God, I swear to...
- Dramatic much?

303
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,680
This doesn't bother you?

304
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:38,614
Any of this?

305
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,854
All this death, it doesn't
mean anything to you?

306
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,488
I'm working. Why would it?

307
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,372
Yeah, well, there's working and then...

308
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,101
Caucasian female, about 30 years old.

309
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,589
She's...

310
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,004
She's pretty.

311
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,910
She looks about
seven months pregnant.

312
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,702
<i>Now remember, Stevens,</i>

313
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:22,270
<i>that drill isn't just gonnstop
like a neurosurgical drill,</i>

314
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:25,092
<i>so as soon as you feel
a release in pressure,</i>

315
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,819
<i>stop the drill or
you'll pierce his brain.</i>

316
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,979
Even if I don't see blood?

317
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,730
Trust your instincts, Stevens.
Trust the feel of it.

318
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:33,335
I'm ready.

319
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:36,377
No, wait. I need to clean
the drill off one more time.

320
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,574
You've cleaned it
a dozen times, Stevens.

321
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,302
<i>It's as clean as it's gonna get.</i>

322
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:44,069
You ready?

323
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:47,618
Yes.

324
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:49,168
<i>Okay.</i>

325
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:52,416
<i>Place three fingers above the ear</i>

326
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,198
<i>and two or three fingers
in front of that,</i>

327
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,902
<i>on the side
where the first pupil blew.</i>

328
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,554
<i>Got it.</i>

329
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,744
All right. Now use a scalpel

330
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:04,110
to make a vertical scalp incision

331
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,349
<i>down to the skull.</i>

332
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:09,762
Jeez.

333
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,724
<i>I see a lot of blood, a lot.</i>

334
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:14,100
Superficial bleeders.
Nothing to worry about.

335
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,795
- Are you at the skull?
- <i>Yes.</i>

336
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:19,566
<i>Drill a hole in the middle
of the incision.</i>

337
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:26,517
Oh, god.

338
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,625
Okay, that can't happen.

339
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:28,817
Do you understand me?

340
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,334
Sounds can't happen.
Freaking out,

341
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,841
<i>can't happen. Because if you
freak out, I'm gonna freak out.</i>

342
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:36,361
And I'm the one holding a power
tool to your friend's brain.

343
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,406
So if you're gonna vomit,
If you're gonna make sounds, step away.

344
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,326
If you're gonna stay here,
you have to pull it together.

345
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:43,528
Okay?

346
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,039
We're good, Doc.

347
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,396
Okay.

348
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,218
<i>I'm ready.</i>

349
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:55,520
The temporal bone's only gonna be
a couple of millimeters thick.

350
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:15,883
Okay, I'm in.

351
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,930
<i>But the dura looks fine.</i>

352
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,211
You're gonna have to go in again.

353
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,166
<i>Frontal lobe, right?</i>

354
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:23,603
<i>That's right.</i>

355
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,303
<i>Just behind the hairline,</i>

356
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,058
<i>a few centimeters off the midline.</i>

357
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,458
<i>This bone will be thicker,</i>

358
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,398
<i>about five times as thick
as the temporal bone.</i>

359
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:32,816
Okay.

360
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,436
Got it.

361
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:53,920
Second hole done.

362
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,375
<i>What do you see?</i>

363
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:56,934
I think I see...

364
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,380
blood. I s-see some blood.

365
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,333
Okay, now this is important.

366
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,077
<i>Drill around the hole
to expand the opening.</i>

367
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>You have to try
and relieve the pressure.</i>

368
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,025
Okay.

369
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:21,058
Okay.

370
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,752
Uh, the hole is about
2 centimeters around now.

371
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,053
<i>I see blood.
I definitely see blood.</i>

372
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,626
Try to evacuate as much
of the clot as you can.

373
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,566
<i>With what?
I don't have suction.</i>

374
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,050
Use your finger,

375
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,590
<i>gauze, anything.</i>

376
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:37,273
I see clotted blood.

377
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,954
- No arterial?
- No.

378
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,407
<i>Good.</i>

379
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:41,714
<i>Now how does the dura look?</i>

380
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,583
<i>Is it bulging or does it look lax?</i>

381
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:44,832
It looks like it's...

382
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:46,673
<i>pulsating regularly
with the heartbeat.</i>

383
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:47,942
<i>That's another good, right?</i>

384
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,580
That's great, Stevens.

385
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,224
<i>If it's pulsating, that means</i>

386
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:53,914
<i>blood and oxygen
are entering the brain.</i>

387
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,939
Okay, now pack it with gauze

388
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,319
<i>so you can minimize
the bleeding.</i>

389
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:58,852
O-Okay.

390
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,143
<i>Now get that rescue rig in here.</i>

391
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:08,493
Nicely done, Stevens.

392
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,470
Is that it?
Is he-- Is he gonna be okay?

393
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,328
We've relieved the pressure
on his brain,

394
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,198
but he's still got
a lot of other injuries.

395
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:17,612
Hey.

396
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,345
His eyes are open.

397
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,093
Hey, kid.

398
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:45,793
Kid.

399
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:48,912
You okay?

400
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,165
You need to come with me.

401
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,247
Kid?

402
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:38,081
Our E.T.A. Is five minutes.

403
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,056
How is she doing?

404
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:00,868
Good.
No intestinal damage.

405
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,934
Missed all her vital organs.

406
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:04,690
She's almost done here.
You find her son?

407
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,663
I've looked everywhere.
I've been in contact with the scene,

408
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:09,646
with Mercy West,
with Seattle Presbyterian.

409
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:10,616
I've checked in, uh...

410
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:14,224
He's lost...

411
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:16,187
or...

412
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,060
- or, uh...
- He's in the water.

413
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,460
So when she wakes up,
I get to inform her

414
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,879
that she's not going to die,

415
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,362
she's just gonna want to die.

416
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:29,899
I'm sorry. I will-- Okay,
I'm gonna keep looking.

417
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,846
Yeah, you do that.

418
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,011
His right pupil's not dilated anymore,

419
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:41,401
and he's normotensive, but his
pulse is still up in the 130s.

420
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:42,740
Okay, what's his neurological status?

421
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:43,561
G.C.S. is 8.

422
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,218
I'm sorry. I ran out of sterile drapes.

423
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:47,302
I had to use some guy's t-shirt.
It wasn't sweaty or anything.

424
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,003
- He was a clean guy, but--
- Okay, call the O.R.

425
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,025
Tell 'em we're coming up.

426
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,637
I also dropped
the scalpel in the field,

427
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,645
and by that time, I had
used all the alcohol swabs

428
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:54,647
on the drill bit, so...

429
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:56,236
I think we should load him up
on antibiotics,

430
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,357
lots and lots of antibiotics.

431
00:24:57,358 --> 00:24:59,589
Stevens you put a drill
through a man's skull

432
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,340
and didn't hit his brain.
You saved his life.

433
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,368
Get cleaned up and get to the O.R.

434
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:07,327
You got work to do.

435
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:08,239
The O.R?

436
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:09,844
Yes, the O.R.

437
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,267
You're officially off probation.

438
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,757
Cristina! Oh, my god. You are
not gonna believe what I just did.

439
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,564
I'm gonna tell you,
but you're not gonna believe it.

440
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,525
- You're gonna think I made this up.
- You're back? Is Meredith back?

441
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,417
I drilled a hole
into this guy's skull...

442
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,189
- What?
- Several holes, actually,

443
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:34,283
With a drill I borrowed
from a guy named Vince,

444
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:36,171
patched the hole
with freakin' tissue,

445
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:38,352
then brought him back here, and now
I get to scrub in on his craniotomy.

446
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:39,946
- So you haven't seen Meredith?
- It was like a ride,

447
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,454
this crazy roller coaster ride with--

448
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,261
With adrenalin
shooting out of my ears.

449
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,699
You'd think that my hands
would be shaking,

450
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,410
but they weren't.
There was no shaking.

451
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,784
- Did I mention the drill?
- Okay, Izzie.

452
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,970
I get it. You are a hero.

453
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:52,169
I am jealous.

454
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:54,387
But I need to know
where the hell Meredith is.

455
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,305
Okay.

456
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,648
I-I don't know,

457
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:58,812
where the hell Meredith is.

458
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:01,450
But she should be back here.
I didn't see her at the scene--

459
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,541
The scene where,

460
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,551
I was a rock star, by the way.

461
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,645
Did I mention I'm off probation?

462
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:08,288
Rock star.

463
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,308
These photos are fatalities.

464
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,007
I know it's difficult,

465
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,899
but please try to I.D. who you can.

466
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,736
We've agreed to let you
do the honors...

467
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,106
A few more burr holes
to start the craniotomy.

468
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:03,582
Really?

469
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,047
You saved his life.

470
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,104
You might as well help finish
what you started.

471
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,841
After I strip off the periosteum,

472
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:11,775
you can see
what a high-speed pneumatic

473
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:13,427
neurosurgical drill feels like.

474
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Drill, please.

475
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,926
I, uh, we, uh,
have two pregnant women.

476
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:58,174
One of 'em is-- She--
She's in bad shape. She's...

477
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,250
pretty beat up.
She might be hard to recognize.

478
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,439
What? I-I don't know.

479
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:04,862
What color is her hair?

480
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:06,655
Brown. R-Reddish.

481
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:09,592
My wife-- My wife is blonde.

482
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:11,423
Brownish, but blonde.

483
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,380
Yeah. Sometimes the blood makes
it look darker like that, you know, red.

484
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:17,926
I know you can't tell from the photo,
But her eyes are--

485
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,176
They're pretty distinctive.

486
00:28:20,704 --> 00:28:22,826
Casey's eyes
are very distinctive.

487
00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:24,328
Yeah, brown,

488
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,800
but not that really dark,
dark brown.

489
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:29,025
More-- More golden and--
And-- And really warm.

490
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:29,888
That's not her.

491
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,048
Casey's eyes are blue,

492
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:34,119
Very, very blue.

493
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:39,395
I'm sorry.

494
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,287
I thought you-- You said
you had two pregnant women.

495
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:47,019
Yeah, we, um...

496
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,256
The other one is, um...

497
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:51,876
She's...

498
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,853
Oh, god. Oh, no.

499
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,383
Oh, god.

500
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,512
Oh, Casey.

501
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,826
Oh...

502
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,784
Oh...

503
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,203
- What do we got?
- Jane Doe, hypothermic drowning--

504
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:22,809
She is not a Jane Doe.
It's Meredith Grey.

505
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,737
It's Meredith.

506
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:25,535
Derek.

507
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:27,103
Derek.

508
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:28,962
- Derek, how long has she been down?
- I don't know.

509
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,657
She's-- She's alive.

510
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:32,018
- One, two, three...
- Derek.

511
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:32,864
She's alive.

512
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,221
Okay, look, I need you
to help me get her inside.

513
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,031
Clear a trauma bay, stat!

514
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,660
Move it!

515
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,596
How was your surgery, Dr. Burke?

516
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:56,216
Well, the patient is out of
the woods now, Dr. Yang.

517
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,258
Thanks for asking.

518
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:00,687
You're numbed.

519
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:02,518
Whatever. It looked harsh.

520
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,541
Fran, finish this, please.

521
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:15,365
- What is your problem?
- Know, everyone's back.

522
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:16,821
Everyone's back except her.

523
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:18,314
And I listen to her

524
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,280
every day about her McLove life

525
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:21,999
and McDreamy and McCrap, and--

526
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,196
And on the one day--
The one day I have a thing--

527
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,877
She disappears.

528
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,877
Meredith? This is about Meredith?

529
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,901
- She doesn't know yet.
- Meredith?

530
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:32,117
She's my person.

531
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:34,502
Right.

532
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:38,630
And if Meredith doesn't approve,
then what?

533
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,048
No. This is not about getting
her approval.

534
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,156
- It's about--
- What?

535
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:44,936
Telling her makes it...

536
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,307
makes it...

537
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:52,554
if I murdered someone,

538
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,150
she's the person I'd call

539
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,620
to help me drag the corpse
across the living room floor.

540
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,419
Okay. See, now you're likening
someone here to a corpse.

541
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,570
I'm done.

542
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:06,557
She's my person.

543
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,571
Removing the bone flap.

544
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:17,867
Ready with suction.

545
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,779
Looking good.

546
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:21,313
Yes.

547
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:22,909
Yes, it is.

548
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,022
Dr. Stevens,

549
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:29,365
it's your pager.

550
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:30,867
That's okay. It can wait.

551
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:32,623
I think you want to take this page.

552
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:45,694
How's she doing?

553
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,128
She's holding steady for now.

554
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:50,851
Anybody claim her yet?

555
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,015
No.

556
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,163
She's still a Jane Doe.

557
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:02,977
I'd notice.

558
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:04,536
What?

559
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:11,147
If you went missing...

560
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,218
I'd notice.

561
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,826
Okay, I need a little
more suction, please.

562
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:51,662
Callie.

563
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:53,908
O'Malley, I'm working.
What do you want?

564
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,681
I read on the board you're doing an
internal fixation of the lumbar spine.

565
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:59,097
On a John Doe
from the ferry crash, age 7.

566
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,177
That's right.

567
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:01,991
Can I see his face?

568
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,357
I'm in the middle of surgery.

569
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,530
I know. I...

570
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:11,259
Is this boy your patient?

571
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,329
I-I know the picture's half
smeared and hard to see, but...

572
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:18,941
Please tell me it's him.

573
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,904
Tell me he has been right here

574
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,918
under my nose, open on your table
all day and not..

575
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,859
drifting along the bottom of the ocean.

576
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,746
Just... please tell me that.

577
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:35,692
Hold the photo under the light
so I can get a better look.

578
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:38,683
Oh, yeah.

579
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:41,466
Oh, yeah, that's my kid.
I could spot those goofy ears anywhere.

580
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,116
- Really?
- Really.

581
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:52,508
Callie O'Malley...

582
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:55,015
I can't kiss you right now
because you're scrubbed in,

583
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,020
but tonight...

584
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:57,588
When you get home,

585
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,442
- I am going to--
- Okay.

586
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:01,103
Okay. All right.
You know what, people?

587
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,228
Let's focus here.

588
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:03,529
- George, I'm working.
- Yeah.

589
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:04,388
I'm...

590
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:05,817
I'm working.

591
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,789
So... yeah.

592
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:09,319
Bye.

593
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:25,529
Oh, my god!

594
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:29,313
Oh, you're safe.

595
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:30,807
You're safe.

596
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:32,901
Oh, honey,

597
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,873
mommy's sorry she got lost.

598
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:36,785
Oh, lisa.

599
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,742
They could only put a 20-guage
I.V in, but I think it blew.

600
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,077
I'll start a central line,

601
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:43,523
but you have
to get out of the way.

602
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,312
We-- We put, uh, 3 milligram
of epi down the E.T. tube--

603
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:47,114
Derek!

604
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:48,811
The last dose was three minutes ago.

605
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:50,431
- We should push--
- Shepherd, get out.

606
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:53,878
I think we should push
just 1 at-- atropine.

607
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:55,696
I think I saw some reactivity,

608
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,912
in her pupils, before the atropine,

609
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,751
and I think she might
have actually had some,

610
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,527
- cardiac activity--
- Shepherd, get out.

611
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,517
We need to put an external
pacer on just to make sure.

612
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:08,917
We need to save her life.

613
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:11,725
You can't do this.
We need to do this.

614
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:12,795
Now go.

615
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:20,946
Go.

616
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:23,153
Three, four, five.

617
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:27,250
Okay, she has a new 18-guage
in her left A.C.

618
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,715
Push 1 of epi through it.

619
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,364
The chief is working on her, man.

620
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:48,031
He threw me out.

621
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:56,916
What do you need?

622
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,108
I need you to go in there.

623
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,434
Give me a new warm blanket.

624
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,312
Her temp's still only at 80 degrees.

625
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:17,570
What can I do?

626
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:19,195
She needs an A.B.G.

627
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:21,739
Was that V-Fib?

628
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,295
Charge to 300.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

629
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:26,098
Okay. Clear.

630
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:28,924
Back to asystole.

631
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:30,220
Keep compressions going.

632
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:33,433
- Oh, my god.
- She's hypothermic.

633
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:38,250
Have you tried a warm peritoneal lavage

634
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,545
or even a continuous
bladder lavage with warm fluids?

635
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:44,084
- You could do a thoracotomy.
- Get back the A.B.G.

636
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:45,742
Okay, now let's go, people.

637
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:34,257
How is her temp?

638
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,451
Only up to 81 now.

639
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:40,414
Come on, Meredith.
Don't do this.

640
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:01,721
- It's Meredith?
- Yeah.

641
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:03,543
Are you sure? Did you see her?

642
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:05,469
- Because it could be anybody.
- It's Meredith.

643
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,081
She will come through this.

644
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,245
You don't know that.

645
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:26,766
She will come through this.

646
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,388
People die.

647
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:35,778
I know people die.

648
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:39,233
People die in front of us every day.

649
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:42,728
But I believe
Meredith will survive this.

650
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:44,240
I believe...

651
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:46,549
I believe-- I...

652
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:50,326
I-I believe in the good.

653
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:59,577
I believe tha
 it's been a hell of a year.

654
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,488
And I believe that in
the face of overwhelming

655
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:03,980
evidence to the contrary,

656
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,647
we will all be okay.

657
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:09,999
I believe a lot of things.

658
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:13,952
I believe that...

659
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:17,597
I believe that Denny is always with me.

660
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:21,531
And I believe...

661
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,659
that if I eat a tub of butter
and no one sees me,

662
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,908
the calories don't count.

663
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:28,856
And...

664
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,933
I believe that surgeons who prefer

665
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:33,440
staples over stitches are just lazy.

666
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:39,076
And I believe that you are a man

667
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:41,761
who made a terrible mistake
marrying Callie.

668
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,627
And I believe that because
I'm your best friend,

669
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:49,060
I can tell you this,
and we can be okay.

670
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:51,275
I believe even though
you made this mistake,

671
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,031
you will be okay.

672
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,874
I believe we survive, George.

673
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:14,231
I believe that believing we survive...

674
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,674
is what makes us...

675
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,402
survive.

676
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:25,887
She's gonna be okay.

677
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:36,242
Push another epi.

678
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:39,688
How many is that?

679
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,421
This is her fourth round, sir.

680
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:46,028
We've been here 20 minutes.

681
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,662
Still in asystole.

682
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,546
We're losing her.

683
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:35,769
Hey.

684
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:38,379
Hey.

685
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:44,400
Am I...

686
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,846
dead?

687
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:51,086
Damn right, you are.

688
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,038
Holy...
