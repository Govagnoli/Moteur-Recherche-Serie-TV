1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,140
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,530
meredith wasn't a fling.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,620
I fell in love with her.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,810
Yeah,it's my mother.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,320
She has alzheimer'S.

6
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,860
Have you even bothered
to tell burke about the baby?

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,960
I had a right to know.

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,510
I failed the medical boards.

9
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,380
That's pretty embarrassing.

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,770
I'm pregnant,
you blind moron.

11
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,310
Can we please just talk?

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,860
You're too busy
screwing nurses to talk.

13
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,740
I never wanted to hurt you.

14
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,660
Sometimes I think we'd be
better off with dogs.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,050
I said down!

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,500
Izzie! Izzie!它正跟着我...

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,160
fresh starts--

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,230
thanks to the calendar,
they happen every year.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,760
Just set your watch
to january.

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,010
You know,I'm thinking
about coloring my hair.

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,120
-Maybe red.
-Red's good.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,980
-I'm thinking about cutting mine.
-Yeah?You'd look good shorter.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,300
-You think?
-Yeah.

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,830
oh,he's such a good dog.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,750
Who's a good boy?
He's a good boy.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,950
What a good dog.Who's mommy's little boy?

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,210
Oh,what a good boy.
You're such a good boy.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,200
What are you guys doing in there?
We're gonna be late.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,480
We need to talk
about the dog.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,600
That's not a dog.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,590
It's a hyena escaped from
the zoo dressed in dog clothing.

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,640
Whatever. I don't
chew up his clothes.

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,750
I don't urinate
on his bed.

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,390
I don't try to mount him
from behind.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,190
People,he's our dog.
We love our dog.He loves us.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,410
-它真的想咬你?
-真的

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,450
he tries to.

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,070
our reward for surviving the holiday season
is a new year

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,780
bringing on the great tradition
of new year's resolutions.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,530
I got a trout.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,040
-Oh!
-Rainbow trout.

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,980
Why--why did you bring
a trout into the house?

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,030
The trailer.

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,750
Why did you bring a rainbow
trout into the trailer?

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,530
-Breakfast.
-Breakfast?

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,740
-Yeah,you hungry?
-For trout?

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,230
I hate this,derek.

48
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,000
I hate this! Hate,hate.

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,600
I hate this trailer!

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,980
So no trout for you then.

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,420
Put your past behind you
and start over.

52
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,840
I'm standing there
with pritchard and lewis,

53
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,140
and they keep on asking me who I was with
in the on call room last night.

54
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,790
They heard us.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,500
Were we that loud?

56
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,510
-Y-you're loud.
-Stop.

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,390
I am loud,aren't I?

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Pritch. He was always sticking his nose
in someone else's business.

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,020
You know,I actually
saw him again,

60
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,530
-at his wife's funeral.
-What?Pritchard isn't married.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,250
Uh,oh,right,right.
I'm thinking of someone else.

62
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm just confused.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,010
You need sleep.

64
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,370
Residency has worn you down.

65
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,720
-Ellis,um...
-yes.

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,050
Nothing.I just...

67
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,110
-hate being an intern.
-hate being an intern.

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,420
It's hard to resist the chance
at a new beginning,

69
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,210
a chance to put the problems
of last year to bed.

70
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,730
So... in the name of the new year--
oh,huh,I don't do resolutions.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,650
In the name of the new year,

72
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,830
I thought you could give me

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,920
an answer to my question.

74
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,710
Your question?

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,860
About you...

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,260
moving in.

77
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,950
I don't have an answer.

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
-Cristina--
-I'm not being cristina,I just...

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,690
I don't have an answer.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,030
Then answer me this,

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,150
what were you planning to do?

82
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,890
-About what?
-The baby.

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,340
Dr. Burke,
we're ready for you.

84
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,440
listen up,people,

85
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,580
new year,new rules.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,390
Or should I say,new year,

87
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,250
we will be enforcing the rules mandated
by the residency review committee

88
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,420
There were too many mistakes
made last year.

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,580
Fatigue played too big a role.

90
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,220
Exceeding 80 hours of work per week
will not be tolerated...

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,230
does that mean we actually
get to have a life?

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,410
I think so.

93
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,460
...Sullivan,you were on call
for 28 hours.Leave when you hit 30.

94
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,500
Grey,you were here until 2 A.M.
Last night,see you at noon.

95
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,850
-I get to go?Free time?
-Run before he changes his mind.

96
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,290
还有护士们are gonna have to work extra hours
to compensate,so treat them well.

97
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,210
Cranky nurses don't
do us any good.

98
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh,well,maybe you can
cheer them up.

99
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,320
you know what?

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,850
My new year's resolution
was to let it go,and I am.

101
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,770
I have.I've let it go.
I apologize.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,100
-You do?
-I do.

103
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,860
How'd your test go?

104
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,560
I feel pretty good about it,
but I won't know for a few days.

105
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,540
We're all pulling
for you.

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,350
-We are?
-We are.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,330
You can see
the mesothelioma better

108
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,990
now that I've
partially dissected it.

109
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,180
Uh,I can't,uh,I can't
really see it from here.

110
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,630
-Can I--can I go in closer?
-You're fine there.

111
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,450
Preston,good news.

112
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,030
We have a heart
for denny duquette.

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,050
That's great news.
Has he been called?

114
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,250
Got here ten minutes ago.

115
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,020
Well,good.I was worried we couldn't
find a match in time.

116
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,610
We have a plane ready to take you to twin falls,
idaho,for the organ recovery--

117
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,530
90 minutes each way.
How much more do you have here?

118
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,520
Well,the heart
comes out first.

119
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,620
No,I'd be cutting it
too close.

120
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,370
They have a local
heart team there,so--

121
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,380
no,bailey. Send bailey.

122
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,530
She'll be our eyes.

123
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,740
Dr. Yang,you need
to leave this O.R.

124
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,370
Excuse me?

125
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,370
You've exceeded your 80-hour limit for the week.
You have to leave the hospital.

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,180
Okay,um,um,as soon as
the mesothelioma's dissected out.

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,310
Dr. Yang,now.

128
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,750
You heard him.

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,780
denny duquette.

130
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,610
Hey,dr. Bailey.

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,110
I hope seeing you here means
they finally found you a heart.

132
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,860
No offense,doctor,but I'm
not a big fan of hospitals.

133
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,130
It'd take something pretty special
to get me in here.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,360
And what do we know about
mr. Duquette?

135
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,040
Capricorn,single,
loves to travel and cook.

136
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,450
Denny,be quiet.
Let her show off.

137
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,440
Denny duquette,36,admitted today for
a heart transplant necessitated by a viral cardiomyopathy.

138
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,730
and what does that mean?

139
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,150
That his heart is unable
to fill and pump blood normally.

140
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,380
Good. Denny,
this is dr. Stevens.

141
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,490
She'll be tending to you
prior to surgery.

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
So I guess I'll be
seeing you around,dr. Stevens.

143
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,740
I gotta hand it to the guy,trying to
get some action when he's practically a corpse.

144
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,950
Alex,he was just
trying to be nice.

145
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,700
No one enforced an 80-hour
work week when I was an intern.

146
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,850
110,120 hours
suited me just fine.

147
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,650
I learned more,
cause I worked more.

148
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,930
Well,at least this way,you get to rest
before you have the baby.

149
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,930
I mean,being that pregnant,
keeping up this pace...

150
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,670
what are you saying,
I look tired,o'malley?

151
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,830
No,not--not tired,no.

152
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,710
You look fresh,spry.
You glow.

153
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,560
What... stop now.

154
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,090
O'malley,go do an intake
on addison shepherd's patient.

155
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,280
addison.

156
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,860
You do glow.

157
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,080
Like the moon.

158
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,210
And you can spend the day
in the pit,karev.

159
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,730
I'm just trying to make a point.

160
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,180
I understand your point,honey.

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,980
But you have to believe
what buckman said.Look,I want--

162
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,490
-dr. O'malley.
-Hi. Um,mr. And mrs. Singleton,

163
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,670
rebecca,this is
dr. Montgomery-shepherd.

164
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,440
You don't think
it's cancer,do you?

165
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,450
Bex is too young
for cancer,right?

166
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,140
Mrs. Singleton,I'm just getting up
to speed.I'm sorry. Dr. O'malley?

167
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,040
-Rebecca's been admitted for--
-could you stop calling me that?

168
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,520
She prefers bex,
not rebecca.

169
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,370
Bex has been admitted for an ultrasound guided
biopsy on an enlargement of a pelvic lymph node.

170
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,330
Okay. Bex,you mind
if I check it out?

171
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,250
Okay,I'll just,um...

172
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
it's a minor procedure,bex.

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,870
But we'll give you a local anesthetic
to manage the pain.

174
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,210
What are you drawing?

175
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,090
Just a dumb comic.

176
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,800
You're really talented.

177
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,920
It's big,I know.

178
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,670
It just appeared one day.

179
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,080
I'll perform a biopsy
this morning,

180
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,840
and dr. O'malley will have to take some blood
so he can run some tests

181
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,680
And then we can start
to get you some answers,okay?

182
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,130
Mrs. Singleton,
there's no need to panic.

183
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,740
I'll keep you posted
every step of the way.

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,830
Thank you.

185
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,140
Sorry about this,but I'm gonna need
that arm to get some blood.

186
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,910
I'll be quick.

187
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,920
Mr. Paskowitz,

188
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,340
we've located the source
of your abdominal pain.

189
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,170
There. It's called a bezoar.

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,080
Bezoar,huh?

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,290
It's a clump of foreign matter that
couldn't be expelled with a prokinetic agent

192
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,880
I love it.In a hospital,
a laxative is a prokinetic agent.

193
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
So what,you just go up
his butt and grab it?

194
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,770
Baby,please.

195
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,650
Actually,we won't be able to reach it that way
We'll have to get it from here

196
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,070
So,mauer,tell me
what you've been eating.

197
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,990
Garbage. Absolute garbage.

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,540
Could you be more specific?

199
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,700
Tell him
what you ate,mauer.

200
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,840
He's a writer,

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,210
suffering for his art.

202
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,250
Okay.

203
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,860
He ate his novel.

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,670
-Uh,I'm sorry. What?
-I ate my novel,okay?

205
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,380
The whole damn thing.

206
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,340
Every last piece of that
unmitigated crap.

207

GA SEASON2 E14

211
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,250
-The labs for bex singleton.
-Anything?

212
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,130
Yeah,her hormone levels--
estrogen,progesterone--are sky high.

213
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,120
Huh,that's--
you did a history,right?

214
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,590
Any mention
of birth control pills?

215
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,210
No,but her parents
were right there.

216
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,010
Talk to her again.

217
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,630
She hasn't hit puberty yet.
Isn't it weird she'd be having sex?

218
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,930
These days,dr. O'malley,
it's not that unusual.

219
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,210
Talk to the patient.

220
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,920
-Derek.
-Hi,morning,richard.

221
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,830
You busy?

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,650
No. My surgery
just got canceled. Why?

223
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,130
-I need a favor.
-Sure.

224
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,720
Hey,bex.

225
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,060
Your mom and dad...

226
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,340
food.

227
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,320
Great.

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,940
Beause I wanted
to talk to you.

229
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,790
Your lab,uh,work show--

230
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,230
have you been taking
birth control pills?

231
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,060
-If you tell my mom and dad,they-
-no,I won'T.

232
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,240
I just,uh,
need to know why.

233
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,870
Do you have
a boyfriend or...

234
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,390
like anybody would want
to have sex with me.

235
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,610
Well,then why?

236
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,780
I'm as flat as a board.

237
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,630
I took,like,
five of those pills a day,

238
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,440
and nothing's different.

239
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,620
Boobs,dude.

240
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,880
You...were trying to
make your breasts grow?

241
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,820
I wanted to be normal
for once in my life.

242
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,880
-Is this what caused the tumor?
-No,no.

243
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,310
The pill wouldn't have
any effect on your lymph nodes,

244
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,530
but the amount that you were
taking is really dangerous,

245
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,340
and it caused a pretty major
hormonal imbalance.

246
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,920
Have you been feeling
different than usual?

247
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,650
I feel like I always feel.

248
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,690
-hi.
-Hi.

249
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,390
You're leaving?

250
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,020
80-hour limit. You?

251
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,030
Surgery was postponed.

252
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,990
-I have a dog.
-You have a dog.

253
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,410
My point is,
I have a dog.

254
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,040
You have a dog.
Oh,you know what?I love dogs.

255
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,320
I've moved on,
so don't give me that look.

256
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,320
-What look?
-That look. Our look.

257
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,990
-I'm over you.
-I'm over you,too.

258
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,780
-You are?
-No.

259
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,130
Oh.Well,
I am.Over you.

260
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,110
I'm over you,too.

261
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,810
You just said...
oh,shut up.

262
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,410
-hi.
-Bye.

263
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,730
There is a land

264
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
-and you are their queen.
-I am fine.

265
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,100
Except when you're shrieking
about trout.

266
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,450
I was not shrieking
about trout.

267
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,390
Right,you weren'T. You were
shrieking about meredith.

268
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,700
No,I was shrieking about
the trailer. I hate the trailer.

269
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,630
Okay,so the past three weeks
have been about the trailer.

270
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,200
Yes.

271
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,510
Not about the fact
that I said I love meredith

272
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,120
Loved.

273
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,000
-What?
-You said you loved her,past tense.

274
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
Right,yes. Past tense.

275
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,880
Well,then I have been
shrieking about the trailer.

276
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,760
okay,mauer,it's time to return
your book to the library.

277
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,030
Surgery's in an hour.

278
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,250
What's up
with this flop sweat?

279
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,290
Probably just nerves.

280
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,180
But I'm sweating
like--like--like nixon,

281
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,760
president
richard milhous nixon.

282
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,010
That guy could sweat.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,790
And I,mauer paskowitz,
I wrote an epically crap novel,

284
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,130
but I sure as shinola
can sweat like nixon.

285
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,590
Come on. It's not even
that bad of a book.

286
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,210
I read
practically every draft.

287
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,680
Forgive me,honey,but you
are not exactly lionel trilling.

288
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,520
It blows.

289
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,480
Lionel trilling?

290
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,830
He seeks the approval
of dead literary critics.

291
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,010
The dead don't read,mauer.

292
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,810
You ever think about being
something other than a writer?

293
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,770
No. I am a writer.

294
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,700
Mauer paskowitz.

295
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,000
I have no plan "B."

296
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,490
We can't get married
for three years,

297
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,360
till the damn book is done.

298
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,200
Three years,I listen to him
piss and moan.

299
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
For what,
so he can eat the thing?

300
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,850
Ha.

301
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,800
Your computer
have a "delete" button?

302
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,250
I wanted to literally
put it behind me

303
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,740
and start a new book.

304
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,150
Okay. We all get
the symbolism.

305
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,370
It's painfully obvious.

306
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,690
And obviously painful.

307
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,170
hey. Uh,hi.

308
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,460
um,I heard you're going
to twin falls,idaho.

309
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,640
I've never been.

310
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,740
You reached 80 hours?

311
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,790
Technically.

312
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,050
You're off work,cristina.
Go enjoy your day.

313
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,930
I'll enjoy my day if i can help
retrieve a heart.I promise.

314
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,890
It's a nice coat.

315
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,370
See that,dr. O'malley?

316
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,380
It looks like the tumor
is compressing an ovary.

317
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,810
Yeah,that's why I biopsied
both ovaries.

318
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,740
Is that bad?

319
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,240
It's really just
a precaution,bex.

320
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,050
-Want to apply pressure,dr. O'malley?
-Mm-hmm.

321
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,020
I'm gonna get this
up to path.

322
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,530
-You mind doing the dressings?
-sure.

323
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,410
All right,bex,

324
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,860
we'll get you the results
just as soon as possible.

325
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,060
You're a doctor.

326
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,160
Haven't you seen scars before?

327
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,990
I was just trying to figure out why someone with
so much talent would want to do that.

328
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,080
It's just a comic book.

329
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,400
It's about me and my best friend jenn
when we were kids.

330
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,910
Satisfied?

331
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,240
Does she write it
with you?

332
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,000
Jenn has a boyfriend,
like everyone else.

333
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,150
I get to be a freak
all by myself.

334
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,280
Oh,a freak?

335
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,110
That's not the easiest thing
to be in high school,is it?

336
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,880
You sound like my shrink.

337
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey,I wasn't always
a doctor.

338
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,890
In high school...

339
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:13,070
I was secretary and treasurer of...
the dungeons & dragons club.

340
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,910
Oh,man.

341
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,940
Yeah. I was also
a mathlete.

342
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,010
And I won the blue ribbon
in biology club.

343
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,270
Best fetal pig dissection.

344
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,050
Ah,let me tell you,that had
the girls knocking down my door.

345
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,630
You just have to
get through high school.

346
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,990
Because high school sucks for anyone
who's the least bit different.

347
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,060
But then there's college,
and then out in the real world,

348
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,360
you'll find where you fit in.

349
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,820
-You think so?
-Yeah,I know so.

350
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,900
Hi.

351
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,500
Denny.I thought
you were asleep.

352
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,810
Nah. I don't sleep in hospitals.
Scared I'll never wake up.

353
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,990
Can I ask you
something personal?

354
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,110
If I say no?

355
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,570
I'll hold my breath,

356
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,590
which will stop my heart,
killing me.

357
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,330
And you're right here,
you'll be charged with murder.

358
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,990
A lifetime in prison being loved
by a big old girl named hilde.

359
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,950
So my choicesare homicide charges or
inappro priate personal questions from a patient?

360
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,250
I know,it kinda sucks.

361
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,480
You know what?
Hold your breath.

362
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,890
I'll take my chances with hilde.
I can do girl on girl.

363
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,210
Oh,see,you're
bringing up girl on girl.

364
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,000
How can I blackmail you
if you bring up girl on girl?

365
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,420
What do you want to know?

366
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,650
That guy alex,

367
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
you with him?

368
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,780
No,not anymore,
and never,ever again.

369
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,920
-Good.
-Good?

370
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,170
Yeah,good.

371
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,150
It means I won't have to
fight him for you.

372
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,150
What makes you think I want you
to fight him for me?

373
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,080
Hello.

374
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,730
-You are in love with me.
-Am I?

375
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,770
Yeah. It's not your fault.

376
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,250
I mean,I'm well-off,
but I'm not into money,

377
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,730
I'm smart,
but I'm not a know-it-all,

378
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,620
I'm funny,
I'm--I'm really nice

379
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,290
I love animals

380
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,560
and I'm hot.I'm a catch,
you know,

381
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
if you can
wrap your head around the enlarged,

382
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,750
failing heart and the dependency to I.V. Meds.

383
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,430
you're right.

384
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,920
I am so in love with you.

385
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,570
It's a shame,really,

386
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,180
since I'm with hilde and all.

387
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,530
there--

388
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,110
five loads of laundry.

389
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,280
I have literally washed the past
out of my life.

390
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,290
You paged me?

391
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,410
Yeah.

392
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Have a look at this.

393
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,210
It's bex' biopsy.

394
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,520
Biopsied ovary?

395
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,410
Not exactly.

396
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,210
Arrange a meeting
with bex' parents,george.

397
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,600
and find out who the on call psychiatrist is
if they're available to join us.

398
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,450
Does she have cancer?

399
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,040
No. It's not an ovary,
it's a testis.

400
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,220
A testis?

401
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,420
Are you sure?

402
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,920
Yes,I'm sure.

403
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,550
Bex is a hermaphrodite?

404
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,650
Yes.

405
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,020
Yang...

406
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,380
why are you staring at my fat,pregnant belly?

407
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,460
Sorry. I...

408
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,900
let me get this straight.You're telling me

409
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,670
that our daughter--my daughter--

410
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,940
you're telling me my daughter might actually be a boy?

411
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,360
That-- how is that possible?

412
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,570
I-I don't understand.

413
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,830
I don't understand how that--

414
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,710
sh-shouldn't this have been  detected somehow?

415
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,340
Externally,bex has female genitalia.

416
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,630
She looks like a girl.

417
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,630
But

418
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,760
internally,she has both female and  male sex organs.

419
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,910
So what now?

420
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,450
What are we supposed to do?

421
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,820
I-I don't understand--

422
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,210
okay,the best news

423
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,840
is that the lymph node tumor is benign.

424
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,140
So physically,bex is going to be just fine,

425
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,720
but emotionally,

426
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,830
psychologically,

427
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,240
I strongly recommend therapy.

428
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,250
she's already in therapy.

429
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm talking about therapy for all of you.

430
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,170
This is not gonna be easy for bex to hear,

431
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,330
and it's not gonna be an easy adjustment for you to make.

432
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,010
Oh,my god. A big adjustment, what kind of adjustment?

433
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,280
Many intersexed people begin to identify very strongly with one sex,

434
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,950
and it's not necessarily the sex they've been raised.

435
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,760
She's a girl.

436
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,900
She looks like a girl.

437
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,230
She has always been a girl.

438
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,420
This at least helps explain why she feels so different.

439
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,870
The point is,biologically and  emotionally speaking,

440
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,150
she has a choice to make.

441
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,220
A choice?

442
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,620
My mouth feels all weird.

443
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,820
Chewing paper will have that effect,lover.

444
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,680
Weird how?

445
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,890
Pins and needles.

446
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,320
No,needles and pins.

447
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,450
Needles and pins-- yeah,yeah--

448
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,870
sprouting from my fingers and toes

449
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,330
like--like--like...

450
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,270
lord,god,give me a simile.

451
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,870
Is he always this way?

452
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,440
The man ate a novel. He's not exactly normal.

453
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,000
But he got weirder,the more he ate.

454
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,540
He's,like,obsessed.

455
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,370
Mr. Paskowitz, I'm dr. Webber.

456
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,180
I'm gonna be performing your surgery today.

457
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,230
I poured my heart and soul into that freakin' book,

458
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,390
and now it's stuck up my ass.

459
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,800
Put that on my tombstone,audrey.

460
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,210
On my tombstone!

461
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,790
Hey,dr. Stevens.

462
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,870
Hey,denny.

463
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,740
You okay?

464
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,220
I've been waiting for this a long time,you know?

465
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,550
You open up my chest,take out my heart, and replace it with another one.

466
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,280
Well,not me,

467
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,580
and not another heart, a better heart.

468
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
what if something goes wrong?

469
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,910
Don't be nervous.

470
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,010
Dr. Burke is an incredible surgeon.

471
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,340
And you're getting a new heart today.

472
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,950
Just keep thinking about that.

473
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,210
Okay,okay.

474
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,220
Denny.

475
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,400
Preston burke--my favorite cardiothoracic surgeon.

476
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,330
You're only cardiothoracic surgeon,but thanks.

477
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,570
I'll be on the phone with dr. Bailey as the organ recovery progresses.

478
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,710
We'll make sure that the heart stays viable,

479
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,240
isn't damaged as the other organs are perfused.

480
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,640
We'll have you in the O.R.,

481
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,890
And if it is a go,

482
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,930
we start the procedure before she even gets back.

483
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,800
Hey,izzie.

484
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,770
Yeah.

485
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm gettin' a new heart.

486
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,200
You're getting a new heart.

487
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,870
I'll see you.

488
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,010
Bye.

489
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,670
um,excuse me.

490
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,970
Um,mary and I were talking,

491
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,750
and,uh,we think bex should stay--

492
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,690
she can't handle something like this.

493
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,400
You saw the scars.

494
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,090
Wait,you're not gonna tell her?

495
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,130
But this could help her.

496
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,370
You can't not tell her who she is.

497
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,460
Dr. O'malley.

498
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,020
Uh,we'll go ahead and

499
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,300
proceed with the scheduled surgery to remove the tumor,

500
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,730
and then you can talk to your daughter in your own time.

501
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,020
Actually,we're thinking...

502
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,040
we thought,

503
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,320
since you're already gonna be in there,uh...

504
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,470
we know "fixed"

505
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,900
isn't the right word,but--

506
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,070
we were thinking that with the hormonal confusion,

507
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,650
it might be easier on her to remove

508
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,980
whatever boy parts she has.

509
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,150
Keep her more of a girl.

510
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,990
Just to be clear,you're asking me to perform sexual reassignment surgery on your daughter?

511
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,590
-yes.
-Without her knowing?

512
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,800
all she's said all her life is that she wants to be normal.

513
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,370
She doesn't feel normal.

514
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,450
Why can't we just put an end to her agony?

515
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,330
Well,first of all,removing her male sexual organs may not do that.

516
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,080
In fact, it could do just the opposite.

517
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,860
but her hormones--

518
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,260
can be controlled with an oral medication.

519
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,240
We just want the best for bex.

520
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,640
To do surgery and alter her body permanently is--

521
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,540
well,I just would never do that on someone  who's unaware of the procedure,

522
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,230
and you're gonna be hard pressed to find a surgeon who will.

523
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,330
Bex will learn the truth...

524
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,520
someday.

525
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,960
H-how do you want her to find out?

526
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,090
Excuse me.

527
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,290
Meredith,hi.

528
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,190
Hi. I had the morning off,

529
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,860
so I thought I would come and see how my mother's doing.

530
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,650
Oh,she's fine. She's in the sitting room.

531
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,990
-Thanks.
-She's in good spirits.

532
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,800
Visitors really cheer her up.

533
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,990
visitors?

534
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,950
what are you doing here?

535
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,620
There is a clinical trial to study the progression

536
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,630
of early-onset alzheimer'S.

537
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,560
Okay,me,you can screw with.

538
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,900
My mother? No,not acceptable.

539
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,650
Look,there's been some really promising results

540
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,830
from similar studies in europe. Your mother is a prime candidate.

541
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,430
My mother is very sick

542
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,160
and has very few good days.

543
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,720
And I don't want her being poked and prodded

544
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
for some experimental program.

545
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm just trying to help.

546
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,820
Well,see,this,what you're doing,

547
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,970
being dreamy,

548
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,140
it doesn't help.

549
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,120
It hurts me.

550
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,640
It messes with my head.

551
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,720
I know the feeling.

552
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,860
I don't doubt that.

553
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,210
But you have a wife to go home to.

554
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,990
And I'm guessing she has no idea where you are right now.

555
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,050
Yeah. No,she doesn'T.

556
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,740
That's what I thought.

557
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,960
Dr. Burke.

558
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Talk to me,bailey. What are we looking at?

559
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,480
The,uh,the donor is on 25 mics of dopamine.

560
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,350
25 mics? That's too much.

561
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,490
They've started him on 5 mics of dobutamine

562
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,220
30 minutes prior to arrival.

563
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,450
Are they trying to kill my heart?

564
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,990
What is his central venous  pressure now?

565
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,990
C.V.P.,Doctor? Back around 10

566
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,520
-Around 10.
-Map close to 80.

567
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,730
And his mean arterial pressure?

568
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,620
Close to 80.

569
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,560
I can live with a C.V.P. As low as 5,a map about 60.

570
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,710
That heart needs to be off dobutamine.

571
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,850
The heart needs to be off dobutamine.

572
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,050
And tell them to get the dopamine back down to 10 mics

573
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,340
and get them to get another 2 units of blood.

574
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,950
We a go,doc?

575
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,800
Still no final word.

576
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,170
I want you to have the healthiest heart I can find.

577
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,140
Dr. Stevens,you'll be in there  with us,right?

578
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,100
Yeah,I'll be in there with you.

579
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,800
all right,people.

580
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,160
We're going to be removing a clump of foreign matter lodged

581
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,190
hey,aren't you supposed to be having free time?

582
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,970
Oh,I did five loads of laundry,

583
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,220
cut my split ends,studied, cleaned out the fridge.

584
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,810
Free time sucks.

585
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,720
When would have been the right time to hear about your boyfriend's wife?

586
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,030
Okay,are you mad at me or something?

587
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,620
No. No.

588
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,730
Sorry.

589
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,660
It's just,

590
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,110
I have this patient,and

591
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,270
I get that there's a right and a wrong time to hear big news,

592
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,070
but wouldn't you rather know sooner than later?

593
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,240
I mean,so you can move forward one way or the other.

594
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,610
I mean,it's a fresh start,right?

595
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,400
See the white line of toldt?

596
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Now we can mobilize the lateral border  the lateral border of the left colon.Clamp.

597
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
When leo tolstoy here wakes up,

598
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,320
you might get him to revisit the idea of a new vocation.

599
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,780
He's pretty against the idea.

600
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,110
Yeah,well,hopefully, it was just delirium.

601
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,280
If it's all right,I'd like to keep an extra eye on him post-op.

602
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,850
He's acting pretty strange.

603
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,130
He ate a novel. Clearly,he's pretty strange.

604
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,390
Yeah,you know,it's just,

605
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,880
I don't want to overlook anything.

606
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,190
Seriously,karev,

607
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,430
I'm short-handed all over the hospital.

608
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,300
Okay,here we go.

609
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,990
Anybody here tempted to read this?

610
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,000
No takers?

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,030
Could be the great american novel. We'll never know.

612
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,720
He needs a plan "B."

613
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,700
He may not be the only one.

614
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,610
You don't think you passed?

615
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,130
I thought I passed the first time.

616
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,650
Well,let's wait and see.

617
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,790
Right now,today,

618
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,220
you're still here.

619
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,870
Did you tell my parents about the pill?

620
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,640
No.

621
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,320
Am I gonna die?

622
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,280
Is that what no one wants to tell me?

623
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,130
Of course not.

624
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,240
Then why are my parents acting so...

625
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,460
will you just tell me what's going on?

626
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,360
What's going on is,uh,

627
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
we're prepping you for surgery to remove the lymph node tumor

628
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,040
that's compressing your...

629
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,570
ovary.

630
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,630
Hey,bex.

631
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,070
How you doin'?

632
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,570
Mom,dad,this is really freaking me out.

633
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,010
Oh,no,everything's gonna be fine,bex.

634
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,200
It's okay,sweetie.

635
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,470
I'm having surgery to remove a tumor

636
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,050
that's compressing my ovary,

637
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,820
right,george?

638
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,120
Dr. O'malley.

639
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,490
George?

640
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,700
What,am I just supposed to lie to her?

641
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,670
Okay.

642
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,860
That's enough.

643
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,840
Dr. O'malley,please leave the room.

644
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,800
No,wait.

645
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,470
Tell me what's wrong with me.

646
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,830
What is wrong with me?

647
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,280
Bex...

648
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,940
we learned that your tumor,

649
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,440
it's not compressing an ovary.

650
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,940
Then where is it?

651
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,950
It's on a testes.

652
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,650
Like a testicle?

653
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,590
I have testicles?

654
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,090
yes,one. Bex,this is a tremendous

655
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,510
amount of information for you--

656
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,360
and I've had it my whole life.

657
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,750
Oh,my god.

658
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,630
Does this mean...

659
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,930
does this mean I could be a boy?

660
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,270
You engineered that conversation.

661
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,100
You forced our hand.

662
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Well,you were lying to her.

663
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,940
We were protecting her.

664
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,390
She's a 14-year-old girl.

665
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,280
Maybe. Maybe not.

666
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,460
This isn't your life.

667
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,070
This isn't your child.

668
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,640
14 years--14 years,

669
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,810
we have raised a daughter,

670
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,290
and in one afternoon, you expect us to--what?

671
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,440
What is bex supposed to do?

672
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,720
How is she supposed to go home and tell the other kids--what?

673
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,890
You had no right.

674
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,850
No,I know. I'm off the case,right?

675
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,530
Ohh Mauer

676
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,910
Mauer,lay back.

677
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,750
You just had surgery.

678
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,060
You're losing your shirt,man.

679
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,430
Much obliged,brock-- brock--

680
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,760
much obliged,pal.

681
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,590
How are you feeling,mauer?

682
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,520
Much obliged.What's whacked for $20,alex?

683
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,330
Weeds whacked. Weeds.

684
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,520
Weeds whacked for $200.

685
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,000
W-way--way whacked. Wh--

686
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,010
I saw ellis.

687
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,740
And?

688
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,540
I think I can get her into the clinical trial.

689
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,140
She's a perfect candidate.

690
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,270
Excellent.

691
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,670
Thank you,derek.

692
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,970
You realize this requires meredith's power of attorney.

693
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,770
Yeah.

694
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,100
It might be better if it's coming from you.

695
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,850
With me,there's baggage.

696
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,020
You,you're just trying to help out a friend.

697
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,460
Right. Right.

698
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,750
Well,let me know if meredith wants me to make the call.

699
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,020
Karev...

700
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,130
what are you doing?

701
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,020
Research on the bezoar patient.

702
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,630
I told you I needed you on the floor.

703
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,030
He has fever,sweats,tingling in his lips, fingers and toes,

704
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,540
mood swings and lack of coordination.

705
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,210
And did I mention the crazy talk?

706
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,000
Your point?

707
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,530
Well,my point is,he ate his novel.

708
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,580
I know.

709
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,530
Mercury's in the paper. He's got mercury poisoning.

710
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,350
Cristina,call burke.

711
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,710
I'm feeling some fairly extensive damage

712
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,650
from coronary artery disease.

713
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,770
Um...

714
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,710
yang.

715
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,570
talk to me,bailey.

716
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,090
it's me.

717
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,240
I can't talk. I'm waiting on a call from bailey.

718
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,760
I'm with bailey.

719
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,090
You're in idaho?

720
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah.

721
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,910
You're breaking the rules.

722
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,640
Yes.

723
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,120
Preston,what's happening with our heart?

724
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,050
Hello,dr. Webber.

725
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,240
Tell me what I need to know about  denny's heart,dr. Bailey.

726
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,690
thank you.

727
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,800
This program derek looked into  was a favor to me.

728
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,630
Nice try.

729
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,420
Sometimes,meredith,a favor is just a favor.

730
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,470
This treatment won't cure your mother,

731
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,050
it won't give her a new lease on life,

732
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,190
but it may give her more good days.

733
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,270
I urge you to consider it.

734
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,440
Lying here trapped in this flesh prison,

735
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,310
I have reached a grim conclusion.

736
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,210
I am a failure.

737
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,740
You know how that feels?

738
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,520
Dude,if you only knew.

739
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,800
Even my manic attempt to put  my failed novel behind me failed.

740
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,160
Time for a plan "b," I reckon.

741
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,330
Time,indeed.

742
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,210
Perhaps I shall play the cello.

743
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,420
Well,we make a mistake here and people die.

744
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,690
It happens all the time.

745
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,430
All the time?

746
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,540
Well,it happens a lot.

747
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,730
This is part of the hallucination,right?

748
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,560
My point is,we all have setbacks,mauer.

749
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,450
But I'm a doctor,and you're a writer.

750
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,110
We don't have a plan "B."

751
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,740
Call security.

752
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,410
Have you determined a course of treatment  for the mercury poisoning,dr. Karev?

753
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,910
Yeah,the patient has been administered a chelator called

754
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,500
british anti-leukocyte,

755
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,850
which will absorb the mercury over the next several days.

756
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,230
Good work,doctor.

757
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,890
Yang...

758
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,590
you know what's wrong with having an 80-hour limit?

759
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,000
It protects the weak.

760
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,860
It levels the playing field, which not only sucks,it's dangerous.

761
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,740
80-hour work week, that's what's on your mind?

762
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,350
I thought about it...

763
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,370
not keeping it.

764
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,370
You did?

765
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,150
My husband and I,

766
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,690
we tried for years,

767
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,620
but still,when that stick turned blue...

768
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,750
well,you can't work the way we work,

769
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,820
you can't want the kind of careers that we want,

770
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,330
and not take... pause.

771
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,620
I took pause.

772
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,460
-You paused?
-I paused.

773
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,970
I paused a very long time.

774
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,970
So why did...

775
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,190
I sat up one night,

776
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,280
middle of the night...

777
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,390
and i knew

778
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,880
I could do this.

779
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,820
Now I still don't know how I'm gonna do this,but

780
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,350
I knew I could do it.

781
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,500
You just have to know,

782
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
and when you don't know,

783
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,280
then no one can fault you for it.

784
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,520
You do what you can

785
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,610
when you can,

786
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,800
why you can.

787
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,190
And when you can't,

788
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,500
you can'T.

789
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,080
You're stalking me.

790
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,870
You're a stalker.

791
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,850
Well,

792
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,860
can you blame me?

793
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,470
So it's bad,huh?

794
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,180
You have time.

795
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,100
Liar.

796
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,300
Fine,there's no time.

797
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,370
Oh,now that's just spiteful.

798
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,280
I didn't get the heart.

799
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,640
You didn't get the heart.

800
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Hey,george.

801
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
Hey,I just,uh...

802
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,230
I just wanted to check in on you.

803
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I heard my parents weren't too  happy with you.

804
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,830
Nope.

805
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,370
Thanks for telling me,

806
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,130
for making them tell me.

807
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,870
You know,um,there are people

808
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,310
that you can talk to.

809
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,510
I can--if you'd like--

810
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,560
I know.

811
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,560
George,

812
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,980
do i have to be a boy now?

813
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,070
No.

814
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,300
No.

815
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,660
But I can if I want to.

816
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,130
Yeah,you can,

817
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,630
if you want.

818
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,240
I...

819
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,390
could you...

820
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,820
would you bring me some scissors?

821
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,740
Who gets to determine when the  old ends and the new begins?

822
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,710
Derek.

823
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,240
Hi.

824
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,050
Tell me about the program.

825
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,070
It's not a day on a calendar,

826
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,250
not a birthday,

827
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,820
not a new year.

828
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,870
Hey,denny.

829
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,140
We'll see ya.

830
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,000
Goodbye Dr.xxx

831
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,080
Hey,he's leaving?

832
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,060
Didn't get the heart.

833
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm sorry.

834
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,860
Yeah.

835
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,060
He's a good guy.

836
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,290
Yeah,he is.

837
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,590
It's an event,

838
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,160
big or small,

839
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,550
something that changes us.

840
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,580
Ideally,it gives us hope...

841
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,830
a new way of living and looking  at the world.

842
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,640
I'm cookin' the trout outside.

843
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,390
Thank you.

844
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,560
There is a land

845
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,510
called passive aggressiva...

846
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,960
and I am their queen.

847
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,650
That's all I'm saying.

848
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,160
So what...

849
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,830
with meredith...

850
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,460
am I supposed to just wait it out, wait until it passes?

851
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,380
That'd be good.

852
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,960
I still hate the trailer.

853
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,090
As is your right.

854
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,350
Letting go of old habits,

855
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,090
old memories...

856
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,520
I wasn't gonna have it,

857
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,170
the baby.

858
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,890
And you don't get to be mad about that.

859
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,950
We barely knew each other,I was an intern,

860
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,080
and there was no way that I could have even--

861
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,290
I'm not mad.

862
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,950
You're not?

863
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,160
No.

864
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,720
I just wanted to know.

865
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,530
I want to know things.

866
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,540
What's important

867
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,180
is that we never stop believing

868
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,410
we can have a new beginning.

869
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,880
doc,that was my laundry. You don't eat laundry.

870
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,500
Bad dog. Bad dog.

871
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,240
but it's also important to remember

872
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,180
that amid all the crap...

873
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,600
are a few things

874
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,520
really worth holding on to.
