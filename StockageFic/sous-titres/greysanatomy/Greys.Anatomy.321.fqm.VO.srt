1
00:00:00,559 --> 00:00:02,465
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,850
I have sex last night
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:06,380
This is our secret, okay?

4
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:09,075
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

5
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:10,851
If I'm not having sex,
neither are you.

6
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,718
- Chief resident?
- The one fifth year resident

7
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:14,118
that rules all residents.

8
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:17,085
I went to the board this morning
and told 'em I was retiring.

9
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,474
I came out here to be chief,

10
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:21,251
- and Meredith complicates that.
- So I just have to pick one?

11
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,411
If you don't pick one,

12
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,561
this is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

13
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,385
My name is not Ava!

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,587
You made it up!
It's not me!

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,964
What percentage of americans
will get an acute appy?

16
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:42,003
<i>As interns, we know what we want...</i>

17
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,463
<i>to become surgeons...</i>

18
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:45,275
<i>And we'll do anything to get there.</i>
7.

19
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:47,031
What are the signs
of residual eye infections?

20
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,545
Uh, pus, uh, redness and, uh, fever.

21
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:53,367
<i>Suffer through killer exams,
endure 100-hour weeks,</i>

22
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:56,144
<i>stand for hours on end
in operating rooms...</i>

23
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,707
<i>- You name it, we'll do it.</i>
- What's conn's syndrome?

24
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,493
- Uh, w-wait, wait, I know this.
- Oh, tick tock, dude.

25
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:02,714
Cracking under the pressure.

26
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:06,195
No. Um...
Hypercortolis... Cortisolism!

27
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:08,928
Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Uh,
primary hyperaldosteronism.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,307
Yes! Out of the seat.
My turn.

29
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,856
- No, it's my turn.
- No, it is not.

30
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,017
- Um, try this one.
- You know, I...

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,322
White sponge with vanilla buttercream.

32
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:18,143
Yeah, I'm trying to study for the most
important test of my intern career.

33
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,561
- I don't have time for wedding cake.
- Well, just try it.

34
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:22,103
Go! Go!

35
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:24,456
Uh, what is the strongest
layer of the small bowel?

36
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:25,487
Fine. Yummy. Go.

37
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,313
Damn it,
damn it, damn it.

38
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:29,440
It is not snot.

39
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:30,917
- Submucosa!
- Yes.

40
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,484
Wait, wait, wait.
How do you know that?

41
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,840
- Are you studying with the wife's cards
- What cards?

42
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,550
Callie was ranked number one
in her year after this test.

43
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,370
She has legendary flash cards.

44
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:42,243
We don't need the flash cards.
We are independently brilliant.

45
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,611
- Dream team.
- Yeah, I'm gonna hurl. Outta the seat.

46
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,446
No, my turn.
I'm gonna kick all your asses.

47
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,654
This is the lemon.
Might be a little tart.

48
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:50,674
What is actinic keratosis?

49
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,658
Uh... actinic keratosis is,
uh, a premalignant lesion.

50
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:54,907
- In old people.
- In anyone.

51
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:56,043
Too tart?

52
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,273
I don't care.
I mean, is Alex right or am I?

53
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,373
Learn to care,
or I'll get another bride.

54
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:05,726
I love it. I love all cakes.
Now break the tie.

55
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,246
Karev's right.

56
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,528
<i>The tough part, though,
is reconciling</i>

57
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,120
<i>this huge thing we want:</i>

58
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,641
<i>to be surgeons...</i>

59
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,719
<i>with everything else we want.</i>

60
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,212
I haven't seen you
in a few days.

61
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,846
- I left messages.
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:26,279
- I was just trying to--
- I know I told you to stop hovering

63
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,054
and you did,
and I appreciate that.

64
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,166
But now stop with the stopping.

65
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,185
No, you're right. It's ridiculous for me
to worry about you all the time.

66
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,892
It's sweet that you worry.

67
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,624
It is. I should communicate more.

68
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:39,425
- Right.
- You don't think I can do it.

69
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:40,673
- I can do it
- Really?

70
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,227
In a few seconds, I'll be
getting on that elevator.

71
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,937
And then I'll be going
on rounds.

72
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:50,807
See, uh, I'm, uh,
getting on the elevator.

73
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:53,511
Communicating.

74
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:58,435
28 more days and...

75
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,650
Then it's you and me
in a locked room

76
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,575
for a record-breaking,
earth-shattering,

77
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,823
- mind-blowing...
- Okay! I get it.

78
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,200
- Thank you.
- That was less than enthusiastic.

79
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:09,291
I'm gonna be
more enthusiastic when we...

80
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,567
cross the finish line.

81
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,215
Okay.

82
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,546
Just making sure you haven't
lost interest in the project.

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,696
Not at all.

84
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,450
Good.

85
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:33,847
What are you doing?

86
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,525
The bakery wants me to make
a decision by tomorrow.

87
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:39,164
So if you can tell me
your favorite by then,

88
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,924
that would be great.

89
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,756
Cakes and little place cards?
Okay, he's turning into a girl.

90
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,723
I think it's sweet. He obviously
cares about this stuff.

91
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,211
This white one
taste's pretty good.

92
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,877
I should bring a piece
to Derek, right?

93
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:53,901
That's what good girlfriend's do,

94
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,819
bring their boyfriend's cake
and communicate?

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,189
No. The best ones just keep
all that stuff to themselves.

96
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,095
- Did you bring Callie's cards?
- Uh, no.

97
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,926
- Oh, well, no cake for you.
- Dr. Bailey,

98
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:03,917
I saw a hemiglossectomy
on the board. Can I scrub in?

99
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,616
No, no. You're not
doing surgeries today.

100
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,935
- What?
- Your intern exams are in two weeks.

101
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,562
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

102
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,431
Oh, believe me,

103
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,666
when you won't have to repeat
your year as interns,

104
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,451
you'll be thanking me
for this opportunity.

105
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:20,146
So, Grey and Yang,
you're... doing scut.

106
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,137
O'Malley, Stevens,
you'll be joing me

107
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,075
in the clinic.
Karev, you're with Ava.

108
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,512
Um, I don't always
have to be on her case.

109
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:29,043
Someone else can have her.

110
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:30,664
Or not.

111
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:34,256
So...

112
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:36,078
Last night we studied together.

113
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,602
Today we're, uh,
treating patients together.

114
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,701
And we're fine.

115
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,302
We're not tortured,
it's not weird.

116
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,213
We made a mistake
and we've moved on.

117
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:46,060
If anything, I think it brings
us closer together as friends.

118
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,183
- We're very impressive.
- I think we are.

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,894
Larry Jennings just checked in
to the hospital.

120
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:56,827
- What's the matter with him?
- I have no idea.

121
00:04:56,828 --> 00:05:00,087
His assistant said it was
a matter of the utmost discretion.

122
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,567
Oh, that's never good.

123
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,205
Yeah, whatever it is,
it was important enough

124
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,524
for him to cut short
his vacation and fly home.

125
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,306
I want you
on point on this one.

126
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:09,161
- No clinic today.
- Oh, I can do both.

127
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,377
Miranda, we are talking

128
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,878
the chairman of the board
of Seattle Grace hospital.

129
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,131
The clinic will survive
without you for a day.

130
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,995
- Learn to delegate.
- Who am I supposed to delegate to?

131
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,533
Chief Webber,
you paged me?

132
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,818
Sydney Heron
reporting for duty.

133
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,169
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you today.

134
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:33,894
- Where you been?
- Just getting my assignments.

135
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,459
Yeah, anything good?

136
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:38,999
Anything as good as a crazily
hormonal pregnant amnesiac

137
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:41,047
with a tendency to yell
at the wrong people?

138
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,463
Your blood pressure's higher
than it should be.

139
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,389
So what,
we're not friends anymore?

140
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,111
Fine.

141
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,946
Then I won't tell you about
Dr. Montgomery's sex bet...

142
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:52,497
with the overly hot Dr. Sloan.
Yeah.

143
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,380
If he can go 60 days without sex,
they're getting back together.

144
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,540
Apparently they used to be a thing

145
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:58,317
back when she was married
to Dr. Mcdreamy.

146
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,089
The question is, how do you
know all that?

147
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,257
I'm on bed rest 5 feet
from the nurses' station,

148
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,234
and I have excellent hearing.
I know everything.

149
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,243
It's like...
It's like watching a soap.

150
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:09,685
Do you know how many doctors in this
hospital nurse Olivia has slept with?

151
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,516
Wait. Who am I talking to?
You're one of 'em.

152
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:14,181
Anyway, I'd strongly advise you
to move on Dr. Montgomery

153
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,769
before you lose your shot,
or I would if we were friends.

154
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:19,104
- So if she wants to be with Sloan...
- Dude...

155
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:21,973
if she wanted to be with Sloan,
she'd be with Sloan.

156
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,374
The other board members have
a say in who gets to be chief,

157
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,975
but Larry... he's the one
who really decides, okay?

158
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,633
He knows it,
and they know it.

159
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,061
So if the attendings
find out he's here...

160
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,884
The man won't get
a moment's peace.

161
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:38,009
You have to leave now. I want
you all out of here, okay?

162
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,160
Look, go, go, go. Out.

163
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,543
All right. But you know
where to find me.

164
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:42,657
Celeste. Larry's assistant.

165
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,530
- He's in here.
- Okay.

166
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,652
- Go away.
- But we can help.

167
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,907
- <i>We</i> can help?
- What is that supposed to mean?

168
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,451
He doesn't have any woman parts.

169
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,884
It's not like we don't know
where he is.

170
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,630
- Right. We'd just come back anyway.
- Right.

171
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,277
Richard. Finally.

172
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,572
Oh, for God Sake. What are
the four musketeers doing here?

173
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:01,849
What happened
to "I'll be discreet"?

174
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,189
Larry, they're here
for the same reason I am,

175
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,349
to see if they can help.

176
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,425
Right.

177
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,899
Bunch of ghouls.

178
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,501
All right, one of you
wants to be the new chief...

179
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:14,829
Fix this...

180
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,155
and you got my vote.

181
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,333
And, no,
those are not grapefruits.

182
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:26,745
Well... looks as though you won't be
needing my services after all.

183
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:43,348
And suprapubic tenderness.

184
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,957
That's because I haven't
taken a leak in three days.

185
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,529
- Three days.
- Could be a hernia.

186
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,391
A hernia wouldn't do that.

187
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:51,978
Was there trauma?

188
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:53,883
Testicular torsion,
uh, you know...

189
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,554
- twisting?
- Twisting.

190
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,093
You'd have to tie him
in a triple knot

191
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,765
to get that kind of
fluid buildup.

192
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,641
Am I wrong?

193
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,354
I was taking a 2-week raft ride
down the Amazon.

194
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,846
Maybe it's a tropical disease.

195
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,615
Schistosomiasis?
Filariasis?

196
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,608
Well, now they're just guessing.
Richard!

197
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:11,991
Dr. Bailey, call Dr. Fischer
in urology

198
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,700
to do a suprapubic cath

199
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,944
an order an ultrasound
and K.U.B.

200
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,120
Larry, have you called Nancy?

201
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,824
I don't want to worry my wife
unless I have to.

202
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,608
She wasn't on the trip
with you?

203
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:31,899
White chocolate with...
hmmm, buttercream.

204
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,203
Dr. Montgomery.

205
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:34,870
I can't decide.

206
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:38,017
Triple berry at least has fruit,
so I could pretend it's healthy.

207
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,721
Yeah, Ava's B.P. is 171 over 118.

208
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,582
- She's preeclamptic.
- I ordered blood tests

209
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,262
and a biophysical profile
on the baby.

210
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,685
It was fine, but, uh,
Ava's got edema.

211
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,407
- Get her on mag and hydralazine.
- What about an epidural,

212
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:50,823
to get her blood pressure down?

213
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,667
- I mean, am I going overboard or...
- Believe me,

214
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:54,763
I wish I had someone

215
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:57,120
who cared that much
about my blood pressure.

216
00:08:57,324 --> 00:09:00,065
Yeah, well, from what I hear,
in 28 days you will.

217
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,818
I've had a cold,
like forever.

218
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,787
And I've been here
three times,

219
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:10,209
and they keep telling me
it's gonna go away,

220
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,890
but my nose
just won't stop running.

221
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:14,454
I'm like the most disgusting
fountain in the world.

222
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,312
Sometimes these things
just drag on.

223
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,853
- You might have to wait it out.
- No, I can't wait anymore.

224
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,775
See, there's, uh,
there's a girl, and...

225
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,509
we've been out a few times,
and now it's gotten to the point

226
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:27,655
where we're supposed to,
you know, seal the deal.

227
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,852
But the nose thing is so gross,
I can't get anywhere near her.

228
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,143
Well, I'm sure if she's really
into you, she'll hang in there.

229
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,766
No, no, no. You don't understand.

230
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,791
Have you ever met someone
where the attraction was so intense,

231
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,674
you thought it may just kill you?

232
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,349
Like you're in the same room,
and your skin is on fire.

233
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:44,924
You want to touch 'em so bad...

234
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,367
Yeah, okay, we get it.
We're...

235
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,470
- on the case.
- Yes, I will do an E.N.T.,

236
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,158
and you will listen to his, uh...

237
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:52,677
- Chest.
- Yes.

238
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:53,697
I'm on it.

239
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,331
Which fluid resuscitation
technique

240
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,669
is used in acute burns?

241
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,800
The parkland formula.
Come on, Mer. Step it up.

242
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,856
What is virchow's triad?

243
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,150
Oh, I hate George.
He married into the cards.

244
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,525
You think he knew? You think
that's why he married her?

245
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,183
Yeah, that's why
he married her.

246
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,525
We need those cards.

247
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,850
We don't need the cards.

248
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,013
- What is virchow's triad?
- Dr. Torres.

249
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,127
Um, Dr. Burke and I are trying
to choose a wedding cake,

250
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,131
and there are some samples
in the conference room.

251
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,065
If you have a moment, I would
really love your opinion,

252
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,530
because, you've got such great taste.

253
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,035
You're not getting my cards, Yang.

254
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,990
Dr. Bailey...
need an intern?

255
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,885
Uh, yeah. How's it going
in the clinic, O'Malley?

256
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,491
How's Sydney doing?

257
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:35,515
Oh, that's w-why
you wanted to see me,

258
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,015
to find out how things
were going? I...

259
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,191
- Dr. Bailey, um can I...
- Well...

260
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,764
- talk to you for a second?
- Oh, of course, Ms. Newman.

261
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:45,941
What can I do for you?

262
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:47,919
This is embarrassing.

263
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,144
Um, mortifying, actually...

264
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,096
I think I need to be tested.

265
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,730
Larry and I...
Whatever Larry has,

266
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,693
I probably have it as well.

267
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,276
Uh, O'Malley.

268
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,060
- Yeah.
- Page Dr. Montgomery.

269
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,588
How's it going, buddy bud?

270
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,798
I'm getting a strep culture on bed 9
and discharging Mr. Benton.

271
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,225
The gentleman with the sinus issues?

272
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:14,364
It's a runny nose,
and I have a test to study for,

273
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,257
- and Bailey doesn't like us...
- Bailey's not here today, okay? I am.

274
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,070
And it's all well and good
to open a clinic

275
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,194
as some kind of power play
for chief resident,

276
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:23,354
but chief resident isn't really
about big think.

277
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,093
It's about patient care, okay?

278
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,328
So let's see what we can do
to improve

279
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,234
Mr. Benton's experience.

280
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,359
It's just a cold.

281
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,096
Nasal lavage.

282
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,319
- Because we care.
- Nasal lavage?

283
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:37,052
Get yourself a bulb syringe,
squeeze an isotonic solution

284
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,602
into one of Mr. Benton's nostrils.

285
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:41,184
It'll squirt right out the other
side. Incredibly restorative.

286
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,429
Rinse and repeat.
Rinse and repeat.

287
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:44,921
It's not what you think.

288
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:49,012
I-I mean, it is. It's, uh...
It's just not an affair.

289
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,012
Though, I guess technically
it is.

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,586
But we're in love.

291
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,164
The, uh, the kind of love you
think you're never gonna find,

292
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,777
and then you do and...
the fact that he's married

293
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:01,099
seems a small price to pay
for being happy, you know?

294
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:04,785
At least, most of the time.
But then five years go by,

295
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,367
and he still hasn't left
his wife, and...

296
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,133
you must think
I'm a terrible person.

297
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:12,051
- No, no. No judgment whatsoever.
- I mean,

298
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,081
I know I should
leave him, it's just...

299
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,062
Do you have any idea
how rare it is

300
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,334
to find someone you can work
and play with?

301
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,111
And we love each other.

302
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,445
How wrong can it be?

303
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,957
Richard, this thing
still hurts like hell,

304
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,670
and my boys here
are not getting any smaller.

305
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,399
I want to know
what you're doing about it.

306
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,234
Well, the urologist
just drained your bladder.

307
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,910
Next step is an ultrasound
and an X-ray.

308
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,701
The interns will be
taking you up quickly.

309
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,441
No, no, I mean,
what are you doing for me?

310
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:45,697
Getting some of the best surgeons
in the world to help you.

311
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:47,108
I came here for you.

312
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,770
You.

313
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,196
You're the best surgeon
in this place,

314
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:53,775
at least you used to be.

315
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,510
What's the problem, Larry?

316
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,736
Am I not taking
good enough care of you?

317
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,647
How does a man lose his...

318
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,154
desire at 53, 54,

319
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,441
however old you are?
How does that happen?

320
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,073
I haven't, okay?
There are other things in life.

321
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,299
Like what,

322
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:12,049
Adele leaving you?
Even more reason to keep the job.

323
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,403
You're a surgeon, man.

324
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,223
I have to go skinny-dipping in the
Amazon to get that kind of a thrill.

325
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,232
I'm not gonna let you browbeat
me into keeping this job.

326
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,083
Like I'd even want to
at this point.

327
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,989
When I appointed you
chief of surgery,

328
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:23,641
you were hungry,
you were the man.

329
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,256
Now you're a politician,

330
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,167
giving me excuses,
handing things off.

331
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,279
I hate to think that's the kind
of doctor that you've become,

332
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:30,327
but if it is...

333
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,022
maybe it is best
that you're stepping down.

334
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,873
I know I said you could use
the day to study,

335
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,784
but we've got
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

336
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,914
- A bad car accident?
- Multiple gunshot wounds?

337
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,900
A penis. The chairman
of the board's penis.

338
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,017
What's wrong with it?

339
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,681
His testicles have swollen,

340
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,486
which is the understatement
of the year.

341
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,905
Fantastic. How much?

342
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,140
No, you know, don't tell me.
Let it be a surprise.

343
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:01,628
Look, you and Grey can
take him for his ultrasound

344
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:03,375
- and his X-ray.
- The V.I. penis.

345
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:04,559
Just go.

346
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,280
Elephantiasis?

347
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,391
No way Jennings has that.
Did you check for brucellosis?

348
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,363
It could be
Fournier's gangrene.

349
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,991
I don't know.

350
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,869
I'd go to gonorrhea
before I went there.

351
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,535
Then again, I'll be there
at the finish line

352
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,577
to make him pretty,
which is what he'll remember.

353
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:25,249
Oh, uh, Derek.

354
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,198
Grey wanted me to tell you

355
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,165
that she's still working
on Jennings' X-ray,

356
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,297
and that she'll be in the, uh,
X-ray viewing room.

357
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:33,173
Good to know.

358
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,159
She's communicating.

359
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,937
Just when I need time to think,
she suddenly starts communicating.

360
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,309
Time to think about what?

361
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,715
All of it... the relationship,
the chief thing...

362
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,162
how to juggle both
without getting distracted.

363
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:48,138
With Cristina,
I have to be explicit.

364
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,068
There would be no wedding
if I wasn't.

365
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,451
- Oh, it's that easy, huh?
- Oh, no.

366
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,542
I never said it was easy.

367
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,281
Right.

368
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:08,677
- Hey
- Hey. How's it going?

369
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,266
I, uh...

370
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,689
caught George in a lie
the other day.

371
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,012
He said he spent
the day in the clinic

372
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:19,857
when he spent it doing god knows
what with Izzie Stevens.

373
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,724
- It's probably nothing, right?
- Right.

374
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:24,605
Right.

375
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:25,856
So how's your man-whore?

376
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,246
Miraculously reformed?

377
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:30,378
For now.

378
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:32,976
That's never gonna
turn him into...

379
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,182
- what I want.
- Which is?

380
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,328
The whole thing.

381
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:39,474
I want someone stable
who barbecues

382
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:42,056
and teaches little kids
how to play catch.

383
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,779
That's not Mark Sloan.

384
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,655
Which doesn't explain why
I spent the entire day

385
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:51,068
looking at Alex Karev
like a puppy at a chew toy.

386
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:53,100
Why don't you just
go there already?

387
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:55,485
Because he doesn't
barbecue either.

388
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,573
Plus, he's like 12 years old.

389
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,836
Could fit all of
his belongings in a milk crate.

390
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,090
I don't know.
Guys like Karev...

391
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,888
Look, at least you know
he'll never lie to you.

392
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,494
Guys like him, they...

393
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:10,024
They mess around in their 20s,
but, then they, you know...

394
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:11,208
pack it in and...

395
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,465
and teach their kids
to play catch.

396
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,840
Maybe.

397
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,337
I need to stop thinking
about both of them.

398
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:20,745
And I have to stop thinking
about Izzie Stevens.

399
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,803
Hey, Callie...

400
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,510
Here's the thing,

401
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,858
when you're obsessing
about something like that,

402
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,254
there's generally a reason.

403
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,581
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,886
Nasal lavage.

405
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:42,041
Why?

406
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,621
Because she's trying
to kill me.

407
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,481
Sydney.

408
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,026
Dr. Bailey, we've really
turned this place around today.

409
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:52,439
- Nasal lavage?
- Four visits in one month?

410
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,268
Oh, are you questioning
my patient care?

411
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,132
Miranda, I get it, okay?
You're protecting your turf.

412
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,907
Very mama bear.
Very chief resident.

413
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,442
But this is not about
hospital politics, okay?

414
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,612
This is about the patient.

415
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,147
The patient can go home.
Get that stuff out of his nose.

416
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,715
No, I'm not comfortable
discharging him

417
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,907
until we've addressed
his problem.

418
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:09,827
The 16 patients
in the waiting room

419
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:10,944
aren't comfortable either.

420
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,124
Sir, I...

421
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,462
I-I don't think there's
anything else we can do.

422
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,786
You know, colds drag on.

423
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,670
Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

424
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,754
- Oh, hell.
- What?

425
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:28,168
That come out of his nose?

426
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,024
See? This is why I'm never
gonna have sex again.

427
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:33,688
Uh, wait right here.

428
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,237
Um, order a head C.T.

429
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,787
Why? It's not a cold?

430
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:42,989
No, Dr. Stevens.
It's definitely not a cold.

431
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,442
Hey, just so you know,

432
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,494
I'll be over here
while you're over there, okay?

433
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,634
Cute.

434
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,024
Easy to locate, right?

435
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,857
Girlfriend comes with a G.P.S.

436
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:02,641
Looks like some kind
of foreign object.

437
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:04,971
- Ouch.
- That almost looks like...

438
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,423
A skeleton.
It's skeleton-like.

439
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,880
Definitely skeletony.

440
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:12,017
- Are those barbs?
- No.

441
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,427
- Can't be.
- Well, it could be.

442
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:17,036
It looks like a teeny,
tiny catfish.

443
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,491
That's close.

444
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:21,714
You see there?

445
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,113
Those are spines.

446
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,108
This is a candiru fish.

447
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:26,881
The penis fish?

448
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:29,071
This guy has the penis fish...

449
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,862
In his... in his...

450
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,385
What the hell
did you do to me?

451
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,338
You know, most pregnant
laboring women

452
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,218
- love their epidurals.
- I'm not in labor.

453
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,364
I'm trying to keep it that way.

454
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:42,841
By paralyzing me
from the waist down?

455
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:44,323
I can't even sit up
in the bed.

456
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,515
I'm missing the show...
the Seattle Grace show.

457
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,017
I can help with that.

458
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,471
So I guess you're
talking to me again.

459
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,198
Well, I can't stay mad at you.

460
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,542
I tried. But I couldn't do it.

461
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,569
You make your move
on the redhead?

462
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,965
I thought you already knew everything
that went on in this hospital.

463
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,597
As a matter of fact,
I have an update.

464
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,831
I saw her talking to
the ortho resident.

465
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,009
Yeah, and?

466
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,525
She's seizing.
She's seizing!

467
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,746
Somebody page Dr. Montgomery!

468
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,494
Somebody page
Dr. Montgomery, now!

469
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,540
It's the candiru.

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,328
It's a freshwater fish
that lives in the Amazon.

471
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,436
It's a parasite.

472
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:22,492
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't drink from the Amazon.

473
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,568
- Did you urinate in it?
- No, I... What?

474
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,897
The candiru is attracted
to blood and urine.

475
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,738
It's been known to swim
up the stream of urine

476
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,700
and lodge itself
in a man's urethra.

477
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,112
You mean a fish swam up...

478
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,540
It's rare, but there are
documented cases.

479
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,881
One man actually saw it go in
and tried to grab it.

480
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,750
- It was too slippery.
- Yang.

481
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,367
- It's in the literature.
- So this thing is in my...

482
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,102
Is now in your bladder.

483
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,479
Well, right next to it.

484
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,418
It's stuck in your, uh,
prostatic urethra,

485
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:48,973
which is causing
the obstruction.

486
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:51,833
We need to get it quickly
before it causes sepsis.

487
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,002
Sepsis?

488
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:55,819
You mean I could die?

489
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,089
B.P. shot up to 202 over 134.

490
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:02,864
There's fetal distress.
The epidural didn't help.

491
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,542
- It'll help during delivery.
- What's going on? Alex?

492
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,467
Your blood pressure spiked.
You had a seizure.

493
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,701
The only way we can reduce
your blood pressure

494
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:12,150
and the swelling in your brain
is if we deliver the baby right now.

495
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,861
No. She's only 30 weeks.
I'm not in labor.

496
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,664
We're gonna do a c-section.
Don't worry.

497
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,528
The survival rate for preemies
at 30 weeks is extremely high.

498
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,840
Alex, tell her no.

499
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,618
- I'm not ready.
- You're ready.

500
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,516
But I can't do this
by myself.

501
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,441
Then it's a good thing
you're not by yourself.

502
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:30,593
I was on a consult

503
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,081
on the chairman of the board.
This better be good.

504
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,088
- What do we have?
- We had a patient in the clinic...

505
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:37,044
Chronic runny nose,
a halo sign on the pillow.

506
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,937
The fluids are still in the lab,
but as far as I can tell...

507
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,693
He's leaking spinal fluid
through his nose.

508
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:43,083
Thought you might like
this one.

509
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,037
Oh, okay. Look at that.

510
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,549
It's a brain herniation.

511
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,325
His brain is literally sinking
into his skull base.

512
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,632
And all along,
I thought it was a cold.

513
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,434
- Book an O.R.
- Dr. Bailey?

514
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,110
You're still studying.
You can watch from the gallery.

515
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,236
- I'll scrub in with you.
- Thought you're doing Jennings.

516
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:01,461
No, um, I'll do both. I sent
this guy home three times.

517
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,123
I can't not scrub in.

518
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,336
Your daughter is beautiful, Ava.

519
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:13,883
- She is?
- She is.

520
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,958
- Get her over to the warmer right away.
- I'll work on her.

521
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,277
Hand her off to peds.
I need an extra set of hands.

522
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,183
- We need to hang some blood.
- Why?

523
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:21,715
Why do we need blood?

524
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,278
Want me to get
the uterine arteries?

525
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:24,363
- Yeah.
- Clamp.

526
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,565
Uh, Alex, what's going on?

527
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,600
- Alex.
- If the bleeding vessels are deep...

528
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,972
- You what?
- Ligate around the hemostats.

529
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,371
- Got it.
- Oh my god.

530
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,961
I'm gonna die.

531
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:37,280
Oh, my god. I'm gonna die.

532
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,762
- Can I?
- Go ahead.

533
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,910
...and my baby's gonna be
all alone. Oh, my god.

534
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:42,702
Ava.

535
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,842
Ava, look at me, okay?
Look at me.

536
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,631
You're not gonna die.
You're doing great.

537
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:52,194
You're gonna be fine.
The baby's gonna be fine.

538
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:54,072
I just need you to breathe
for me, all right?

539
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:56,270
Nice slow, deep breaths.

540
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:58,393
That's it.

541
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,175
Just breathe. That's it.

542
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,734
Keep breathing.

543
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,524
Celeste.

544
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:08,740
Good news.
No chances of an S.T.D.

545
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:10,941
Now Larry's condition...

546
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,875
He's having surgery,
but you are fine.

547
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:16,877
You did hear the part
about being fine, right?

548
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,915
That's what
I keep telling myself,

549
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:21,409
that I'm fine with things
they way they are, but...

550
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,795
I probably won't be really fine
until...

551
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,791
I don't care
if he's fine anymore.

552
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,879
Celeste?

553
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:32,008
I got here as soon as...
Is he in surgery yet?

554
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,758
Um, no. They're taking him soon.
This is Dr. O'Malley.

555
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,945
Dr. O'Malley...
This is Mr. Jennings' wife Nancy.

556
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,273
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure. He's just in there.

557
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,614
- They're prepping him for surgery.
- Thank you.

558
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:43,980
I left my car in front
in a no parking zone.

559
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,107
Could you move it?

560
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,591
What are you going to do?

561
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,233
Move her car.

562
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,613
- Talk about divine retribution.
- What?

563
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:02,021
He sleeps with his assistant
and a carnivorous fish

564
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:03,644
lodges itself in his penis.

565
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:05,777
That's instant karma
if I've ever seen it.

566
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:07,402
Well, Derek wasn't
struck by lightning,

567
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:09,317
- and neither were you.
- Addison showed up.

568
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:11,816
I had months of pain
and self-loathing,

569
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:14,227
a crazy, ranting mother
and a near drowning

570
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:15,454
off the side of a dock.

571
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:16,928
I mean, it's no fish
in my hoo-hoo,

572
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,731
but it's certainly not
an easy ride.

573
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,808
Well, I've cheated
on my boyfriends, and I'm fine.

574
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,290
I mean, am I the only one?

575
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:26,586
Which cake is your favorite,
or have you chosen one yet?

576
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:28,933
Okay, clearly,
you're not getting the point.

577
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:31,844
I don't have favorite cakes.
That's why you're involved.

578
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:32,934
We gotta go.

579
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,971
If you see my boyfriend,

580
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,441
tell him I had some tuna salad
and a yogurt,

581
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:39,115
and now I'm off to the O.R.

582
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,085
Okay, this is not eating
for pleasure.

583
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:43,376
I really need a choice,
so mark down your favorite.

584
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,569
Sorry I froze there
for a little bit.

585
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:49,428
That's okay.

586
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,616
I... I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not getting weird.

587
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:54,376
- You know, it was a weird question.
- Shut up and eat some cake.

588
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,988
- Good?
- Disgusting.

589
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:04,413
- Karev.
- Hey.

590
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:05,750
I was just checking up on Ava.

591
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:08,117
Do I have another Denny Duquette
situation on my hands?

592
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:09,524
What? Are you serious?

593
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,834
I have never seen you
so attentive with a patient.

594
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,749
You're always there...
Checking her stats,

595
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,278
running tests, doing research.

596
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:16,775
- That's my job.
- No, it's my job.

597
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,067
I'm her doctor.
You're my intern.

598
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,274
Which is why I have to know
her stats at all times.

599
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,975
Because I'm not about to stand
next to you in your O.R.

600
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,711
And be anything less
than overprepared.

601
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,434
Okay? There's no way I'm gonna
go to work every day

602
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:30,956
with a surgeon like you and not
be at the top of my game.

603
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:33,299
So if you want to yell at me...

604
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,019
Uh, I know you have
to give him the cards

605
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:48,058
'cause you're married to him.
I respect that.

606
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,535
But there is an argument
to be made for female surgeons

607
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:52,329
- sticking together.
- You're relentless.

608
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,520
- "Sisterhood" and all that, you know?
- Scary, inhuman relentless.

609
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:58,994
You are like a role model
to me or... something.

610
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,976
Okay, you know what? Stop.
Okay?

611
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,590
This is just getting sad.
I will give the cards to George.

612
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,083
- I am sure he will share.
- No, he won't, with me anyway.

613
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:08,839
He'll just share them with Izzie.

614
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:11,421
They're like an exclusive
little unit. Whatever.

615
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,625
Yang.

616
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,824
Uh... my, uh...

617
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,870
My locker
is on the right side,

618
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:20,947
third one from the door.

619
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:22,280
The cards are on the top shelf.

620
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,030
- Really? You...
- They're all yours.

621
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,321
Oh, god. Um...

622
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:40,075
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Me, too.

623
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,574
- I was, uh...
- Yeah, I...

624
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:42,855
- So we're good?
- Yes, good.

625
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:44,377
Good. Okay, then.

626
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,116
Don't talk.

627
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:03,757
I know it's not fair,
and I know it's not your fault,

628
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,653
I know there's nothing
between you and George.

629
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,667
I know that.

630
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,271
Except there is.

631
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:11,068
You're his best friend.

632
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,149
He loves you.

633
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,761
He gets you. He needs you.

634
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,876
And I'm just...
I'm just... I'm his wife.

635
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:19,801
And I know, I know
I get the sex

636
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,772
and the commitment
and the life with him...

637
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,592
But I-I want him to get me

638
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:26,972
and to need me.

639
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:29,660
And I can't compete with you.

640
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:32,815
So I'm asking you...

641
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:34,467
to please stop.

642
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:36,934
Just stop.

643
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:38,755
Find another friend.

644
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,251
Or whatever you do,
just give me my husband back.

645
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,502
What about the forked stone grasper?

646
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:56,413
It can lead to urethral injury.

647
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,071
Well, the forceps aren't working.

648
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,950
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

649
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,749
All right. Stone grasper.

650
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,088
<i>- Coming in.</i>
- Did we miss anything good?

651
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,290
Hello? You okay?

652
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:17,291
I've had better days.

653
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,283
Where's Dr. Bailey?

654
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,130
Page her.

655
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,580
V-tach.

656
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:26,486
Does he have a pulse with that?

657
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:28,580
- Oh, he's going down.
- Yes.

658
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:30,653
He needs 150 of amiodarone.

659
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,014
How much longer
you think it'll take?

660
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:33,882
You worry about getting
his arrhythmias down.

661
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:35,653
We're gonna have to change
our game plan.

662
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:37,736
The scope isn't working.
Excuse me, Dr. Fischer.

663
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,132
We're gonna have to
open him up.

664
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,808
I don't know how I missed it.

665
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:44,654
It presented as a cold, Miranda.

666
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,926
This sort of thing, at some point,
ou think it's gonna get better.

667
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:50,673
You don't figure it's something
that could ruin your whole life.

668
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,595
- The chief.
- The candiru?

669
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,023
- Go ahead. We're almost done here.
- Okay.

670
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:57,060
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

671
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:04,439
You want to quiz me
on the G.I. stuff?

672
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,634
No, I'm still trying to get
through my cardio notes.

673
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,452
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

674
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:13,052
I should've snuck in
to the candiru surgery

675
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:14,826
- with Mer and Cristina.
- You still can...

676
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,966
George, can you maybe
stop talking

677
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,567
so I could concentrate?

678
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:23,762
What's your problem?

679
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:26,654
My problem... is you.

680
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,775
You're my penis fish.

681
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:31,878
Your what?

682
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,196
You've crawled in,
and latched on,

683
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,000
and now I can't move

684
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,126
or talk or think or even pee
without the nagging feeling

685
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:41,050
that something is eating
through my organs.

686
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,225
You don't
even have a penis.

687
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:44,494
- How am I the fish?
- It's a metaphor, George.

688
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,961
What happened to us being fine?

689
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:52,669
I don't know.

690
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,323
Maybe we're not.

691
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,129
A little more suction
there, please.

692
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,734
Those barbs won't let go.

693
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,730
Dr. Bailey,
glad you could join us.

694
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,411
Oh, this is useless.

695
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:21,270
We're gonna have to
cut it out, Dr. Fischer.

696
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:23,486
- I'll repair the bladder.
- Okay, let's do it.

697
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,426
How's his heart holding up?

698
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,854
Occasional runs of V-tach.

699
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:29,704
He can't take much more.

700
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:31,359
Forceps.

701
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,108
Okay. Almost there.
Come on, you.

702
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,854
Almost there.

703
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,318
Got it.

704
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,843
Oh, man. Unbelievable.

705
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,171
You see that thing?

706
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:11,176
Remind me never
to pee the Amazon.

707
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:13,799
What?

708
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:17,935
What do you say we have a real
meeting of the dirty mistresses club?

709
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:20,799
Like what it should've been
from the beginning.

710
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:22,452
- What are you doing?
- Once.

711
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,569
20 minutes in the on call room.
Nobody ever finds out.

712
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:26,922
- Mark.
- What you're telling me

713
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,631
everything's great
between you and Derek?

714
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,714
What makes you think
there is something wrong

715
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,139
between me and Derek?

716
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:35,118
Something's always wrong
between you and Derek.

717
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:38,571
Enough.
What is wrong with you?

718
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,953
Nothing. I'm... I'm...

719
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:44,268
Addison and I were gonna
try and make a go of it.

720
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,826
Things are not
gonna work out.

721
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:49,008
So you make a pass at me?
Like that'll help.

722
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:50,699
She doesn't want me.

723
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:52,973
Something's gotta help.

724
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,763
Revenge sex is not the answer.

725
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,661
If you're letting her go,
let her go.

726
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,690
Be an adult.

727
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:09,423
Thanks... for the baby

728
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,582
and for me not dying
and stuff.

729
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,829
Well, it's always a nice bonus
when a patient doesn't die.

730
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:18,085
You and red
make a pretty good team.

731
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,520
Don't tell Sloan.

732
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:22,020
Oh, she and Sloan
aren't happening.

733
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:23,778
She wants you.

734
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,169
- How do you know that?
- I know everything, remember?

735
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:27,662
I heard her talking
to the ortho doc

736
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:30,303
about how she wants someone
who barbecues and plays catch.

737
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,761
She wants someone
who's committed.

738
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:35,313
Yeah. Well, that's not me.

739
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,885
I hate to tell you this,
but it is.

740
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:41,136
You may talk tough,
but you're a decent guy, Alex.

741
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:43,015
Whether you want
to admit it or not,

742
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:44,593
you're actually
one of the good ones.

743
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,799
Mrs. Jennings.

744
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:52,952
Your husband's out of surgery.
Everything went very well.

745
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,044
Oh. Oh, thank you.

746
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:58,169
Thank you.
That's... That's wonderful.

747
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,756
Dr. Webber will be down
to fill you in soon.

748
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:04,781
Uh, Dr. O'Malley,
um, do me a favor.

749
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:06,681
Could you go tell Celeste?

750
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,609
She's a basket case,
and I just don't have it in me

751
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,844
to take care of my husband's
girlfriend right now.

752
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,531
Of course I know.

753
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:20,906
The wife always knows.

754
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:37,283
- Dr. O'Malley.
- Yes.

755
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,975
Mr. Jennings', uh,
personal physician

756
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:41,732
would like a copy
of his medic records.

757
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:43,365
Um, here's the number.

758
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,723
Mr. Jennings, I've canceled
your appointments for next week.

759
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,222
There's just a conference call

760
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,561
that's proving a little bit
difficult to reschedule.

761
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,215
But I'm sure Danny
can handle it.

762
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:56,378
Wait, what's...
What's Danny got to do with it?

763
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:57,797
I've asked him to step in,

764
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:58,976
temporarily,

765
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:00,797
until you find someone else.

766
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,949
Now, w-wait, Celeste...

767
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:08,628
What the hell was that all about?

768
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,647
Well, I think she just left you.

769
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,341
Good-bye, Larry.

770
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:26,424
What...
What the hell's going on here?

771
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,837
I think I'm done here.

772
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,942
Can you be a vault?

773
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,015
I think I need a vault
'cause I've eaten like

774
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:58,230
a cake and a half,
and it's just not cutting it.

775
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:00,018
- And you don't gossip.
- Because...

776
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:01,607
nobody tells me anything.

777
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,078
I was with a married man.

778
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:05,652
- It was...
- I don't mind

779
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,225
that nobody tells me anything.

780
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:10,504
It was George.

781
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:13,900
I was with George.

782
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:27,636
It should be firm inside,
not spongy.

783
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:31,845
The frosting,

784
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,090
like meringue...

785
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,559
Light and not too sweet.

786
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,137
I always thought
chocolate inside,

787
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:42,479
but, um, well,
I'm leaning away from that.

788
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,085
You've thought a lot
about this cake.

789
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,499
This cake...

790
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,786
for this day...

791
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,109
with this woman.

792
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,904
The red velvet's your winner,
by the way.

793
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:12,384
What are you doing here?

794
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,329
I wanted you to know
where I was,

795
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,869
so I thought I'd come
and tell you.

796
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,179
Oh, you're mocking me.

797
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,190
I'm apologizing to you.

798
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:24,335
You're making light
of things.

799
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:26,832
I'm running my fingers
through your hair.

800
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:37,799
I'm standing in your bedroom,

801
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,741
unbuttoning my shirt.

802
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:48,641
And now I'm taking off my pants.

803
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:55,636
And now...

804
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,373
I'm getting in your bed naked.

805
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:05,995
Mark...

806
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:09,030
we need to, um...

807
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,092
We should go get a drink,
um, and maybe talk.

808
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:14,341
Do you have some time?

809
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,620
Uh, I mean...

810
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,180
just something's always wrong
with you and me...

811
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,897
You don't want to have
a drink with me.

812
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:29,664
I'm not what you're looking for.

813
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:32,638
What are you talking about?

814
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:35,378
I slept with someone.

815
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,040
Couldn't hold out.

816
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,639
Once a man-whore,
always a man-whore, right?

817
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,194
Miranda, go home.

818
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,603
I'm almost done.

819
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:53,397
Go home. See your family.

820
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,635
You have to accept there are
days where you can't do it all.

821
00:36:56,654 --> 00:36:58,617
- You have to delegate.
- I did.

822
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,264
And then you do
all the work anyway.

823
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:01,687
And you're still doing it.

824
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,409
You didn't have
better things to do today

825
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:05,250
than to ride herd
on that V.I.P. case?

826
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:07,152
There was a fish
in a man's penis.

827
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,425
There's always gonna be
a fish in a man's penis, chief.

828
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,493
You can say you movin' on
all you want,

829
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,817
but are you really?

830
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:17,962
If you don't slow down,

831
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,741
you might end up without
a family to go home to.

832
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,060
Good night, Miranda.

833
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:29,854
Now see,
you can't do that.

834
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:30,980
Do what?

835
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,525
Not look happy after sex.
It's bad for the ego.

836
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,570
I'm fine.

837
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:39,278
- Are we fine?
- Sure.

838
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,416
Not so convincing.

839
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,608
I shouldn't have
accused you of hovering.

840
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,634
It wasn't nice.

841
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,515
You were just trying
to be there for me.

842
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:52,165
But...

843
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:55,268
now I'm being available,

844
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,752
communicating
and getting naked

845
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:00,146
and doing all of your
favorite things.

846
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,104
Mm. Good things.

847
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,039
Then why are you
still staring at the ceiling?

848
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,781
I-I don't know.
I just... I...

849
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:11,172
That day...

850
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:14,459
You came out of the water...

851
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,296
I spent the scariest hour
of my life

852
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:19,798
trying to breathe for you.

853
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:25,453
I love you and I want you,
but I don't know what to...

854
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,255
You didn't swim.

855
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:34,660
You didn't swim,
and you know how to.

856
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,131
And I don't know if I can...

857
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,827
I don't know if I wanna...

858
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:45,618
keep trying to breathe for you.

859
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:57,258
I should go.

860
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,324
I'll go.

861
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,244
<i>Too often,
the thing you want most</i>

862
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,411
<i>is the one thing
you can't have.</i>

863
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,094
What acid-based finding

864
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,214
do you classically get
with significant vomiting?

865
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,031
Hypokalemic hypochloremic
metabolic alkalosis.

866
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,308
Unbelievable.

867
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,845
Did you pick a cake?

868
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:32,277
Uh... I like the red one.

869
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,427
The red velvet?

870
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:04,764
That's the girl?

871
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,642
Runny nose guy's big love.

872
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,546
I don't know
how we do this.

873
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:16,741
I don't know
how we work together

874
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,985
and be friends
and act like it's all okay.

875
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:23,431
I, um...

876
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,678
There's a spot available
at Mercy West.

877
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:28,699
I called them.

878
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,960
You're gonna transfer
to Mercy West?

879
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,013
I have to.

880
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,942
<i>Desire leaves us heartbroken...</i>

881
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:41,864
<i>It wears us out.</i>

882
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:46,451
<i>Desire can wreck your life.</i>

883
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,953
I was gonna go get a drink.
You want to, uh...

884
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,521
head over to Joe's?

885
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,502
Yeah. Well, I'm kinda under it
with this test.

886
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,144
You know, um...

887
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:06,297
I, uh, took that test
once upon a time.

888
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:08,948
We could, um...

889
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:10,859
go back to my hotel.

890
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,155
I could quiz you.

891
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:14,665
Look, uh, this...

892
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,045
This isn't, uh...

893
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,474
You're not my girlfriend.

894
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:21,954
Okay?

895
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:23,770
What?

896
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,630
I mean, no offense.
Today was awesome.

897
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,921
It's just...
I'm... I'm really busy.

898
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,349
I have a lot of work to do.

899
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,104
I don't have time for...

900
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:32,705
No, of course.

901
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,992
Uh... study.

902
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,318
That's what you're here for,
right?

903
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:50,477
<i>But as tough as wanting
something can be...</i>

904
00:41:56,739 --> 00:41:58,476
<i>The people who suffer
the most...</i>

905
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,317
<i>are those who don't know
what they want.</i>

906
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:15,453
