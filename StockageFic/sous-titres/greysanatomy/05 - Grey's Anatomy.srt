[The Ditty Bops: Wake Up]

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,995
[Meredith] Remember when you were
a kid, and your biggest worry was,

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,940
like, if you'd get a bike
for your birthday

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,036
or if you'd get
to eat cookies for breakfast?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,048
Being an adult, totally overrated.

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,477
I mean, seriously, don't be fooled

7
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,545
by all the hot shoes and the great sex

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,456
and the no parents anywhere
telling you what to do.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,021
Adulthood is responsibility.

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,759
The lawyer has been managing her estate
with a limited power of attorney,

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,063
but your mother's Alzheimer's
is advancing.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,434
So while she's still
lucid enough to consent,

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,666
she needs to sign everything
over to you.

14
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,905
Me?

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,775
[Meredith] Responsibility,
it really does suck.

16
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,544
Look, I haven't slept in 48 hours.

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,644
I'm getting my first shot
at heart surgery this morning.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,086
I'm missing rounds.

19
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:00,252
Are you sure there isn't anybody here,
or the attorney...?

20
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,817
I mean, do I really have to be
the one to handle this?

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,888
We're talking about her estate,
finances, medical care.

22
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,433
You want to leave her life
in someone else's hands?

23
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,230
She's your mother.

24
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,938
[Meredith] Really, really sucks.

25
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,043
Adults have to be places and do things

26
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,046
and earn a living and pay the rent.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,014
And if you're training to be a surgeon,

28
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,517
holding a human heart in your hands...

29
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,884
Hello!

30
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,616
Talk about responsibility!

31
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,088
- What was that, Dr. Grey?
- Sorry, it slipped. My hands...

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,393
It's OK. I'm done.

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,097
You can release Mrs. Patterson's
heart now, very gently.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,804
All right. Let's warm her up.
Get her off bypass.

35
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:55,280
Kind of makes bikes and cookies
look really, really good, doesn't it?

36
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,975
I wish I could hold a heart.

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,711
A monkey could hold a heart.

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,616
You're mad Burke didn't ask you.

39
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,087
George, I need more ice and chips.

40
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,148
- Who else did you invite?
- We said the list was jocks only:

41
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,921
Surgery, Trauma, Plastics.

42
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,394
- Who else?
- Some people from Peds.

43
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,296
You invited the preschoolers
to Meredith's house.

44
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,460
Next thing, you'll say
that you invited the shrinks.

45
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,761
She invited Mental Defects.
This party is DOA.

46
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,331
Meredith thinks this is a small
meet-your-boyfriend cocktail thing.

47
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,310
- Did you clear this with her?
- No, but I will.

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,069
I promise.

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,945
Why are you wasting the only weekend

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,950
your boyfriend is in town
on a big party?

51
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,178
Is he bad in bed?

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,914
No. I just want him
to meet some of my friends.

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,288
Right. Sixty geeks in scrubs
are your friends.

54
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,259
[Pager beeping]

55
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,555
Ugh!

56
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,221
Bad sex, sucks for you.

57
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,095
- I heard there's a party tonight.
- Really? A party?

58
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,964
- Uh, news to me.
- No party.

59
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,434
We losing her or what?

60
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,031
- Are the grafts...?
- They're open. Temperature?

61
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,369
She's at 96 and rising.

62
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,966
[Burke] She should be
doing this on her own.

63
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,341
[Flatlining]

64
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,340
[Man] That's her falling.

65
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,407
Continue the progressions.

66
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,180
[Burke] Come on,
Mrs. Patterson. Paddles.

67
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,191
- [Man] Sets are below 90.
- [Woman] Charge.

68
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,954
Ten joules.

69
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,222
Clear.

70
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,059
[Flatline continuing]

71
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,894
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

72
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,627
- Give me 20.
- Charge.

73
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,328
[Man] There. We have rhythm.

74
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,836
[Monitor beeping]

75
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,134
[Burke] Reluctant heart.

76
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,765
All right.

77
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,571
Let's close. Keep an eye on her.

78
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,339
Good work, everyone.

79
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,249
[Meredith] The scariest part
about responsibility?

80
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:42,414
When you screw up and let it slip
right through your fingers.

81
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,490
Hey, I heard you did
a CABG with Burke.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,585
- Did you get to hold the heart?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,927
It's an amazing feeling.
You never forget the first time.

84
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,933
It was pretty great just to watch.

85
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,129
- Vicarious thrills, you know?
- Yeah.

86
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,694
[Elevator bell dinging]

87
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,002
[Woman over PA] Dr. Bailey to OR 7.

88
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,737
Dr. Bailey to OR 7.

89
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,472
- See you later.
- Bye.

90
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,207
[Elevator bell dinging]

91
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,319
I think maybe
I did something to the heart

92
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,419
when I was holding it.

93
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,158
I nodded off a little, squeezed it.

94
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,901
Oh, please. The heart's a tough muscle.

95
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,494
It can take a squeeze or two.

96
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,406
My fingernail popped a glove,
cut straight through.

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,302
George, what if I punctured
Mrs. Patterson's heart?

98
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,540
If you had punctured it,

99
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,746
you would have known
when they reperfused.

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,687
They got her heart beating.
The woman's OK.

101
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,817
- So I shouldn't tell Burke?
- Tell him what?

102
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,054
You know, um...

103
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,461
...nothing happened.
The woman's OK, right?

104
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,332
She's OK.

105
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,392
She's fine.

106
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,528
She's fine.

107
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,267
[Psapp: Nobody Knows]

108
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,929
[Bailey] What do you see, George?

109
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,768
[George] Hyperinflated lungs,
cloudy with bullae.

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,569
Seriously diminished capacity.

111
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,110
She must be having trouble breathing.

112
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,271
Course of action?

113
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,339
Bullectomy procedure. Remove
the bullae. Reduce pressure.

114
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,509
It says here we operated
on her back in '99.

115
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,678
So Mrs. Drake has been
through this before,

116
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,312
but talk her through it anyway.

117
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,380
And resist the anti-smoking lectures.

118
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,653
She feels bad enough already.

119
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,127
So, do you think, if they
put a picture of these

120
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,723
in a pack of cigarettes,
people would stop smoking?

121
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,599
How long has your back
been hurting you?

122
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,699
It's chronic.
Means I have it all the time.

123
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,472
I know what "chronic" means.
What pain are you having?

124
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,705
Oh, man, the pain's bad.

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,580
It's like a thousand samurai warriors
stabbing their swords into my spine.

126
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,550
I'm allergic to aspirin, most NSAIDs.

127
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,553
So maybe we'll start you on morphine.

128
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,818
No. The only things
that will work are Demerol

129
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,552
or Dilaudid.

130
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,651
A ten of Dilaudid will set me straight.

131
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,593
The standard starting dose is two.

132
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,188
Did you see that Tom Cruise
samurai movie, hmm?

133
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,563
Pow! Pow! Pow!

134
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,594
Exaggerated and overly specific
description of his pain.

135
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,401
A self-prescription. "Pow! Pow! Pow!"?

136
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,499
- He's a Dilaudid junkie.
- What do you do?

137
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,034
Check the database for history,
refer to a program and discharge.

138
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,740
After you give him something.

139
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,407
That's exactly what he wants.

140
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,008
You still have to treat
his pain as if it were real.

141
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,280
- [Pager beeping]
- Why?

142
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,721
The first rule in pain management:
Always err on the side of caution.

143
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,622
He's in our care. He says he's in pain.

144
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,126
Start a central line.
His veins are shot.

145
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,268
The surgery before
was supposed to help.

146
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,637
But it never felt right.

147
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,302
Probably would have been
a good idea to quit smoking.

148
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,506
I did! Four-pack-a-day habit.
It was hell.

149
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,981
- Here you go, Mrs. Drake.
- Didn't do any good.

150
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,745
Really? Because it looked...

151
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,377
I mean, from the damage,

152
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,854
we all thought you probably
were still smoking.

153
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,154
Cold turkey, five years ago,
and what did I get for my trouble?

154
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,456
I still had to quit my job
at the restaurant.

155
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,359
But even sitting, it hurt.

156
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,556
[Nurse] Here you go.

157
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,600
Nobody believed me.
They all said it was in my head.

158
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,865
I've seen the films.
It's not all in your head.

159
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,496
You're right about that.

160
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,835
Hey, come here.

161
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,239
You're too damn young
to be a doctor.

162
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,404
- Hey.
- What?

163
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,970
I'm older than I look.

164
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,447
[Chuckling]

165
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,882
Do you think this is
going to work this time?

166
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,681
I think it's your best option.

167
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,085
- Straight shooter, huh?
- Yes, ma'am.

168
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,555
I like that.

169
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,434
Hi, Mr. Patterson.

170
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,771
Hi.

171
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,504
Hemodynamics stable?

172
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,342
Yeah, map has stayed around 80.
Cardiac output at five.

173
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,474
- That's good, Dr. Grey?
- That's fine, Mr. Patterson.

174
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,984
But it's not good.

175
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,714
Well, heart surgery takes
a lot out of the patient,

176
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,814
but we're monitoring
your wife very carefully,

177
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,723
and she should be fine.

178
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,191
Mr. Sterman, let's see about
getting you out of here today.

179
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,462
How are you feeling?

180
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,629
Pretty OK,
except I don't think I ever want

181
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,695
to have a bowel obstruction again.

182
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,899
Really?

183

We get people in here
all the time requesting them.

184
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,271
Oh.

185
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,336
So, you keeping down clear fluids?

186
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,247
And my all-time favorite
question: Have you pooped yet?

187
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,808
I'm not exactly sure.

188
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,219
I think you'd probably know.

Passed gas?

190
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,082
Yes.

191
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,992
Really? Because if I bring in
my handy lie detector...

192
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,256
OK, no.

193
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,390
And I shouldn't try and lie, I know.

194
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,696

Wow.

200
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,508
Yeah, I do research now,
and I have a life, a family.

201
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,279
No offense.

202
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,910
No, no, that's OK.

I'm just one of those people
who believe you can have both.

204
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,116
Maybe so.

always gonna be your patient.

350
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,000
- I told her not to.
- [Cellphone ringing]

351
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,040
I got to take this.

352
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,132
Thanks. Thank you. Very comforting.

353
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,370
I'll watch your books.

354
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,434
Oh.

355
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,378
OK, so the beer is coming at 7:00,

356
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,508
and some of the floor nurses
are bringing wine.

357
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,611
- You invited nurses?
- Did you clear this with Meredith?

358
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,021
A few more people isn't gonna make
a difference. A party is a party.

359
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,856
And the bigger the party,
the less time for bad sex.

360
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,623
- Would you stop saying that.
- OK.

361
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,857
Hank and I have great sex, all the time.

362
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,197
We'll probably have sex after
the party, or during the party.

363
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,499
As long as you clear it with Meredith.

364
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,367
Hank just needs to realize
that doctors can have fun.

365
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,807
We're not all workaholics
with God complexes.

366
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,869
We are workaholics with God complexes.

367
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,352
And the notary
can be there at 6:30 too?

368
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:55,218
And the home's physician will be there
to attest to her mental competency?

369
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,727
OK.

370
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,356
Is there anything else I need
to bring beside my license?

371
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,491
My checkbook.

372
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,968
6:30. I'll be there.

373
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,165
I heard.

374
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,174
It's a notary thing,
a thing to get notarized.

375
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,039
I'm talking about the heart thing.

376
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,635
Do you want to talk about it?

377
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,681
We're adults.

378
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,739
When did that happen?

379
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,488
And how do we make it stop?

380
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,262
Dr. Yang.

381
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,863
Dr. Burke.

382
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,775
That bypass graft
got a little complicated.

383
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,040
It's nothing I couldn't handle.

384
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,378
Good.

385
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,524
Uh-huh.

386
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,561
Yeah.

387
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,221
Mm-hmm.

388
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,598
Listen, I'll call you back.

[Cellphone beeping]

390
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,435
That was my lawyer.
He's advising me not to talk to you.

391
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,443
Mr. Patterson, I know
that you're frustrated and angry,

392
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,470
but I need... We need some
more information about your wife.

393
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,846
The walls of her heart
are abnormally thin.

394
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,908
Hey, don't blame this on my wife.

395
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,819
I heard from your very mouth
what happened. I know.

396
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,151
But we can't treat her.

397
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,192
No, she was
in the best shape of her life.

398
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,887
You ask her cardiologist.
She had lost 100 pounds.

399
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,396
Don't you dare
try to hang this on her.

400
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,761
Mr. Patterson, please.

401
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,697
We're through talking.

402
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,599
[Sighing]

403
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,685
You don't like me very much, do you?

404
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,990
Oh, Jerry, it's not
you specifically. It's just...

405
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,623
It's just people like you, that's all.

406
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,293
Doc, I'm feeling pretty good.

407
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,097
Pain's about a three.

408
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,035
A three? That's excellent.

409
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,096
Mr. Frost, I'm glad
we could help you out,

410

as well as County,
Mercy West, Seattle Pres.

411
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,809
A lot of people have
helped you out lately, Jerry.

412
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,675
We're pleased we could do our part.

413
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,647

414

[Alex] Stevens.

415
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,479
Dr. Stevens is gonna discharge you.

416
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,646
Whoa, you can't discharge me.
I'm in pain.

417
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,622
You were in pain. Now you're not.

418
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,248
Dr. Karev is going to recommend

419
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,793
some wonderful
treatment programs for you.

420
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,193
Go home. Get some help.

421
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,560
You can't just do that!

422
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,690
He just did, my friend.

423
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,035
OK, any luck yet?

424
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,628
Nada.

425
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,503
Ugh. Looks like you're gonna
have to spend another night.

426
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,140
I hate to miss the party.

427
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,440
You gonna make it?

428
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,142
You are the last person on my list,
so it's looking pretty good.

429

So, doctors have lives
after all. Who'd have thunk?

Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 342.

Don't look at me like that.

- You page me?
- I'm gonna be a while.

435
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,163
Do you think you could get home
to sign for the beer?

436
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,233
Why don't you have
your boyfriend sign for it?

437
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,137
You have a very annoying way
of sneaking up on people.

438
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,205
Maybe if you were
a little less creepy...

439
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,183
I wouldn't come. I hate big parties.

440
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,744
Is Meredith the only person who
doesn't know the size of this thing?

441
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,153
I'm telling her.

442
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,215
- You can't. She's gone already.
- What, already?

443
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,625
I think she had... um, excuse me...

444

...an errand to run.

445
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,599
You don't think Meredith's
going to mind, right?

446
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,567
I want you to make it very clear to her

447
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,605
that I had nothing to do
with this party... nothing.

It was the traffic.

It doesn't matter, dear.

in a half an hour. I need to go.

OK, Mom. We're all here.
We have a notary.

and I need you to sign these papers.

earlier in the day.

put this off for so long?

And why did you let her?

523
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,949
[Glass breaking]

524
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,517
I made it!

525
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,385
George! George, come here. Come on.

526
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,052
- See it?
- It's hard to miss.

527
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,062
- More than he bargained for.
- [Alex] Maybe he's lucky.

528
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,155
Maybe this is his way out of the hole.

529
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,257
The hole? Interesting expression.

530
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,737
My father was into smack
pretty heavy. He was a musician.

531
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,637
It's tolerated in his line of work.

532
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,504
Not good for the family at home.

533
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,852
Why do we want
to be surgeons, anyway?

534
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,751
Surgery is a very serious business.

535
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,255
[Belching]

536
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,154
Full house.

537
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,351
[Laughing]

538
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,155
Royal flush.

539
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,219
Get naked, baby boy.

540
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,589
- Surgery is stupid.
- You're so sexy!

541
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,793
It's stupid.

542
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,063
- It's stupid.
- Give me that. You're drunk.

543
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,571
I'm not driving. I'm not on-call.

544
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,608
I'm in my own house. My life is crap.

545
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,578
And it's my party,
and I'll get drunk if I want to.

546
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,274
Is, um, lzzie Stevens...?

547
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,579
Oh, you must be Hank.

548
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,812
[Laughing]

549
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,878
He's very large and hockey-like.

550
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,049
No, lzzie's not here right now.

551
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,989
OK.

552
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,826
You and lzzie will give birth
to very tall, blonde people...

553
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,455
...kind of like Barbies.

554
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,524
Izzie was going to be home.
She didn't say there was a party.

555
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,197
Which pisses both of us off.
Would you like some tequila?

556
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,206
When do you think
she's gonna get here?

557
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,368
Don't know.
Look, we're low on ice, Hank.

558
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,413
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

559
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,811
We're interns, Hank.

560
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,578
The hospital owns us. It's what we do.

561
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,411
Bye.

562
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,080
Nice to meet you.

563
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,056
Can you guys see him
through recovery?

564
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,888
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- No, I can do it.

565
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,984
That's OK, Stevens.

566
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,551
He's my patient now too.

567
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,461
No, I got it. See your hockey player.

568
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,964
I'm serious.

569
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,364
Yeah, OK.

570
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,062
I guess. Thanks, Alex.

571
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,798
No problem.

572
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,001
[Sighing]

573
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,585
- Hey!
- Hey.

574
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,646
What are you doing here?

575
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,120
Mmm.

576
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,628
I'm sorry I didn't
have a chance to call.

577
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,688
My patient needed brain surgery.

578
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,702
Like, we were inside his brain.
How cool is that?

579
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,761
[Laughing] Oh, my God.

580
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,908
There's a party at your house.

581
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,967
Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out?

582
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,513
I wanted you to meet
some of the people I work with.

583
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,673
I don't care about
the people you work with.

584
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,216
I just want to see you.

585
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,981
You didn't mind meeting the people
I worked with when they were models.

586
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,182
Yeah, well, when they were models,

587
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,817
you actually showed up
to your own parties.

588
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,484
Yeah.

589
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,498
This is my life now, Hank.
I work 100-hour weeks.

590
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,902
I can't always show up
to my own parties on time.

591
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,669
My patients have to come first.
It's just...

592
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,802
Yeah, I just flew
across the entire country,

593
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,778
and there's 100 people at your house.

594
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,213
100 people who understand
what I do all day.

595
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,342
I shouldn't have to apologize for that.

596
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,079
No, you shouldn't.

597
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,019
[Lvy: The Edge of the Ocean]

598
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,354
Look, let's just go by the party
for a little while.

599
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,593
You'll really like everyone once
you get a chance to know them.

600
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,795
I should just go.

601
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,599
Hank, come on.

602
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,607
I'll call you.

603
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,101
[Derek] You know, in some states,
you get arrested for that.

604
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,942
So, you blew me off
for a bottle of tequila.

605
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,111
Tequila's no good for you.
Doesn't call, doesn't write.

606
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,553
It's not nearly
as much fun to wake up to.

607
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,838
Take me for a ride, Derek.

608
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,939
You know, it sounds
like the party's winding down.

609
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,538
- Listen to me!
- What?

610
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,141
We should probably
sneak inside now.

611
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,278
We've done enough sneaking
for the night.

612
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,481
It was good sneaking,
but enough sneaking.

613
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,649
Yeah, I'd say
we're pretty good sneakers.

614
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,197
You mind moving this tail wagon?

615
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,257
You're blocking me in.

616
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,662
Apparently not good enough.
[Clearing throat]

617
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,731
[Sighing]

618
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:14,033
When's your meeting with the chief?

619
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,572
In an hour.

620
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,013
Holy mother of destruction.

621
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,072
You missed Doctor-palooza.

622
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,516
Apparently, you didn't.

623
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,350
I should probably
never speak to you again.

624
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,885
I'm so sorry, Meredith.

625
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,392
I had no idea it was going to get so...

626
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,791
[Meredith] It's OK.

627
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,363
Really, I don't care.

628
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,194
What would I be doing, anyway?

629
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,791
Preparing for your
career-altering meeting.

630
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,200
Sorry.

631
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,738
That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

632
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,933
Anything in the patient's history?

633
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,000
Husband said she was
in the best shape of her life.

634
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,546
She lost 100 pounds last year.

635
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,981
100 pounds in a year...
How's her muscle mass?

636
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,755
Do you even know whose that was?

637
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,621
I'm hoping it was yours.

638
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,682
No.

639
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,262
What do you think?

640
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:19,292
[Cristina] 50 says Meredith gets
tossed out and Burke walks away clean.

641
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,701
Please be nice to her.

642
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,068
[Sighing]

643
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,370
[Sighing] So, I have done
a lot of research on this,

644
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,741
and Dr. Burke has been
kind enough to help me.

645
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,042
And I understand my responsibility

646
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,082
in what I've done wrong here.

647
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,777
However, I do think
the patient's history

648
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,752
is significant in this case.

649
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,721
She still weighs 200 pounds,

650
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,552
which is why no one even noticed it.

651
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,422
But with that kind of a weight drop,

652
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,519
it doesn't matter how much
you weigh. You're anorexic.

653
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,360
Along with all that fat,
she was losing heart muscle.

654
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,127
That certainly could be the reason

655
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,101
for a small poke
to become a large tear.

656
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,364
That still doesn't change the fact,
though.

657
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,134
The poke wasn't reported
at the time of the occurrence.

658
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,143
- And if I could change that...
- And you can't.

659
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,908
You left yourself and the hospital open
to tremendous liability.

660
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,643
[Burke] Not if the weight loss
caused the problem.

661
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,151
- I have no choice...
- I've spoken to the husband.

662
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,881
His wife remains stable...

663
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,823
I can't take your beliefs
to the bank, Dr. Burke.

664
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,484
Dr. Grey made a huge error here.

665
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,152
- And she reported it.
- Too late.

666
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,129
And in front of the patient's husband.

667
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,392
But she reported it. She spoke up.

668
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,667
Five years ago, as a CT fellow,

669
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,730
I had a nagging feeling
that I didn't check the body cavity

670
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,333
of a lung patient
closely enough before I closed.

671
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,505
The patient seemed fine post-op,
and I was in a hurry.

672
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,312
And yesterday you and Dr. Bailey
pulled a towel out

673
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,512
from under that patient's lung.

674
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,351
Why didn't I report it
at an appropriate time?

675
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,258
Maybe because I was afraid that
I would be called into a meeting

676
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:55,061
where some hospital lawyer's
fear of liability could end my career.

677
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,895
Even great doctors make mistakes,

678
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,266
and when we do, we've got
to have a chance to speak up

679
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,772
without fear of retribution.

680
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,774
Or everyone suffers.

681
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,367
Dr. Grey spoke up.

It really does suck.

00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,060
- Yeah, one-month probation.
- That's good.

685
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,124
Yep.

686
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,296
Burke saved my ass in there.

687
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,705
Don't you all have something better
to do? Come on, people, move!

688
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,273
He was always gonna
tell them about the towel.

689
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,245
Just wanted to wait
for the right time.

690
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,578

00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,587
She's here to talk to you,
if you want, about options for rehab.

696
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,193
[Meredith] It can't be avoided.

697
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,829
Mrs. Drake,

698
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,707
I cannot begin to
tell you how truly sorry I am.

699
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,746
Either someone makes us face it,

700
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,181
or we suffer the consequences.

701
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,330
Izzie! I did it! I pooped!

702
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,423
All right!

703
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,429
- Missed your party?
- Life as a surgeon.

704
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,133
And loving every minute of it.

705
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,056
[Meredith] And still,
adulthood has its perks.

706
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,359
Thanks for the coffee.

707
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,717
[Meredith] I mean,
the shoes, the sex,

708
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,352
the no parents anywhere
telling you what to do...

709
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,634
...that's pretty damn good.
