1
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:07,616
<i>No one believes their life
will turn out just kind of okay.</i>

2
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:11,131
<i>We all think
we're going to be great.</i>

3
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,008
<i>And from the day
we decide to be surgeons,</i>

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,655
<i>we are filled
with expectation--</i>

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,027
<i>Expectations
of the trails we will blaze,</i>

6
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:23,670
<i>the people we will help,
the difference we will make...</i>

7
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,822
<i>Great expectations
of who we will be,</i>

8
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,535
<i>where we will go.</i>

9
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>And then,</i>

10
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:32,665
<i>we get there.</i>

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,209
Meredith,

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,637
- would you like seconds?
- I'm great.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,271
Maybe Cristina would like some.
Cristina, would you like some?

14
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:50,582
I only made enough for three.

15
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,375
You just said there was seconds.

16
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,465
This is, uh, awkward.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,672
You know, we can go,
and you two can talk.

18
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:01,582
- We're talking.
- We're talking.

19
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,803
To each other.

20
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,321
You're enjoying your meal at
the international house of silence?

21
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:07,162
Burke,

22
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,679
you have to feed Cristina.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,555
She doesn't cook,
and she will starve to death.

24
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:11,542
I have cereal.

25
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,935
You two live together.
Someone has to be the first to speak.

26
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,231
I am giving a--

27
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,402
A dinner party. If she wants
to sit there, she can sit there.

28
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:22,948
Let's just enjoy our evening
and talk about something else.

29
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:27,987
I heard a crazy rumor today,

30
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,380
from one of the scrub nurses,

31
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,869
that Richard was retiring.

32
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,662
Mm. That's an interesting rumor.

33
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,910
What? It's true?

34
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:38,082
Richard's gonna name
a new chief of surgery?

35
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:39,738
He asked Burke.

36
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,767
But Burke took himself
out of the running,

37
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,201
which apparently is my fault,
for being a part of the team.

38
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:45,416
He asked you?

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,320
Who wants dessert?

40
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,085
It's so sad.

41
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:53,761
She's not talking to him.
He's not talking to her.

42
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:56,382
He said that when he retired,
I would become Chief.

43
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,011
No, no, no, no, no.

44
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:01,607
- He asks Burke.
- I don't think they're gonna make it.

45
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:04,424
He said to me :
"Shep, you're my man". Not Burke.

46
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,190
How can two people be
in a relationship and not talk?

47
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,935
I am supposed to be Chief.

48
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:14,607
George, can I come in?

49
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,165
I made you some cookies,
some brownies,

50
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,145
some muffins, of course--
I always make muffins.

51
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:19,214
Oh, thank god you're here.

52
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,525
I can't take anymore.

53
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:22,911
Three times already tonight,
And he's getting ready for a fourth.

54
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:24,863
- I--
- Are-- Are you talking about--

55
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,676
Oh. Oh, ew.

56
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,897
You know, I'd get it
if he were crying or depress,

57
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,328
and I know we all deal
with it different ways,

58
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,206
but this is not grieving, this is my legs
being bent In ways my legs do not go.

59
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,704
And I know. I know his dad died.

60
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,690
I get it. I feel horrible for him.

61
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,622
But ow, ow, okay?

62
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm gonna give you guys
some privacy.

63
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,932
- Yeah, I'm going far, far--
- No, you stay.

64
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,325
You take over for me, okay?

65
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,607
- Callie Torres!
- No, I don't--

66
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,577
Not like that.

67
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,938
I am giving him to you.

68
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,324
You are now officially on
George watch 2007, okay?

69
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,511
You are his friend. Yay!
And I need a break.

70
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,165
- I need to heal. I need to heal.
- No, no.

71
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,855
- I need...
- But what am I supposed to--

72
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:55,773
Callie.

73
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,062
- Thank you. Good-Bye.
- No. Callie.

74
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,566
What is taking you so...

75
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:08,105
Uh, she...

76
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,332
she had to go.

77
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,056
Are you hungry?

78
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,084
Hey.

79
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,622
Dr. Karev. Hello.

80
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,152
What's wrong with you?

81
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:20,450
Me? No, I'm good. I'm good.

82
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,594
I'm all good, all...

83
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:22,450
good.

84
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,477
- You've been avoiding me for a week.
- No.

85
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:25,511
No, I have not.

86
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,195
Okay, fine. Forget it.

87
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:30,229
I kissed Karev.

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,167
George has become a sex machine.

89
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,994
George has turned
into a sex machine.

90
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:39,015
Are you hearing me?
A machine of sex.

91
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,325
We have to do something.

92
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,456
What's wrong with you people?

93
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,457
Derek kept me up
all night with his ranting.

94
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,953
Cristina and Burke still
are not speaking to each other.

95
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:47,318
Oh, you know what? I'm fine.

96
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:49,249
I mean, I'm just not gonna be
the first one talking.

97
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,193
I mean, he has to talk
'cause I'm in the right.

98
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:52,725
Talking first is for losers.

99
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,206
- I'm winning.
- And Alex--

100
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:55,931
I don't know what's wrong with Alex.

101
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,366
I'm good. I'm all good.

102
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,062
Let me just remind you

103
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,283
that I'm still recovering
from the death of my fiancé,

104
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,442
the demise of my surgical career,
the fact that I was forced

105
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,690
to deposit an $8-Million check.

106
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,759
That I was saving for a good cause even
though I haven't found a good cause,

107
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,387
and I'm the only one here under care
of a shrink. I could blow any minute.

108
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:12,124
Now george's dad has died.
It has turned him into a sex machine.

109
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,683
I'm gonna need a little help with that,
so one of you better pull it together.

110
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,566
Hey,

111
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,979
anyone seen Callie? I kinda
need to find her for something.

112
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:21,608
Last I heard, perpetual sex

113
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,139
was not one of
the five stages of grief.

114
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,125
- But denial is.
- That's not what I'm do--

115
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,332
You shouldn't be listening
at other people's doors.

116
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,636
You were in the hallway naked.
I saw you.

117
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:30,740
Oh, I blocked that out.

118
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:31,567
Denial.

119
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:34,139
Dr. Montgomery.
Is sex another form of denial?

120
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:35,471
What?

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,285
What do you know?

122
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:40,809
That...

123
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,126
That you have a G.Y.N. patient in here.
That you want us to see.

124
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:47,719
That's right.

125
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:50,815
That's right. I do.

126
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:52,139
Shall we?

127
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,401
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

128
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,492
- Chief!
- Chief!

129
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,499
- Chief. I gotta talk to the Chief.
- Well, so do I, and I was here first.

130
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,919
I have a meeting to get to,

131
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,933
- a very important meeting.
- I'll talk quickly.

132
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,671
Get in, too, Shep,
if you can make it fast.

133
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,037
Mine's not fast. Mine is epic.

134
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,471
Then we'll have to talk later.

135
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,327
Why are you wearing a tie?

136
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,410
And why are you smiling like that?

137
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,916
You have the length of
this elevator ride, Miranda.

138
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:20,685
Use it well.

139
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,092
I have two words for you,
Chief-- Free clinic.

140
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:24,299
What?

141
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,706
I want Seattle Grace
to open a Free Clinic.

142
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,250
- I know, it's a big undertaking, but--
- This isn't even surgical.

143
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:30,623
I've done all the research.

144
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,465
Miranda, there's all kind of hoops
to jump through--

145
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,154
Funding, you have to get
the Department heads to okay it.

146
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:39,065
Well, if I get the support,
will you consider this?

147
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:41,837
I'll think about it.

148
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,533
I can't imagine why
you want to take this on.

149
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,271
You're a surgeon.

150
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,264
I gotta get to
my meeting now, okay?

151
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,946
Your chart says you've been
having some pain and bleeding?

152
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:55,140
- She has, for weeks.
- It's not a big deal.

153
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:56,671
I had to drag her in here.

154
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,237
On our one day off
from the restaurant.

155
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,208
Just let the doctors check you out.

156
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,630
A lot of doctors. She needs
three people for a pap smear?

157
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,352
Actually, it's not a pap smear.

158
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:08,524
It's a pelvic exam. And since
this is a teaching hospital,

159
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,469
I was going to have
one of the interns,

160
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,559
do the exam, but if you're
uncomfortable with that...

161
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:14,497
No, it's fine.

162
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,586
I'm helping you guys
learn something, right?

163
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,296
Okay, Stevens.

164
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,862
Okay, Jilly, I'm just gonna, uh,
warm the speculum for comfort.

165
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,903
So if you'll just
relax your knees...

166
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,466
You don't have to stay here, if you--

167
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,310
Of course I'm staying.
We do everything together.

168
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:31,800
We might as well do this.

169
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,944
Rachel and I were born
two days apart.

170
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,317
That's nice that your friendship
has stayed so strong.

171
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,551
Cradle to grave, right?

172
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:41,923
Cradle to grave.

173
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,703
So just relax this muscle for me.

174
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,192
You're gonna feel the speculum.

175
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,253
Dr. Montgomery.

176
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,177
Okay, uh...

177
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:02,942
- Jilly--
- Wait.

178
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,508
He didn't get to look.

179
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,384
I don't have to.

180
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:11,913
You said this was
a teaching hospital.

181
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,299
He should learn.

182
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,203
Dr. O'Malley.

183
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,585
Okay,

184
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:26,350
what do you have up there?

185
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,088
Is she pregnant?

186
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,764
- Oh, my god. If you're pregnant--
- No.

187
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:31,012
I'm not pregnant.

188
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,238
Am I?

189
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,514
No.

190
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:47,040
I could see the tumor, with my
naked eye, I could see the tumor.

191
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,184
I've never seen
a cervical tumor that large.

192
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:53,915
Does she have cancer?

193
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:55,888
It-It'll take hours

194
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,405
to get the biopsy results back.

195
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:00,439
If she has cancer,
I need you to tell me,

196
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,453
because if you tell me
in front of her,

197
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:05,198
I'll start to cry,
and when I cry, she cries.

198
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,184
If she has family,

199
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,950
parents, you should call them.

200
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,087
You should call them now.

201
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,219
It's just, her...

202
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:13,888
parents, we...

203
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,515
left home. We both

204
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,303
left home when we were 16,

205
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:18,737
and we haven't been back.

206
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:19,979
We don't...

207
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,220
speak to them.
It's-- It's-- It's complicated.

208
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,289
It's just, Jilly, um...

209
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,765
In situations like these,
she might change her mind.

210
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,151
She might want her family.

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,283
I am her family.

212
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,634
She is... my family.

213
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,545
I'm not contacting her parents,

214
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,200
and neither are you.

215
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,572
Jim, annoying interns.
Annoying interns, Jim.

216
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:54,827
Jim is semicomatose
and has stage III decubitus ulcers.

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,544
Bedsores?

218
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:57,854
Right.

219
00:08:58,268 --> 00:08:59,785
So he's gonna need to be debrided,

220
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,316
have his dressings changed,

221
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,647
and be repositioned every two hours.

222
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,627
Every two hours?

223
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,109
By the time we finish,
we'll just have to start again.

224
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,820
I'm crying on the inside

225
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:10,565
Can't the nurses help?

226
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,862
They could but...

227
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,683
I like nurses.

228
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,538
They're helpful and smart and,

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,648
already good at their jobs.

230
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,703
So as a going away gift to them,

231
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,290
I'm gonna let you hang with Jim

232
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:24,717
while I go do one last rhinoplasty

233
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,014
at Seattle Grace.

234
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,297
I do like to leave a city just
a little prettier than when I came.

235
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,442
Did he just say he was leaving,

236
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:35,738
as in quitting?

237
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,030
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Bailey.

238
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,258
How was your meeting
with the Chief?

239
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,491
Uh, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

240
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,244
There's a project I'm trying
to get off the ground.

241
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,189
I'd like to open a Free Clinic.

242
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:47,997
Why?

243
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:49,059
Because I want to,

244
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:50,556
and I could use your support.

245
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,926
Ah, see, that kind of project

246
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,574
Requires logistical strategic
and administrative components,

247
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,218
something the Chief does.

248
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,204
Apparently I'm not cut out
for that kind of work.

249
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,679
So... you're gonna have to take it

250
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,273
to somebody else.

251
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,838
How's George?

252
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:08,983
Dealing, I guess. Oh, well,
he sure has a voracious appetite.

253
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,411
You know, some people bake,
others eat.

254
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,028
No, no, no. I don't mean that appetite.
I mean the other appetite.

255
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,333
Uh, we are not friends.

256
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,652
You and I are not friends.
So please don't talk to me about what

257
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,595
- George eats.
- Okay, I was just concerned,

258
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,724
And I thought you'd be concerned.
But you know what? Forget it.

259
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:25,723
I don't like you.

260
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,329
Now my feelings are hurt.

261
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,523
Steve Beck, age 32,

262
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:34,219
right patellar dislocation secondary
to a fall while running a marathon.

263
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,248
The paramedics told me
I blacked out.

264
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,289
Any theories as to how Mr. Beck
here could've passed out?

265
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,806
Uh, no sign of head injury.

266
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,737
His B.P. was low in the field.
80 over 60.

267
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,130
Athletes have low B.P's.

268
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:45,931
Well, in that case,
it's probably dehydration.

269
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,393
I drank a lot along the way.

270
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,007
Now, what else
did you do today?

271
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,145
Ate a couple of protein bars,

272
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,117
took a couple aspirin
for this cold I'm fighting.

273
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,469
I've got another race
next month-- Oh, god!

274
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:58,233
All right, put him in a patellar
brace, get postreduction films

275
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:00,799
And run some labs.
Make sure he's not too dehydrated.

276
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,923
And, steve, next time
you have a cold,

277
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,303
you might wanna skip the race

278
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:05,751
Never.

279
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,384
You gonna be okay with this,

280
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,116
- working on a cancer case?
- Yeah. Why?

281
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,743
Because of your dad.

282
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,508
Callie! Hey!

283
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,881
Hi. Uh, sorry.
Uh, busy. Izzie.

284
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,259
- Is she avoiding me? What are you--
- Maybe, I don't know.

285
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,308
Um, but I'm here,

286
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,936
if you want to talk.
I know you're sad.

287
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,203
I don't want to talk about that.

288
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:30,859
George, I'm your best friend.
I'm trying to help you.

289
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,123
Why are you making
this about you?

290
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,218
It's not about me. It's about me
wanting to talk about you

291
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,694
needing so much sex,
your girlfriend's vagina is broken.

292
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,915
- Puritans.
- I'm not a puritan.

293
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,619
Izzie.

294
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:42,494
Look out!

295
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,063
Do you need some help?

296
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,098
Pardon?

297
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:03,325
Our daughter is here somewhere.

298
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,601
What's her name?
We'll look her up for you.

299
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:08,098
J-Jillian miller.

300
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:09,422
Jilly.

301
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,967
Don't worry, if this is really
something serious,

302
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,228
I'll switch my shifts at
the restaurant. Maybe...

303
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,036
do nights instead of days.

304
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,046
Mom?

305
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:25,274
Dad?

306
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,163
Hello, Jilly.

307
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,246
What are--

308
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,039
What are you doing here?

309
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:33,038
You called her parents?
I told you not to.

310
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,473
No, I didn't.

311
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,859
It's okay, Rach.
She meant well.

312
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,500
They can't talk to you, remember?

313
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:45,452
Right.

314
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,452
I'm shunned.
You can't give an inch, can you?

315
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:48,762
You and these rules.

316
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,804
Jilly, uh, I have
your test results.

317
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,638
I'm sorry. You are...

318
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:55,700
My parents.

319
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:58,748
It is... it is cancer.

320
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,259
We'll have to perform
a radical hysterectomy.

321
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:04,652
Surgery?

322
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,790
- It's okay, Rach.
- But how does--

323
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,728
How did it get this bad?

324
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,409
- Jilly doesn't want you here, okay?
- Rachel, it's okay.

325
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,885
- No, it's not.
- But it's--

326
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:15,755
They are just here to make you
go home with them.

327
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:18,051
Is that what you want?
Do you want to go back there?

328
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,543
Mom, dad...

329
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:27,916
you should go.

330
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:31,958
- But you're having surgery.
- I know, but...

331
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,489
You coming...

332
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:35,517
was a mistake.

333
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:37,406
Please go home.

334
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:50,529
You're quitting?

335
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:53,494
As soon as I find the Chief and
hand him my letter of resignation.

336
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:54,542
Why?

337
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:56,445
I hate it here.

338
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,418
I hate the town.
I hate the weather.

339
00:13:58,542 --> 00:13:59,618
I hate the people.

340
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:02,211
They're mean. They're unforgiving.

341
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:06,811
The people of Seattle are unforgiving,
or Derek and Addison?

342
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,632
What's your point?

343
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,308
What about your contract?

344
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,832
My non-binding verbal
agreement with Richard?

345
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,832
Yeah, I'm breaking that.

346
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,915
Well, it's not as if he's gonna be
around to enforce it, so...

347
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,115
What do you mean?

348
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,191
Well, the rumor has it
he's stepping down.

349
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,529
The Chief?

350
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:29,267
- Well, who's gonna take his place?
- What do you care?

351
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,301
You're leaving anyway.

352
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,742
When Richard asked you
to come out here,

353
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,956
what did he use for bait?

354
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,115
He told me that
I would have the foremost

355
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,046
neonatal unit west of Manhattan.

356
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,129
Okay. He didn't say anything
about being Chief.

357
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:48,063
- Why? What do you know?
- Nothing.

358
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:49,208
I know what you know.

359
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,125
You're lying.

360
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,546
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Uh, I'm busy now, Karev.

361
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,547
When you get a minute,
I'd like to talk about the kissing.

362
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:07,664
Who'd you piss off?

363
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:09,112
- Sloan.
- Oh, nice.

364
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,478
You got anything good?

365
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,995
Not even a fracture.

366
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:13,764
You think a guy passes out
while running,

367
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:14,936
I'd at least get a fracture.

368
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:21,284
Anyone available to assist me
on a truncus arteriosus surgery?

369
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,608
- Yeah.
- Yes, absolutely.

370
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,347
Good,

371
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,002
then the first one of you to accurately
describe the condition will scrub in.

372
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,657
No one knows the answer?

373
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,823
That's too bad.

374
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:38,747
It'll probably be years before
we see another one like this.

375
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:40,982
Oh, well.

376
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,948
It's a single arterial trunk
coming from the ventricles.

377
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:47,400
- How could you not know that?
- How could you not say it?

378
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,758
I'm sorry you had to find out
about that Chief thing that way.

379
00:15:58,502 --> 00:15:59,978
You mean after the fact?

380
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:02,226
Not the first time.

381
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:06,557
I couldn't go to anybody about my hand.
I didn't know who I could trust.

382
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,371
I was stuck.

383
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,571
Yeah.

384
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:12,681
Well, now you're not.

385
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:14,847
Hand's all better.

386
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,957
You can operate.
You can even run for chief.

387
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,681
Life is all good again.

388
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,805
Well, I'm not gonna try for chief.

389
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:23,233
I'm looking for...

390
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,013
answers.

391
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,488
Well, the chief asked you
once already.

392
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,171
I don't see why
he wouldn't ask you again.

393
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,495
Look, I couldn't take the job.
It wouldn't be...

394
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:33,330
It wouldn't be...

395
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,673
right.

396
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,341
Well, whether
something's right or not.

397
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,569
Doesn't seem to matter
much in this place.

398
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:46,719
Well, your labs show that
you're significantly dehydrated,

399
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,388
and your muscles
are breaking down a bit.

400
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,056
We just want to make sure
that the fluids help get

401
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:52,016
everything back to normal
before we send you home.

402
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,698
But my knee's gonna be okay, right?

403
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,250
'Cause I blew this race.
I gotta win the next one.

404
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:57,753
Your X-ray looks fine.

405
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:59,422
Your knee should be okay
in about three weeks.

406
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:00,774
You might want to try some P.T.

407
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,226
It's pretty sore.

408
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,260
The knee?

409
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,522
- Yeah, my calves, too.
- Oh. Uh, well, maybe--

410
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,115
Your brace is probably
a little too tight.

411
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:11,308
You've got extreme
swelling in both legs.

412
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:12,528
Uh, get Torres, now.

413
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,688
- What the hell happened?
- He was complaining of leg pain.

414
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,203
Please, can't you make it stop?!

415
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,700
- I can't find a pulse.
- All right, open a cutdown tray.

416
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,277
Gloves. All right, listen, I need
you to do everything that I don

417
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,730
exactly as I do it, all right?

418
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,473
Steve, listen to me,

419
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,570
this is gonna hurt, but
if you want to keep your legs,

420
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,232
I need you to hold them still.
All right? Can you do that?

421
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,749
Okay,

422
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:35,714
hold his legs.

423
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:37,425
All right.

424
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:42,956
Follow my lead.

425
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,932
His kidneys are failing.

426
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,057
Why in the hell is this
progressing so rapidly?

427
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:57,221
- Damn it.
- What?

428
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,484
The aspirin. Because of
the marathon and the dehydration,

429
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,864
His muscles are breaking down, and
the aspirin's accelerating the process.

430
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,919
His whole system's crashing.

431
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,326
The toxins in his body
are going to kill him.

432
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:07,126
I need to put in a dialysis
catheter under fluoro.

433
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,264
Let's get this man to an O.R.
Now, people.

434
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,153
You want to go grab lunch?

435
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,216
Oh, yeah... I was actually hoping
I could grab lunch with Callie.

436
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,809
- Have you seen her?
- No, but--

437
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,161
I think I'm gonna page her.

438
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,084
- George.
- Izzie.

439
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,050
Look.

440
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:24,643
They're still here.

441
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,449
They're her family.
Where else are they gonna go?

442
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:30,311
Actually, I'm gonna find Callie.

443
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,463
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Now's not a good time. Karev!

444
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:43,277
- Karev, listen to me--
- No, you listen.

445
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:45,208
You kissed me, right?

446
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,543
You kissed me, and ever since,
you've been avoiding me.

447
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,259
- Alex--
- No, you have been avoiding me

448
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,998
because you just assume
that I want you.

449
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:54,664
You just expect that everyone you look
at sideways is pining after you, right?

450
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,567
Has it even occurred to you that

451
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,795
maybe I'm not interested?

452
00:18:58,733 --> 00:18:59,946
You're not interested?

453
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:03,492
You think I want to be just another
intern sleeping with an attending?

454
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,946
You kissed me back.

455
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:07,932
You're my boss.

456
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,057
I mean, what'd you expect me to do?

457
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,567
Look, Sloan's had me
changing bandages all day,

458
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:17,464
and I would way rather be scrubbing
in on one of your surgeries,

459
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,085
and if you keep avoiding me,
then I don't get to scrub in.

460
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:21,726
So stop avoiding me.

461
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,699
It happened.

462
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:25,409
But it doesn't have to happen again.

463
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:28,585
All right.

464
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,075
All right.

465
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,986
Rumor has it you're headed
back to New York.

466
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,137
- Where'd you hear that?
- Good news travels fast.

467
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,220
Actually, I was gonna
ask you to scrub in

468
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,889
on a peripheral nerve
reconstruction but,

469
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,400
- since it's your last day--
- It isn't, and I'd love to.

470
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:48,421
- What? But I thought--
- Well, I was going, but now I'm not.

471
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,973
Rumor has it there's a race
for Chief.

472
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,242
Where'd you hear that?

473
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:54,232
Good news travels fast.

474
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:57,045
Especially when you have
a chatty girlfriend, anyway...

475
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,687
See you at the finish line.

476
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,590
Have you done that before?

477
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,086
Slice a guy's legs open
while he's awake?

478
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:05,876
No.

479
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,845
Impressive.

480
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:09,445
You, too.

481
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:12,093
Not that we're, uh,
friends or anything.

482
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,314
So you said I should be
concerned...

483
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,472
about George.

484
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,555
He doesn't-- He doesn't
talk about his dad.

485
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,362
We don't-- We don't talk
about anything, really.

486
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:26,976
He just-- Talking's overrated.

487
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,914
Oh, so you and Burke
still aren't, uh...

488
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,342
George told me.

489
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,169
Well, see, you talked about that.

490
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:37,521
Yeah, a week ago.

491
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:38,721
If this keeps up,

492
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,356
you and burke might be the very
last thing we ever talk about.

493
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:45,293
So what's the last thing
you and burke talked about?

494
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:50,771
Silence is overrated.

495
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,405
Where's Rachel?

496
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,557
She went to go make
some phone calls,

497
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,978
try to get her shifts covered.

498
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,109
You know, Jilly, um...

499
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,412
your parents are still here.

500
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,495
They are?

501
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,909
And I'm not the one
who called them.

502
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:11,640
Yeah.

503
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:15,336
You called them, right?

504
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:19,654
And I'm guessing they had to
fly in from somewhere. So...

505
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:23,219
you called them, what,
yesterday, the day before?

506
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,137
I went to an E.R.
A while ago.

507
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:29,495
And they told me to see
an oncologist.

508
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:31,288
But...

509
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,696
I couldn't afford my rent,

510
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,807
let alone pay
a bunch of medical bills.

511
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:36,641
But...

512
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,262
Then I got scared.

513
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,648
You called your parents.

514
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,562
I didn't know what else to do.

515
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,348
You sent them away because...

516
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,679
Rachel's my best friend. And...

517
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:53,389
And after she was baptized,
she decided to leave the community,

518
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,461
which means she's shunned.

519
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,006
But...

520
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,895
I couldn't just let her go out
in the world all by herself.

521
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,364
So you're shunned, too?

522
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,205
No,

523
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,261
because I hadn't been baptized yet.

524
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,592
So I could still go back.

525
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:10,206
- But Rachel would never--
- Do you want to go back?

526
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:13,895
I think about it.

527
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,260
It's my home, you know?

528
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,736
And if I'm dying...

529
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,451
I want an amish funeral.

530
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:27,196
I want to be...

531
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,527
buried in the white dress,

532
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,954
and I want everybody
to be there.

533
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:34,631
It's your home.

534
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:38,465
But...

535
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,406
I made a promise to Rachel.

536
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,693
Cradle to grave.

537
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,248
How did Jilly let it get this far?

538
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:54,875
It's frustrating, isn't it?

539
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,665
And it's entirely preventable.

540
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,786
And treatable, if you catch it
in time, but you gotta catch it.

541
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,531
Which is why I want to open a clinic.

542
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,975
If she had had access to a Free Clinic,

543
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:09,264
she probably would've had
a pap smear every year and,

544
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,126
wouldn't be dealing with infertility
and premature menopause,

545
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,699
at the tender age of 23.

546
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,491
- You want to open a Free Clinic?
- At Seattle Grace? Why?

547
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:22,643
Illness caught early means
fewer unnecessary surgeries,

548
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,864
fewer unnecessary deaths.

549
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:25,975
But I mean, why?

550
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:29,933
Because. And if I can get
the support that I'm looking for--

551
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,271
I need suction.

552
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:37,312
Oh, no. My god.

553
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:38,629
What?

554
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,022
The tumor's invaded through
the cervix and into the bladder.

555
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,891
Which means she is a stage IV.

556
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:47,541
Well, we're not doing
this operation today.

557
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:48,700
We've got to close her up.

558
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:50,348
There's nothing more we can do here.

559
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,176
O'Malley?

560
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:57,693
His dad.

561
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:22,157
How far'd he run before his body
had the good sense to pass out?

562
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,261
12 miles.

563
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,356
You've got to be out of your mind.

564
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,412
Well, he couldn't have expected
a head cold and a couple of aspirin

565
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,350
to do him in.

566
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,481
He probably felt dizzy
miles before he passed out.

567
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,633
He should've stopped,
sat his ass down.

568
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:36,212
He was in it to win.
I understand that.

569
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,303
You can, can you?

570
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:39,446
Well, surgery is the most
competitive field in medicine.

571
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:40,335
We're all here to win.

572
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:41,743
It's a long road, Dr. Yang,

573
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:44,474
When you get to the end of it,
you're not gonna care about winning.

574
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:47,615
You're just gonna be relieved
that you made it to the finish line.

575
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:50,484
You told Sloan?

576
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:52,622
- What?
- Mark Sloan.

577
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,525
You told him the Chief was stepping
down, that I wanted the job.

578
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,863
I didn't know
that was a secret.

579
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:57,594
He was leaving, Meredith.
He was leaving town.

580
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,773
- Okay, and now he's not?
- No, he's not.

581
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:02,136
You gave him a reason to stay.

582
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:04,605
Derek.

583
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,301
The commitment I'm asking for,
is only a few hours a week.

584
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:10,998
I'm sorry, but I can't deal with
any more distractions right now.

585
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,005
You owe me.

586
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,143
- What?
- When you had that tremor,

587
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,005
you cut me out of surgery.

588
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,812
After surgery made me feel like

589
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:22,074
I was the one who couldn't do her job.

590
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,175
You made me doubt myself.

591
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,272
You owe me this.

592
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:30,713
You need someone
who can provide leadership,

593
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,023
Direction to the project.

594
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,467
I'm not that man.

595
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,177
Not anymore.

596
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,282
That's what you want to believe.

597
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,419
Over the next few months,

598
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:47,950
Jilly's gonna go through a lot--

599
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,340
Radiation, chimo.

600
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,409
It's likely her...

601
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,547
condition will get worse,

602
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,312
a lot worse.

603
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,912
And she's gonna need
a lot of help.

604
00:25:58,063 --> 00:25:59,567
Okay, um...

605
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:04,674
Um, well, can you give me some names
of-- of doctors and medications?

606
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,123
'Cause I wanna be ready.
I wanna...

607
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,271
know everything so I can do this--

608
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,760
Do this right for her.

609
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:10,812
Rachel...

610
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:13,833
You can't...

611
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,853
be everything. It's too hard.

612
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:20,068
Jilly has parents who love her.
They--

613
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:23,626
They love her, and they're here,
and she wants to go home.

614
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,681
- No, she doesn't.
- She called them, not me.

615
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:28,412
Jilly called?

616
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,592
Jilly is dying.

617
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:33,571
But I promised her.

618
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,433
Cradle to grave. She's...

619
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:38,681
Jilly, I love her.

620
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:42,695
It's possible that The very best thing
that you can do for her if you love her,

621
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:44,585
is let her go.

622
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:03,442
- Are you waiting to see the Chief?
- Yes.

623
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:04,724
You ?

624
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:05,704
Yeah.

625
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,207
About?

626
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,331
Uh, oh, you know, just,

627
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:10,669
admin stuff.

628
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,379
Yeah, me, too.

629
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:16,220
- What are you doing here?
- We're waiting to see the chief.

630
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:18,697
- You too?
- Yes, Derek,

631
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:20,448
- both of us.
- You're unbelievable.

632
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,407
I'm unbelievable?
The chief steps down,

633
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,255
And you automatically assume
it's between you and burke?

634
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,966
- You think he's gonna pick you?
- Well, I think the fact

635
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,339
that he hasn't tapped either
one of you, yet means that he...

636
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:30,739
- he has another candidate in mind.
- What?

637
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,311
no one invited me to the party?

638
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:33,939
Chief!

639
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,511
- I have an appointment!
- Chief!

640
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:36,808
- I've been trying...
- I called Patricia.

641
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,477
- I have an appointment.
- No!

642
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:39,552
- I have an appointment.
- I--

643
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:42,311
Stop, stop, stop.
One at the time here.

644
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:44,297
You.

645
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,538
What's all this about?

646
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:47,883
They all wanna be Chief.

647
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,524
And for the record,

648
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:50,517
so do I.

649
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:52,466
<i>Oh, you want to be chief
Just because we want to be.</i>

650
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,076
All right, button it. All of you.

651
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,445
I have had...

652
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,003
A perfect day.

653
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,058
I went to the board this morning
and told them I was retiring,

654
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,493
I saved a life,

655
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,127
and now I'm off to see my wife.

656
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,099
It has been a perfect day

657
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,196
until you four fools
tried to ruin it.

658
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,286
A man can't be happy
he's retiring around here,

659
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,140
Not with you vultures
trying to pick my bones.

660
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,037
Chief...

661
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:18,120
you steppin' down?

662
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:23,278
As soon as they find
a replacement for me,

663
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,788
I'm stepping down
as chief of surgery.

664
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:29,788
But I don't know when that'll be,

665
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,278
cecause at this point,
I don't see any front-runners.

666
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,058
Excuse me.

667
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,678
Chief, that's not true...

668
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:44,991
You didn't think of maybe
tell me this morning ?

669
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,398
That you were planning
to step down,

670
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,364
Instead of sending me
on this wild goose chase?

671
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:49,556
Dr. Bailey,

672
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,343
you need those clowns
To sign off on your proposal

673
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,812
because one of them maybe
Chief of surgery in a month.

674
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,481
It's hard to imagine,

675
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,721
for me more than anyone,

676
00:28:58,722 --> 00:29:00,735
but since you're not ready
for the job...

677
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,687
One of them's gonna have to
Do it for the next few years.

678
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:04,646
Me?

679
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,287
It's you in the chair, eventually.

680
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:07,473
That's who you are.

681
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,153
But you're gonna have to get
a new chair because you're short.

682
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:12,750
You have short legs.

683
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,399
But someday you are gonna be
Chief of surgery.

684
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,408
I wasn't sending you
on a wild goose chase.

685
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:22,207
I was trying to get you in the
habit of doing things without me.

686
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,055
- He's really doing it.
- Mmh.

687
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,696
He's really retiring.

688
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:37,814
One of us could be Chief.

689
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:39,324
No.

690
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,379
One of us could be chief.
You? I don't think so.

691
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,668
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

692
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,365
Oh, I could be Chief.

693
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:47,951
You're delusional.

694
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,475
Mark Sloan, Chief of surgery.

695
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,317
That makes me vomit
a little in my mouth.

696
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:57,164
These are your letters of support,

697
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,716
for my Free Clinic.

698
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,406
- Sign them.
- Why do you want this clinic so badly?

699
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:02,633
You're a surgeon.

700
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:04,495
Because I need something more.

701
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,047
I know you all have your
messy love lives and your,

702
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:09,957
secrets and your silliness,
but I want more.

703
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:13,067
I need something to hold on to.

704
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:16,798
I need a reason to believe that medicine
can do more than stitch you up,

705
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,081
and-- and send you away.

706
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,715
I need to believe that medicine
can not only save lives,

707
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:22,760
but-- But change lives.
I need to...

708
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,321
I need...

709
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:30,785
I need to believe in something
the way I used to believe in you all.

710
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,244
Sign the papers.

711
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:43,443
- Sign the papers.
- You still need funding.

712
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,391
The nazi's back.

713
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:04,791
Hi.

714
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,593
Go home.

715
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,075
Rach...

716
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:14,965
They're your parents,

717
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,834
and you love them,
and they're still here.

718
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:21,131
You know what a big deal it is,
for them to get on a plane.

719
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:23,034
Go home, Jilly.

720
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:24,910
But...

721
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:28,965
- I can't just leave you here.
- Yes, you can.

722
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:32,993
- Rachel--
- You can go back home.

723
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:35,075
And you can put on your bonnet,

724
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,309
and you can get in the buggy,

725
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,744
and go to church, get baptized.

726
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,262
You can die amish.

727
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:43,779
- No, I can't do that.
- Why?

728
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,495
'Cause you'll have to shun me?
Don't worry about me.

729
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,689
I will be living it up here,

730
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:51,992
with your curling iron
and your cable TV,

731
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:54,330
and your entire dvd collection.

732
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:57,095
I'll be okay,
here in the 21st century.

733
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,626
I can't shun you.

734
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:04,882
You can.

735
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:08,247
And you will. And I won't take
no for an answer.

736
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,414
Now, say hello to your parents.

737
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,637
Hi.

738
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:28,338
- Jilly.
- Hi.

739
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:33,841
Jilly.

740
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:35,649
Dad.

741
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:43,967
I will tell your parents
that I saw you,

742
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,008
and you are well and happy,

743
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:49,732
and have grown
into a fine woman.

744
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,276
Richard.

745
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,097
What are you doing here?

746
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,166
These are for you.

747
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,655
Richard,
what are you doing here?

748
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:21,558
I did it, Adele.

749
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,462
I retired.

750
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:26,538
And I gotta tell you,
I didn't Think I wanted to do it,

751
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:28,344
but...

752
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,029
I'm relieved.

753
00:33:31,394 --> 00:33:32,208
I'm happy.

754
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:35,049
But when I told you I didn't have
any more time to wait,

755
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,284
- I meant it.
- I know you did,

756
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,332
- which is why--
- That was months ago.

757
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,166
Months ago, I said,
"you are out of time with me".

758
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:43,118
Adele...

759
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:55,704
is there a man in my house?

760
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,084
I'm so sorry, Richard.

761
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:05,484
But, what did you expect?

762
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:24,748
I'm sorry.

763
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:29,362
Why?

764
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:33,212
I'm angry... What's wrong
with having a lot of sex

765
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:35,129
- if it makes me feel better?
- Do you...

766
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:37,992
feel better?

767
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,865
You know how you felt...

768
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,921
when you were lying
on the bathroom floor?

769
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,899
Maybe you're not supposed
to feel better.

770
00:34:59,803 --> 00:35:00,948
Iz, you can't help me.

771
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:04,749
I know you want to.

772
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:06,680
But you can't.

773
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:11,190
You can't help me.

774
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:13,370
I have to let you go.

775
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:16,672
Yeah.

776
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,555
Just one last thing.

777
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,077
Life is short, George.

778
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:34,870
Life is short,

779
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:37,822
And it sucks a lot of the time.

780
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:43,697
If being with Callie makes you happy,
Then go be with Callie.

781
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,388
Hey,

782
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,657
he gonna be okay?

783
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:09,381
I think so.

784
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:14,076
How's your clinic going?

785
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,297
I got my signatures,

786
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,352
Which is a start.

787
00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:22,876
The Seattle Grace
Free Clinic will exist.

788
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,562
"The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic".

789
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,100
What?

790
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,776
I have $8 million.

791
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:40,093
Izzie Stevens...

792
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,048
You left without me.

793
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,558
Now you're not talking to me.

794
00:36:59,019 --> 00:36:59,998
I was a jerk.

795
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,653
Sometimes, boyfriends can be jerks.

796
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,557
That doesn't mean
you stop talking to them.

797
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:09,998
You get that
I'm saying "I'm sorry",

798
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,281
right?

799
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,977
You yelled at me for no reason,
and then you walked away,

800
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:16,895
and now you show up here.

801
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,026
Of course I showed up.

802
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:20,026
Why wouldn't I?

803
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,232
- You don't trust me?
- I do.

804
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:24,757
Okay, well, this is how it works--
You fight sometimes,

805
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:26,329
and somebody apologizes.

806
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:28,522
Well, how am I
supposed to know that?

807
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:31,802
You've never
done this before.

808
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,684
No, I've never
done this before.

809
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,678
Okay. All right.

810
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,478
Well, this is...

811
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,009
From now on,

812
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:48,216
you can expect

813
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,009
that I'm gonna show up,

814
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:52,547
even if I yell,

815
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:54,574
even if you yell.

816
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,563
I'm always gonna show up.

817
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:01,335
Okay?

818
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,308
Okay.

819
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,699
You are gonna make
an excellent chief.

820
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:20,512
<i>We all think
we're going to be great.</i>

821
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,036
Yeah.

822
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:28,444
</i>And we feel a little bit robbed
when our expectations aren't met.</i>

823
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:29,740
Karev.

824
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:33,313
I've got an ovarian torsion
that needs emergent surgery.

825
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,595
You want in?

826
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:36,865
Yeah.

827
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,768
</i>But sometimes,</i>

828
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:41,844
</i>our expectations sell us short.</i>

829
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:45,223
I was right.

830
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:51,149
I swear, I really believe
what I did was right.

831
00:38:52,514 --> 00:38:54,666
I-I don't want you to forgive me.

832
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,647
Frankly, I'd...

833
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,633
I'd find it patronizing
if you did, because

834
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:04,040
while I know I was right,
you think I'm wrong...

835
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,004
which doesn't matter.

836
00:39:12,252 --> 00:39:13,204
Because...

837
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:17,417
I'm in this.

838
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,803
I'm in this for the long haul,

839
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:26,948
and I'm in this to finish the race.

840
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:30,575
So if that means,
I don't win this one,

841
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:34,506
then fine, I don't win.

842
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:36,879
You win.

843
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:39,499
I'm talking.

844
00:39:41,444 --> 00:39:43,444
See? I'm talking first.
You win.

845
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:47,141
</i>Sometimes the expected,</i>

846
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:50,920
</i>simply pales in comparison
to the unexpected.</i>

847
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:54,449
Marry me.

848
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:01,263
I don't want to waste
another minute.

849
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,042
I can't have sex
with you again, George.

850
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,008
Okay? I can't. I just--
I-- Enough with the sex.

851
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:10,063
Since my dad died,

852
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,428
I feel like, uh...

853
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,035
someone ripped out
my stomach,

854
00:40:14,642 --> 00:40:15,966
filled the hole with asphalt.

855
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:19,152
And I laugh every time
that I remember

856
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:21,911
I'm never gonna
talk to him again,

857
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:24,752
because it just sounds like
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

858
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:27,911
I can't believe it's real.

859
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:30,422
But...

860
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:33,318
every time I look at you...

861
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,435
I feel better.

862
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:39,599
It shocks me.

863
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,165
It knocks my wind out,
but it's true.

864
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:45,503
And I don't have to have sex with you.
I'm happy just to

865
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,296
look at you from across the room.

866
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:50,670
And even that--
Anything, any piece of you...

867
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,366
I mean, hopefully all of you.
That'd be the best thing...

868
00:40:58,387 --> 00:40:59,477
because I love you.

869
00:41:00,111 --> 00:41:00,966
George...

870
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,437
Marry me.

871
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:20,333
Will you marry me?

872
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,285
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

873
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:30,347
</i>You gotta wonder why
we cling to our expectations.</i>

874
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:33,946
</i>Because the expected is...</i>

875
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:36,567
</i>just what keeps us steady,</i>

876
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:38,746
</i>standing,</i>

877
00:41:39,808 --> 00:41:40,621
