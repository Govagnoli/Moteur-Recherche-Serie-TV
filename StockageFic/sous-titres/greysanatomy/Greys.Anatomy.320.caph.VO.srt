1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,484
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,587
I had sex last night,
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:06,094
But the thing is,
it didn't fell wrong.

4
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:07,577
This is our secret, okay?

5
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:08,789
We heard about your mother.

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,329
We're here to make sure
you're okay.

7
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,708
What if my husband shows up
tomorrow with a picture of

8
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,943
what I'm supposed
to look like, but it's too late,

9
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,012
I'm stuck with the wrong
face for rest of my life?

10
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,808
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

11
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,309
- Are you gonna invite me?
- Where?

12
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:22,783
- To the wedding.
- Please leave.

13
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:25,930
<i>A patient history,</i>

14
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:28,240
<i>is as important
as their symptoms.</i>

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,050
<i>It's what helps us decide
if heartburn's a heart attack,</i>

16
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:34,615
<i>if a headache's a tumor.</i>

17
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:40,679
<i>Sometimes patients will try
to rewrite their own histories.</i>

18
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,072
<i>They'll claim they don't smoke</i>

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,606
<i>or forget to mention
certain drugs,</i>

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,873
<i>which, in surgery,</i>

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,859
<i>can be the kiss of death.</i>

22
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,459
<i>We can ignore it all we want...</i>

23
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,659
<i>But our history...</i>

24
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:02,331
<i>eventually always comes back
to haunt us.</i>

25
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:09,184
Meredith, she'll accept
a certain amount of help,

26
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,869
and then she start
to feel suffocated.

27
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,803
Oh. Is this...
Am I suffocating?

28
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:16,500
No. The groceries are just right.

29
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:19,233
It's... It's me.
I sometimes overdo it.

30
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:20,979
Well, who could blame you
with everything?

31
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:22,395
After Ellis died,

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,649
I gave her some time,
but I want to be here.

33
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,291
- I want to help make things easier.
- Good. Yeah. That's great.

34
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,366
I just try to keep it light.
You know, be helpful.

35
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,660
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,435
- Want some coffee?
- Yes.

37
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:35,952
This all you?

38
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,177
I just picked up some things
to restock your fridge.

39
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,755
Well, you bought groceries last week.

40
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:42,018
Yeah, you have to get it
every week if you want more.

41
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,315
Well, thank you.

42
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:48,320
It's unexpected, and you
didn't need to do all this.

43
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,449
- Is this for everybody?
- Absolutely.

44
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,841
I gotta run.
I'm gonna go talk to Richard

45
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,568
before things get too busy
in the hospital.

46
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,822
- See ya.
- Are you gonna talk to him about the...

47
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:58,587
Yeah. Wish me luck.
You don't need it.

48
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:00,193
Just make him listen to you.

49
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,705
You deserve to be chief.

50
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:10,470
Nice sweater.

51
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,038
Uh... my wife.

52
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,290
- What?
- My wife,

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,541
she gave it to me.

54
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:18,874
The sweater.

55
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:21,676
Actually, it's my ex-wife.

56
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,378
- It's amicable.
- I'm sorry?

57
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:27,265
The divorce, it's... it's amicable,

58
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:28,561
very friendly.

59
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,157
I'm a friendly guy.

60
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,543
- "I'm a friendly guy"?
- Sloan.

61
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,730
She pressed five
and got off at three.

62
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,623
She'd rather walk up two flights
of stairs than flirt with you.

63
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,933
Hell, she'd rather climb up
the outside of the building.

64
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:51,093
- I wasn't flirting.
- You're telling me.

65
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,974
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

66
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,476
Time for you
to shake off the rust

67
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,631
and get back in the game.

68
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,260
- You need a wingman.
- I have patients to see.

69
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,132
We'd make a great team.

70
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:09,464
Nothing like a quick
ventricular reconstruction

71
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,797
to jumpstart your morning, eh?

72
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,930
Okay, you're officially
becoming creepy,

73
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,934
creepy and... stalking.

74
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,361
Burke and I have set our date.
We're getting married next month.

75
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,897
We both know that
you are not the marrying kind.

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,903
You don't know that.
You don't know me anymore.

77
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:23,271
Well, just to be sure you're...

78
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,276
fully aware of
what you're passing up.

79
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:26,490
I'd like you to assist me

80
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,016
on my heterotopic
heart transplant today.

81
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,311
What, a piggyback transplant?
Seriously?

82
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:35,024
Burke will want to scrub in,
too, I imagine,

83
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:37,166
see how it's done.

84
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,955
Heterotopic transplant.
He is upping his game.

85
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,498
I need a gambit.

86
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,519
I need to force him
into the defensive.

87
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,615
Take his queen.

88
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,071
- You've never played chess?
- I'm not a geek.

89
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:51,428
I've gotta crush him.

90
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,996
I've gotta annihilate him
at his own game.

91
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,010
So it's weird, right,

92
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,775
that susan keeps stopping by
like this?

93
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,354
I mean, we just became friends
or semi-related

94
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,411
or whatever you call
your estranged father's wife.

95
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:02,645
You may be confused since you
were basically raised by wolves,

96
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:03,966
but this is what mother's do.

97
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,891
They stop by,
they stock the fridge.

98
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,767
Dude, you think
she might do our laundry?

99
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,476
Hey, get your own fake mom.

100
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey.

101
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:14,145
- Bad night on call?
- Oh, god.

102
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,533
Yeah, when my patient's
gooey abscess

103
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,186
exploded all over me
at 4:00 A.M.,

104
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,666
- that was a highlight.
- Holy mary, mother of god...

105
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,589
Pray for us sinners now and at the...

106
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,024
Iz, you look nice.

107
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,873
Did you just come from
confession in a church?

108
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,063
Shut up.

109
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,995
Izzie Stevens does penance.
You did something bad.

110
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:36,591
Oh. I feel like poo.

111
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,659
I hope I can make it through
the day without falling asleep.

112
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,386
Do you want to make a coffee date?

113
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,508
3:00 P.M.
You could use a little pick-me-up.

114
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,429
Yeah. That sounds nice,
really nice.

115
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,997
- Good
- Okay.

116
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,240
Smile.

117
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:57,075
Oh, come on, man.
That's not a smile.

118
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,145
Can I see?

119
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,154
That's me?

120
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,795
Oh, my god.

121
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:05,987
I know this is gonna sound terrible,

122
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,177
but I'm not bad-looking.

123
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,524
I think beautiful
is the word you're looking for.

124
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,184
I was gonna say hot.

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,052
I was too
but I would've gotten in trouble.

126
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,005
- You would've.
- Still a little swelling.

127
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,098
In a day or two,
I'll raise that hot to smokin'.

128
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,369
Then shouldn't we wait
to take the "after" pictures?

129
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,108
We could,
but the sooner we take them,

130
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,235
the sooner we get them
out there.

131
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,903
Your picture's gonna be everywhere.
The police, the news, the internet.

132
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,803
But my face looks
completely different,

133
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,606
then what good
would pictures do?

134
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,737
I was able to maintain
aspects of your bone structure,

135
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,345
so your face bears some
similarities to your old face,

136
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,696
plus, your... your hair
and your eyes are the same.

137
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:39,112
You think... Do you really think
someone might recognize me?

138
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,521
I think you should smile.

139
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,765
I'm telling you,
this confession thing,

140
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:46,389
it... it really works.

141
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,427
It's like we have a do over.
Our sin is gone.

142
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,127
So you don't have to keep avoiding me.

143
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,033
Yeah, I do.
Until this thing blows over, I do.

144
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,733
Javier Ruggero?

145
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,688
Javier, uh, Ruggero?

146
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:00,394
Blows over?

147
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,103
What does that even mean?

148
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,237
When Meredith and I, uh...

149
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,624
eventually, you know,
it blew over. It passed.

150
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,023
You mean the sad sex?

151
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,900
The sad, tragic,
depression-inducing sex

152
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,577
you had with Meredith is the same

153
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,594
- as what...
- I can't.

154
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,518
Okay? Back off.
Just for now, back off.

155
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,755
Javier... Ruggero?

156
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,539
You're Dr. Isobel Stevens?

157
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,003
Yes.

158
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,589
Uh, if you're Mr. Ruggero, though,
you're with Dr. O'Malley.

159
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:26,755
Uh, Dr. Stevens...

160
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:27,929
We, uh...

161
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,717
Our d... Our daughter has leukemia

162
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,830
and needs a bone marrow transplant.

163
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,815
You, uh,
you're looking for hematology.

164
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:36,870
It's third floor west.
Through these double doors,

165
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,618
second set of elevators on the...

166
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,714
on the right.

167
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,501
I'm so sorry
about your daughter.

168
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,116
But Seattle Grace
has one of the best

169
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:48,313
bone marrow transplant centers
in the country.

170
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,059
If you'd like, I can
take you up there myself.

171
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,196
No, no, it's just that...

172
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,942
You look so much like
our daughter.

173
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,753
We're Dustin and Caroline Klein.

174
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,591
We're Hannah's parents.

175
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:01,989
We're her...

176
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,795
We're your daughter's parents.

177
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,061
You're Hannah's birth mother.

178
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,277
Hannah was diagnosed
a few months ago

179
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,704
with acute
myeloid leukemia.

180
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,606
We, uh, we looked you up,

181
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:19,998
and we know that
that's wrong, but...

182
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,188
She needs the transplant.
We... We were set to go.

183
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,331
- We had a donor.
- Yeah, her donor died.

184
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,446
The registry called
Hannah's oncologist last night.

185
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:29,770
'Cause apparently
Hannah hasn't had enough bad luck.

186
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:30,985
And we'd never ask.

187
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:32,750
We had no intention
of bothering you, ever.

188
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,506
But last night,
everything changed.

189
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,409
No. Of course.

190
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:39,921
Of course I'd donate. It's just...

191
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,754
A biological parent
isn't usually a good donor.

192
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,041
I'm only a half match.

193
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,481
Hannah would probably do better

194
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,364
getting back on the donor list
and waiting.

195
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:53,379
I know...

196
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:55,777
When you gave her up,

197
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,671
we promised
to take care of her,

198
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,920
to keep her safe,

199
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,178
but I-I can't protect her
from this.

200
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,029
It's genetic.

201
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,264
You have to take care of her.

202
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,470
Every day we wait,
she gets sicker.

203
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,067
And... And if we're lucky,

204
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,246
you... you could be better
than a half match.

205
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,398
Is she...

206
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,010
She's here?

207
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:25,652
God, she must be scared.

208
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,680
She's upstairs
with my mother.

209
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,246
Can I...

210
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,179
I'd... I'd like to meet her.

211
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:38,499
We... We'd have to check with Hannah.

212
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,532
But if she agrees,

213
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:42,738
of course we'd be okay with it.

214
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:47,673
Isobel...

215
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,055
Our daughter could die.

216
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,928
Charles...
This is Dr. Burke.

217
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,090
I've invited him to assist
on the surgery.

218
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,907
- How do you do, Dr. Burke?
- Oh, you're playing yourself?

219
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,656
It distracts me from the fact
that you're going to have

220
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,703
your hands in my chest
in a few hours.

221
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,646
And this, Charles, is
a former student of mine...

222
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,429
A formidable chess player
herself... Dr. Cristina Yang.

223
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,204
Soon to be Dr. Cristina Burke.

224
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,722
we're getting married next month.

225
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,459
Congratulations.

226
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:20,586
Thank you, sir.

227
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:22,494
Perhaps you'd like to explain...

228
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,095
The procedure, Dr. Yang.

229
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:26,146
Absolutely.

230
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:27,792
Mr. Redford,

231
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,824
instead of replacing
your current heart,

232
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,739
we're going to attach it
to the new heart,

233
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,092
essentially piggybacking it.

234
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,929
The two hearts pump together,
share the workload.

235
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:37,961
It's, uh...

236
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:39,499
It's a perfect team.

237
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,471
More accurately,

238
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,477
the new heart will circulate
blood to the body,

239
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,456
while the native heart
will pump blood to the lungs.

240
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:48,550
More of a divide-and-conquer
approach.

241
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,808
Wouldn't you say, Dr. Yang?

242
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:51,877
Sounds risky?

243
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,999
All surgeries carry
a degree of risk,

244
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,005
but Dr. Marlowe pioneered
the procedure.

245
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,116
And Dr. Burke is one of the foremost
cardiothoracic surgeons

246
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,605
- in the country.
- I'll be the one on point, of course.

247
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,238
So you've nothing to worry about.

248
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:06,262
You've picked the best man
for the job.

249
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,523
What was that?

250
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,599
That was my smug,
passive-aggressive,

251
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,712
limey ex-boyfriend
trying to show me

252
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:15,065
I picked the wrong guy.

253
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,815
I-I know,
and I'm fine with it

254
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,411
as long as I'm learning something.

255
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,129
I was actually talking about you.

256
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,829
What was that?

257
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,690
You're gonna have to put up
with me

258
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,605
being nice and sweet
for a little while.

259
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:27,917
That'll be a nice change of pace.

260
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,563
Shut up.

261
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:30,906
That's more like it.

262
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:33,683
Hey, I saw Ava.

263
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:35,092
She looks terrific.

264
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:37,636
Yeah, yeah, she does.
Sloan kicked it out.

265
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,924
Yeah, well, you had something
to do with that, too.

266
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,154
Just doing my job.

267
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:44,261
Jeez.
You cannot take a compliment.

268
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,275
Well, I just don't want
people thinking...

269
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:49,248
What, you're trying to build
the perfect woman?

270
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,254
Dr. Montgomery,
the police just called.

271
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:54,024
They're on their way over.
They think they found Jane Doe's family.

272
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,533
I'm sure you felt that you need to be
even-handed when you announced

273
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,612
you were looking for someone
to take over as chief.

274
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,439
Give everybody a shot
at the brass ring.

275
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,904
I did.

276
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,196
- Can we drop that ruse soon?
- It's not a ruse.

277
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,657
You promised me the job
when I came here.

278
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,885
- It's why I came here.
- No you came

279
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,158
'cause your marriage fell apart,
you'd to get the hell outta dodge.

280
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:11,814
We had an understanding,
now you're having me

281
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,819
jump through hoops with
other attending in this hospital.

282
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:15,626
And I hear you're giving
Marlowe special privileges

283
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,699
to do a piggyback surgery.

284
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,361
This is a teaching hospital, Derek.

285
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,674
My interview didn't go
as well as I had hoped.

286
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,239
I would like your support
with the board.

287
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,779
You know my credentials.
You know I'm ready.

288
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:29,670
- I only have one vote.
- It's a strong vote.

289
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,144
I'm not feeling well.

290
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:39,008
What's wrong
with that girl?

291
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:52,346
Look, I can't talk to you
when you're making all that noise,

292
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,514
so pull it together
and get out here.

293
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,720
Now.

294
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:12,638
I have an 11-year-old daughter.

295
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,328
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

296
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,178
I'm potentially a good match.

297
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,968
Please don't tell anybody.
Please.

298
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,837
This isn't a chapter
of my history that...

299
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,892
I understand.

300
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,246
She's here...

301
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:37,499
My kid...

302
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,670
And I'm supposed to go
up to pediatrics

303
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,670
and meet her right now,
and...

304
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,654
I mean, I've thought
about this moment...

305
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,532
what I would look like...

306
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,478
What I would say.

307
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,790
But I thought I would be older,

308
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,006
more together, more mature.

309
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,090
I thought she would be older.

310
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,504
And I never thought
that she would be sick.

311
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:12,276
Oh, god.
I don't know what to do.

312
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,694
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

313
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,103
We love our Shannon,

314
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,230
but we never got along
wither husband.

315
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,912
- So she has a husband?
- Had.

316
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,936
One day while she was at work,
he packed up and disappeared.

317
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,872
He didn't want a baby.
But she went after him,

318
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,311
even pregnant like that.

319
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,767
We hadn't heard from her
in months,

320
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:38,503
and then today
we saw her picture on TV.

321
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,862
Mr. and Mrs. Waring, uh,
the woman we found,

322
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,579
- if she is your daughter...
- Well,

323
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,735
her nose is different,
and her chin, but they said that

324
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,675
they said that her face had been,
you know, changed.

325
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,760
Do you happen to know
your daughter's blood type?

326
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,610
She's B-positive.

327
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,672
Any medical conditions,
surgeries we should know about?

328
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,489
Um, she had her tonsils out
when she was 12.

329
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,259
It's her, isn't it?

330
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:02,833
It's Shannon.

331
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,554
Susan.

332
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,122
Meredith, hi.
I'm so glad I found you.

333
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,059
- Twice in one day.
- Is this a bad time?

334
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,365
I know you're always busy, but...

335
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:16,548
Yeah, no, I'm busy.
I'm at work.

336
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,228
Okay, I was, um...

337
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:20,729
You know I'd really
just love to talk with you.

338
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,943
I would love to find a time
for you and me to sit down...

339
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,159
I'm sorry. This is too much.

340
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,417
Way too much.
You keep showing up.

341
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,727
I cannot be your daughter
or your charity case

342
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,480
or the thing that you need to fix.

343
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,522
- I'm not trying to...
- No, no.

344
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,137
Stop talking, okay?

345
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,404
Stop mothering.

346
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:37,850
Just stop.

347
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,297
<i>She is mid-30s,
brunette and 8 months pregnant.</i>

348
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,287
<i>If you recognize her, please...</i>

349
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,238
My glamour shot's
been on the news

350
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,598
at least a dozen times already.

351
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:50,741
Admit it...
You're gonna miss me

352
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,659
when my fancy family
shows up to take me away.

353
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,562
You don't know they're fancy.
Open up.

354
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:56,523
Why, what's wrong
with my throat?

355
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,260
How would I know?
I haven't even seen it yet.

356
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,194
- Now open up.
- No, not till you tell me...

357
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:02,752
Wait.

358
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,860
Someone has recognized me,
haven't they?

359
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,135
Alex... Alex, you have
to tell me who it is please.

360
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,241
Their daughter's blood type
is B-positive.

361
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:13,886
She's your age.
She's pregnant.

362
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,435
Your height, your hair color,

363
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,153
and she has no tonsils.

364
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:19,120
So now are you gonna open up?

365
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,902
Yes. Please tell me
I have no tonsils.

366
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,104
- Say ah.
- Ah.

367
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,791
No tonsils.

368
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,787
Shannon?

369
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,590
Mr. and Mrs. Waring,
I asked you to wait.

370
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,384
- I have tests to complete...
- Alex...

371
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,347
It's okay.

372
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:36,151
Your name...

373
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:39,786
Is Shannon Marie.

374
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,319
Marie was my mother's name...

375
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:44,449
Your grandmother.

376
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,961
Shannon Marie.

377
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:56,107
Okay, discharge
beds one and three.

378
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,375
Two needs a social worker.

379
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:58,802
Hold this down for me,
O'Malley.

380
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:00,642
- I'm gonna be out for a while.
- Why?

381
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,785
- What's going on with Iz?
- What's going on with Stevens

382
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,128
is none of your concern.

383
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,051
What is your concern?
Sick people...

384
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,624
All these sick people...
until I get back. Understand?

385
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,509
Dr. Bailey, just did
a consult in trauma one.

386
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,841
The guy has a perf.
Can I scrub in?

387
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,352
No, you cannot scrub in.

388
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,155
Uh, you're here
with O'Malley for now.

389
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:23,869
Hey, what's wrong with Izzie?

390
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,847
Beds 7 through 13.
Start with number 8.

391
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,425
He doesn't have
much bladder control.

392
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:31,083
First, Mr. Redford,

393
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:33,280
while Dr. Marlowe is
preparing the surgical area,

394
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:34,998
I will be examing
the donor heart.

395
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:36,258
Actually, I'm sorry.

396
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,695
I'll examine the donor heart.

397
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,765
I want to be sure
the I.V.C. Orifice is oversewn.

398
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,345
Well, carry on.

399
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,903
Then I'llopen your chest
and put you on bypass,

400
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,477
at which point we will
connect the left atrium

401
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,956
- then the right atrium...
- Superior vena cava.

402
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:56,604
It simplifies the subsequent
cardiac biopsies.

403
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,392
You didn't read my article
in the...

404
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:00,627
"cardiothoracic monthly" last year.

405
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:02,253
Did you? Huh?

406
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,178
Well, I think Cristina
has a copy of it.

407
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:06,159
- Cristina, may i?
- Oh, of course.

408
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,964
Oh, what on earth is that?

409
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,246
Oh, testing colors.

410
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:16,928
For the big day, I assume?

411
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,359
I'm thinking, um...

412
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,200
coral.

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,348
Chief, come here.
I want to show you something.

414
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,550
I'm busy, Sloan.

415
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,818
I need an update on my patient
in room 3129.

416
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,086
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

417
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:29,880
Okay. I have that right here.

418
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,736
I like those sneakers.
You a runner?

419
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:36,208
Yeah.

420
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,353
Me, too.

421
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:38,912
Maybe we should
go running some time.

422
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,607
Sure.

423
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,149
Anything else I can
help you with, Dr. Sloan?

424
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:47,111
No. All good.

425
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,526
Wingman.

426
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,080
Wingman.

427
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,168
Hannah is in there right now?

428
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,304
She is.

429
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:08,427
You see her,
you'll know what to do.

430
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,805
Must be nice to know
she has parents like this,

431
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,913
who fight for her,

432
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:15,390
think about what she wants,

433
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,390
try to make her happy
like you would've.

434
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:23,984
Doesn't mean you don't want
that girl to want you.

435
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,129
I'm...

436
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,062
She's so, so tired.

437
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,829
We left it up to Hannah,
and, uh, she's just not ready.

438
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,632
- I'm sorry.
- We don't want to force it.

439
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,443
Maybe another time?
When she's feeling better.

440
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:49,456
No, of course.

441
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:50,972
I understand.

442
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:55,056
I'm sorry,
but... the transplant?

443
00:18:58,674 --> 00:18:59,679
Stevens.

444
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,672
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

445
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,715
Your girl...

446
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,006
You can want her
to want you all day long,

447
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,180
but she has to be here

448
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,964
if she's ever gonna have
that chance again.

449
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:16,439
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:18,964
Of course. Yeah.
I'm ready. Let's get started.

451
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,435
Hey, guess what.
I'm a teacher.

452
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,556
I teach second grade
at north bend elementary.

453
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,190
- Oh
- Or at least I did until...

454
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,230
You can get your job back
whenever you want.

455
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,944
They love you there. When will
we be able to take her home?

456
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,049
You want to take her
back to...

457
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,152
North bend.
We've got a room all setup for her.

458
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,276
Your mom's got all of your books
and your letters and diaries.

459
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:45,020
- I kept diaries?
- About 800 of them.

460
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,206
So even if you don't
remember everything now,

461
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,623
you will.

462
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:51,523
Hear that?

463
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,409
I can go, right?

464
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,260
Well, you're still getting
I.V. antibiotics,

465
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,473
and we're monitoring the baby
very closely right now.

466
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,396
Yeah, but you can
make it happen, right?

467
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:03,961
Come on, Alex. Don't doctor me.
Help me get outta here.

468
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:06,655
Dr. Montgomery's got you
on strict bed rest until your delivery.

469
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,723
But I'll ask. Maybe...
Maybe you can do it from home.

470
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,995
Home. Wouah.

471
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:18,782
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,693
- You okay? You look...
- Horrible. I'm in a horrible mood.

473
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:22,740
I yelled at Susan.

474
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,182
I think I scared off
my fake mommy forever.

475
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,323
Mm. Need cheering up?

476
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:28,712
No.

477
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,910
Me either.
It's gonna be ok.

478
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,881
- You think?
- Yeah, Susan will be okay.

479
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,129
How'd it go with the chief?

480
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:43,687
Uh, about as well
as you and Susan.

481
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:45,068
Wow. We make a good team.

482
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:51,784
I've been waiting for you

483
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,713
in really-old-guy's room
for 20 minutes. What gives?

484
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,740
Sorry. We decided
to eat down here today.

485
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,420
- Nobody told me.
- Anybody...

486
00:20:58,547 --> 00:20:59,552
Move.

487
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,374
Anybody know
what's going on with Izzie?

488
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,393
Something's going on.

489
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,264
Why don't you
just ask her yourself?

490
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,184
Fine. I would if I knew
where she was.

491
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:08,503
I brought you lunch.

492
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,274
You've got stuff
on your hands.

493
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,278
I'm trying to scare away
cardio god.

494
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,498
With pretty, pretty fingers?

495
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,311
He takes my rook,
I take his bishop.

496
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,695
Hey, pouty head.

497
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,926
Oh, are you so sad 'cause no-face
girl's family is taking her home?

498
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,160
- Really? Someone claimed Ava?
- Yeah, her parents.

499
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,452
- She must be so relieved.
- Yeah, unless they suck.

500
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:31,091
Can you imagine, you can't remember
a family and they show up,

501
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,232
and it turns out
they're psycho killers?

502
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,409
Or over sharers.

503
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,818
Whatever. She's a patient.

504
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,128
I don't give a crap who her
parents are, where she goes.

505
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,283
Can we move on?

506
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:41,302
One second.

507
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,249
What's up with Izzie?

508
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:46,530
- I told you, it's none of your concern.
- No, it is my concern.

509
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:47,582
I demand to know.

510
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,729
I hope I didn't just hear you
say youdemand.

511
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:53,273
Well, are you her father?
Are you her husband?

512
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,475
Then stay here and keep
your mind on your job.

513
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:57,508
You hear me?

514
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,440
Grey.

515
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,594
Uh, look, I need to be upstairs,
so...

516
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,392
do not let this
out of your sight.

517
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:09,504
Walk this to the lab,
watch the lab run the test,

518
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:12,425
bring the test results
directly to me, nobody else.

519
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,476
It's Izzie.
What's the matter?

520
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:20,490
You will be discreet and not ask
a bunch of questions.

521
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,452
Now this is a private matter.
She needs these results now.

522
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,058
Okay.

523
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:37,492
Wow.
That's a big needle.

524
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,416
It's standard.
You should start to feel

525
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:42,397
numb about ten minutes after
I inject the lidocaine, okay?

526
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah. No, I know.
I've given epidurals before.

527
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,465
I know that's the needle.

528
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,358
It's just that somehow
it seems so much bigger

529
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,742
now that it's going into my spine.

530
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,505
- Little stick.
- Oh, my god.

531
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,852
You sure I can't call someone?
One of your friends?

532
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,731
You're gonna need somebody
to hold your hand.

533
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,774
No. Thank you.

534
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,276
Look, you sure?

535
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,028
Yeah, well, I can take
a lot of pressure,

536
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,357
just...
It's rough as sandpaper.

537
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,115
A little pressure.

538
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:21,941
Tell me where she is.

539
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,603
I can't. If she wanted you to know...

540
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,711
She does. She just...

541
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,739
We're just having
one of our stupid fights.

542
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:30,905
You know how wrong it is
if she's really in trouble

543
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,783
and I'm not there
because we're being idiots?

544
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,619
Come on.

545
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,295
Meredith, please.

546
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,100
She's upstairs in procedure room "A."

547
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,864
- That's all I know.
- Thank you.

548
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,175
So...

549
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,372
Dr. Montgomery says
you can take your daughter home.

550
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,539
But she wants to talk to
her local O.B.-G.Y.N.

551
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:55,982
There are some things
she wants to go over

552
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,882
- before we release her.
- I can't.

553
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:01,806
Okay. Well, I can go through
all this with your husband if...

554
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,505
No, you don't understand.

555
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:06,071
I can't take her home.

556
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:10,871
That girl is not my daughter.

557
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,402
She does look
an awful lot like shannon.

558
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:22,048
Sometimes
she even sounds like her.

559
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:26,219
You know, with the surgery
and, uh, the loss of memories...

560
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:29,019
A mother knows her own child,
Dr. Karev.

561
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,681
And that is not my child.

562
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:33,138
- But your husband, he's...
- Look,

563
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:35,572
if that's not Shannon,
we still don't know

564
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,694
where our girl is.
Do you understand?

565
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,807
He needs it to be her.

566
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,529
How am I supposed to tell him?

567
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,031
How do I tell either of them?

568
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:48,064
- Mrs. Waring...
- Dr. Karev...

569
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:52,298
Would you ask my husband
to meet me in the lobby?

570
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:54,343
- You need to face her.
- Please...

571
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:56,118
Tell her I'm sorry.

572
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,818
Things have changed.

573
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,659
No, no. Nothing has changed.

574
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:05,029
I deserve your support, Richard.

575
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,011
Tell me I have it. That I didn't move
to Seattle for nothing.

576
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,014
You moved to seattle to start
a new life,

577
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:11,039
and you did.

578
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:12,983
You have a fantastic woman

579
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:14,550
- who love you.
- It's not bout my personal life.

580
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,031
- But my career.
- You know what being chief

581
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,055
will do to your life?

582
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,468
Why the hell do you think
I'm getting a divorce

583
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,702
or dyeing my hair?

584
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:24,970
You can't do it all,
not if you want to be chief.

585
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,566
- You couldn't do it all.
- Neither can you.

586
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,010
Don't put your mistake on me.

587
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,931
Don't. I am the best candidate
for this job.

588
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:32,167
You know it and I know it
and that is the only factor

589
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:33,678
you need to take
into consideration.

590
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,828
I don't need your protection,
Richard and I don't want it.

591
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,519
I'm not trying
to protect you, Derek.

592
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,880
I told Ellis...

593
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,018
I promised her that I would
look after her daughter.

594
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:58,215
O'Malley,
did Stevens ask for you here?

595
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,652
No! No, I did not.

596
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:01,950
- Then you need to turn yourself...
- You're giving bone marrow?

597
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,921
- This is a private matter.
- I'm not leaving.

598
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,791
- George.
- No.

599
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:08,836
Make me.

600
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,507
Sorry, I'm starting now.

601
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,051
Just let me know when you're
gonna do stuff, okay?

602
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,230
You're okay.

603
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,065
I got it here.

604
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:28,183
Fine. Stevens, I'm going.

605
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,818
Unless you need me
to call security.

606
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,715
I'll manage.

607
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:35,561
Thank you.

608
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:43,897
You said back off.

609
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,680
You didn't tell me you were having
a hole drilled in your damn hip.

610
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,945
For who?

611
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,245
What's this private matter?

612
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:58,612
Okay,
I'm going in when you're ready.

613
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,044
Yeah?

614
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:11,693
Hey, Callie.

615
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,632
So if you could
just take these two,

616
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,241
- then that'll free me up...
- Oh, no.

617
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,705
I'm not here to work. I'm...

618
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:19,365
I'm, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

619
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,625
I haven't slept in like 2 days,

620
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,938
and,
I'm actually looking for George.

621
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,478
We're supposed to meet up
for coffee.

622
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:27,197
- So...
- He's, uh, with Izzie, I think.

623
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:28,465
So if you're not here to work,

624
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:30,305
I'm st gonna take these back.
Thanks.

625
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,349
15-blade.

626
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,261
Suction, please.

627
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,933
Dr. Burke, you're not using

628
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,985
the superior-transseptal approach
for the atriotomy, are you?

629
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,183
Is that a problem?

630
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,019
Not at all unless your intention
is to kill the patient.

631
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:54,273
Dr. Marlowe, from what I've read--

632
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,642
Reading about a procedure is one thing

633
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:57,308
and performg it,
is quite another.

634
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:58,325
It was my mistake.

635
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,143
I should never have allowed
you to scrub in.

636
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,875
I think it best
from this point on

637
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,208
that you simply observe.

638
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:11,399
Suction, please.

639
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:15,220
Hurry up.

640
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,219
You should use the wheelchair.

641
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,604
- You're gonna be sore.
- I'm aware.

642
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:25,045
I'm fine now. Thank you.

643
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,371
Uh, you mean pantless but fine?

644
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:29,911
Crap.

645
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,490
Stand.

646
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:02,730
- I got it.
- Okay. Okay.

647
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,764
Hannah...

648
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,027
An 11-year-old girl.

649
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,839
That's the private matter.
She's mine.

650
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:24,077
Don't...

651
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:26,509
Don't look at me.

652
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,621
My mother wanted me
to keep her.

653
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,414
But I knew... even at 16...

654
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:40,555
I knew that baby
deserved better

655
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:44,163
than life...
at a Chehalis trailer park.

656
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,693
And now she's here and...

657
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:52,330
And she might be dying and
she doesn't want to meet me.

658
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:58,799
Oh, crap.

659
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:05,748
I didn't think I really cared
until she said no.

660
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:09,988
How about that?

661
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,987
I can say hail marys until...

662
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,703
Until I turn into mary,
but I still miss you.

663
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:30,920
Not the...

664
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,632
the sex.

665
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,743
It was not tragic,
George.

666
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:41,531
But I'll live without it.

667
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,876
I won't make it
if you can't be my friend.

668
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,726
If we can't...

669
00:30:58,616 --> 00:30:59,762
What you did today...

670
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,093
You should be proud.

671
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:08,660
I'll get an orderly
to take you downstairs.

672
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:10,191
But I have to go.

673
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:15,433
You understand?

674
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:49,004
Some surgery.

675
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,607
- And Colin was...
- Brillant.

676
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:56,181
He's a gifted surgeon.

677
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,889
Listen, I had a question.

678
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:06,203
When you moved the atrium
to the vena cava,

679
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:09,471
why did you switch
from 3-0 to 5-0 sutures?

680
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,072
You want to use
the finest sutures you can

681
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,400
for vascular structures.

682
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:17,269
A delicate tissue
demands a delicate touch.

683
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:19,828
Right.

684
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:21,565
That makes sense.

685
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:23,049
Thank you.

686
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:24,748
Of course.

687
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:27,958
- I'll see you at home?
- Yeah.

688
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,653
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

689
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,944
We've been playing
our little game all day long.

690
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,307
But what I just saw...

691
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:47,711
that was real.

692
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,580
The question you asked him
about the sutures,

693
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:51,758
that was from my paper
the paper you helped me write.

694
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,191
You already knew the answer.

695
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,804
The Cristina Yang I knew...

696
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,948
was concerned with excellence.

697
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,818
She would never play the part
of the helpless girl

698
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,771
trying to build up
a grown man's ego.

699
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,577
- What has become of you?
- I have learned that sometimes

700
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,367
you have to think about
other people.

701
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:12,571
You've compromised yourself.

702
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:13,651
No.

703
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,718
I'm going home.
You're right.

704
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,755
It's senseless,
coming here,

705
00:33:18,774 --> 00:33:20,401
chasing after a job
that was beneath me

706
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:22,126
just so I could be near
a woman who...

707
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,711
a woman who apparently
no longer exists.

708
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,082
Best of luck...
With the wedding.

709
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:48,435
No, there they are.

710
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:53,121
- Come on.
- I can't. I-I can't.

711
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,276
You look. Please.
You look for me.

712
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay.

713
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:02,985
she's getting the infusion.
You did it.

714
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:04,779
Is she, um...

715
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:07,057
How does she look?

716
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:09,386
You can...
You can see for yourself.

717
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,217
It's okay.
She can't see us from here.

718
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:20,496
She's got your eyes...

719
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,693
And your mouth.

720
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,282
That means she probably
talks a lot and eats a lot then.

721
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,121
If she's in pain,
she's not letting on.

722
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:39,702
Man, she's tough.

723
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:02,926
That's her, George.
That's Hannah.

724
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,230
She's beautiful, don't you think?

725
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:11,709
She's really... beautiful.

726
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,786
Yeah, she's a heartbreaker.

727
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:27,898
Need some help with that?

728
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:29,917
I know you didn't
just wander in here

729
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:31,401
to help me change
pillowcases.

730
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,501
You warned me
she could become a problem.

731
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:35,618
Who, Meredith?

732
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,922
You know, you love somebody,
you think you can handle it all.

733
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,584
You've done all right.
Both of you.

734
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:43,180
I came out here to be chief,

735
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,777
and Meredith complicates that.

736
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,045
Well, if this turns
into an either/or,

737
00:35:49,496 --> 00:35:50,942
you pick the person you love,

738
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:52,146
end of story.

739
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:56,213
Look, all of this means nothing
if you're alone.

740
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:09,015
Oh, crap!

741
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:11,627
Our coffee.
I'm... I'm sorry.

742
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,517
I've... I forgot.
I got...

743
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:16,552
- I got so busy...
- Oh, yeah? With what?

744
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:18,626
Oh, j... the clinic,

745
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,720
patients and...
Well, you know how it is.

746
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,199
Oh, man.

747
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,333
Yeah, I know how it is, so...

748
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:31,921
I'm really tired.
I'm really, really tired.

749
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,573
So I'll just...
I'll see you at home.

750
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,069
Solitaire.

751
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:44,679
My dad taught me.
That sounds so weird.

752
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:46,227
"My dad."

753
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,291
Good weird, though.

754
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:51,024
So you and the redhead
gonna let me go home?

755
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,644
Or were you too busy making eyes
at each other to even ask?

756
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,009
What?

757
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,116
- Ava...
- No.

758
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:00,759
It's Shannon.

759
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:03,368
- Listen...
- My name is Shannon.

760
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:04,735
Shannon Marie.

761
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,098
I'm sorry.

762
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,966
Those are supposed to be
my people.

763
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:19,045
I belong with them, Alex.

764
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:21,253
I'm supposed to go with them.

765
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:23,155
Your people, we... we don't
even know who they are yet.

766
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,712
You don't want to find them.

767
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,544
You want to keep me
all to yourself.

768
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:27,634
Well, here I am,

769
00:37:27,986 --> 00:37:30,584
your pathetic
captive audience.

770
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:33,420
Isn't it sad that I'm
the best you can do?

771
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,156
- Ava...
- My name is not Ava!

772
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,307
You made it up!
It's not me!

773
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:40,076
Get out!

774
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:41,419
Get out!

775
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,927
<i>Some people believe
that without history,</i>

776
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,285
<i>our lives amount to nothing.</i>

777
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,353
Sloan, you brought me to a bar.

778
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,497
- You know I don't drink.
- Which is perfect.

779
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,568
Better to keep your mind sharp.
Let the ladies do the drinking.

780
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,769
You think if you get me laid,

781
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,450
I might make you chief.

782
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,331
<i>At some point,
we all have to choose.</i>

783
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,678
<i>Do we fall back on what we know?</i>

784
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,355
I hear Dr. Marlowe is going home.

785
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,167
About time.

786
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:23,070
The fingernails,
the hand holding,

787
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,432
well played.

788
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,846
Now you can get back
to being Cristina.

789
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:32,195
<i>Or do we step forward
to something new?</i>

790
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:41,305
<i>It's hard not to be haunted
by our past.</i>

791
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,234
<i>Our history is what shapes us,</i>

792
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,548
<i>what guides us.</i>

793
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:11,914
Seriously?

794
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,639
Okay.
That stops right now.

795
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:17,917
It's just, I'm... I'm waiting
for Derek, and I'm very tired.

796
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,544
I don't care. Let me in.

797
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,363
- Excuse me?
- It's freezing out here,

798
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,983
and I have been working
myself up to saying this,

799
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:25,482
well, for a while now,

800
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,660
so I need you
to let me in now, please.

801
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,073
It's my fault your father
didn't fight harder for you.

802
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,538
I knew about you.

803
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,656
I could've pushed him to be
a part of your life.

804
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,332
I should've pushed him.
You were a child.

805
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:46,900
We were the adults.

806
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:50,720
But we were just married,
and it was new and...

807
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:52,729
That's what I cared about.

808
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:55,296
And I know the groceries
and everything

809
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,427
are a little much,
but that's just what I do.

810
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:00,752
I mean, quit looking at me
like I'm crazy 'cause that's not fair.

811
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,921
I'm just trying to find a way
to be there for you

812
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,498
the only way that I know how,

813
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,547
and if you can't accept that,
fine.

814
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,158
But just stop being so rude.

815
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:11,754
And I...

816
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:14,833
Okay.

817
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:17,509
I'm overstepping again,
aren't I?

818
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,624
As mothers go,

819
00:40:20,638 --> 00:40:22,629
I've only ever known
overbearing,

820
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,366
never overprotective.

821
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,164
This is all new.

822
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,489
- It's okay.
- It is?

823
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:31,868
Yes.

824
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:36,121
<i>Our history resurfaces
time after time after time.</i>

825
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:39,479
Not just surgery,
but chief of surgery.

826
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,203
Really?

827
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,907
Oh, well, not for much longer,
really.

828
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,291
I'm gonna go...

829
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,586
Over there.
Hold down the fort, chief.

830
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,077
So, um, you come here often?

831
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,959
Oh, sometimes. It's on my way
home from bio class.

832
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:05,345
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

833
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,491
No.

834
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:09,961
Um, it was, uh,
it was nice talking to you.

835
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:11,026
You, too.

836
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:15,962
The last time I tried
to pick up a woman,

837
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:18,132
I had a harvey wallbanger
in one hand

838
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,887
and an afro pick in the other.

839
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,492
Oh, Richard.

840
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,877
Well, you think about it.
I mean, when you're married,

841
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,532
you'd like to think
you still have game.

842
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:28,795
Practice on me.

843
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:30,590
I'm sorry?

844
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,242
Mark's right. I mean,

845
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:33,792
he's wrong about
so many things,

846
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,501
but he is right about this.

847
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,444
You need to get back out there.
So...

848
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,378
practice.

849
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,427
Addison,
I wouldn't know where to start.

850
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:42,528
Ask me to dance.

851
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:45,997
Well, there's...
There's no dance floor.

852
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,119
So? Ask me anyway.

853
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,099
<i>So we have to remember...</i>

854
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,007
<i>Sometimes the most important history</i>

855
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:02,872
<i>is the history
we're making today.</i>
