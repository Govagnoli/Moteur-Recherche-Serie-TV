1
00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:01,775
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,408
I was dead. Now I'm not.

3
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:05,070
Anybody come looking for me yet?

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,769
No hits from missing persons, plus--

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,967
My face is hard to identify.

6
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,826
Anyone know who
the new chief candidate is?

7
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:12,460
- Colin Marlowe.
- The one and only.

8
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:13,615
- He...
- Yes.

9
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:14,876
- With...
- Yes.

10
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,887
Your best friend violently disses
our marriage every chance she gets...

11
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:19,220
She has feelings for you!

12
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:20,864
Is she crazy?

13
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:35,266
<i>Surgeons always have a plan...</i>

14
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:39,849
<i>Where to cut, where to clamp,</i>

15
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:41,785
<i>where to stitch.</i>

16
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,583
<i>But even with the best plans...</i>

17
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,984
<i>Complications can arise,</i>

18
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:49,956
<i>things can go wrong...</i>

19
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:55,301
<i>And suddenly you're caught
with your pants down.</i>

20
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:58,954
Wow. You and George
were really going at it last night.

21
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:01,500
- What?
- Oh, the laughing,

22
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,097
the drinking, the music--

23
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,219
Okay, you know what?
Nobody, meaning me,

24
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:07,741
needs to hear
George's rendition of "Sexy Back"

25
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:08,938
at 3:00 in the morning.

26
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:10,873
Yeah.

27
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,882
You shoulda-- You shoulda just,
you know, said something or-- or...

28
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:15,642
Banged on the wall.

29
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,355
It's like living in a youth hostel.

30
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,399
Well, the important thing is,
is that she and George made up.

31
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,690
You did, right?

32
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:23,258
I need to use your bathroom.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
- Why?
- Because O'Malley is puking in mine.

34
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,760
- Okay, youth hostel.
- George is still here?

35
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:29,361
Yes.

36
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:32,892
Yes, but only because he was
too drunk to drive home.

37
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,728
You know, just totally impaired,

38
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,888
like no-heavy-machinery drunk.

39
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,432
What's her problem?

40
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:40,775
Still drunk.

41
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:42,968
What's she doing here?

42
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,067
She's afraid she's ruining
her engagement to Burke,

43
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,147
so she's hiding from him.

44
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,913
Not anymore. I have a plan.

45
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:50,551
Burke doesn't want me
to marry him just to appease him--

46
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,138
- Which you are--
- So...

47
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,487
we don't get married.

48
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:55,670
Simple.

49
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,956
We go back to the way it was.

50
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,646
"Be kind. Rewind."

51
00:01:58,853 --> 00:01:59,886
My plan has a name.

52
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:01,078
I gotta go.

53
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:02,949
Gotta get to work.

54
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,179
I'll see you guys there.

55
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,400
Is that George?

56
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,071
You said he was upstairs puking.

57
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,212
So now he's downstairs puking.

58
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,406
What the hell happened last night?

59
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,378
Callie is gonna kill me.

60
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,727
Did I at least call her before
I passed out?

61
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,541
You don't...

62
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,245
You don't remember?

63
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,348
I remember the bourbon...

64
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:35,884
And, uh...

65
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:37,970
I don't...

66
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:40,448
Where did you sleep?

67
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:45,108
- Big day.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,924
What time's your interview
with the board?

69
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:47,990
3:00.

70
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,707
Well, if you have any questions,
please--

71
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,981
Yes, thank you.
I think I have everything well in hand.

72
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,569
That's a big folder.

73
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:56,973
It's, uh, it's nothing.

74
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,301
It's, uh, just a few ideas
I have for Seattle Grace.

75
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:00,982
A 10-year plan,

76
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:03,134
which, uh, really is just a few...

77
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:04,787
tweaks.

78
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,665
What did, uh, Einstein say?

79
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:07,820
"Newton did the work,

80
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,444
"I'm merely standing on his shoulders."

81
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,261
And in this scenario, I'm Newton.

82
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,663
- Hey.
- Hey.

83
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,309
- You look nice.
- I look insane.

84
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,867
I'm-- I'm wearing pearls.

85
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,018
- Listen--
- Listen, about, uh, last night--

86
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,103
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I had--

87
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,150
we're gonna have to put a pin in that
for now, because as of this moment,

88
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:34,701
You and I are the perfect couple. Okay?

89
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,452
We are the perfect,
happily married couple who are perfect

90
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:38,748
and-- And never fight,

91
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,034
because, uh,

92
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,499
because my dad's in town.

93
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,177
- What?
- Yeah.

94
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,032
My dad is in town, and, uh,

95
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,522
he wants to meet my husband.

96
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:51,484
Oh, hey.

97
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,118
The O'Malleys.

98
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,223
Carry on. Do your stuff, your...

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,213
married stuff.

100
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:00,490
Yay!

101
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,093
You told her about our fight?

102
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,848
Just when exactly is he coming?

103
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,623
Today. Lunch. Cafeteria.

104
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,749
You know what,
I think I'm gonna change it to Joe's

105
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,074
so he might not be able to tell
that stink's coming from you.

106
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:15,786
No, it's-- It's okay.

107
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,335
It's gonna be okay.

108
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,405
Uh, I'm good with parents.

109
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,635
Parents love me.

110
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,623
Funny, funny, funny little man.

111
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,838
Funny little smelly little man.
Get in the shower, OK?

112
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,486
- It's gonna be OK.
- Get in the shower.

113
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,445
I know. You'll see.
He's gonna love me.

114
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,149
Oh! No.

115
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:36,978
What's this?

116
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,630
We bring each other coffee.
This is what we do.

117
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,355
No, it's what we used to do,

118
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,502
before you moved in.
We started making coffee at home.

119
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:47,943
You know, I'm not really interested
in going back to the way it used to be.

120
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,328
So unless you have something else
to say to me...

121
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:54,142
I've already had my coffee.

122
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:08,143
Good morning, Doctors.

123
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,194
Good morning.

124
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:10,544
Big day today, huh?

125
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,652
Good luck to all and sundry, hey?

126
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,827
He has a 10-year plan.

127
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,946
- What?
- He's presenting the board

128
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,822
with a 10-year plan
for the surgical wing.

129
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,072
He's only been here a day.

130
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:26,264
Did you see that folder?

131
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,579
It's full of plans,

132
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,276
"tweaks" for my hospital...

133
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,945
This is our computer-generated

134
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:39,556
approximation
of your original facial structure

135
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,091
based on the 3-D C.T. scans we did.

136
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,108
It's what you could look like after

137
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,809
reconstructive surgery.

138
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,754
Or you could look like this.

139
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:50,026
Or this.

140
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,670
You don't like them?

141
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,162
No, it's not that. It's...

142
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,790
How does this work exactly?

143
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:09,261
He'll make an incision
along your hairline, and then...

144
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,788
It's okay. I can take it.

145
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:16,173
He'll literally pull your face off.

146
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,966
It sounds a lot worse than it is.

147
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,154
Your face is extremely elastic,

148
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,602
and pulling it down allows me
to repair the bone fractures

149
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:26,647
underneath without
causing any scaring.

150
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,993
And once you've healed, no one
will ever know you had the surgery.

151
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:32,669
I'm that good.

152
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,225
He is. It's annoying.

153
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,995
The surgery won't affect my baby?

154
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:40,034
I'll be monitoring the baby throughout.

155
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:46,346
So...

156
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,590
Then I-I just have to pick one?

157
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,764
Do I have to pick one now?

158
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,479
Um, take a couple hours
and think about it.

159
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,108
Couple hours... yeah.

160
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,678
- Dr. Bailey.
- Chief,

161
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,612
our Jane Doe is getting
a new face today.

162
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,049
Well, that's exciting.

163
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,493
How are you doing, Meredith?

164
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:15,293
You didn't take
too much time off after--

165
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,131
I'm fine. Really, sir. I, uh,

166
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,914
I think working is
the best thing I can do.

167
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,427
Like mother, like daughter?

168
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,075
Dr. Grey, what can you tell me

169
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,785
about reconstructing
the orbital floor?

170
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:28,156
Uh, you can create
a new base for the eye socket

171
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,167
by harvesting bone from the skull.

172
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:32,525
Dr. Bailey,
Dr. Grey will be scrubbing in

173
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:34,073
on the Jane Doe surgery. Come on.

174
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,241
I'll show you how to do it
without breaking the bone graft

175
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:37,632
into a million pieces.

176
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,013
Congratulations, Dr. Grey.

177
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,215
Okay, let's go, people.

178
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:48,395
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I need to talk to you.

179
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,400
Why?

180
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,411
To prepare you guys
for what you're about to see.

181
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,451
You meant--

182
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:55,042
You meant "you" like "us",
not like "me".

183
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:57,297
You don't want to talk to me,
you want to talk to us

184
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,489
about a p-- About a patient.

185
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,019
That's what I just said.

186
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,197
Uh, this patient has a disease so rare

187
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,758
that you'll probably
never see it again--

188
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,146
- F.O.P.
- Oh, uh, fibrodysplasia

189
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,507
ossificans progressiva?

190
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:10,660
Yeah. It's a congenital disease

191
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,034
which turns muscle into bone.
You become a human statue.

192
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,547
So just, uh, try to learn.

193
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,302
Try not to stare, okay?

194
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,880
If you people are interns,
you need to stand back.

195
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,730
Nina, please don't be rude.

196
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,401
My mother still has movement in her...

197
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,567
face and hands. I would like to keep it
that way, so please be careful...

198
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,963
If you press too hard during an exam
or bump into her accidentally,

199
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,352
it causes a bone to grow
where a bone shouldn't grow.

200
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,963
So there can be no accidents.

201
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,093
Remember that
when you're dealing with her today...

202
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:42,183
It's just a stomach virus or a flu.

203
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,670
I'm sure it's nothing.
Nina insisted

204
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,399
- that I come in.
- She was vomiting blood

205
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,661
and going through her pain meds
like they were candy.

206
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,093
And she has new growths on her back,

207
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,799
no doubt caused
by some clumsy interns

208
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:53,982
on her last hospital stay.

209
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,005
Well, obviously you're having
a flare-up of the F.O.P.,

210
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:58,666
but what really concerns me
is the vomiting.

211
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,996
So I'm gonna need a C.T.,
see what's going on.

212
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,444
Wow. Did you build that?

213
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,707
- My mom did.
- No, Nina did it.

214
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,129
I used to do, I-I'm not able to.

215
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,134
It keeps her active.

216
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:12,205
When she's active,
she has fewer flare-ups.

217
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,440
Plus it makes her happy...

218
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,244
And relaxed.

219
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,634
Good. Okay.

220
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,244
Can I work in the clinic today?

221
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:27,765
You don't want the F.O.P. case?

222
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,347
Clinic, why?
What's going on in the clinic?

223
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:30,844
Nothing. I just feel clinic-y.

224
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,214
That's not a word. I'll take the clinic.

225
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:34,725
You both can go to the clinic.

226
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,758
The board is interviewing
the chief candidates all day today,

227
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:39,036
so we're light on surgeries.

228
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,536
Yes?

229
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:42,973
You're with Dr. O'Malley.

230
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,700
What am I supposed to do?

231
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,479
Find Dr. Montgomery.
See if you can help with Jane Doe.

232
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:53,731
I showered twice.

233
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,568
It's coming out of your pores, George.

234
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,660
You reek, you're trembling,

235
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,565
there's no way I'm letting
you near my patient right now.

236
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,968
- Dr. Bailey.
- Don't tell Bailey.

237
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:02,944
Bailey,
with Mrs. Rogerson's limited mobility,

238
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:05,244
I'm gonna, uh, need
an extra set of hands.

239
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:06,808
Fine.

240
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:10,059
Yang will handle the clinic.

241
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,890
You'll be with the O'Malleys today.

242
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,447
It's my foot.

243
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,621
It hurts like crazy.

244
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,405
I'm gonna need a painkiller.

245
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,508
Can't spend the whole day
propped on an ice pack.

246
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:36,615
Uh, you're gonna need
to take off your shoe.

247
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,637
No, no, no, no.
I've been down this route before.

248
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,707
Just slip me a couple painkillers,
and I'll be on my way.

249
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:43,811
Sir, uh, did you go to medicalchool?

250
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:46,074
I did. Take off your shoe.

251
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,070
You have type 2 diabetes.

252
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:51,356
Ten years now.

253
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:53,836
You inspect your feet every day.
Have you noticed anything?

254
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,866
I notice it hurts.
Look, I got 30 guys

255
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,456
sitting on their ass
waiting for me to show up.

256
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,865
Sir, I get it. You're in a hurry.
That makes the two of us.

257
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,154
Sock.

258
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,982
You need to call your guys
and tell them you're not coming in.

259
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:23,701
Did you choose a face?

260
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,837
Not yet.

261
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:28,349
I was hoping I'd see one of 'em,
and, I don't know,

262
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,016
recognize myself or something, but...

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,250
I don't recognize any of these women.

264
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,222
What if I choose the wrong one?

265
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:37,475
What if my husband or boyfriend
or whoever's...

266
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,863
baby this is shows up tomorrow with a--

267
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:42,925
With a picture of what
I'm supposed to look like,

268
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,171
but it's too late, and I'm stuck with
the wrong face for the rest of my life?

269
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,399
Okay, that would suck,
but if you don't pick one...

270
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,892
This is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

271
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,500
Shouldn't you be preparing
for your board interview?

272
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,796
I am.

273
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,657
You're hovering.

274
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,999
No, I'm breathing you in.

275
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,084
You're hovering.

276
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,520
Fine. I'm hovering.

277
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:19,689
If Cristina would sleep in her own bed,
I wouldn't have to hover at work.

278
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:22,262
I could hover in bed.
A different type of hovering perhaps.

279
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,480
How bad is it today,

280
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,008
on a scale of one to ten?

281
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,793
- Seven. Maybe a six.
- Good.

282
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,119
You know what's gonna make it
even better than that?

283
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:36,506
- What?
- The calvarial

284
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,314
bone harvest I get to do
on Sloan's Jane Doe later.

285
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,239
Sloan's gonna let you do a harvest..

286
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,320
- By yourself?
- By myself.

287
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,898
Which makes me very cool in the eyes
of my dead mother, by the way.

288
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:49,964
Okay, then.
Well, I better let you study.

289
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,875
Better stop distracting me.
I will not be cool

290
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:55,795
in the eyes of my dead mother
if I maim Jane Doe.

291
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:06,703
We're gonna need you to lie very still,
Mrs. Rogerson.

292
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,391
I think I can do that, Dr. O'Malley.

293
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,603
Sorry about that, Mrs. Rogerson.

294
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,369
I'm never gonna drink again.

295
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,087
I can't believe I have to be
presentable for Callie's dad at lunch.

296
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,658
Oh, god.

297
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:31,200
Hours--

298
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:34,054
Hours of our lives--

299
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:37,365
Many hours that are
all I can think about,

300
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,935
and you seriously don't remember?

301
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,476
How can you not remember those many,
many hours?

302
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,384
Let-- Izzie, if...

303
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,137
Whatever I did, whatever I said,

304
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,175
I was drunk. I'm sure I didn't mean it.

305
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,816
George, I promise you, you meant it.

306
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,301
You meant it a lot.
You meant it more than once.

307
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,298
Do you see that?

308
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,171
Gotta page Callie.

309
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,781
You'll be pleased to hear
I'm proposing an expansion

310
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,273
to the hospital board this afternoon.

311
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,000
Give you quite
a few more places to hide.

312
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,018
I'm not going to hide.

313
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,546
I'm just trying to find my resident.

314
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:21,021
I come here to Seattle to see you,
and you don't even give me a moment?

315
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:22,703
You didn't come to see me.
You came to get a job.

316
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,838
- I came here for both.
- Well, you made a mistake.

317
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,366
Are you going to invite me?

318
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,624
- Where?
- To the wedding.

319
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,554
Will you stop talking about the wedding?

320
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,751
Most blushing brides to be love
to talk about the wedding.

321
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,866
What the matter?

322
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,417
Are we getting cold feet?

323
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,262
Please leave.

324
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,216
If he's rushing you,

325
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:42,699
you should tell him.

326
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:45,019
When you marry, you want to be ready.

327
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,150
He should understand that.

328
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,162
Good afternoon, board.

329
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,249
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen...

330
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,817
of the board.
I am so grateful for this opportunity.

331
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,047
Don't wear the glasses.

332
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,600
You fiddle with 'em.
It makes you look indecisive.

333
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,818
And stop stressing.
It'll be like any other job interview.

334
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:14,043
"What do you consider your strengths?
What do you consider your weaknesses?"

335
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,137
What do you consider your weaknesses?

336
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:19,925
I don't have any.

337
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:21,119
I'm that good.

338
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:23,382
What are yours?

339
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,551
I'm an easy Mark for evil redheads.

340
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:29,924
Trust me, you have other weaknesses.

341
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:31,867
Obviously...

342
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,445
you are a man-whore.

343
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:35,773
Correction. I was a man-whore.

344
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,346
Yeah, while you're bragging
about that to the board,

345
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,280
Colin Marlowe is pitching
his 10-year plan.

346
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:42,538
10-year plan?

347
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,662
Was that a requirement?

348
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:46,305
It is now.

349
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,235
Mrs. Rogerson, according to your C.T.,

350
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,667
you have severe internal bleeding.

351
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:54,549
It was probably caused by
your anti-inflammatory medication.

352
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,576
Does that require surgery?
Because she can't have any--

353
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:59,252
Obviously any surgical procedure
could cause more bone growth

354
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:00,909
or do more damage than good.

355
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,486
That's why Dr. Burke's here.

356
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,443
What we can do is insert
a line into your groin

357
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:08,093
and then float a catheter up
and embolize the area.

358
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,727
That's minimally invasive?

359
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:12,055
As minimally invasive as possible.

360
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:14,121
But with your condition,
even this is risky.

361
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,234
I'm 41 years old.

362
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,926
Most F.O.P. patients don't live to 45.

363
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,220
I'm down to the use
of my face and hands.

364
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,872
Pretty soon I won't have anything.

365
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:26,051
So what would happen...

366
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,520
If I refuse the surgery?

367
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,393
You will bleed to death...

368
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,871
Within a day or two.

369
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,491
Is that painful?

370
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,065
- Mom, stop, okay?
- Nina, please.

371
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,395
- Let me think.
- The reason you've gotten this far--

372
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,680
Our treatment plan works.

373
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,338
It will work.

374
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,204
Burke is using powerpoint.

375
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:57,293
He's doing a powerpoint presentation
for the board, which is...

376
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,857
cool if it's, like, 1998.

377
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,314
There's no swag, is there?

378
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,230
We're not allowed to give gifts?

379
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,535
Why did you ask Meredith

380
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:12,603
to do a bone graft on your Jane Doe?

381
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,840
Because I'm her teacher,
and that's my job.

382
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,388
You're doing it to impress the chief.

383
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,267
You're setting her up,

384
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:20,826
and she can't fail right now.

385
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:25,470
Why don't you let your girlfriend decide
what she can or can't do?

386
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,345
I will hurt you
if this goes wrong for her.

387
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,768
Is that a... dollhouse?

388
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:43,408
Yeah. The lights work and everything.
It's the perfect little home.

389
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,758
Did you have a dollhouse growing up?

390
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,948
I had sex last night...

391
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:50,994
with the wrong person.

392
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:54,351
But the thing is,
it didn't feel wrong at the time.

393
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,742
It felt like...

394
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,061
Something's falling into place.

395
00:17:58,624 --> 00:17:59,781
So what do I do?

396
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,152
What am I,
the go-to person for adultery?

397
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:06,804
I just...

398
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:08,945
I just don't know what to do.

399
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:11,838
You stop.

400
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:14,674
That's what you do.

401
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:16,289
Are you sure?

402
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,120
I mean, how do you know

403
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:20,265
that it didn't feel so right because...

404
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:21,757
it's god's plan?

405
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,844
God wants you to be an adulter?

406
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,421
God got a virgin pregnant by magic.

407
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,867
God is not playing by the rules.

408
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,489
Uh, talk to paul.

409
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:34,916
Mr. Kendry.

410
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,330
No, Paul will get you drywall numbers.

411
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,348
- Mr. Kendry.
- Okay.

412
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,280
Let me just write
a couple notes about that call.

413
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,383
Mr. Kendry, we're gonna have
to amputate your foot.

414
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,263
- What?
- The infection is in the bone.

415
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,005
If we don't remove the foot,
it will travel to your blood,

416
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,559
and that will cause sepsis
and possible death. I'm sorry.

417
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:02,300
How can you be so...

418
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,013
I mean, I-I can't get around a...

419
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:07,850
No, no, no, no, no.

420
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,906
No, no. You're not cutting off my foot.

421
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,780
Sir, diabetes is a manageable disease.

422
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,733
If you had been here even a month ago,

423
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,451
- maybe we--
- Okay, so I screwed up.

424
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,237
But you're telling me
that this is my only option

425
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,751
because I'm late getting in here?

426
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,756
- That there is no way--
- Mr. Kendry--

427
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:28,161
Please.

428
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,888
There's gotta be a way for me
to get that month back.

429
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:33,381
Tell me what to do.

430
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,484
I'll do it. I'll do every line

431
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,055
of every plan you give me.

432
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,388
I'll do it.

433
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:40,013
Please.

434
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,625
You gotta find a way to save my foot.

435
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:56,836
What do you think of a robotics lab
as a goal for the hospital?

436
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,080
- Derek...
- You're harvesting.

437
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:02,385
I'm trying to be supportive
but this graft, it's really tricky.

438
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,614
You don't have to do it, you know.

439
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,917
I talked to Mark, and, uh--

440
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,429
You what?

441
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,457
I talked to Mark.
I mean, Meredith, this is a--

442
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:12,166
- It's a complex procedure.
- You don't think I can do it?

443
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,439
When has Mark Sloan,

444
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,847
allowed his interns to do anything,

445
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,415
let alone harvest a bone graft?

446
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,274
He's in the race for chief.

447
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,698
- He's trying to prove he can teach.
- By teaching you..

448
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:25,100
Your mother died, the chief
is gonna be watching you very closely.

449
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,011
And Mark is trying to gain points by--

450
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,090
Using me.

451
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,389
If it goes well, he gets the credit.
If it goes poorly,

452
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,688
he gets the save.

453
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,055
So this is about you onupping Mark.

454
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,407
He's using you.

455
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:38,698
I'm just trying to protect you.

456
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,299
You don't need to.

457
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,678
Close the door on your way out...

458
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,892
- Can I help you with those, Dr. Bailey?
- What do you want?

459
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,529
See, that's what I like about you.
You always get right to the point.

460
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,387
Make it quick.
I'm headed over to the clinic.

461
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,401
All right.

462
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,815
What would you change
about this hospital if you could?

463
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,392
Is this for your board interview?

464
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:12,605
You want me to do
your homework for you

465
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,361
because I'm not busy enough,
is that it?

466
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:18,098
All the other attendings are putting
together 10-year plans. I was...

467
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:19,809
just looking for some input.

468
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:20,917
Input? You want--

469
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,738
I have patients
in need of medical attention right now.

470
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:27,648
This guy here is about
to have one less appendage.

471
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,404
I don't have a 10-year plan for him.

472
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,282
I have a "right now" plan for him--

473
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,000
Cut off his foot to save his life.

474
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,655
So you need to get out of my way
right now so I can do my job.

475
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,467
- Right now?
- Right now.

476
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:45,998
Talk to me about blackouts.

477
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,406
Are they real?

478
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:49,539
Do you really not remember
anything afterwards?

479
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,750
Iz, I'm fine. Not drinking.
I'm not drowning my sorrows.

480
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:53,887
Fine.

481
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,309
Everybody needs to stop trying
to protect me.

482
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,867
Um, this isn't... really about you.

483
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:02,979
I'm asking, back when you had
a best friend named tequila, did you...

484
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:04,668
actually ever blackout?

485
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:07,729
Once. No, twice.

486
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,500
But the stuff
you don't remember is usually

487
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,013
the stuff you don't wanna remember.

488
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:13,497
Right.

489
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,989
Great. Thanks.

490
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, I have type 2 diabetes.

491
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,724
Patient let it go,
and the infection is in the bone.

492
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,649
I have to find a fix
or cut off the foot.

493
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:24,480
Anyone? Anybody?

494
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:25,982
You get to cut off his foot? Cool.

495
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,442
You think-- No, not cool.

496
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:29,906
The patient was neglectful.

497
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:32,400
He made a couple of bad calls.
Does that mean he has no hope?

498
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,817
Does that mean he can't have a do over?

499
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,608
But you get to cut
through bone and stuff.

500
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,430
We're talking about Burke now.

501
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:40,481
We are?

502
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:44,031
Operation "Be kind. Rewind."
not going so well?

503
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,413
You need to fix it.

504
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,027
Cause it seems like you guys
have a pretty good thing,

505
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:49,494
and pretty good things are rare,

506
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,709
and hard to come by,

507
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,770
unlike really screwed up,

508
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,488
complicated things, which...

509
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,480
seem to be freakin' everywhere.

510
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,029
You know what? Things are great.

511
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,208
I'm gonna get things back
to the way we were.

512
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,720
Watch me.

513
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,989
Has Jane Doe picked a face?

514
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:09,595
No, not yet.

515
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,097
How cool would that be,

516
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,139
to get to pick your own face, just...

517
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,125
disappear and start all over?

518
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,448
How you doing?

519
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,316
How am I doing?
I'm freaking out, Alex...

520
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,053
That's how I'm doing.
I can't do this.

521
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:27,105
I can't pick.

522
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:28,466
I can't.

523
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:30,119
All right.

524
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,693
Well, let's, uh...

525
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,125
Let's meet the contenders, all right?

526
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:40,150
Let's see. This...

527
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,315
This is... Maggie.

528
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,441
Married her high school sweetheart,
has two kids--

529
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:49,060
Boy and girl...
Loves being a mom,

530
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:52,064
coaches her daughter's
basketball team and...

531
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,533
makes an insane bana cream pie.

532
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,063
Bana cream pie?

533
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,772
It's my favorite, so shut up.

534
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:02,813
And this is... um... Elizabeth.

535
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:04,738
Graduated from Northwestern.

536
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,086
Met her husband
at a political rally where they...

537
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:08,805
got arrested and fell in love.

538
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:10,702
She's all angry and fired up,

539
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,777
but everyone forgives her
because she means well.

540
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:18,319
This one...

541
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,244
This one's Ava.

542
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:23,812
She's funny, she's tough.

543
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,268
You know, little neurotic sometimes,
but you get used to it.

544
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,488
You can tell she's-- She's been
through a lot in her life, but...

545
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,156
It's only made her stronger, you know?

546
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,981
It's just, your daughter, the way she...

547
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,258
You know, she's sort of undeniable.

548
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:51,005
And, uh, after I lost my father, I...

549
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,803
realized, you know, that life is short.

550
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:57,267
And it's-- It's long, too....

551
00:24:58,801 --> 00:24:59,806
Short and long...

552
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:01,787
Life....

553
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,562
He talks a lot.

554
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,773
No, no. He-- He-- He talks.

555
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,125
Like a-- Like a--

556
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:09,920
Like a person who talks, dad.

557
00:25:10,498 --> 00:25:12,112
- Please.
- Do you have any idea

558
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,465
what you've done to your mother?

559
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:17,370
You make this decision,
the most important day of your life...

560
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:21,082
We didn't even know she was seeing
someone... Are you pregnant?

561
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,317
- Did you get my daughter pregnant?
- No. Daddy.

562
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:25,937
No, it is not--
No. This is George, okay?

563
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,835
He's not like the other guys
I've been with.

564
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:28,980
Clean as a whistle,

565
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:30,539
and a mathlete.

566
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:32,716
He has no money.

567
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,386
- You have money.
- Oh, come on...

568
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:37,571
I didn't know that Callie was well-off.

569
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:39,383
- She just told me.
- Really?

570
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:41,824
Really? Well, then,
you won't mind if the house,

571
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:43,712
the car and everything else
we'll provide

572
00:25:43,914 --> 00:25:45,172
will be in Calliope's name.

573
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,266
- Uh, what house?
- You're a married woman now.

574
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:50,504
I'll find something suitable. It's all
here in the postnuptial i've drawn up.

575
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,994
- Dad!
- Sorry.

576
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:55,120
I've got it. It's all right. It's okay.

577
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:00,119
You know what? You--
You are not drawing up any...

578
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:12,023
- ...you can raise a family.
- No!

579
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,033
- What?
- No, that's not gonna happen.

580
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,960
There's no way I'm gonna
let you pay for anything. I can't--

581
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,560
We can't, uh... Callie, I'm so sorry.

582
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:23,927
Mr. Torres, I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

583
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,435
You remembered.

584
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,674
That's really coming along.
It looks great.

585
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:40,716
Thanks.

586
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:42,293
We've been working on it for months.

587
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,204
But when I say "we", I mean "she".

588
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:46,516
I just hold things and look pretty.

589
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,140
That can be hard work, too.

590
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm gonna need to draw
some blood for, uh, your surgery.

591
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:53,577
Be careful.

592
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:56,206
You can only use one specific vein.

593
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:58,117
In this area here.

594
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,002
- I said be careful.
- I'm so sorry.

595
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,035
That's okay.

596
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,495
I's not. If she gonna be that clumsy,
she's not drawing your blood.

597
00:28:05,513 --> 00:28:07,039
Nina, she's just doing her job.

598
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,935
Not very well. I'm going to get a nurse,
a senior nurse.

599
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:10,316
- Oh, Nina, stop.
- No, mom.

600
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:12,457
Do not let her touch you.
We can't be too careful.

601
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:14,553
You're not taking her blood.

602
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:22,823
She's not even a person anymore.

603
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:24,588
You know what I mean?

604
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,132
- Mrs. Rogerson--
- I know I'm gonna die.

605
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,414
You know, maybe not today, but soon..

606
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:33,052
I just need to talk, you know?

607
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,455
Nina won't let me talk.

608
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,712
I just need to talk.

609
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,703
No coffee.

610
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,371
One more thing for marlowe to tweak...

611
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:53,728
Please tell me you're not coming up

612
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,606
with a 10-year plan for this hospital.

613
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:59,643
You can me up with all the plans
you want, but in the end, it just...

614
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,560
Doesn't make one bit of difference.

615
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:05,161
- Things happen. People just--
- Drown?

616
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:11,924
You know, when I pulled her
out of the water, it was...

617
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:14,342
She was like ice.

618
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,530
She can swim.

619
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,290
Richard, she's...

620
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:24,285
She gave up.

621
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:27,808
I close my eyes for a moment,
it's like she's back in the water.

622
00:29:29,705 --> 00:29:32,271
I'm up, and I just listen
to her breathe, you know? Just...

623
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:34,203
In case she stops.

624
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,383
So I can come up with plans
for the hospital, but...

625
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,379
But if they ask me where
I'm gonna be in ten years...

626
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,206
George.

627
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:55,880
Mr. Torres.

628
00:29:58,077 --> 00:30:00,409
You want to take care of her
in your own way.

629
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,100
I understand that.

630
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:04,964
I respect it.

631
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,635
But you have to understand,

632
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:09,203
she's my only little girl, George.

633
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:12,632
And you need to promise me
that you will love her and protect her,

634
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,989
because the minute that you hurt her...

635
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:17,655
You understand?

636
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:22,307
Good. Then I'll tell Callie's mother
she can plan the party.

637
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,420
What pa-- What?

638
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:26,401
- Your wedding party.
- Oh, dad.

639
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,406
Oh, no, please, <i>mija.</i>
For my sanity, <i>mija</i>,

640
00:30:28,932 --> 00:30:30,556
just let her plan a party.

641
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:32,220
All right, all right. Okay.

642
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,572
All right.

643
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,262
I have a plane to catch.

644
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:36,980
Come here.

645
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,638
George.

646
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,325
Bye, dad.

647
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,754
You stood up to him.
Nobody does that.

648
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:51,576
I was all proud.

649
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,075
So listen...

650
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,805
About last night,
I don't know about you,

651
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,390
but personally,
I'd like to take back about 90% of it.

652
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:02,484
Me, too.

653
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,183
Good.

654
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,395
Good. Okay. Then go--
Go find Izzie

655
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,729
and help her prep Mrs. Rogerson.
I'll see you in surgery.

656
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,464
You here to keep my baby alive?

657
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:18,968
I am.

658
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:21,240
Good.

659
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,006
So?

660
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:25,381
So...

661
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:28,276
Call me Ava.

662
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:34,191
You been practicing? You know
the chief will be watching today.

663
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,370
The chief. Right. Of course.

664
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,625
"Of course" what?

665
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,212
Derek was right about you.

666
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,057
You're using the memory
of my dead mother

667
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:44,851
to win points with the chief.

668
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:46,944
It's despicable,

669
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,515
and I'm not gonna play.

670
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,008
The chief--

671
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:52,233
The way he was looking
at you this morning--

672
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:54,567
Was like you were
some beaten down puppy

673
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,205
he picked up off
the side of the road.

674
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,096
You do this procedure

675
00:31:58,444 --> 00:31:59,787
and you do it well,

676
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,625
he'll start looking at you
like a surgeon again.

677
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,869
But, you know...

678
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,843
You wanna think of me as despicable,

679
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,080
you wanna pass up this shot,
that's up to you.

680
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:26,398
They're doing a-amazing things
with prosthetics these days.

681
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,225
This doesn't mean your life is over.

682
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,997
Uh, take him up to the O.R.
I'll meet you there.

683
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,417
You've got your board thing now?

684
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,004
The chief picked you...

685
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,541
Originally. You were always
supposed to be the next chief.

686
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:56,552
That was the plan.

687
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,096
That was a long time ago.

688
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:00,699
A lot has happened since then.

689
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,117
But you're still that guy.

690
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:04,905
You're the guy the chief chose.

691
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,146
No, I'm not.

692
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,663
I'm not that guy, Cristina,
and I wouldn't want to be.

693
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,428
I want to be better than that.

694
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,716
I'd like to believe that I've grown.

695
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,040
I want to move forward.

696
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,500
I'm not interested in going back.

697
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,345
Dr. Burke.

698
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:38,719
You ready?

699
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:41,076
Osteotome and hammer.

700
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,803
All right, use the curved osteotome
to elevate the external table.

701
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:46,358
Gently.

702
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:57,736
- How's it looking?
- Still see bleeding.

703
00:33:58,553 --> 00:33:59,905
The platinum microcoils--

704
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:01,070
They aren't holding.

705
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,498
What about using a gelatin sponge?

706
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,602
I've already tried polyvinyl alcohol,

707
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,517
glue, microcoils-- Nothing's working.

708
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,610
B.P.'s dropping to 62 systolic.

709
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:10,168
We'll have to open her up.

710
00:34:10,187 --> 00:34:11,577
If you open her up, she's dead.

711
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,948
If we don't, she's dead.

712
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,367
Beginning amputation.

713
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,291
Fine amputation, Yang.

714
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,255
Beautiful.

715
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,644
Wait.

716
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,334
- Now they're laughing.
- Laughing?

717
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,855
They're laughing.

718
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:37,193
They can't be laughing with him.

719
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,019
They have to be laughing at him.

720
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:41,949
I'm surprised
you don't have a shot glass

721
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,296
pressed up against that window.

722
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,983
- We weren't listening.
- Just listening.

723
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:47,329
Let me show you the new clinic.

724
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,538
Chief.

725
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,477
So?

726
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,768
If you ask me, you all could stand

727
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:58,918
to borrow a page from Dr. Sloan's book.

728
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:01,593
Sloan? You're kidding right?
That's a joke?

729
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:05,227
He didn't get caught up in
this whole 10-year plan foolishness.

730
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,605
He said he had a "right now" plan
for Seattle Grace.

731
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:09,808
A right now plan?

732
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,620
A right now plan?

733
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:13,998
Is that right?

734
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,265
The board ate it up.

735
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,671
To tell you the truth, so did I.

736
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,533
I should've brought her in sooner...

737
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,857
The first time she threw up.

738
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:34,665
I knew better.

739
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,699
- There was nothing any of us could--
- No.

740
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:40,740
It was a mistake.

741
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:45,570
Your mother...

742
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,490
talked to me.

743
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,365
She wasn't ready to leave you,

744
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,262
but she was ready to leave her body.

745
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,295
Please.

746
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,186
I don't need you to explain the relative
comforts of death for my mother.

747
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:03,846
What she was afraid of...

748
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,156
was that you had taken
on so much of her disease

749
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,612
that you were freezing up, too.

750
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:12,459
You've spent so much time
planning and...

751
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:14,783
Helping her avoid risk--
God knows,

752
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:17,094
that's what you should've been doing--
But...

753
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:19,698
She was worried.

754
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,451
You have a healthy body, Nina.

755
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,441
If you fall down,
you won't turn to stone.

756
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:31,706
And your mom so wanted you
to just let yourself fall.

757
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:35,481
Messing up...

758
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:38,234
It's what makes a person.

759
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,173
It's how we learn...

760
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:44,177
Where we find joy--

761
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:48,180
In the things you don't plan for,

762
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:51,335
the things you never see coming.

763
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:03,310
It happened.

764
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:06,236
It was a mistake, and it happened.

765
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:07,807
People make mistakes.

766
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:11,462
We need to figure out
where we go from here.

767
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:13,293
We need to figure out
how to tell Callie.

768
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:14,579
I'm not gonna tell Callie.

769
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:17,918
Do you know how much
this would hurt her?

770
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,690
I'm not gonna clear
my conscience at her expense.

771
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:23,037
She has done nothing but...

772
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,244
support me, encourage me
and believe in me,

773
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:26,784
and this is how I pay her back?

774
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,065
I have to live with what I did.

775
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:34,269
This is our secret, okay?

776
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,471
<i>The thing about plans is,</i>

777
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:45,856
<i>they don't take into account
the unexpected.</i>

778
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,255
<i>So when we're thrown a curveball,</i>

779
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,463
<i>whether it's in the O.R. or in life....</i>

780
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:54,745
How are you feeling?

781
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,520
<i>We have to improvise.</i>

782
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:57,956
I'm a guy without a foot.

783
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:01,894
What do I do now?

784
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,645
You move forward, you...

785
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,573
You follow the plan and...

786
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,363
you try and keep your other foot.

787
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:11,856
My other foot.

788
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:15,509
Right.

789
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:19,905
<i>Of course,</i>

790
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:23,398
<i>some of us are better at it than others.</i>

791
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,877
I'm impressed, Karev.

792
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:33,501
You spent the whole day
watching a fetal monitor

793
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,816
and never complained.

794
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,229
Well, I, uh, I do what I'm told.

795
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,546
Since when?

796
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,850
Depends on who's doing the telling.

797
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,560
Good night, Dr. Karev.

798
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:51,501
What was that?

799
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,468
How's... Ava?

800
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,302
I don't think I'm gonna know
the answer to that for a little while.

801
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,249
What do you say we talk about you
and the redhead instead?

802
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,969
Well, the redhead's my boss, so...

803
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,227
- So?
- So, it's complicated.

804
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,725
- And?
- And...

805
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:18,872
<i>Some of us just have
to move on to plan B...</i>

806
00:40:22,327 --> 00:40:23,867
<i>And make the best of it.</i>

807
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:38,108
It has to be small--

808
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,418
Just you and me...

809
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:42,441
And Meredith..

810
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,821
And-- And Shepherd, too, if you want.

811
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,398
But that's it.

812
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:50,694
And a justice of the peace.

813
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,244
I know you're...

814
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,337
spiritual and stuff, but...

815
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:57,093
I-I don't want any rabbis or ministers,

816
00:40:57,102 --> 00:40:58,539
nothing religious.

817
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:00,448
We'll just...

818
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,260
Make an appointment at city hall, and...

819
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:05,650
that'll be that.

820
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:07,809
And no veil.

821
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:09,654
Okay? I don't want
to get married with...

822
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,720
mosquito net all over my face.

823
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,135
I let Mark use
the memory of my mother

824
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:29,388
to win points with the chief.
You were right.

825
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,125
I'm sorry.

826
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:33,980
- You know what's weird?
- What's weird?

827
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,557
It's exactly
what she would have wanted.

828
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:39,298
Dead mommy's proud?

829
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:41,186
Dead mommy's proud.

830
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:46,604
How was your interview?

831
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,152
Not great.

832
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,387
It wasn't great.

833
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:54,903
I was distracted.

834
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:56,783
By what?

835
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,304
Nothing.

836
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:03,121
I don't know.

837
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,819
On a scale of one to ten,
how bad is it?

838
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:11,718
Eight.

839
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,480
How about, now?

840
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:17,945
Seven.

841
00:42:21,863 --> 00:42:23,234
<i>And sometimes...</i>

842
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:24,404
How about, now?

843
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,333
Six.

844
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,671
- <i>What we want...</i>
- Five.

845
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:31,352
- <i>is exactly what we need.</i>
- Four, three.

846
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:51,050
<i>But sometimes...</i>

847
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:05,520
I can smell your clothes
through the closet door.

848
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,515
Did you tie them up
in a plastic laundry bag?

849
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:08,808
Yeah.

850
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:11,983
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:18,980
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

852
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:21,111
Well, I guess I can...

853
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:22,914
live with it.

854
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:27,852
<i>Sometimes what we need...</i>

855
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,143
<i>is a new plan.</i>
