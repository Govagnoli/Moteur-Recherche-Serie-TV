1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,360
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,730
Last night, you and Shephard did it.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,340
Meredith, what does this mean ?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,130
uh,I had panties *********

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,160
***** I thought I was a surgeon, but I'm not.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,860
- She cut the ******* wire.
- So I quit.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,050
It's time for you to make
a choice... Me or this hospital.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,270
Good-bye, Richard.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,060
You live here ?

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm not crazy or anything.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,550
I just spend so much time here in the hospital.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,180
- Are you gonna tell Shephard about...
- Not yet...

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,700
What does this mean ?

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,870
It means you have a choice.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,970
At any given moment, the brain has 14 billion
neurons firing at a speed of 450 miles per hour.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,060
We don't have control over most of them...

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,640
When we get a chill...goose bumps.
When we get excited...adrenaline.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,390
The body naturally follows its impulses,

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,900
which I think is part of what makes it
so hard for us to control ours.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,350
It's enough muffins.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,740
We don't need all these.

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,210
No more muffins.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,870
Of course, sometimes we have impulses
we would rather not control...

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,680
What are you doing ?

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,960
Just because you can't touch doesn't
mean you can't enjoy.

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,560
That we later wish we had.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,310
Mama.
Daddy.

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,750
Oh, my ... Preston.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,770
Mama and daddy ? !

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,700
Is this a new service the hospital is providing ?

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
I told you to guard the door !

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,270
I had a code blue.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,510
I had parents walk in.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,980
- We saved the guy's life.
- Whatever.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,810
- You know,I want my 20 bucks back.
- Sorry.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,960
bought everyone coffee...

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,660
to celebrate saving the guy's life.

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,540
Yeah, I want my 20 bucks back.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,870
It's not Tyler's fault you're a dirty, dirty stripper.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,240
- You heard.
- Everyone heard...

41
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,350
Stripper.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,640
Oh, oh, you're one to talk, sleeping with two men.

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,530
Wrong.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm not sleeping with either one of them...

45
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,740
not until I pick one.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,920
If I haven't made a decision by
the end of the day, I'm flipping a coin.

47
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,470
A girl can only hold out for so long.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,910
Oh, and somehow I'm the dirty stripper ?

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,090
You two have time to round, or are you
too busy getting naked on hospital property ?

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,650
No, I wasn't naked.
I-I wasn't naked.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,540
You've got a coffee stain on your shirt.

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,670
You had a bed on your couch.

53
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,010
Hope you're not planning to
see patients in your sweat suit

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,890
Actually, um...

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,300
I need the day off.

56
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,810
A day off, for what ?

57
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,380
For drinking.

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,900
I am feeling the need to do some drinking.

59
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,280
Actually, I'm feeling the need to do some
crying, but my tear ducts seem to be too proud,

60
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,930
so I'm going to do some drinking instead.

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,550
- What, no laboring moms today ?
- No.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,290
Because I think god knows that...

63
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,610
I need to do some drinking today.

64
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,280
You wanna talk about it, Addie, or you
just wanna be glib a little longer ?

65
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,210
Why are you living in your office ?

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,880
Marriage...
is hard.

67
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,030
Well... Thank goodness mine seems
to be just about over.

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,300
Ms. Seabury, what...what are...

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,810
No, I'm... I'm sorry. You cannot be eating.

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,330
What is all of this ?

71
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,120
This is chocate raspberry souffle cake.

72
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,230
It is the best thing i've ever tasted in my life.

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
except for maybe the banana cream torte there.

74
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,080
It's pretty stunning, really.

75
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,580
Bakeries deliver.
Did you know that ? Please, grab a fork.

76
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,470
Ms. Seabury, you're scheduled for surgery this afternoon.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,160
We push the surgery a little.
Tomorrow, maybe ?

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,810
Oh, my god.
You've gotta taste this.

79
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,090
Ma'am, you have an aggressive form of lung cancer.

80
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,920
The sooner we get you into surgery,

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,500
- the better your chances--
- The better my chances of surviving.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,250
So I heard.
it's all very aggressive.

83
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,450
I mean, it's very...

84
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,160
It's funny.

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,370
I have never smoked a cigarette in my life.

86
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,350
I have never smoked pot.

87
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,740
I've never drank.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,390
Before today, I hadn't had a dessert in ten years.

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,620
I am the picture of health, and I have lung cancer.

90
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,670
I mean, come on.
It's absurd, right ?

91
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm sorry. I think I'm on a sugar high.

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,210
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,450
O'Malley, reschedule her surgery for
tomorrow and get her a psych consult.

94
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,020
Yes, sir.
And no more food deliveries.

95
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,750
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,330
Okay.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
You do it.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,630
So, um...
Um, Dr.Bailey ?

99
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,320
Surgeons don't say "um," O'Malley.

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,870
You want to be a surgeon, learn to speak like one.

101
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,160
Look,he wants you to talk to the chief
about Izzie, see if she can come back.

102
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,740
She's just baking...a lot of baking

103
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,720
and it seems a waste for all her talent
and medical skills to go into muffins.

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,880
- We just thought you might be willing to help.
- Stop... talking.

105
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,240
Well, good morning.
Benjamin, Ruth.

106
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,350
Good morning, Dr.Shepherd.

107
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,420
It doesn't feel like a very good morning to me.

108
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,110
I have to have brain surgery today.

109
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,370
Pretty scary.

110
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,760
Plus my sister is nervous.

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,270
When she gets nervous, she sweats, and
the windows in here don't open, so it's pretty rank.

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,190
Benjamin.

113
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
Was I rude, Ruthie ?

114
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,070
Let's let the doctors talk.

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,540
Benjamin O'Leary, 32,

116
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,740
in for the removal of a brain tumor
that's pressing on his frontal temporal lobe.

117
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,790
Clearly, it's affecting his impulse control.

118
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,590
It makes me say everything I think,
which apparently is annoying.

119
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,270
This doctor looks annoyed, anyway.

120
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,340
Although, it's hard to tell 'cause she always
has kind of a pinched, uptight look on her face.

121
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,780
Am I annoying you ?

122
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,640
It's fine.

123
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,100
You can't say it's fine.

124
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,000
He doesn't perceive sarcasm or irony.

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,890
If he's annoying you, you have to tell him.

126
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,620
Maybe I'm not annoying her, Ruthie.

127
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,200
- No, you are.
- Dr.Yang.

128
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,970
- He asked.

129
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,480
- Okay, Benjamin, Dr.Yang...

130
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,740
pinched and annoyed though she may
be, she wanna prepare you for surgery today.

131
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,050
Do you have any questions for me ?

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,590
Is that blonde your girlfriend ?

133
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,210
'cause the way you keep looking at her, you might
as well just mount her right here and now.

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,970
I'm sorry.
Was that rude ?

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,510
I'm proud of you all.

136
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,200
You make me proud.

137
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,670
You reflect on me well.

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,140
Grey, if you think you can keep your
clothes on long enough to follow up the labs,

139
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,630
I'd appreciate it. Karev, cover the pit.

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Wait, the pit ?

141
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm...I'm off gynie ?

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,920
Dr.Montgomery-Shepherd is out sick.

143
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,890
You can cover the pit, or you can...

144
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,090
You can tell me whose damn panties
are on the bulletin board !

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,780
It's yours ?

146
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,730
This is a hospital, people.

147
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,570
Serious work happens here.

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,370
We save lives he... Oh, something funny ?

149
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,320
Whose are these ?

150
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,290
This is bad.
This isn't good.

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,970
Well, you better claim them.

152
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,320
- She thinks they're mine. Claim them !
- No !

153
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,850
Yeah, I know it's one of you.

154
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,940
It's always one of mine. Always.

155
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:38,320
So tell me, which one of you left
your damn drawers on my surgical floor !

156
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh, no. Did I leave my underwear
lying around again ?

157
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,040
I am so sorry, Bailey.

158
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,640
It's, uh, it's my bad.

159
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,370
O'Malley, Yang, prepare your patient for surgery.

160
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,940
Karev, pit.
Grey, charts.

161
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,980
All four of you, do not make me regret
setting you loose in this hospital.

162
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,400
O'Malley, what do I mean by that ?

163
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,900
You mean check with you before
we cut any wires or steal any hearts.

164
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,960
Are you trying to be clever ?

165
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,250
- No, ma'am.
- Better not be.

166
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,150
Holy crap. The nazi's definitely back.

167
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,600
And louder than ever.

168
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,130
Oh, Mrs. Burke.
Hi, I'm Cristina.

169
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,500
I-I may have said that earlier, but I was, um...

170
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,860
Did I hear you refer to Miranda Bailey as a nazi ?

171
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,490
What ?
Oh, no.

172
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,010
Oh, uh, uh, I mean, yes, but--

173
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,720
You do understand that the nazis were responsible

174
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,100
for the worst genocide in the history of man ?

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,840
And a racist genocide at that.

176
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,100
I would think that as a woman
of color and as a doctor, no less,

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,690
that you would think twice before
using that word as a punch line.

178
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,030
I'll think about that in the future, Mrs. Burke.

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Mrs. Burke ? Preston's mother ?

180
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,700
Yes. Oh. And you are ?

181
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,940
Derek Shepherd. I'm the surgeon
who operated on your son.

182
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,130
Oh, thank you.

183
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,260
Brilliant surgeon.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,850
And a handsome man, too.

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Your mother must be very proud.

186
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,080
Do you mind, Dr.Shepherd, if I borrow your
young intern for a quick cup of coffee ?

187
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,870
- I'll bring her right back.
- Oh, no problem.

188
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,450
Dr.Grey can cover for Cristina.

189
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,460
- I'm sorry ?
- Uh, Dr.Grey is very busy.

190
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,830
She has charts to do for Bailey.

191
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,110
Bailey's on the warpath.

192
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,280
Uh, not the german warpath.

193
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,990
It's a hospital warpath.
It's--it's--

194
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,480
I'll take care of Bailey, okay ?

195
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,120
Enjoy your coffee date, ladies.

196
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,370
- Very nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

197
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,950
I'll, um...

198
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,530
I just have this one quick... I will meet you
in the cafeteria in a couple of minutes.

199
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,370
Is that--is that all right ?

200
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,200
- Yes, I look forward to it.
- Oh, good.

201
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,990
Well, this is a change from the elevator,

202
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,350
I mean a little more public. I like it.

203
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,520
You're married. You're married, and you said things to me.

204
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,200
Yes, I said things to you.

205
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,850
Normally, I would like the things you said to me.

206
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,130
Normally, I would even think the
bulletin board thing was funny.

207
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,090
Bulletin board ?
What are you talking about ?

208
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,660
But you're married, which makes none of this normal.

209
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,240
It makes me a home wrecker

210
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,510
and I hate the fact that I'm a home wrecker.

211
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,040
Meredith, I'm not gonna pressure you.

212
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,350
Take all the time you need.

213
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,280
But just so you have all the information,

214
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,450
my home was wrecked well before you came into the picture,

215
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,630
and I am just now done trying to rebuild it.

216
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,170
- You're done ?
- I'm done.

217
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,730
Whatever you decide, I am ending it with Addison...

218
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,010
Today.

219
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,340
You have said this before.

220
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,590
I know, but this time I mean it.

221
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm gonna come clean just as soon as I see her.

222
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,760
- You are ?
- I am.

223
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,020
You guys should think about getting
a hotel room or something.

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,610
Your mother wants to have coffee with me.

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,870
- And ?
- And...she thinks I'm a racist.

226
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,270
Oh, and a stripper.

227
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,630
She thinks I'm a racist stripper.

228
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,030
Oh, come on.
What's funny ?

229
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,270
This is not funny.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,180
It's kind of funny.

231
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,240
She's just my mama, Cristina.

232
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,530
Your "mama" ?

233
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,130
You'll love her when you get to know her.

234
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,270
Everybody loves my mama.

235
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,520
You will save me from this, okay ?

236
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,600
You will save me from this or...

237
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,390
You will save me.

238
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey, uh, chief, you haven't heard from
Addison, have you ?

239
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,110
She's not answering any phones.

240
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,820
Actually, she needed a day off.

241
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,950
Something about finding another woman's
panties in the pocket of your tux.

242
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,130
Oh, that's
that's not how I wanted her to find out.

243
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,710
You don't leave another woman's panties
in your tux unless you want her to find 'em.

244
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,350
- I know, I know.
- Look, I know a thing or two about affairs.

245
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,400
I even know a thing or two about
affairs with women named Grey.

246
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,150
It's not an affair.

247
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,590
See, I was gonna tell her.

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Addison -- I was gonna tell her today.
I was gonna end it.

249
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,390
- Look, give her some space.
- No.

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,350
- Give her some time.
- No.

251
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,870
That's not it.
No.

252
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,890
No, I gotta... I gotta talk to her today.

253
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,010
If something's over, it's just gotta be over.

254
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,340
Meredith, she's... She's not an affair.

255
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,620
Ruthie, I don't think I want this surgery. 
You have to have the surgery, Ben.

256
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,450
Right.

257
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,710
You're very pretty, but you look kinda tired,

258
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
and I think maybe you should change your hair conditioner.

259
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,640
- That was rude, Benjamin.
- It is ?

260
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,530
No, actually, it's true, and it's refreshing.

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,730
- Do you have sex with that brain surgeon ?
- Benjamin.

262
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,440
It's okay.
Nope, I haven't.

263
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,790
Not today, anyway.

264
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,900
I would.
He's hot...

265
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,330
and arrogant in way that's still sexy.

266
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,450
I would totally have sex with him if I could.

267
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,100
Looked like you could.

268
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,780
So what's the holdup ?

269
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,950
Are you trying to seduce me ?

270
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,280
I was just wondering...'cause I got a lot of work to do...
mm-hmm.

271
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,840
But, uh, I was just wondering about, uh,
the panties... The panties that are yours...

272
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,220
and how they ended up on the bulletin board.

273
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,510
Black, lacy panties on the board.

274
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,760
- You are trying to seduce me.
- No. No, I'm not.

275
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,870
I'm just wondering how, uh, panties
that I haven't seen before...

276
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,920
and I've seen your panties
a lot of days in a row now...

277
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,140
I'm just wondering how black panties
that apparently belong to you

278
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,180
and I've never seen end up
on the bulletin board.

279
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,450
Wow.
You're jealous.

280
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,430
No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I'm not...

281
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,130
- Yeah. Yeah, you are.
- I'm not jealous.

282
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,170
No, I'm... Is that my patient... Ms.Seabury ?

283
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,520
Ms.Seabury ?
Hey. Stop. Get up...

284
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,570
- I'll tell him.
- What ?

285
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,200
- I'll tell him the truth about the panties.
- Don't you dare. He is jealous.

286
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,920
So you and O'Malley, huh ?

287
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,700
How'd that happen ?

288
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,850
I don't know.
You're a surgeon. How'd that happen ?

289
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,310
Karev, she's a resident.
She outranks you.

290
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,930
You don't get to ask personal questions.

291
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,800
- It's fine, Dr.Bailey.
- He's my intern.

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
I say it's not fine.
Are we clear ?

293
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,530
No.

294
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,600
What's not clear ?

295
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,920
What's not clear to me is why you won't talk to Izzie.

296
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,280
- That's what's not clear.
- Really ?

297
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,740
You want to push me on this today ?

298
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,120
Today you want to push me ?

299
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,810
What do we got, Jill ?

300
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,220
Harley Hernandez, 14, was street luging
when he lost control and hit a car.

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,930
Witnesses say he was catapulted
at least 20 feet into the air,

302
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:15,790
landed on a pile of tree trimmings.
****************

303
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,720
It's all right, Harley.
You're at the hospital.

304
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,440
We're gonna take care of you now, okay ?

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,520
Hospital ?
What's the matter with me ?

306
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,870
You're an idiot.
That's what's the matter.

307
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,420
- Dad.
- Sir. Sir, please back away.

308
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,760
Your friends are idiots, and you
don't use the sense god gave you !

309
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,550
That's what's the matter with you !

310
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,740
Sir, you're blocking our path.
Please !

311
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,180
You okay ?
Sorry about that.

312
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,890
- Sir, sir.
- You, son of a bitch.

313
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,890
- Where's my son ?
- We took him in there.

314
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,920
- He was blocking the paramedics.
- No, he is terrified.

315
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,390
His child is a tree !

316
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,450
Alex, listen to me.

317
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,920
You will not get physical with another
human being on my watch ever again,

318
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,550
you will not question my authority,

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,410
and you will not defend your little
girlfriend for killing a man !

320
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,810
Are we clear ? !

321
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,660
She's not my girlfriend.

322
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,480
As you know, I'm sure, he graduated
first in his class from Tulane.

323
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,850
I-I did know that.

324
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,500
Actually, I graduated first
in my class at Stanford.

325
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,330
So you are planning to pursue
a less time-consuming specialty...

326
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,880
Obstetrics, perhaps, or family medicine ?

327
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,760
Oh, I'm in the surgical program.

328
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,570
But after you're married.

329
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,070
Married ?
Uh,I'm sorry. Married ?

330
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,280
Come, Cristina.

331
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,650
You must have considered the possibility.

332
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,960
You're no spring chicken.

333
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,020
I don't know a young woman who wouldn't want
to marry my Preston given half the chance.

334
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,910
He's handsome.
He's brilliant.

335
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,270
He is the best thing i've ever
done in my life.

336
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,170
He is the most important thing
in the world to me.

337
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,830
Oh. Okay.

338
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,390
Oh, Burke.
Burke. Burke's here.

339
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
Preston is... Preston Burke is here.

340
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,960
Oh, what a surprise.

341
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,550
- My two favorite ladies in one place
- Preston, what on earth are you doing out of bed ?

342
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,170
Oh... Well, I...

343
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,690
I wanted to get some, uh, I... stretch my legs, mama.

344
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,110
But you're not suppose to stretch your legs.

345
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,540
You're supposed to be resting.

346
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,330
Right.

347
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,790
But I wanted to have, uh, some air...

348
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,880
some stretching, some air and some coffee.

349
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,440
Anybody want any coffee ?

350
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,400
We already have coffee.

351
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,910
- Please have a seat.
- Right. Just a second.

352
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,850
- You did this.
- Did what ?

353
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,640
Cristina, listen to me.

354
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,300
It's not that I don't like you.

355
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,910
I think you're a very smart,
very attractive young woman.

356
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,000
- But you're selfish.
- I beg your pardon.

357
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,370
Oh, you pulled him out of sickbed
because you were uncomfortable.

358
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,890
That's selfish.

359
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,640
You're selfish and my son is giving.

360
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,790
and the combination, well, it's not gonna
last, not much longer.

361
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,330
Hey, hey, hi.
All right. All right.

362
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,180
I brought you a scone, mama.

363
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,610
His kidney's gone.

364
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,230
There's no way to save it.

365
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,180
Just focus on keeping the renal
artery under control.

366
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340
I have another bleeder.

367
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,940
Okay, pace yourself, everybody.

368
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,860
We got long way to go.

369
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,790
- We have enough blood standing by ?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,560
Is that a tree ?

371
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,080
His mother rivals my mother,
and that is saying something.

372
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,040
They're ating around both othem,

373
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
Dark and evil.

374
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,800
You're blocking my view, George.

375
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
I miss dirty stripper Cristina.

376
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,020
She was fun...
A lot less angry.

377
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,620
Next time I see her, if she even looks at
my sideways, I'm telling her what I think.

378
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,750
She wants to call me racist ?

379
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,670
- wh--
- Yeah. Okay ?

380
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,570
I'll call her sexist.

381
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
Change my career after I'm married ?

382
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,900
What is this, 1953 ?

383
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,090
If she comes at me, I'm goin' there.

384
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,890
I think you should.

385
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,400
I think we all should just go there.

386
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,310
You know, tell the truth, spit it out,
go with your gut, follow your instincts.

387
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,520
I miss philandering whore Meredith.

388
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,590
She was trashy and much less idyllic.

389
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,870
Do women have two sets of panties ?

390
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,210
You know, two sets they wear for different occasions ?

391
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,800
I made a choice.

392
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,170
I'm picking Derek.

393
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,180
Finn is great.
But Derek is...

394
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,690
Derek.
And...

395
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,320
- I'm following my gut.
- Yeah, whatever.

396
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,990
I-I want my patient back.

397
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,600
You know, the one you stole after...
mama cornered me ?

398
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,140
Well, that's fine.

399
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,520
It's my day to check on Izzie anyway.

400
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,880
You paged me ?

401
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,980
Your patient was caught shoplifting
chocolates from the hospital gift shop.

402
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,750
What ?

403
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,360
I'd never done that before.
It was exhilarating.

404
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,990
And now she's planning to leave.

405
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,580
Leave ?
You can't leave... She can't leave.

406
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,540
You're sick.

407
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,910
You should be sleeping and resting.

408
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,030
- And preparing for death ?
- Preparing for surgery.

409
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,870
- There's a difference.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

410
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,180
That's what they mean when they give
you a 60% chance of survival.

411
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,920
It means that 4 out of 10 people die
whether they have the surgery or not.

412
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,910
I have lived my entire life pent-up,
repressed, stifling every impulse,

413
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,790
foowing every rule,and now
I'm done. And you know what ?

414
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,560
You should be, too.
We should all be done.

415
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,990
- So you're leaving ?
- I'm claiming my life, doctor.

416
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,450
I can't do that from a hospital bed.

417
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,490
And you know you'll die.

418
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,940
Maybe.

419
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,410
But at least when I do, I'll know that I have lived.

420
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,630
Oh, god, this is good.

421
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,920
Izzie ?

422
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,000
Wow.

423
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,110
Okay.

424
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,410
- Finn.
- Hi.

425
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,560
Wh-what are you doing home ?
I thought you were working.

426
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,230
I am.
I'm...I was. I-I still am.

427
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,610
I just came home to check on Izzie.

428
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,880
Oh, so did I.

429
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,920
I brought her lunch.

430
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,840
You brought Izzie lunch.

431
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,750
When my wife died, uh...

432
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,520
There really wasn't anything anne could say, but, uh...

433
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,780
the bringing of food actually helped.

434
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,110
it's the only thing that helped.

435
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,180
- You brought Izzie food.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,570
Even though you didn't think I was here.

437
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,200
Is--is that okay ?

438
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,020
Yeah.
It's amazing,actually.

439
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,150
You're amazing...

440
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,130
Sweet and thoughtful and sensitive.

441
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,790
Meredith, I don't want to pressure you.

442
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,130
You have a decision to make, and I want
you to take all the time you need.

443
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,070
but I do want to make one thing clear.

444
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,800
What's that ?

445
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,190
I'm not all that sensitive.

446
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,160
So...

447
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,910
So...

448
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,220
Have a nice day of work.

449
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,140
Mr. Hernandez.

450
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,800
H-how is he ?
Is he okay ?

451
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,170
I mean, you've been operating for hours.

452
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,810
There is extensive damage.

453
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,840
We've had to remove one of his
kidneys and a portion of his bowel.

454
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,930
but the tree's out.
I mean, you got it out, and he's okay.

455
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,470
Okay, Mr. Hernandez, the branch
actually is still there.

456
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,620
We're operating around it, which is
part of what's taking so much time.

457
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,950
His mother's not here yet.
I mean...

458
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
You think... You think he'll be okay
by the time she gets here ?

459
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,930
I-I'm sorry, I do have to get back in there.

460
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
But I just wanted to give you an update.

461
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,320
That he's still alive.

462
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,290
Yes, that he's still alive.

463
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,940
Okay.
Okay.

464
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,070
Izzie.
How you doin', sweetie ?

465
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,680
- I brought you some muffins.
- Okay.

466
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,900
I made a lot, and I was...

467
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,410
running out of room, and I thought maybe...

468
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,250
you would like some.

469
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm a good baker.

470
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Yeah.
Absolutely. Thank you.

471
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,800
Dr.Stevens.

472
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,380
Please don't call me "Doctor."
Okay...

473
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,740
Please don't call me "Mrs. Shepherd."

474
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,450
That's funny.

475
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,060
- She's drunk.
- This is true.

476
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,740
So did you know about the slutty
sex your slutty friend had with my...

477
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,410
super slutty husband ?

478
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,620
You should have a muffin.

479
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,530
They're really good, and...

480
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,750
they'll help you.

481
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,930
I may be beyond help

482
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,550
Yeah. Me, too.

483
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,770
Don't let her drive, Joe.

484
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,480
Good.

485
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,090
But I knew.
I knew that you...

486
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,980
She's still here.

487
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,770
Never leaves.

488
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,140
She never even pees.

489
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,390
I'm not entirely sure she's human.

490
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,240
Finn brought Izzie lunch.

491
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,360
Oh, you went to see Izzie ?

492
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,590
Yeah, she wasn't home.

493
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,000
But I'm taking that as a good thing, 'cause
at least the baking has stopped.

494
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,110
but my point is that Finn brought Izzie lunch.

495
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,870
He's that guy... The guy who brings
your roommate lunch when she's sad.

496
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,930
So, uh, you didn't end it ?

497
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,210
He's the guy who brings your
roommate lunch when she's sad.

498
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
So I'm gonna end it with Derek.

499
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,770
Whatever.

500
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,980
You know,I am not selfish.

501
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,420
I am by his side.

502
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,360
I-I took off all my clothes this morning.
That's not selfish.

503
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,430
And I'm going ***** surgery.

504
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,160
Selfish people don't save lives.
For surgery.

505
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,270
- George.
- What ?

506
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,770
You're flirting with that nurse.

507
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm young.
I'm healthy.

508
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,240
I got a life to live.

509
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,760
Is this about the panties ?

510
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,270
Are you still jealous ?

511
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm not jealous.

512
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,710
I'm just living my life.

513
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,290
Do you have a boyfriend ?

514
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,670
Do you have a boyfriend ?

515
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,740
Do you have a boyfriend ?

516
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,550
He's gonna keep asking till you answer.

517
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,650
Yes, I have a boyfriend.
Can you look here ?

518
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,830
If I had a boyfriend, I would
definitely not be as angry as you.

519
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,710
Why are you so angry ?

520
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,580
Is it because you're frigid ?

521
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,760
or he's frigid ?

522
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,250
- or--
- Nobody's frigid.

523
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,910
My boyfriend's mother called me selfish, okay ?

524
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,350
Are you selfish ?

525
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,680
- 'cause you do seem kind of self-obsessed to me.
- Ben.

526
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,250
Hey, I'm a surgeon.

527
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,420
In order to be a surgeon, a certain
amount of self-obsession is necessary.

528
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,620
My boyfriend gets that.

529
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,440
If his mother doesn't, it's her problem.

530
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,700
I used to have a boyfriend.

531
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,330
When I got the tumor, he understood.

532
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,060
He tried to understand.

533
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,610
He loved me.

534
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,710
But his mother didn't.

535
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,670
My offending everyone offended her.

536
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,230
And he said he didn't care what his mother thought.

537
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,350
But in the end, he did care.

538
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,440
'cause now it's two years later,
and I'm having brain surgery,

539
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,330
and only my fat sister Ruth is with me.

540
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,510
Benjamin...

541
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,280
That was kinda rude.

542
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,170
Sorry.

543
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,980
When the tumor's removed, is it gonna
bring his old personality back ?

544
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,280
If we get the tumor out and Benjamin lives,
anything else is icing on the cake.

545
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,630
** I'm locking down the external fixator.

546
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,310
There's no active bleeding,and the trajectory is clear.

547
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,960
Karev, I want you to hold pressure on the liver.

548
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,800
Put your hands down in here, and don't move.

549
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,790
You with the saw,

550
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,030
Don't make a move until we get our hands on
every vital organ around the tree trunk.

551
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,710
The parents... Have they said their good-byes ?

552
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,080
Mom's not here yet.

553
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,290
And the father was too busy blaming him to say good-bye.

554
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,730
Speak when you're spoken to, Karev.

555
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,340
I've had enough out of you today.

556
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,060
All due respect, Dr.Bailey, I think you
got me mixed up with Izzie Stevens.

557
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,650
All right, everybody.
Take your positions.

558
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,190
Cut carefully.

559
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,900
We'll get this thing out in pieces.

560
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,160
You see that right there ?

561
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,120
It's too close to the cavernous sinus.

562
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,250
Suction.

563
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,640
I've got a bleeder.

564
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,090
The brain is starting to swell.

565
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,940
- v-fib.
- His heart can't take it.

566
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,680
Yang, get in there with those paddles.
Move. Now. Go.

567
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,150
Clear.

568
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,130
Renal artery's collapsed.

569
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,990
I thought you had that.

570
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,030
Hepatic artery's gone.

571
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,940
B.P. is dropping.
All right, he's bleeding.

572
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,600
Damn it, he's bleeding fast.
Laps.

573
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,780
- Come on. Come on.
- No change.

574
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,160
epI and atropine are in.

575
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,540
- Still in v-fib.
- Shock him again.

576
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,630
I've decided that I'm gonna get really fat,

577
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,300
Just as a stopgap, just until
I figure out another plan.

578
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:23,910
I'm gonna eat all of these muffins,
and I'm gonna get really, gloriously fat.

579
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,880
It's over. Over. Over.

580
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,370
I'm talking about the last
third of my life,Miranda.

581
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,490
How can that just be over ?
How does that just end...

582
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,440
over a skanky pair of panties and...

583
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,270
- A bad tux ? I am desirable, Amanda
- Miranda.

584
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,410
Right.

585
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,480
Joe...

586
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,770
I'm desirable, right ?

587
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,060
I have a boyfriend.

588
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,360
Be that as it may, I don't need me to tell you
how wildly attractive I am... Wildly attractive.

589
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,870
You are...

590
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,520
And your wildly attractive cab is here.

591
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
It is ?

592
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,370
You told me to call you a cab at 10:00.

593
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,090
It's 10:00.

594
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,030
I guess that's for the best, huh ?

595
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,370
I would say so.

596
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,710
Hey.

597
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,590
Can I buy you a drink ?
I have a lot of them.

598
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,890
I'm trying one of everything.

599
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,680
Hey.
Hey, aren't you the cake lady from this morning ?

600
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,060
Aren't you supposed to be having surgery ?

601
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,640
Oh, well, that hasn't been decided yet.

602
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,780
So you're a doctor ?

603
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,230
Yes, I'm a doctor.

604
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,740
Does that mean you can't drink with me ?

605
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,650
Not at all.

606
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,730
Joe.

607
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,530
George...
You're gonna kill someone.

608
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,470
What are you doing ?
I'm workin' it.

609
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,330
Callie can be bad, so can I ?

610
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,890
Hey, watch it.

611
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,490
George...
Callie is hot.

612
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,670
She's, like, really sexy, like almost
dirty-hot, and she's hot for you.

613
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,790
Maybe you could keep using the darts as weapons,

614
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:05,860
or you could go get lucky with
the sexy, hot, dirty girl.

615
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,590
Where is he going ?

616
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,670
To get laid.

617
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,730
God, you know, there is something wrong
in the world when bambi's getting laid,

618
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,930
and I can't get five minutes
alone with Burke.

619
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,330
- What are you doing ?
- Day's over.

620
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,550
Flippin' a coin.

621
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,880
Call it.

622
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,730
The brain surgeon should be heads.

623
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,460
Right.

624
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,540
Choice made.

625
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,040
Oh, that's it ?

626
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,030
You're gonna base your choice on flipping a coin ?

627
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm taking a cue from Benjamin.

628
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,910
Impulsive, hont... It's my new motto.

629
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,450
Benjamin died.

630
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,650
He wasn't impulsive, Meredith.
He wasn't honest.

631
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,590
He was sick and brain damaged.

632
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,990
And now he's dead.

633
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,110
Mr. Hernandez.

634
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,370
Uh, may I ?

635
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,730
You--you okay ?

636
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,890
Your son, he's gonna be fine.

637
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,480
He was off with his friends.

638
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,640
I let him go off with that thing.

639
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,460
I knew better.
I knew better.

640
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,040
his friend, he has this driveway up on a hill.

641
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,710
I just keep picturing him.

642
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,000
I keep picturing him going down that hill and...

643
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,120
and I didn't stop him, and I should stopped him.

644
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,510
Kids spin outta control sometimes.

645
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,990
They...
spin outta control.

646
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,100
- You can't--
- Yes, you can.

647
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,170
You can control them.

648
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,400
It's your job as a parent to control them.

649
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,880
Ever since he divorce, I only get
to see him every other weekend.

650
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,410
I never woulda bought him that luge.

651
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,740
I never woulda let him go off
on his own that way before.

652
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,830
I went soft.

653
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,890
I went soft when he needed me to be the father.

654
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,040
I wish I'd had more fun.

655
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,360
I didn't want to be a slut.

656
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,710
Didn't want to be a tramp.

657
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,090
Didn't have any fun.

658
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,360
My ex-husband, he had fun--

659
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,990
All sorts of fun with all sorts of
women who were a lot more fun than me.

660
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,030
Nobody ever called him a slut.

661
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,500
Why is that ?

662
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,100
Men can do it, but women can't.

663
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,180
Women can.
I know some who do.

664
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,660
Not without getting called names.

665
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,870
What do you care what people call you ?

666
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,300
I get called an ass.
I don't care.

667
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,780
I don't think you're an ass.

668
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,650
I don't think you're a slut.

669
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,170
Do you have a girlfriend, Alex ?

670
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,970
No, no girlfriend.

671
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,960
So you're single ?

672
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,190
Yes, definitely.

673
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,680
- I'm single.
- I'm single, too.

674
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,860
And I'm very bad at this,
never having had any practice.

675
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,330
So, um, I am...

676
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,310
I'm gonna go into the bathroom, and
if I find myself alone in there after two minutes,

677
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,700
i'll just touch up my makeup and come back out.

678
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:40,060
but should you have any interest in fulfilling
the wish of a potentially dying woman,

679
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,650
you know where I'll be.

680
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,170
Getting some exercise, Dr.Torres ?

681
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,570
Yes. Yes. Sir. Chief Webber/

682
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

683
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,670
Finn.

684
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,680
Derek.

685
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,540
Thanks for coming.

686
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,050
Both of you, thanks for coming.

687
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,570
So here's the thing...

688
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,260
I like you.

689
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,860
And I like you.

690
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,740
And I thought I had a choice to make.

691
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,200
I thought I had to decide.

692
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,500
But I think I owe myself the
chance to consider my options.

693
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,020
- Options ?
- Options ?

694
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,410
There's this thing that allows
for the considering of options.

695
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,050
In the olden days, they called it dating.

696
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,030
- Dating.
- Yes.

697
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,670
I'd like to try that.

698
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,600
- You wanna try dating.
- Yes.

699
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,420
- Both of us ?
- Yes.

700
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,080
And I understand if you're not up for it.

701
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,830
But I really hope you are.

702
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,300
You bowing out ?

703
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,130
No. You ?

704
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,750
I don't think so.

705
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,450
You're here first, you get all the best cases.

706
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,100
Trauma comes in the middle
of the night, you get first dibs.

707
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,220
Exactly.

708
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,840
Yeah, I respect it, I did.

709
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,830
And also, I can't have it.

710
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,220
And you know that.

711
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,350
You're throwing me out ?

712
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,550
Got no choice.

713
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,130
This violates all sorts of codes, and you know it.

714
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,080
So I have to go, but you're allowed to live in your office ?

715
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,400
You noticed that, huh ?

716
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,330
Yeah, I'm pretty observant.

717
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,220
Guess if I'm throwing you out,
I have to follow my own rule.

718
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,100
Okay, I'm jealous.

719
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,410
But I have a right to be jealous, because I don't
want other guys touching your panties.

720
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,890
Great.
It's great.

721
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,750
- You might wanna clear that up.
- Yes, sir.

722
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,510
********ut,dana ?

723
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,320
Gotta get back to the hospital, Joe.

724
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,350
Gotta go kick this cancer's ass.

725
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,930
Okay.

726
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,330
********

727
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,770
Hey, Alex.

728
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,690
Uh, about today...

729
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,090
Dr.Bailey, you were right.

730
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,250
I...I shouldn't be getting physical with patients.

731
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,590
The body is a slave to its impulses.

732
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't know if it's gonna get better, mama.

733
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,550
Well, I do, baby.
I do know.

734
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,630
Cristina, it's late.

735
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,430
Preston needs his sleep.

736
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,810
But the thing that makes us human...

737
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
I'm sorry, Mrs. Burke.

738
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,970
I was just coming in to see if either of you
needed anything before I went home for the evening.

739
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,310
is what we can control.

740
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,590
We're fine.

741
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,510
Good night, Preston.

742
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,500
Sleep well.

743
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,370
Hang in there.

744
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,100
After the storm...
After the rush...

745
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,930
After the heat of the moment has passed...

746
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,510
- The panties ?
- Yeah.

747
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,210
- Not mine.
- Yeah ?

748
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,110
- The jealousy ?
- Yeah.

749
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,190
Insanely hot.

750
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,790
What's with the suitcase ?

751
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:40,820
We can cool off and clean up the messes we've made.

752
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,800
I'm busy, you guys.
Leave me alone.

753
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,290
Izzie.

754
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,280
I went soft.

755
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,460
I...

756
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:22,820
had a baby, and I swore it wouldn't change me, 
but it, it does change you.

757
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,970
I got tired, I got busy, and I stopped teaching.

758
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,480
I stopped teaching when you needed a teacher the most.

759
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,430
- You couldn't have stopped me.
- Yes, I could've.

760
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,890
You couldn't have stopped you, but I could have.

761
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,950
And in the past,I would have.

762
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,880
I went soft.

763
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,010
and I'm partly to blame for what happened, so...

764
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,370
I want you to come back.

765
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,710
you will talk to the chief.

766
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:12,270
We'll work it out, because you're talented,
and you're capable, and we all make mistakes,

767
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,660
And... and it's enough muffins.

768
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,210
We can try to let go of what was...

769
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,280
I thought you were room service.

770
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,800
I feel terrible.

771
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm not proud of what I did.

772
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,300
You deserve better.

773
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,900
And I'm sorry about the...

774
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,300
sorry about the panties...

775
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,730
and the prom.

776
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,910
I...I'm sorry I did that.

777
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,510
Yeah.

778
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,340
I'm sorry you did that, too.

779
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,090
Our marriage is over.

780
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,590
Yeah, I guess it is.

781
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,920
It's all my fault.

782
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,590
God, this is incredibly sad.

783
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,420
I'm incredibly sad.

784
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,700
And then again...

785
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,380
Oh.

786
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,030
Well, this is awkward.

787
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,380
I feel much better now.
