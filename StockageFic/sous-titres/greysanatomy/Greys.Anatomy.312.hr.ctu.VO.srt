00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,915
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:03,491
You're watching me sleep again?

3
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:04,935
It's just that, .. you snore a little ..

4
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:09,750
Harold O’Malley, 63 .. Scheduled for ..
a transhiatal esophagectomy
tomorrow morning at 9.

5
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,579
I want that you take the tumor out.

6
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,463
As things progress with my dad ..
It will help me if you were straight
with me

7
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:16,271
Okay

8
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:18,282
so, that's it ?
we're closing him and back up?

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,523
- No.
- but, i thought ..

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,723
the patient asked us .. to proceed

11
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:24,139
You would have watch his kidneys.
Because if the kidneys fail, ...

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,849
that's a sign that
everything else is starting to go

13
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,344
130cc of shiny yellow urine!

14
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:29,784
That is fantastic!

15
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:34,237
Heather Douglas, 17.
Past medical history of VATER syndrome.

16
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,903
i think i could significantly
help with this spinal curvature.

17
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:37,973
I get to scrub in.

18
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:39,128
No, until I say so

19
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,411
I deposited the damm check

20
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,562
Insurance bastards.

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,233
the surgery's too experimental.

22
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:45,430
Looks like there won't be a surgery
to scrub in on.

23
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,555
Sorry, Stevens.

24
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,417
You don't get the high-horse
this week, Addison.

25
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:49,767
Not this week.

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,773
Dr Burke's hand ..
has he had any tremors?

27
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:52,948
Talk to him.

28
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:53,991
No, because then he wins.

29
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:57,082
My father's here.
The one i don't talk to and barely know.

30
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,035
He's here.

31
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,337
If you want to go back to plastics ..

32
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:01,246
Nahh ....

33
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,668
Oh! Just ..
shut it off, please!

34
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,800
Could you not snap at me?

35
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:21,829
I didn't sleep much.

36
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,948
Maybe it's because you were too busy
shoving me every five minutes.

37
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:27,821
I wasn't shoving you.
I was nudging you to stop the very ..

38
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:30,210
loud sawing of wood.

39
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,292
I wore the nose strip.

40
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:33,899
Oh, it's cute, but it doesn't work

41
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:35,699
- Aouhh!
- What?

42
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,130
- You need to shave.
- Uhm

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,627
Izzie, uh, the, the-the, the, 
the check .. 

44
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:01,528
the, it's not, uh, it's--it's not-- 
Did you--did you drop it?

45
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,013
Here, Move,move,ve. 
No, Did you-- not--it--it's not here!
Izzie, it's not here!

46
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,306
I depositied it. Okay?

47
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,739
You didn't deposit it in the garbage disposal
or something like that, did you?

48
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:17,272
It's at the bank. Ok, George?
Now, you shut up about it already.

49
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,624
It's at, it's at the bank?
It's, it's earning interest?

50
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,127
Did I not just say,
"shut up about it already"?

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,975
Izzie! It's really now... I mean..
That money, it could .. Money could travel.

52
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,207
It could, it could buy things.
It could buy many, many things.. That's ..

53
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,887
It's a lot of money, Izzie!

54
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,281
Shut out about it, George!

55
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,524
I'm just sayin'... I'm just sayin'...

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,541
Life is short, You know, it's .. cancer happens,
and surgery happens, and, eh ..

57
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:52,624
I-- you know, it's-it's
"gather ye rosebuds"...

58
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,825
You know,
you have 8.7 million rosebuds, Izzie.

59
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,905
You gotta spend some rosebuds.
That's what i'm saying.

60
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,560
You made me burn my french toast.

61
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:07,985
You can buy new french toast!

62
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:33,116
- Oh!
- Hey. Uh, I was, uh ...

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,909
Yeah, I was just, uh, just  ...

64
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,660
- The baby's doing ..?
- Good! Yeah, she's good.

65
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:40,301
- Good! That's, That's good!
- Yeah ...

66
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:40,897
Doctors?

67
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:41,565
- Yes?
- What?

68
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,616
I was wondering ...
The baby looks ...?

69
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,655
- Good! Yeah, she's good!
- Good! Yes, she's good!

70
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:47,459
Good! She looks good.

71
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:48,955
- Yes, she's She's, uh...
- She's good?

72
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,646
She, She's out of the woonds?

73
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,205
She is. She is, uh ...

74
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,312
She's good.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,374
She is out of the woods.
Her vitals are strong.

76
00:03:56,466 --> 00:04:01,888
Uh, she made it through the night,
and she's, uh ... she's a fighter!

77
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:04,498
So-So, I can tell my wife and my daughter?

78
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,516
You can.
And, you should.

79
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,798
Oh! Thank you. 
Thank you both .. so much.

80
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,630
Yeah!,
No, she's out of the woods.

81
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:33,034
How am I related to that man?

82
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:35,023
What yu mean?

83
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,176
Look at him. He's a mess.

84
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,212
Yeah!

85
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:43,993
I mean he's a disaster. He's a
stammering, mumbling, clumsy disaster

86
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:49,102
with whom I have absolutely nothing in common.
Not one thing.

87
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,181
I hate to break this to you..

88
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,300
What?

89
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:59,608
Well, you know, you do your own share
of stammering yourself.

90
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:03,233
- Yeah, that nervous talking thing you do?
It's actually a lot like him.
- Mmhmm. Mmhmm.

91
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,075
No, it's not.

92
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,074
- Plus, that messy thing.
- Oh, totally.

93
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:08,628
You're the messy one.

94
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,005
No, my apartment's messy,
my locker's messy, ..

95
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,811
but, I am not messy....

96
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,855
Sometimes, you know, you have
like food and stuff in your hair.

97
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,388
Yeah, food.
Band-aids on your face.

98
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,120
I can still kinda see the indentation from
the nose strip you were wearing last night.

99
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:28,618
You, .. are in a relationship with no words.

100
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,916
And you are a millionaire
in twenty dollar shoes. Whatever!

101
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,641
- Oh , my god!
- She's just like him.

102
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:38,303
Right!!

103
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,597
- Dr Bailey, you paged me?
- Yes,i did.

104
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,093
We're going to proceed with
heather's surgery, as scheduled.

105
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,363
The insurance company changed their mind?

106
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,582
No. Better.

107
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:56,946
It seems an anonymous donor has offered
to foot heather's entire bill.

108
00:05:57,077 --> 00:06:00,973
Well! That is incredible.
You're a very lucky girl.

109
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:05,299
Hey, that's the first time anyone's
ever said that sentence to me in my entire life.

110
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,359
I like it.

111
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:25,009
You spent 300 grands,
so you could scrub in on this surgery?

112
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,327
No.

113
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,111
No?

114
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,725
I spent the three  ..
Have you seen that girl?

115
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,912
Her life is miserable.
She's deseparate, she's, she's ..

116
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,072
she'll, she'll never have a date,
she'll never wear high heels

117
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:40,315
she'll never feel normal,

118
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:44,415
I-I spent 300 grand because ..
It-It's a good thing.

119
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,825
I was hoping you tell me
you spent the money..

120
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,510
so you could scrub in.

121
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:55,757
But, I ..

122
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:59,939
You need to decide, whether or not,
you are a surgeon, because .. th ..

123
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:07,975
thing you did, this is lovely and generous, and,
i'm not trying to away from any of that, but ..

124
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:11,488
You are, once again, overly involved,
Once again, ..

125
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,687
you are personally involved, so..

126
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:18,097
No, I'm sorry, you cannot scrub in.

127
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:36,778
<i>Grey's Anatomy  312 - Six Days, Part 2</i>

128
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,066
George kissed me. Yesterday.

129
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,470
One minute, he's holding a urine bag,
the next minute, he's kissing me.

130
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,685
You think he's just freaking out about his dad?

131
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:56,963
Oh, you're right, you're right.

132
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,678
He's probably just freaking out.
I shouldn't hold him to it.

133
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:01,567
- Oh, man!
- What?

134
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,585
Did you not just hear a word I said?

135
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,189
I'm pouring my heart out here.

136
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,679
Jeez, it's all about you. Isn't it?

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,075
It's all about
.. everything's about Addison.

138
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,667
I aborted Mark's baby.

139
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,271
It is all about you. Floor is all yours.

140
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:32,657
About eight months ago, 
I ... peed on a stick,...

141
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:40,355
and I wasn't even, uh, ..
gonna tell him but then I did...

142
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:49,219
tell him. And, uh, he went out and bought this
insane Yankee's onesie ..

143
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:56,059
and a calendar, and marked the due date,
which I should mention, was today.

144
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,479
You didn't want a baby?

145
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:03,744
I wanted Derek.
I wanted to have a baby with Derek.

146
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,869
I never thought I'd end up alone.

147
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,853
You have not "ended up" anywhere.

148
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,871
Yeah, yu're right, I know,
it's just that, um,

149
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,990
sometimes it feels that way, you know?

150
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:23,175
This is one of those weeks it feels that way.

151
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,630
Drill.

152
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,683
Another screw, please.

153
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,291
Hey, how's your old man?

154
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,178
His urine output's holding steady.
Mostly it's steady today, which is good.

155
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:46,086
Have you seen Burke, today?

156
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,484
Even if I did, like you,
I still wouldn't tell you that.

157
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,964
How can you be okay with burke,
but not Cristina?

158
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,495
Her career wasn't on the line when she lied to me.

159
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:59,113
Why don't you just ask Burke about the hand yourself?

160
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,607
But, I-I am not talking to him.
He owes me.

161
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:02,907
What?

162
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:03,928
Oh, I don't know.

163
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:05,911
So, you're together
but you don't talk to each other.

164
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:06,561
Uh huh.

165
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,698
I wish I could find that in a woman.

166
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,700
Hey, how's it going with Addison?

167
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:16,923
What? What, wha-what y do? what do y,
 what do y, what do y-you mean by that?

168
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,827
Laura Grey, tiny baby.

169
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:23,298
Laura. the baby, right,
She's, she's um, doing fine.

170
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,307
She's doing well.

171
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:27,712
I gotta get, yo know.. 
I gotta get back to Sloan.

172
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:33,275
What are you plotting?
and can I get in on it?

173
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:37,893
- Shut up.
- Oh!! - God!!

174
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,496
Ahh... this is my surgery,
I should be down, here.

175
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:48,072
- No!
- Escuse me.

176
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:51,990
Mr O’Malley...

177
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,441
- 9.1.1 ?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,474
It sucks.

179
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,067
Yeah...

180
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,410
Could you give me the retractor?

181
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:05,121
Um, Dr. Shepperd,
can you proceed without me?

182
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:10,577
Are you kidding me? This is your surgery,
Torres. This is your find, you want to leave?

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,601
I-I'm, I don't, but, eh, yes, I'm sorry 
But if it's all right, I need to leave.

184
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:19,702
Give me some sponges.

185
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:26,151
Okay, i called the family in,
because, i need to ..

186
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,970
perform a procedure, um, on your father,
to help him breathe.

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,467
Uhm, So, so you're saying,
he can't breathe?

188
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:39,146
Uh, With the, extensive surgery, 
uh, your father,

189
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,975
is not breathing on his own.
Which is why we still have him intubated.

190
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:42,814
Intubated?

191
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,200
The tube in dad's mouth.
It's breathing for him.

192
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:47,614
And right now, that tube has a kink,

193
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,974
in it, which is straining his breathing.

194
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,774
How did it get a kink in it?

195
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,942
It just happens, mam,
We don't always know why.

196
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:58,584
But, but he's doing good, today..
I mean, he made--he made plenty of pee, so...

197
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,860
Still, we need to replace the tube.

198
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,923
So, why don't you just do it?
I mean, what are we waiting for?

199
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:09,360
Ok. With the damage to your father's oesophagus
and the swelling in his throat ...

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,926
from being intubated all this time ,...

201
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:14,685
You might no be able to get it in ..
the new tube?

202
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:22,228
Under this circustumcies,
it can be a complicate procedure

203
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,247
if i am not succesfull...

204
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:30,547
I am saying, uh, you need, ..
to prepare yourselves.

205
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:53,949
What is that?

206
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,985
It's Jerry.

207
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,763
I'm sorry, I'm nervous

208
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:58,543
Oh, God!

209
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,314
- My God!
- Stop it, Jerry!

210
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:02,744
I'm nervous!

211
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,033
For God, sick!
take some charcoal or something, son.

212
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,134
- Tyler!
- Yeah?

213
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:23,947
Could you let dr.Burke know that
Mr. O'malley is having some kind...

214
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:27,361
of medical crisis right now,
and I thought he would like to know.

215
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,037
He is awake, you know?

216
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,147
Yeah, I know.

217
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,407
You want to handle this, chief?

218
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,085
Dr. Bailey, you have a lot more
hands on hours these days than i do

219
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,173
I'll be standing by to help,
but this is all yours.

220
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:49,074
All right, Grey, let me have 8.0 E.T, tube?

221
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:52,453
Dr. Bailey, this is a patient,
like any other patient,

222
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:56,857
There is no room for error, which means,
there's no room for nerves

223
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:58,738
so shake it off.

224
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,498
All right,
let's do this.

225
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,155
- great
- 8-0.

226
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,218
- I can't, uh ...
- is it too tight?

227
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,697
I can't get past the vocal chords.
Damn it.

228
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,952
- Pulse ox down 88...
- Damn it!

229
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:23,008
86 Come on!
Lets go! ,Lets go!, Lets go!

230
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:25,312
Let me have a 7 1/2.

231
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,521
Hurry!

232
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:29,822
Oh! Come on, come on, come on!

233
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:31,138
Good!

234
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,455
- let me get a !
- okay,I got it.

235
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,851
Beautiful job.
Beautiful job....

236
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,469
Oh, can I go tell george?

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,113
Dr. Bailey, you're all right?

238
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:59,203
My son .. he's named after his son.
I just need a minute.

239
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,623
There is a surgery, you know?
It's a minor laser thing.

240
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,429
Supposed to really help.
We could look into it.

241
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,803
Sure, and while we're at it,
let's look at halitosis cures for you.

242
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,150
Not to mention stubble cures,

243
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:25,004
Because, it's now become physically
impossible for me to kiss your face.

244
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,479
I am too tired to shave!

245
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:32,613
Sloan! Dr. Sloan!

246
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:35,570
Bone dry Capuccino
And I watched 'em make it this time so no mistakes.

247
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,104
Hey, I-I noticed you had a reconstructive rhinoplasty
on the board today,

248
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,566
and I'd--I'd really like to scrub in if at all possible.

249
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,800
You been working with addison this week?

250
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,140
Yes, sir, working.
Working ...a lot.

251
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:54,163
Working hard.
Just ...working

252
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:59,720
- Is she miserable?
- I'm sorry?

253
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:08,765
It's just ... I need to know if she's...
at least miserable this week.

254
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:12,397
Did she seem... is she miserable?

255
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,780
Oh, dude, she's awful.
She's torturing me.

256
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,603
I seriously have to get away from that woman.

257
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:21,785
I mean, she is completely
and utterly, 100% miserable.

258
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:24,528
Good.

259
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,456
- So can I scrub in?
- No!

260
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:35,360
Are you sleeping?

261
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,440
I should be.
I haven't slept in days.

262
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:44,592
me neither. I can't sleep alone anymore.

263
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,948
I used to sleep just fine, and then he...

264
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,004
God, he gets me all strung
out on him, and then he disappears?

265
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,162
He didn't disappear.
He's in an hospital.

266
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:01,229
- I just want to know how he's doing.
- You could just ask him.

267
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,503
Uh, he could just tell me.

268
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:12,095
Georgie's dad is going into renal failure.

269
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:13,396
I heard.

270
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,138
My dad's here, everywhere, every day.

271
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:20,858
He's perfectly healthy,
and I have nothing to say to him.

272
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,692
- If george's dad dies...
- I know.

273
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,780
If thatcher died,
my life wouldn't be any different.

274
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,263
Is it weird that I'm a little jealous of George?

275
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,014
Yes.

276
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:51,704
Bailey re-intubated him, but um, he was
without ox-oxygen for, I don't know, a few minutes.

277
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:57,308
- O'Malley... there's no blame here.
- No ..

278
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:02,528
Your father's body is diseased
and has undergone tremendous trauma.

279
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:09,801
Now, his organs are shutting down.
There's no blame here.

280
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,858
Do people come back from this?

281
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:17,441
His B.U.N. and creatinine are high.
I get that.

282
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:24,293
I was just wondering, in--in your experience,
can people come back from this?

283
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:33,217
I don't have any statistics....
I don't have any more medicine for you.

284
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,980
- Now, it's about faith.
- We're men of science.

285
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:46,067
In my experience,
science is not enough, OMalley...

286
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,513
But if you want me, to hope with you...

287
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:57,149
if you'd like me to send up a prayer,
that is a thing I'll be happy to do.

288
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:16,218
- You have family here?
- Yeah, a daughter.. She's 17...

289
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,619
oh, I'm so sorry...

290
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:24,249
She had surgery on her spine.
And they said it went well.

291
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:31,607
But then she has trouble with her kidneys and...
well, she hasn't woken up.

292
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:37,626
- My husband either.
- It was a dangerous surgery.

293
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,260
- They told us that.
- My husband's, too.

294
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:48,475
He has...cancer, so... 
I was surprised when they went through with it.

295
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,491
I thought I'd be taking him home.

296
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:02,664
Excuse me, mrs.Douglas?
Heather is asking for you.

297
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:07,023
- She woke up?
- She did.... And she looks great.

298
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,632
Congratulations!
It's wonderful!

299
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:16,534
- Good luck. I'll... good luck.
- Thanks!

300
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,559
- What did you do it?
- Dr. O'Malley!

301
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,392
What did you do the surgery
once you saw the cancer had spread?

302
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:36,224
- George...
- He asked you? Right?

303
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,364
He asked you to do it no matter what?

304
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:43,379
We have to honour our patient's wishes.

305
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:50,753
You said that you will be straight with me ...

306
00:20:53,626 --> 00:21:01,163
He-he could've live for .. weeks, .. or months!
We could've months with him.

307
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,952
My Mom!
She could've months with him!

308
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:08,647
- He wanted to fight the cancer, George, It was his choice...
- He didn't know any better!

309
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:12,962
You knew better!

310
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:22,949
You shouldn't done it!
You shouldn't done it.

311
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:45,043
- Oh, my God! Look at you!
- I'm miserable.

312
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,219
it's the rain... the constant dampnes in the air.

313
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:54,365
- It takes the body a while to adjust.
- I don't want to adjust.

314
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,440
Then go home.

315
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:02,809
If you'd had the baby,
we'd be together in New York right now;

316
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,465
it wouldn't be raining and even if it was,
we wouldn't care because we'd be together.

317
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,742
We'd be together.
And I'd have a family ..

318
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,106
instead of walking pneumonia,

319
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,469
and an ex-best friend who hates me.

320
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,653
You didn't want to raise a child, Mark.

321
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,654
You just wanted to trump Derek,
You wanted to win.

322
00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:19,741
Don't make this my fault.

323
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,165
- You didn't want a baby.
- No, I did .. want a baby, Mark!

324
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,193
That last woman you slept with before I left New York

325
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:34,837
Charlene, the peds nurse? I--did you think
that she was the only one I knew about?

326
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,638
You're rewriting history, Mark.

327
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,973
We wouldn't still be together.
We weren't a great couple.

328
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:45,670
And you would've made...
a terrible father ..

329
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:54,756
Mark, .. I did want a baby. It did. I just...
I just didn't want one with you.

330
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,606
What? Is that his lunch?
I've been looking everywhere for that.

331
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,519
- Oh,no. He can't have that.
- What?

332
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,849
- He's, uh, restricted from food.
- No, he's not...

333
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,250
- No,I'm his doctor.
- You are not!

334
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,491
I just want to know how he is.

335
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,732
And withholding food gets her that how?

336
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:53,865
- Fine. Feed him... Whatever!
- You want me to call security?

337
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:13,112
- Hey!
- Hey!

338
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,858
Haven't seen you the last couple of days.

339
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:20,164
Yeah, I was covering the pit, and, uh,

340
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,808
I got pulled into an emergency appy and a ruptured spleen.
It's been pretty chaotic.

341
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:31,285
Look, Karev, I'm your attending.
I'm sorry about what happened.

342
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:36,779
It's been a ...
a weird week, for me.

343
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,872
so, normally, ..
anyway, I apologize.

344
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,701
The baby's, uh, bowels functioning yet?

345
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:53,341
Uh, yeah, actually, um...
she had her first diaper change today, so...

346
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:56,929
- that's good!
- Yeah, it is.

347
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,929
That neighbor kid, Mike Wildon,
I did hit him in the face with a stick.

348
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:34,828
Um..
when his dad came over and was yelling and ..

349
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,807
and, you asked me if it was true ...

350
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:42,165
I lied.

351
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:49,703
And you thought I never lied.
So you took my side, ..

352
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:54,007
and you and his dad got in that big fight.

353
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:57,751
And then his kids egged our house, and then

354
00:25:57,752 --> 00:26:02,866
Ronny and Jerry went over
and blew up his lawn mower.

355
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:10,640
Anyway. I did it. He was teasing me,

356
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,197
and he was bigger than me.

357
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,846
So, I needed a stick to reach his face.

358
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,210
And I lied to you dad.

359
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:35,876
So, ..
I'm saying I'm sorry.

360
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,731
Dad ...

361
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,880
If you have any more fight in you,

362
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:57,811
if you could fight this thing just... 
just a little harder, that would be good. 

363
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,612
That'd be good right now.

364
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:20,761
- Where is Derek?
- He slept at his place

365
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,031
Do i really snore?

366
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:27,491
Well, I grew up next to a freeway,
so it doesn't really bother me,

367
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:28,951
but, yeah, you do.

368
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,168
Did you get any sleep last night?

369
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:34,169
No...

370
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:38,822
No, I stayed up last night baking
and cleaning the bathroom floor, ..

371
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,766
in case George wants to lay down on it.

372
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:45,911
It's weird.
I have all this money. I..

373
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,145
I have all this money,
and i would spend every penny of it

374
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:54,354
to save george from what he's
about to go through, but I.. I can't.

375
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:59,988
It's useless.
So, I made cobbler.

376
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,851
- Well, cobbler's good.
- Yeah!

377
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:26,877
She told you.

378
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:28,962
Hum...

379
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,163
Yeah.

380
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:41,896
- You think I'd be a terrible father?
- Oh, I don't.. I don't know .. are you?

381
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,229
Okay, do you like kids?

382
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:49,032
I don't know.
It depends on how loud they are.

383
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,312
Okay, .. do you like your family?
I mean, are you a family kind of guy?

384
00:28:54,747 --> 00:29:00,455
I don't really have a family.
Derek ...  was my family.

385
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:06,644
Okay, well, what about birthdays and
anniversaries. Do you remember
those sorts of things?

386
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,615
No. I don't know.
Sometimes.

387
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,360
- Hum...
- Isn't it the same with all men?

388
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:21,509
No. Some men just like kids.
To uh, to some men, family is everything.

389
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,843
Right...
And you know these men?

390
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,955
I do. .. I know one.

391
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:41,941
I would've made a terrible father.

392
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:52,834
You're saying ..
you're saying it's not getting better.

393
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,671
You're saying he's not gonna wake up?

394
00:29:56,206 --> 00:30:00,908
Mrs O'Malley... All of his organs ar shutting down.

395
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:05,431
His liver and his kidneys are no longer supporting him

396
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:09,802
And, he his entirely dependant upon his life support machines

397
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:12,407
We are saying he is not going to wake up.

398
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:19,105
You can keep him on .. life support
and wait for nature to take its course

399
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,877
That could take .. days .. or weeks ..

400
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:28,464
Or, you can ... take him off, life support.

401
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,676
- Unplug him?
- Yes, Ma'am.

402
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:40,498
- Georgie!
- Yeah.

403
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,091
What do you think?

404
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:52,928
Dad is in pain.
His organs were shutting down.

405
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:56,078
He can't breath with his own.
It's painful.

406
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:04,686
And he's on medication, but ..
medication can't only do so much

407
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:11,684
You think ...
You're saying you think it's time ...

408
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,887
.. to let him go?

409
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:31,008
We can't tell you what to do, here, Georges.

410
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,658
He is not Dad like this.

411
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,118
and he's not gonna wake up, mom...

412
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,716
No!!

413
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:35,012
Is there a drawer of
unopened cards, somewhere?

414
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:37,490
I'm sorry. What?

415
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:44,591
I just wanted to know... I've only ever heard
my mother's version of the story
of why you left and ...

416
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:50,448
And I was just wondering,
if maybe you have a side, that I hadven't heard.

417
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,666
Your mother moved to Boston.
And uh, .. I wanted to..

418
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:10,926
but she told me not .. to call
or come around and ... uh, she-she was.. um

419
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,945
eventually, I re-married
and I...

420
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:29,651
I'm-I'm sorry.

421
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,392
- Do you snore?
- What?

422
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:39,853
It appears that, I snore.
My mother never did, so I was just...

423
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:43,990
- Forget it.
- I snore!

424
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:51,576
I snore like a trucker.
You get that from me.

425
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:57,260
The wax earplugs work pretty good.

426
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:04,940
Thanks.

427
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:20,935
Hey.

428
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,627
Derek... I was waiting on an update
on Mr. O'Malley.

429
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:32,962
I didn't want to intrude, but, uh...
Did you have an update?

430
00:34:33,797 --> 00:34:35,786
They're letting him go.

431
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,458
- Hum.
- Hum!

432
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:51,744
I haven't had any more tremors.

433
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:55,441
Not one all week.

434
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:02,816
- How about that?
- Yeah. How about that?

435
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:14,868
- I'm both.
- What?

436
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:23,146
I'm both ... I'm a surgeon and I am a person
who becomes emotionally involved.

437
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:28,345
I will never again,
cross the line like I did with Denny.

438
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,424
I have learned my lesson.
But I'm still both,

439
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:38,793
and I'm not gonna give up either part of me.
And I am not gonna to apologize for it.

440
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:10,399
There's a club...

441
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,000
The Dead Dads Club,

442
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:15,473
And you can't be in it until you're in it.

443
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:19,960
You can try to understand, you can sympathize.
But until you feel that loss...

444
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,306
My dad died when I was nine.

445
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:30,711
George.

446
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,190
I'm really sorry you had to join the club.

447
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,398
I...

448
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:51,334
I... I don't know how to .. exist in a world
where my dad doesn't.

449
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,758
Yeah, that never really changes.

450
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,729
Beer, Joe, please.

451
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,555
How is Georgie's Dad?

452
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:37,864
Hey.

453
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,912
Hey.

454
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,747
You got a dad?

455
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:53,226
Not really, not anymore.

456
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,00
