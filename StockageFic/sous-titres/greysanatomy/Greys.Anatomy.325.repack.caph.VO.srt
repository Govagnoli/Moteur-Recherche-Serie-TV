1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:01,540
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:03,268
You people are taking a test

3
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:05,930
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,507
- You want big wedding?
- Yes.

5
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:09,791
I know you think I have
feelings for you, but I don't.

6
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:12,191
Search and rescue
found those lost climbers.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,787
- One's still missing.
- Tell me the truth.

8
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,688
Do you remember?
Do you know who you are?

9
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,960
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

10
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,130
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,506
- You're adopting?
- She hasn't actually picked us yet.

12
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:23,933
This heartburn, it's like it...

13
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,983
- Fourth climber.
- Is that an ax in his head?

14
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:31,126
If Richard finds out that
you're carrying another man's baby...

15
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,189
Somebody help!

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,137
<i>Being chief
is about responsibility.</i>

17
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:43,758
Every single surgical patient
in the hospital is your patient,

18
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,546
whether you're the one
who cut them open or not.

19
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,503
Come on. She's lost a lot of blood.
<i>The scalpel stops with you.</i>

20
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,159
Start 2 large bore I.V's
and bolus 2 liters L.R.

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,976
You need to be able
to look at a family...

22
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,779
Ready? One, two...

23
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,146
And tell them your team
did everything they could

24
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:00,423
to save someone's child...

25
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,666
Get me a stat E.K.G.
And a portable chest, Brooke.

26
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,423
- She's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.
- Their husband...

27
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,442
You guys, why don't you go have
a seat in the waiting room?

28
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,475
We're not leaving her.

29
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:11,743
Their wife.

30
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:13,930
What happened?

31
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,925
I don't know.
I found her unconscious.

32
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,066
You get caught up...

33
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,512
Taking care
of other people' families.

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,046
She's lost blood,
a-a lot of blood.

35
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:26,403
And the responsibility,
it makes you...

36
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:27,940
I didn't know
she was in the hospital.

37
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,187
What was she doing here?

38
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:32,501
You take care
of other people's families...

39
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,569
<i>And you sacrifice your own.</i>

40
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,484
I thought I was gonna hate this party
game thing, but it's kinda great.

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,569
Can we set her on fire after?

42
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,950
No, we cannot.

43
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,250
Okay, these wedding vows
are not all gonna fit on here.

44
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:49,490
- Okay, then write smaller.
- Be still, please.

45
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,410
- "vow" just became "cow."
- You don't need vows on your hand.

46
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,189
When you get up there,
just speak from the heart.

47
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:56,917
Izzie,
the heart is an organ.

48
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:00,601
It pumps, it circulates blood,
it gets clogged from time to time.

49
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,608
It does not, however, speak.
It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.

50
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,476
Well, you're all
"glass totally empty."

51
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:07,331
I'm gonna like being married.

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,523
It's the wedding part
that's ridiculous.

53
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,777
- Party's over.
- Damn.

54
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,168
Hey, mine didn't go off.

55
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:16,925
Piece of crap.

56
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,784
You can do this, right?

57
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,189
Become a piece of chattel?
Sure. Looking forward to it.

58
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,964
I mean, no matter what,

59
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,955
you're walking down
that aisle today.

60
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,301
I need you
to go down that aisle.

61
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,787
Is the toilet paper
cutting off your circulation?

62
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,627
You marrying Burke,
it's a sign.

63
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,764
It's a sign that people
like you and me... can do this.

64
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,688
Be healthy, be happy.

65
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:40,392
You marrying Burke,

66
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,543
restores my faith in me.

67
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,948
Oh, I get it.

68
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,519
My wedding's about you.

69
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:47,675
- Yes.
- Okay.

70
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,322
You can do this, right?

71
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,683
I can do this.

72
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,099
Hey. They found
the fourth climber.

73
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,457
Vitals are stabilizing
after fluids, but...

74
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:00,175
- Thought he was dead.
- He was according to his friends.

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,896
- Did the C.T. show a bleed?
- Uh, we haven't done a C.T. Yet.

76
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,330
I don't understand.
You said there's a head trauma.

77
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,528
Yeah, there's been
a little head trauma.

78
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,168
Ice ax to the head.

79
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,247
What the hell happened
up on that mountain?

80
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:12,542
That's a good question.

81
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,106
You don't think it could be
uterine cancer, do you?

82
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,963
It runs in the family.

83
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:24,118
No, it's not...

84
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,766
She was in earlier.
She was in a fender bender.

85
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,391
My wife came into my hospital,
and you neglected to tell me?

86
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,006
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

87
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,927
We're still married.
She's unconscious.

88
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:39,040
There are medical decisions
to be made.

89
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,580
Legally I have a right to know.
I have a right...

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,677
She might...

91
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,232
be having a miscarriage.

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,027
She's pregnant.

93
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,032
I need to know what time
your chest pain started.

94
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,307
I don't know.

95
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,697
Yesterday afternoon.

96
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:00,271
What time exactly?
This is important.

97
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:02,913
Around 3:00.

98
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,961
What's wrong with me?

99
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,706
I'm gonna explain everything
to you. I promise.

100
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:11,495
But right now we need to get you
up to the surgical floor.

101
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,636
Surgery? But...

102
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,624
What about my babies?

103
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,413
I think those babies
are coming out today.

104
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:21,203
But I-I haven't decided.
I...

105
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,399
I haven't chosen the parents.
I need time to decide.

106
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,839
You don't need to decide
anything right now.

107
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:32,217
Right now
the most important thing

108
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:33,814
is making sure
that you are okay.

109
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,009
All right?

110
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,122
Ah, I've got a surgery,

111
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:44,855
but it shouldn't be more
than four hours, five tops.

112
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,564
- I can scrub in.
- How's Rina?

113
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:48,107
I need to get a C.T. angio,

114
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,018
but I'm pretty sure
it's a tear in her aorta.

115
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,372
Her heart is about to blow.

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,907
Most dissecting aortas
burst within 48 hours.

117
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,702
Which means we have
less than 12 hours

118
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,228
- to fix it before she's dead.
- So you need me to get the babies out.

119
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:00,609
- So I can save her life.
- You have an aortic dissection?

120
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:05,214
Hey, I promise I will make it
to the chapel in time.

121
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:07,154
I...

122
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,270
Okay.

123
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,286
Listen up. Uh, O'Malley,
you're with Shepherd and Sloan.

124
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,849
Stevens, you're with Burke.
Karev, Addison. Go.

125
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,169
Grey...

126
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,595
You are with the chief's wife.

127
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,555
- The chief's wife?
- Is pregnant.

128
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,028
Yes, I did say pregnant.

129
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,986
I recommend that you lose
the shocked look

130
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,944
and try for something
a little more dignified.

131
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:28,014
Go.

132
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,219
Who am I on?

133
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,239
Uh, I didn't page you.
Go home. Get some sleep.

134
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,439
Yeah,
but I'm here already, so...

135
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,044
You're getting married
in less than 12 hours.

136
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,287
Give us room.

137
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,603
Well, Burke's getting married, too,

138
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,072
- and he gets to operate.
- There's only one preston Burke.

139
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,301
There's only one
Cristina Yang.

140
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,045
I've given you the day off,
the whole day.

141
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,885
It's a kindness. Take it.
It's your wedding day.

142
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,876
- There'll always be more surgeries.
- But...

143
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,656
Really, what would you
rather be doing,

144
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:55,487
prepping a patient
or prepping for your wedding?

145
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,623
Go home.

146
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:06,060
I never got the sense
you really wanted the job.

147
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:09,214
Seems to me you got in the race
to play out

148
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,975
some kind of unfinished business
you had with Derek.

149
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,838
I was in this to win.

150
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,333
Sir. I don't know
if he's your new chief,

151
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,940
but if he is, he got there
because I made him fight for it.

152
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:24,193
You made them all
fight for it.

153
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,275
So I'm not gonna be chief.

154
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,305
No, you're not.

155
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:33,884
They recovered Lonnie's body?

156
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:36,321
Not his body. He's alive.

157
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:41,189
So why don't you tell me what really
happened up there on the mountain?

158
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,583
We're half way up this ice wall.

159
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,635
There's a...

160
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:55,200
There's a ledge a couple
of huned feet above us.

161
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,763
We figured
we'd set up the tents,

162
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:58,585
wait out the storm.

163
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,187
Only Lonnie's insisting
we go down the mountain.

164
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,374
I told him,
we gotta dig in,

165
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:06,129
sit tight.

166
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,228
He started freaking out,

167
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,677
keeps saying
down's the way to go.

168
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:10,528
And then, he starts climbing down.

169
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,062
We were tied together.

170
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:13,826
- And just like that...
- We're falling.

171
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:16,384
I swing out with my ice ax,

172
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,534
just trying to catch a rock.

173
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,597
And I clip Lonnie
in the back of the head.

174
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:24,638
Ax just...

175
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,118
snags.

176
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,407
We thought he was dead.

177
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:34,203
It was an accident.

178
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,086
What happened?

179
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,472
You've been unconscious
for a while.

180
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,652
- What about...
- He knows.

181
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,938
Adele, you lost a lot of blood.

182
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,315
I'm gonna try to find
a heartbeat.

183
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,637
You should prepare yourself.

184
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:04,937
Heartbeat.

185
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,609
It's a little slower,
than I'd like,

186
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,008
but once we tank you
with liquids and a transfusion,

187
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,466
it might get stronger.

188
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,491
Um, I've gotta rush off
to surgery,

189
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,420
but I will back with you
the minute I'm done.

190
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,000
- Thank you.
- Okay.

191
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,351
Adele, why didn't you tell me?

192
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:30,149
Come on, Richard.

193
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:32,934
What do you think
you would've done,

194
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:34,934
congratulate me?

195
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,502
I'm sure you have work to do.

196
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,824
I'm good right here.

197
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,840
The peds resident's on call.

198
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,403
He'll be in the O.R.
For Rina's delivery.

199
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:55,267
Great. Just make sure
they notified the nicu.

200
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,910
Hi. Sorry for interrupting.

201
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,201
Uh, the nurse said that
you're Dr. Montgomery.

202
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,732
Yes.
Can I help you with something?

203
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,066
Yeah, I'm Jeff Pope...

204
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:06,526
Rebecca's husband?

205
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,546
Rebecca?

206
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,107
Hi, Jeff.

207
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:53,826
You, uh...

208
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:57,005
Your face...

209
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,172
But it's you.

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,772
I'm so sorry, baby.

211
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,538
I should've never let you go.

212
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,876
I'll never let you go again.

213
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,497
- I have a surgery.
- I heard you're the best man.

214
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,247
Well, maid of honor,
best man, kinda perfect.

215
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,846
I know I haven't been myself lately,
but I'm me again,

216
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:34,488
so I was thinking maybe
you should sleep over,

217
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,057
because the me that I am
is horny for the you that you are.

218
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,411
I met a woman last night.

219
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,517
- You met a woman last night?
- At Joe's.

220
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,186
Nothing happened.

221
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,810
She was pretty,
I noticed, and we talked.

222
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,407
- You met a woman last night?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:51,511
So should I be
worried or something?

224
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,802
Should you be worried
that I met a woman? No.

225
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,011
Should you be worried that,

226
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,044
for me, flirting with that woman
was the highlight of my week?

227
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,082
Yeah, you should be
worried or something.

228
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,742
I don't understand.

229
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:09,361
- It's not you.
- No, I understand that part.

230
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,929
What I don't understand is why.

231
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,127
I need this job, Richard.
I need it more than the others.

232
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,981
- Addison...
- No, I need a reason to stay here.

233
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:19,619
I need a reason to get up in the morning
I need to wake up...

234
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:22,533
and not care that it's raining
or that I'm 39 and alone.

235
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:25,174
I need the job, Richard.

236
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,014
That's why.

237
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,933
If you need a job
to give you a life,

238
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,459
you either need a new job
or a new life.

239
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,763
I'm thinking four hours tops
to repair this heart,

240
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,307
if all goes well.

241
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,256
You're a lucky man, Burke.

242
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:51,171
Cristina's great.

243
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,573
She's there, she's sure.

244
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,611
She's willing to commit.

245
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:56,866
You're a lucky man.

246
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,043
And you're not?

247
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,461
There he is.

248
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:04,245
T-minus five hours.

249
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,244
And how's the best man?
Up to the challenge?

250
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,273
I was an excellent best man.

251
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:12,153
The worst case scenario is I sleep
with your wife in ten years.

252
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,066
I just checked. Chief resident
hasn't been posted yet.

253
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,379
- I wasn't looking for chief resident.
- Yeah, you were.

254
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,094
Yeah. Okay, I was.

255
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,059
What I'm about to say is,
uh, is crazy.

256
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,688
And, uh, I-I am not responsible.

257
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,616
I-I am saying this
against my will.

258
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,078
Because I am a surgeon, okay?

259
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,741
I-I love my job. I love
my life exactly as it is.

260
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,725
Okay? Exactly as it is.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

261
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:47,746
Not really.

262
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,943
I-I have no desire
to house a human being

263
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,323
in my body for nine long months
and then... and then...

264
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:53,835
And then push it out
and raise it.

265
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,844
- Okay? None. Zero.
- Okay.

266
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,514
Except housing a human,

267
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,256
for nine long months
is all that I can think about.

268
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:03,000
It... It...
The thoughts are invading

269
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,733
the surgeries that I love,
and it's...

270
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,517
It's... It's hormonal.

271
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:08,457
It's... And horrible.

272
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,368
But it is happening...

273
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,393
To me.

274
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:15,734
You want to have a baby?

275
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,057
Apparently.

276
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:21,983
There's a guy with an ax
in his head.

277
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,500
Right. So go.

278
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,917
I'm a freak.
Just go. Just run. Just...

279
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,176
- Thank you.
- Please.

280
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:30,867
Go. I'm fine.

281
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,944
Take your pill...
and drink your water.

282
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,341
Richard, you know
you wanna go out that door

283
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,181
and start bossing
some people around.

284
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,815
Take your pill, Adele.

285
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:45,979
See?

286
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,280
I can do my bossing
right from this chair.

287
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,203
Go ahead, Richard, ask.

288
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,522
I know you are dying to know
whose baby...

289
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:01,874
Not really my place.

290
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,174
Mrs. Webber...

291
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,869
Your room is ready.

292
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,470
Excuse me,
but what do you want to do

293
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,452
about the announcement
for chief of surgery?

294
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,841
Look...

295
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:16,052
I will be right back.

296
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,479
I promise.

297
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,345
We've met before.

298
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:26,899
You probably don't remember.

299
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,431
You were little.

300
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,846
My husband always flirted
with your mother.

301
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,339
I didn't want to see that, so...

302
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,387
I watched you a lot,

303
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,396
watched you grow up.

304
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,251
You turned out well.

305
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,551
I'm sorry about your mother.

306
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,571
I'm...

307
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,634
sorry about my mother, too.

308
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:54,898
It wasn't your fault.

309
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,098
Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.

310
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:00,832
You get married at 25
thinking, this is it,

311
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,803
happily ever after.

312
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,237
Maybe there is
no happily ever after.

313
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:10,809
It's stunning.

314
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:12,667
It's a little...

315
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,515
Um, is it supposed to be so tight?

316
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,380
Well, it's a choker.

317
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:18,888
It's beautiful.

318
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,992
It's really, really beautiful.

319
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:25,062
I just don't know if it's me.

320
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,283
Five generations of Burke women

321
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,861
have worn this
on their wedding day.

322
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:31,916
It's a way of...

323
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,277
joing our family,
becoming a Burke.

324
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:36,985
A Burke.

325
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,204
I'm afraid
I misjudged you early on.

326
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,481
I thought you were selfish.

327
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:43,880
But you've given way

328
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,752
to Preston's ideas
about the wedding,

329
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,065
and you've been flexible
about the things that are...

330
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,166
most important to him.

331
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,273
And that is wonderful.

332
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,831
Oh! It's just...

333
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:01,355
What were you planning to do
about your eyebrows?

334
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:04,671
Nothing.

335
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:09,997
How's she doing?

336
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,367
B.P.'s 92 over 56.

337
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,284
How'd the reunion go

338
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,127
- with Jane Doe's husband?
- Whatever.

339
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,036
He cried like a baby.
She looked bored.

340
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,751
Don't go overboard
with compassion, Karev.

341
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,997
She's not even sure
if she wants to stay with the guy.

342
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,657
- It's complicated.
- It's not actually... complicated.

343
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,178
They're married.
She took a vow.

344
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,354
You don't mess with vows.
Married is married.

345
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,563
Game over.
So freakin' over.

346
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:36,824
Just an opinion.

347
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,636
Pressure's dropped to 60.

348
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:40,341
She's bleeding out.
Addison, how much longer?

349
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,487
Rupturing the membrane now.

350
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,125
I just need 2 minutes
to get these babies out.

351
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,932
Make it one. She's flatlined.
Stevens, start compressions.

352
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:47,958
Got the first one out.
Clamp.

353
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:49,405
Come on, come on.

354
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,661
Second baby's out.
Okay, go.

355
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,712
Boki, 10-blade.

356
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:00,474
Poor guy...
he just wanted to climb a mountain,

357
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,681
and he ends up
with an ax in his head.

358
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:04,392
He shouldn't have tried turning back.

359
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,575
The group is going up,
you move with the group.

360
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,256
- Okay, drill, please.
- He panicked.

361
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,192
You have a right to turn back
if you're scared.

362
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:12,192
No, you don't.
You chose to climb a mountain.

363
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:14,408
You can't change your mind
in the middle of the climb.

364
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,493
Okay.
Now we pull it out?

365
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,484
Ah, yeah, but the ax went in
as they fell,

366
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,203
so there will be some tearing,

367
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,681
it should be a shallow wound,

368
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,494
and it should come out easily.

369
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:30,578
You got it?

370
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,740
All right, everybody.
Here we go. Ready?

371
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,820
Okay, one, two...

372
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,477
three.

373
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:45,798
That's strange.

374
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,935
One...

375
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,686
two...

376
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,984
Three!

377
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:58,849
That's a clean cut.

378
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,679
Thought you said
there was gonna be tearing.

379
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,652
I know.
It doesn't make sense.

380
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,164
You are a lucky guy.

381
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:09,779
Or the ax didn't go in there
by accident.

382
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,413
It's probably unfair,

383
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,878
but I hold you
to a higher standard.

384
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,284
And you let me down
this year, Preston.

385
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:24,393
After you got shot,
the tremor...

386
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,380
This job is about making
the tough calls.

387
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,818
Sometime the toughest call
you can make

388
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,774
is admitting
when you're in over your head.

389
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:35,511
You don't do that.

390
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,379
You know a lot, Preston.

391
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,914
You're one of the best surgeons
I know...

392
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,142
One of the best men.

393
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,562
But you're not perfect.

394
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,325
You don't know everything.

395
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:58,110
I want to give you the job.

396
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:01,774
I want to.

397
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:05,899
But I can't.

398
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:12,971
Preston.

399
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,368
I have a wedding to get to.

400
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,915
Thank you.

401
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,664
Yeah. The babies are doing great.

402
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:23,857
They're in the nicu.

403
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,566
How are you doing up there,
Preston?

404
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:27,378
Close call, but she's stabilized.

405
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,740
Good work, Dr. Burke.

406
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:31,039
We may actually get you
to the church on time.

407
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,584
You nervous?

408
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,242
No, not really.
More, uh...

409
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,366
excited.

410
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,759
Um, except by my vows.

411
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,937
I wrote them myself, and...

412
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,877
I don't know.
They may be too...

413
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:49,315
- I want 'em to be right.
- Well, let's hear 'em.

414
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,630
- What, now?
- You've got a room full of women.

415
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,842
Try it out on us.

416
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,526
Cristina...

417
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:08,193
I could promise...

418
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,173
to hold you...

419
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:14,986
and to cherish you.

420
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:19,309
I could promise to be there
in sickness and in health.

421
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,832
I could say...

422
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,793
till death do us part.

423
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:27,235
But I won't.

424
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,693
Those vows...

425
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,377
are for optimistic couples,

426
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,366
the ones full of hope.

427
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:38,510
And I do not stand here
on my wedding day,

428
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,584
opmistic...

429
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,246
or full of hope.

430
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:44,064
Okay, um...

431
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,631
I am not optimistic.

432
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:49,624
I am not hopeful.

433
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,047
I am sure.

434
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,515
I am steady.

435
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:58,232
And I know.

436
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,847
I am a heart man.

437
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,811
I take 'em apart.

438
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:08,051
I put 'em back together.

439
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,942
I hold them in my hands.

440
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,478
I am a heart man.

441
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,677
So of this I am sure...

442
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,211
You are my partner...

443
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,599
My lover...

444
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:27,906
My very best friend.

445
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,079
My heart...
My heart... beats for you.

446
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:34,528
And on this day,

447
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:36,711
the day of our wedding,

448
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:38,823
I promise you this...

449
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,391
I promise you...

450
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,329
to lay my heart
in the palm of your hands.

451
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,884
I promise you... Me.

452
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:01,060
Too trite?
Because I can rewrite it...

453
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,076
No.

454
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:04,431
No. It's...

455
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,481
I think I speak for...

456
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:11,253
every woman in this room

457
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,464
when I say dump her.

458
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,170
Dump Yang and marry me.

459
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:30,753
Hey. Oh, god.
Did I miss a page?

460
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,690
No, no, no, no, no.
Everything's okay.

461
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:37,731
What?

462
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,422
Is this really what you want?

463
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,299
'Cause if it's really
what you want, we could do it.

464
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,659
- Really?
- Yeah.

465
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,734
Okay, wait. Really?

466
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,031
Really.

467
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:58,764
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

468
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:00,038
- Really.
- Really.

469
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:12,083
She looks like Rebecca.

470
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,847
Well, at least what
Rebecca used to look like.

471
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:18,010
But still...

472
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,538
around the eyes.

473
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:21,943
Yeah.

474
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,640
I thought
I'd give her some space.

475
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:25,836
She seemed a little overwhelmed.

476
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,531
The ferry crash
was on the news everywhere.

477
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,121
Your wife goes missing...

478
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:38,765
How could you
not look for her?

479
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:42,753
I thought she left me.

480
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,319
We got into a fight that night.

481
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,110
She was trying to tell me
how unhappy she was and...

482
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:51,872
I shut her down.

483
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,912
Yeah, I didn't look for her
when she was missing,

484
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,180
but what's worse is...

485
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,324
I didn't see her
when she was there.

486
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,073
I can't imagine

487
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,716
what it must have
been like for her,

488
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:08,759
what her face must have
looked like all broken.

489
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,325
She was beautiful.

490
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,804
I... I love her.

491
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:23,403
You know?

492
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,578
Meredith.

493
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,726
You are not gonna believe...

494
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,538
Derek met a girl...

495
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,357
In a bar.

496
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:51,065
And he flirted with her.
And he told me.

497
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,377
You know, no big deal.
Just thought I should know.

498
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:55,422
- Meredith.
- I'm not exaggerating.

499
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,895
He didn't even hint.
He just flat out told me.

500
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,717
Meredith, you know how
sometimes it's about you,

501
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:00,984
and sometimes it's about me?

502
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:04,167
This is really,
really about me.

503
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:08,263
Mama took my eyebrows.

504
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:10,309
She took my eyebrows,

505
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,094
and now I am a Burke.

506
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:18,762
Lonnie's stable...

507
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:22,616
But the damage he sustained
is significant.

508
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:24,776
But is he gonna wake up?

509
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:27,418
- Do you want him to?
- What?

510
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,626
The ax in his head
was put there deliberately.

511
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,578
I just wanted to give you three guys
another oportunity to tell me the truth.

512
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:41,587
- It wasn't...
- Shut up, Andy.

513
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:44,075
- But we can't just sit here...
- I said shut up, Andy.

514
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,303
Is that how you let him
talk to you at 14,000 feet?

515
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,486
I have to talk to his family.

516
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,083
You guys can talk to the cops.

517
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:02,135
Dr. Bailey.

518
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,651
Yeah. What?

519
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:06,595
Cristina needs to cut something.

520
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,018
I can't really explain it

521
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:10,643
in a way
that won't make you glare.

522
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,640
But... they took her eyebrows

523
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:15,232
and they called her a Burke.

524
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,509
She really needs
to cut somebody open.

525
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:18,970
Yang...

526
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:23,317
Go... do...
getting married things.

527
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:25,532
Get out of this hospital.

528
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,308
Hey!

529
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,486
I mean... hey.

530
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:33,456
I...

531
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,572
You have to let me cut,

532
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:40,740
because I am standing here
eyebrowless with no dignity left.

533
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,700
I am a surgeon, Dr. Bailey.

534
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,370
But right now
I don't feel like one.

535
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:45,581
I feel...

536
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:47,741
like...

537
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,261
somebody else.

538
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:52,711
Do you know what that's like,

539
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,161
not to feel like yourself?

540
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,152
Yeah.

541
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:05,477
- Oh!
- What's going on?

542
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,052
She started cramping and then
she got really diaphoretic.

543
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:10,897
Alert O.B. to a possible D&C,

544
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,709
due to an incomplete miscarriage.

545
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:14,844
Adele, you could have

546
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,821
a placental abruption
due to the trauma.

547
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,737
We've got to get you
to into an O.R. Now.

548
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,446
Let's move, people!

549
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,719
Sir, Dr. Shepherd is here.

550
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,198
Thank you.

551
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,756
Richard, are you sure
you want to...

552
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,315
You don't have to do this today.

553
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,252
Yes, I do.

554
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,153
She went into early D.I.C.

555
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:55,966
I gave her blood,
platelets, F.F.P,

556
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,370
pregnancy at 52 is dangerous.

557
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:02,431
I tried everything.
I couldn't save...

558
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,947
I thought...

559
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:25,710
I thought...

560
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:28,502
For a second,
I thought I'd lost you.

561
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:35,614
Do you want to...

562
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,089
call somebody? I can...

563
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:39,498
No, no one.

564
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,783
Well, the father of the baby,
maybe you want to...

565
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,666
He doesn't even know about it.
I didn't tell him.

566
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,643
I, um...

567
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:49,568
I think I misjudged him.

568
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,470
I thought he'd go running
for the hills.

569
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:55,432
But actually...

570
00:28:57,441 --> 00:28:59,619
He's a much better man
than I thought.

571
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:04,283
He'll get over his initial judgments,
and he'll...

572
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:06,164
sit with you...

573
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,594
And he'll make you drink
your water.

574
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,406
Adele...

575
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:22,122
It was a boy.

576
00:29:25,153 --> 00:29:26,280
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:36,278
All right, Dr. Leonard,

578
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,827
would you please close
for Dr. Burke?

579
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:39,094
He has a wedding to get to.

580
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:42,136
One cut, and then you're gone.

581
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:43,215
One.

582
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:44,638
But... But I still have to...

583
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,882
Come on. You want your bride
waiting for you at the altar?

584
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,309
They don't like that.
Let's go.

585
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,311
We gotta go now, Cristina.

586
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,636
- Grey.
- Put the scalpel down, Cristina.

587
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:04,483
you can still do this, right?

588
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:12,196
What?

589
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,905
Hold on a minute.

590
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:23,249
I just wanted to make sure
no one's around so I can say this.

591
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,986
I think we've said everything
we need to say.

592
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,122
Shut up.

593
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,840
I am an optimist.

594
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,110
I am hopeful.

595
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:32,960
I am not sure.

596
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:34,988
- Look, I can do this myself.
- Let me speak.

597
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,367
Because I'm your best friend,

598
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:42,207
and because I love you,

599
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,677
if what you want
is to be with Callie,

600
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:49,060
then I will do everything
in my power to support you

601
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,008
and help you
make your marriage work.

602
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,327
But because
I'm your best friend...

603
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,688
and because I love you...

604
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,569
I also have to say...

605
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,019
that I'm in love with you.

606
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:14,503
I'm in love with you.

607
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:19,305
I can't promise the future,
I can't....

608
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:23,197
promise perfection because
we're us and I'm me,

609
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,116
and who knows what will happen.

610
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,862
But in my heart...

611
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:31,444
I am sure.

612
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:35,947
I'm in love with you, George.

613
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,744
And I hope
you're in love with me, too.

614
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:46,813
Say something.

615
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,709
- What time is it?
- You got 30 minutes.

616
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,545
Crap. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding.

617
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,925
No, you're not.

618
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:57,582
Dr. Burke asked me
to check on you.

619
00:31:58,635 --> 00:31:59,725
Let's see. Your, um...

620
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:02,370
Your post-op X-rays look good.

621
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,910
We'll discuss releasing you.

622
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:05,722
- Any change in Lonnie?
- Andy?

623
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:06,789
Who are you?

624
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,601
He's my lawyer.

625
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:12,309
- That was fast.
- Don't you dare judge me.

626
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:14,817
You weren't there.

627
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:17,982
We thought...
he was almost dead.

628
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,048
No way he was gonna make it.

629
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,792
He was in so much pain.

630
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:26,878
So I...

631
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:29,584
picked it up...

632
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,043
- Andy, shut up.
- No!

633
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,695
I'm not gonna shut up.

634
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:38,887
I put him out of his misery.

635
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:44,963
And if I was back there
right now...

636
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,043
I'd do the same thing.

637
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,956
He was my friend.

638
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:54,003
He is my friend.

639
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:58,210
I put him out of his misery.

640
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:04,487
Anyone got any deodorant?

641
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,571
Um, you're not putting my
deodorant in your hairy armpits.

642
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:07,970
Don't move.
You're gonna have a unibrow.

643
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,193
And I have some in my locker.

644
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,808
Uh, closed? Open?

645
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:13,220
Closed.

646
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:15,708
Perfect. Dashing.

647
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,953
- Thanks.
- You look great.

648
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,221
- Moment of truth, people.
- Those our scores?

649
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,366
Grey.

650
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:22,858
Karev. Yang.

651
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,305
Stevens.

652
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,548
- O'Malley.
- Yes!

653
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:27,699
Right here, baby.

654
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:29,347
Yes. Thank god.

655
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:34,183
- Did you pass?
- You bet your married booty, I did.

656
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:38,093
- How'd you do? Did you pass?
- Yeah.

657
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:40,973
I'll talk to you
at the church.

658
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:45,313
All right. Let's go.

659
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,937
Excuse me.

660
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,181
Meredith.

661
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:50,723
I'll meet you at the chapel.

662
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:52,131
Iz, will you take the dress?

663
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:53,932
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

664
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,749
I like the suit.

665
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:05,022
The suit is way better
than the scrubs.

666
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:08,155
Thanks.
Hey, uh, I passed my intern exam.

667
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:09,303
- Good!
- Yeah.

668
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:10,392
That's good.

669
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,066
We got discharged,
me and the baby.

670
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,479
Oh, come on, you just...
You just had brain surgery.

671
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:23,802
You're still on antibiotics.

672
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,123
My body's been signed off on by...

673
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,546
plastics, cardio...

674
00:34:28,564 --> 00:34:30,499
orthopedics, neuro and O.B.,
and my...

675
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:32,891
And also, my teeth
got the blessing from...

676
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,258
Wait, I can say this...
Prosthodontics.

677
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:36,402
But there's still your memory...

678
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:37,671
You know how I know
my memory's fine?

679
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:39,258
Because I can say prosthodontics.

680
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,475
- Yeah, but the baby...
- Discharged, by peds.

681
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,391
Yeah, but...

682
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,329
I have every reason to go.

683
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,841
And... And yeah, I'm scared.

684
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,152
And yeah, this is...
this is moving at warp speed.

685
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:59,687
And yeah, I'm freaking out,
but Jeff is good.

686
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,746
And... And Jeff is
the father of my child.

687
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:04,348
The man is out buying
a car seat right now.

688
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,267
And the minute he gets back...

689
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,766
I-I have every reason to go,

690
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:12,447
because medically...

691
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,423
there's no need
for me to stay.

692
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:18,087
Medically.

693
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:25,459
Okay. Well, then I'll just
check the chart. And just...

694
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:27,117
- Damn it.
- We got, uh...

695
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:29,595
- What?
- Are you...

696
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,782
Do I... Do I have to spell
everything out for you?

697
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:35,908
I mean, did... did you sniff
too much glue as a child?

698
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,478
I'm asking you something here.

699
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,483
What do you want from me?

700
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:42,962
I want...

701
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:46,696
I want you to give me
a reason to stay...

702
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,069
A real reason.

703
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,632
I mean, Jeff's...

704
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:55,270
Jeff's a decent guy,
a good, decent guy.

705
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:57,862
But to him, I'm Rebecca,

706
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:01,739
and I don't know
if I am Rebecca anymore and...

707
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,748
You know me. You knew--

708
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:06,860
You knew when I couldn't
even speak who I was.

709
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,057
You...

710
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,883
You named me Ava,
and I was more me...

711
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:13,846
as Ava...

712
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,509
then I'll ever be as Rebecca.

713
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:19,719
Look, I-I have every reason
to go back to my life.

714
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,736
And I will.

715
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,654
Unless... you...

716
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:33,065
Alex, I'm asking you to give me
a reason to stay here...

717
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,206
A reason from you.

718
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:40,827
Jeff loves you. He's a...

719
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:42,781
He's a decent guy.

720
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:44,264
Alex, give me a reason.

721
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,180
I think you should stay
with the decent guy.

722
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,334
If you want to break up
with me

723
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,832
so you can see other women,
just do it.

724
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:17,828
Don't tell me you met
another woman.

725
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,611
Just end it
if that's what you want.

726
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,730
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

727
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,253
Here's how it goes...

728
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,228
Meredith, I don't want
to see you anymore.

729
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,613
Meredith,
I don't love you anymore.

730
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:29,679
Meredith...

731
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,393
I do love you.

732
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:35,901
Don't you see?

733
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:38,460
Don't you understand?

734
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:42,342
You're the lover of my life.

735
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:44,777
I can't leave you.

736
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:48,502
But you're constantly leaving me.

737
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,063
You walk away when you want,
you come back when you want.

738
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:53,875
Not everyone,

739
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:57,157
not your friends,
but you leave me.

740
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:02,218
So I'm asking you...

741
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:06,007
If you don't see a future for us,
if you aren't in this...

742
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:09,790
Please...

743
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,409
Please just end it,
cause I can't.

744
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:13,470
I'm in it.

745
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,071
Put me out of my misery.

746
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:25,151
I... I can't.

747
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,715
I...
Cristina is getting married.

748
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,186
I have to go
make sure she gets married.

749
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:32,256
Meredith...

750
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,325
I really need to make sure
she gets down that aisle.

751
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:38,752
Let's go.
We're running late.

752
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:55,576
You okay?

753
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,595
I'm fine. I'm fine.

754
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:00,863
You need anything?

755
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:03,420
Need a mint, huh?
A getaway car?

756
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:06,751
If it's the chief thing,
don't worry about it.

757
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,784
You deserve it.

758
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,427
Richard didn't pick me
to be chief.

759
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:13,171
We all assumed you...

760
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,956
- Well, who did he pick?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

761
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,275
You really don't...

762
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:23,014
look so good.

763
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:25,711
Meredith and I
may not make it.

764
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:29,255
I think I want it
more than she does.

765
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:32,552
But today's your day.
It's all about you today.

766
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,741
You really are
a good best man.

767
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:36,788
I try.

768
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,128
Cristina.

769
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,276
I didn't run.

770
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,348
You look beautiful.

771
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,784
I'm proud of you.

772
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:56,354
Thank you.

773
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,678
Frankly, I always feared...

774
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:02,053
you were too emotionally
stunted to settle down.

775
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:06,598
You can do this.

776
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:11,369
I've always found it confusing.

777
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,967
If you know both the bride and
the groom which side do you sit on?

778
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,432
I look for the hottest chick
in the room

779
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,027
- and sit next to her.
- Stop.

780
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,067
Wanna ditch the reception,
grab a drink instead?

781
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:22,146
Stop it.

782
00:40:23,663 --> 00:40:24,686
You don't want me.

783
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:25,851
Maybe I do.

784
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,008
No, you don't.

785
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,191
You want Ava.

786
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:31,412
She's not Ava anymore.

787
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,205
She's Rebecca now,
and I barely know her.

788
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:35,724
Look at me.

789
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,166
Look at me.

790
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:40,362
You suck.

791
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,291
To me, you suck.

792
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,807
I kind of... hate you.

793
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,796
But, Alex...

794
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,814
We do not get
unlimited chances,

795
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:52,531
to have the things we want.
And this...

796
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,042
I know...

797
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:57,460
Nothing is worse
than missing an opportunity

798
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:59,042
that could've
changed your life.

799
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,203
And no matter
what her name is,

800
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,296
she'll always be Ava to you.

801
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:10,657
Dr. Bailey.

802
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,066
You didn't go
to the wedding either.

803
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,192
No.

804
00:41:18,558 --> 00:41:22,126
I am... so sorry, George.

805
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,657
So, um...

806
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,862
What do I do now?

807
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:34,002
You fail your intern test,
you have two options.

808
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,086
You can...

809
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:39,427
walk away from being
a surgical resident altogether,

810
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:43,265
or you can start
from the very beginning.

811
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,698
Repeat my internship?

812
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:49,190
No.

813
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:52,740
I can't.

814
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:59,026
I can't.

815
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:13,420
Did I... Did I fail you...

816
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,074
George?

817
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,487
No.

818
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,058
No.

819
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:25,347
I failed you.

820
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:38,938
It looks so pretty in there.

821
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:41,013
I see Burke.

822
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:44,768
Yang...
The twins looks nice in that dress.

823
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:47,024
Thank you. Sort of.

824
00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:49,146
- I gotta go. I gotta check...
- You're on call?

825
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,268
Wait, alex.
Did you see George in there?

826
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:53,715
I don't see him.

827
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,092
He's, uh...
Probably gonna be late.

828
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,337
We had kind of a big,
emotional day.

829
00:42:58,497 --> 00:42:59,595
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

830
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:02,215
Did something happen
between you two? I mean...

831
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,249
No. It's just that I was
named chief resident.

832
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:06,189
Plus we decided
to have a baby, so...

833
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,680
- A baby?
- Yeah, we're trying.

834
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:10,962
We tried today, in fact.

835
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:13,746
Yeah. Big day.

836
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,177
- Okay, this is it.
- Yeah.

837
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,473
- Okay?
- Yeah.

838
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:23,778
- You have the bouquet.
- Yeah.

839
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:25,027
- I have the ring.
- Yeah.

840
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:26,674
You remember your vows?

841
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:28,007
- Okay.
- I wrote them on my...

842
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:30,494
Oh, my god...

843
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:33,133
I scrubbed in.

844
00:43:33,683 --> 00:43:36,453
I scrubbed in, and the vows were on
my hand. I scrubbed off my vows.

845
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,456
- Oh, okay. Um...
- Okay, hello?

846
00:43:38,477 --> 00:43:39,655
I scrubbed off my vows.

847
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:41,279
I-I can't do this.
I don't have any...

848
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:42,664
I don't have anything
on my hand!

849
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:52,107
I should go see
what's going on.

850
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:54,097
Well,
Cristina wouldn't be Cristina

851
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:55,524
if she didn't need
a little push.

852
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,850
There are no words
in my head. Okay?

853
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,193
I have no vows.
No vows.

854
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:02,025
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

855
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:03,211
You know what?
Stop saying that!

856
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:05,210
- Will you say sometng else?
- Like what?

857
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,909
Say something
that is gonna help me.

858
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,725
Okay, okay! I...

859
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,238
Meredith, please.
You know what? Say something.

860
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:14,097
Say... I don't know what.
Say... Say... Okay.

861
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:16,402
Say what I would say to you
if you were me.

862
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,585
- Okay.
- Good.

863
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,927
- Got it.
- Good, go.

864
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:22,847
Stop whining.

865
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:24,429
This is your wedding day.

866
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,808
You will go down that aisle
and you will get married.

867
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:29,483
If have to kick your ass every step
of the way to get you there,

868
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,760
you will walk down the aisle.
You will get married.

869
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:33,814
Do you hear me, Cristina?
We need this.

870
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,224
We need you to get
your happy ending.

871
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:40,219
Okay, I'm ready.

872
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:41,384
All right, then.

873
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,017
My train.

874
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:45,675
I'll go.

875
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:23,310
I'm ready. I'm fine. I...

876
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,995
Meredith talked me down.
Really I'm fine.

877
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,805
Go, go, go.
I'll be right behind you.

878
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:29,701
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,222
I can do this.

880
00:45:34,259 --> 00:45:36,344
You know, I had a momentary
freak out, but now I'm fine.

881
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:38,550
- I can do this. Go.
- But you don't want to do this.

882
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,773
I'm up there waiting for you
to come down the aisle,

883
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:45,093
and I knew
you don't want to come.

884
00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:47,140
I know
you don't want to come

885
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,478
but that you'll come anyway
because you love me.

886
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,412
And if I loved you...

887
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,688
If I loved you,

888
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:58,211
not the woman
that I'm trying to make you be,

889
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,559
not the woman
that I hope you'll become,

890
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,671
but you...

891
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:05,336
If I did...

892
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,789
I wouldn't be up there
waiting for you.

893
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:12,954
I would be letting you go.

894
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:19,318
I am wearing the dress.

895
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,104
I'm ready.

896
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,854
And maybe I didn't want to before,
but I want to now.

897
00:46:24,872 --> 00:46:26,534
I really think I want this.

898
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,910
And I really wish
that you didn't think.

899
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:32,892
I wish that you knew.

900
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,008
It's over.

901
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,035
You can all go home.

902
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:14,917
It's over.

903
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,594
It's so over.

904
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:29,817
He's gone.

905
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:33,564
I-I don't think he's gone.

906
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:35,899
- Uh, his stuff is still here.
- No, it isn't.

907
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,490
His trumpet was here.

908
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:42,549
His entire Eugene Foote collection...

909
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,030
Vinyls and cds...

910
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,117
His grandmother's picture
was by the bed.

911
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:53,065
His lucky scrub cap
was hanging on the door.

912
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:02,270
He's gone.

913
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:06,789
I'm...

914
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,281
I'm free.

915
00:49:12,655 --> 00:49:13,679
Damn it.

916
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:16,529
Damn it.

917
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:18,824
Damn it. Damn it.

918
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:21,490
Oh, god.
Get this off me.

919
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,010
Take this off!
Take this off!

920
00:49:24,536 --> 00:49:25,935
Please, just...

921
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,295
Help me, help me, help me!

922
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,920
Do we get assigned lockers
here or what?

923
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,124
Dude, it stinks in here.

924
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,469
What do you want?
It's a locker room.

925
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:14,676
No, it's our locker room.

926
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,246
You guys, look,
bloody scrubs.

927
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:22,337
- Hi.
- Hi.

928
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:25,407
Come on, you guys.
Let's go check out the cafeteria.

929
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:26,487
Yeah.

930
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:34,543
We're the new interns.

931
00:50:36,394 --> 00:50:38,276
Well, you look seasoned and wise...

932
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:39,831
Got any advice?

933
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:42,441
No.

934
00:50:46,683 --> 00:50:50,025
Learn how to do an appendectomy
start to finish before your first day.

935
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,255
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

936
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:57,154
Better offer?

937
00:50:57,762 --> 00:50:58,861
Just, uh...

938
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:01,748
You know, life.

939
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:08,090
Anyways, uh,
good luck with...

940
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:10,475
life, Doctor...

941
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:13,832
My name is George.

942
00:51:13,973 --> 00:51:15,607
I'm lexie. Lexie grey.

943
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,645
Congratulations.
You'll make a fine chief.

944
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:30,975
I'm not the best man
for this job.

945
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:34,266
You're the best man
for this job.

946
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,994
What are you talking about,
Derek?

947
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:39,860
A good chief learns
from his mistakes.

948
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:41,356
I'm still working on that.

949
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:42,633
But you...

950
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:46,376
If you had a chance to do it all over
again, you'd do it differently.

951
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:49,409
Go ahead.
Do it all over again.

952
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:52,511
Be the best man.
