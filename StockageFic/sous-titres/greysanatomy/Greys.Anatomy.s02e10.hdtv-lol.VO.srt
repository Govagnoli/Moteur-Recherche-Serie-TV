1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:03,545
you can't help her now.

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:05,592
You don't ask a lot
of personal questions,

3
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,030
and you're very hard
to get to know.

4
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:10,531
Yes.

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,934
With your reputation,
Seattle grace will become one of

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,421
the foremost neonatal
hospitals west of Manhattan.

7
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:17,152
We got a third trimester
burn victim here.

8
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:18,623
Dr. Bailey,
I'm going to need some help.

9
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,529
You show a real gift
with my specialty,

10
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:22,406
I'm going to be staying
in town for a while.

11
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,049
Good-bye Derek.

12
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:26,201
Good-bye, Meredith.

13
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:29,032
Do you want to
buy me a drink?

14
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,186
When you were a kid,

15
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,169
It was Halloween candy.

16
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,514
You hid it from your parents
and ate it until you got sick.

17
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,881
So this is where you live?

18
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:05,068
In college,
it was the heady combo

19
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:08,204
of youth, tequila and
well you know.

20
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,584
As a surgeon, you take
as much of the good

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,618
as you can get

22
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,615
Because it doesn't come around
nearly as often as it should.

23
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:36,184
Cause good things aren't
always what they seem.

24
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,985
That was amazing.

25
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,801
Too much of anything even love

26
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,866
is not always a good thing.

27
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:47,839
Did you

28
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,153
I did.

29
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,757
There's a boy in my bed.

30
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:57,497
What's his name?

31
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:58,794
Steve.

32
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,256
Where'd you find him?

33
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,022
Joe's.

34
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:03,817
Guess where I am.

35
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:04,946
Where?

36
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:06,294
Burke's apartment.

37
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:07,774
He went to the hospital.

38
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,819
He left me here alone.

39
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,680
You're going through
His stuff, aren't you?

40
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,819
Oh, there's no stuff
To go through.

41
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,240
It's a freak show.

42
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:18,882
I mean, you could do surgery in here.

43
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:26,997
He arranged his books using
The Dewey decimal system.

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,810
Mer, I’m scared.

45
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:28,541
Get out.

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,103
Get out of the house now.

47
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,108
Who are you talking to?

48
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,418
I have to go.

49
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,775
I have to go take a shower.

50
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,684
And when I get back,
You won't be here.

51
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:46,983
So,  good-bye, Steve.

52
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,691
Well, another sleepless night in Seattle.

53
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,103
who was it this time?

54
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,472
Hairy back guy?

55
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,524
You know who I miss?

56
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,146
Inappropriate facial hair guy.

57
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,301
You know he did
his own dishes?

58
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:19,210
Tattooed ass guy
made coffee.

59
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,705
he was a keeper.

60
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,393
What?

61
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:25,488
What Meredith?

62
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,159
I am over her.

63
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:28,332
Okay.

64
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:29,743
I am.

65
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,102
I can see that.

66
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,801
Although, is she trying
to set some kind of record?

67
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,504
At least she has a goal.

68
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,442
Oh, he's new.

69
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:42,712
And I shall name
him running guy.

70
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,636
You know who I heard Alex
come home with last night?

71
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:49,613
You.

72
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:50,549
I don't want to talk about it.

73
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,909
Actually, I really do
want to talk about it.

74
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,301
But he doesn't want
to talk about it

75
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,709
because there were
technical difficulties.

76
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,918
What?

77
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:01,018
You know, he didn't
he, it was

78
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:03,457
- no.
- Stop it.

79
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:05,708
You can't say anything.

80
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:07,912
George, stop it.

81
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:09,766
I'm going to at least think about

82
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,668
making fun of him
next time I see him.

83
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:13,327
He said it never
happened before.

84
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,918
Oh, that's what we all say.

85
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,357
And I mean them.
That's what they all say.

86
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:19,767
I don't know.

87
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,983
Maybe this relationship
just isn't meant to be.

88
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,053
I mean, I jus

89
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,851
just need some sex, George.

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,101
You know? I just

91
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,945
I need sex now.
You know what I mean?

92
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:34,412
No matter how hard you beg

93
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,941
I am not doing you.

94
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,021
Nice to have you on board.

95
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,317
Thank you, Patricia.

96
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,475
Your own service,

97
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,373
state-of-the-art did you?

98
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,467
and a salary that'll make you one

99
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,393
of the highest paid
surgeons  in the northwest.

100
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,122
You better be worth it.

101
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,216
Quintuplets,Richard.
That's a go?

102
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:02,045
The mother-to-be
checked in this morning.

103
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,062
Nothing I like more
than a high-profile case.

104
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,813
Well, don't go calling the press in yet.

105
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:07,888
It's an extremely
high-risk pregnancy.

106
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:09,274
At least three of the
babies are surgical.

107
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,518
In fact, I'm going to need to pull
people from all departments.

108
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:12,511
You're my star.

109
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:14,781
Whatever you need.

110
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,346
Is there meal service on this flight?

111
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,704
Robert Martin, 45,
collapsed and hit his head,

112
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,425
causing a small
subdural haemorrhage.

113
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,420
Also presents with uncontrolled
eye movement and delirium.

114
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,185
His alcohol and tox
screens were negative,

115
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:27,484
but his sodium levels are 112.

116
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,556
A little too low for my tastes.

117
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,286
Mr. Martin,

118
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,362
how you doing in there?

119
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,189
I'm still waiting on that drink.

120
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,407
Are you the stewardess?

121
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:39,671
We're called flight attendants now.

122
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,515
there it is right there.

123
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:44,362
On his pituitary.

124
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:45,718
It's a rathke's cleft cyst.

125
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:46,807
So he's hyponatremic.

126
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,829
Excessive thirst is
a common side effect.

127
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,411
The water's what's been
screwing up his sodium level.

128
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,318
It's causing his delirium.

129
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,817
So how do you treat
hyponatremia?

130
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:56,171
3% hypertonic saline solution i.v.,

131
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,769
300 cc's over 3 hours.

132
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,944
Great.
Get him back to his room.

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,036
Call me when he stabilizes.
Nicely done, Dr. Karev.

134
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,110
When does the movie start?

135
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,034
Dorie, this is Dr. Stevens.

136
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,409
She'll be working with us on this case.

137
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,454
Oh, the more the merrier.
Apparently.

138
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,765
How far along are you?

139
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:11,673
32 weeks.

140
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,638
And how long is a normal
gestation period?

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,480
40 weeks, but with twins

142
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:17,659
36 weeks is considered full term.

143
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,782
So with quints, 34 weeks is
considered extremely successful.

144
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:22,997
Well, just give them
some acetaminophen.

145
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,184
It's in the medicine cabinet.

146
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,558
Plan on going 36 weeks.

147
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:28,149
No one's leaving this
uterus until I say so.

148
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:29,745
The power of positive thinking, huh?

149
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,090
Well, that bed rest

150
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,598
and all the medical care you can give me.

151
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:36,000
We're with the doctors now,
so I'll talk to you later.

152
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,378
Okay, bye.

153
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,483
Adam's got a fever,

155
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't think my mom's
going to make it through lunch.

156
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,328
We have 4-year-old boys at home

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,623
Adam, Oliver and Graham.

158
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:49,615
Triplets?

159
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:51,326
You, you already have triplets?

160
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,767
Oh, I guess when you take
those fertility pills,

161
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,921
you should read the fine print.

162
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,530
Dr. Stevens.

163
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:57,854
Oh, I'm sorry.

164
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,202
- I just, I meant it as a
- it's okay. I'm used to it.

165
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:01,493
I just really wanted a girl.

166
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,355
we just didn't
bank on five girls.

167
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,774
But think of all the clothes
and all that pink cuteness.

168
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,683
Honey, that's your happy
place, remember?

169
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:15,494
Try not to say everything
that pops into your brain.

170
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,712
they always look so sad
when I kick them out.

171
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,667
Seriously,

172
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,055
why do guys not understand

173
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,447
that when you pick them up in a bar

174
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,435
and take them home for sex

175
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,762
that there are no picket fences
or kids in your future?

176
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,411
Burke keyed you?

177
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,269
I got freaking' keyed before coffee.

178
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,629
Oh, what is wrong with them?

179
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:44,576
They're like these
1950s debutantes,

180
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,004
one dance, and there's
a shotgun to your head.

181
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:49,713
Meredith.

182
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,291
You work here?

183
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:54,603
What are you doing here,

184
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:55,697
Steve?

185
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,230
I'm having a little problem.

186
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,517
"Steve" Steve?

187
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,508
Actually, I'm having
a big problem.

188
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,073
What?

189
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,091
Steve, hi. Cristina.

190
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,649
Ever since you and I
it won't go away.

191
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,084
- Cristina!
- What?

192
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,407
It's right there looking at me.

193
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:22,489
Oh, there are so many things
I could say right now.

194
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,175
Champ.

195
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:54,503
suppose you'll never know

196
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,082
Do you think it's serious?

197
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,820
It hurts like it's serious.

198
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,159
You realize this is
completely insane?

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,668
Look, we have to
stash him somewhere

200
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,050
until we figure out
what's wrong with him.

201
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,668
I can't have the whole
hospital finding out.

202
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,896
I'm not going down for this.

203
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,974
It's not my fault you
broke this guy's penis.

204
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,604
Broke his what?
Come hey, hey.

205
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:11,775
Don't make me chase you down.

206
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,033
I'm growing a person here.

207
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,436
I got to check on some labs.

208
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,068
How's it look?

209
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,033
Not bad.

210
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,358
Not bad?

211
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:30,609
Not bad is pretty good

212
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,302
when you have five
babies in your uterus.

213
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,081
It's Kate.

214
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,633
She kicks me so hard.

215
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,899
It's like a belly burn every time.

216
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,298
You've named them already?

217
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:45,677
I know you think
I'm crazy.

218
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,533
Or maybe just a little bit stupid?

219
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:49,938
Mrs. Russell, I'm sorry

220
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,485
If I've done something to offend you.

221
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,805
The only thing that will offend me

222
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,474
is if you pretend that you
haven't been judging me

223
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,759
since the minute, we met.

224
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,806
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together,

225
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,775
so we may as well
be honest, right?

226
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,566
If you had reduced the
fetuses even by two,

227
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,844
the other three could've
been carried longer,

228
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,283
been more developed
and born healthier.

229
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,021
And you're about the 16th
doctor who's told me that.

230
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,814
This one up here

231
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,096
this is Charlotte.

232
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,490
She's the stubborn one.

233
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,691
Lodged into my rib cage, won't budge.

234
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:32,004
And over here

235
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:32,882
Lucy.

236
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:34,267
She's a bad ass.

237
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,314
She gets kicked,
she kicks back.

238
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,483
Emily.

239
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,272
she has the hiccups
almost every day.

240
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:48,266
And over here is Julie.
She's pretty mellow.

241
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,312
Every once in awhile,
she just turns over.

242
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,373
Which brings us back to

243
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,325
Kate.

244
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,284
Who gives you belly burn.

245
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:00,467
Every time she kicks.

246
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,288
We were just bringing him up here

247
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:08,532
because he's got this
problem, you see.

248
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,563
And he's a-a friend.

249
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:14,052
What did your friend take?

250
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,843
Take?

251
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,351
Which erectile dysfunction drug?

252
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,865
- You took
- absolutely not.

253
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:18,834
I swear.

254
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,570
- It was all natural between us.
- Shut up.

255
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,742
Your condition
is called priapism,

256
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,635
usually brought on by
the overuse of e.d.s.

257
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,057
I didn't take anything.

258
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,399
Well, we'll have to
take your word for it

259
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,054
because there's no test
to see if you're lying.

260
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,569
We'll have to look
for other causes.

261
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:35,918
There'll be lots of labs.

262
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,072
Lots of

263
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,357
procedures

264
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,322
painful procedures

265
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,246
procedures, which might make

266
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:43,702
you wish you never had a penis.

267
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,182
You sure you don't want
to change your story?

268
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:47,497
I swear, I'm clean.

269
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,044
All right.
Grey, start his work-up.

270
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,074
Get some blood, get him
some meperidine for his pain.

271
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:55,287
As of now, your friend is admitted.

272
00:11:58,562 --> 00:11:59,501
Dorie Russell

273
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:00,627
she's giving birth to quints.

274
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,093
Yes, Richard said
we were on standby,

275
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,940
which is no problem, really,
'cause it's not like, I have

276
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,514
a neurosurgery department
to run or anything.

277
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:08,846
Yes, apparently our
departments are at her disposal.

278
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,053
Do you have time to
talk to the mom now?

279
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,733
I want her to meet all the
surgeons on her team.

280
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes, no problem.

281
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,137
I'll come by after I get out of the o.r.

282
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:17,798
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.
- Sure.

283
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,335
I didn't hear you leave
the hotel room this morning.

284
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:22,406
I missed you at breakfast.

285
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,662
I had an early surgery.

286
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,329
You sure that's all?
Nothing's wrong?

287
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,451
No, it's like I said.
I just had an early surgery.

288
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:29,794
Okay.

289
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,255
I feel like a beached whale.

290
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,538
Dorie, this is Dr. Shepherd.

291
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:35,682
He's our head of neurosurgery.

292
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,166
- Hi, Dorie.
- Hi. Another Dr. Shepherd.

293
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,428
- He's my husband, actually.
- Seriously?

294
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,147
Look at you two.

295
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,114
Everybody must hate you.

296
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,662
you have no idea.

297
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,674
Anyway, Dorie,

298
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,735
Dr. Shepherd wants to talk
to you about baby c.

299
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:50,891
Lucy.

300
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,968
Yes, Lucy has a condition
called hydrocephalus.

301
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,289
It is a build-up

302
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,896
of cerebral spinal fluid
on the brain.

303
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:57,722
Okay, and that means

304
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:58,876
excess fluid builds up

305
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,456
and it puts pressure
on the baby's brain,

306
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:01,990
which could result
in brain damage.

307
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,067
Here's the good news.
We caught it early enough.

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,670
We can take care of it very quickly.

309
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:09,474
How?

310
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,917
I'm going to install a
shunt to drain the fluid.

311
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,954
Barring any complications,

312
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,187
you're looking
at a full recovery.

313
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,558
No brain damage?
No brain damage.

314
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,638
Okay, really

315
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,843
couldn't you have led with that?

316
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:25,408
Good point.

317
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:28,110
What the hell is this?

318
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,940
It's a key.

319
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,655
- Why?
- Why is it a key?

320
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,508
Are we feeling
existential this morning?

321
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,030
Well, if a key turns in a lock

322
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,265
and no one asked for the key

323
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,703
or even wanted the key,

324
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,312
doest make a sound?

325
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,517
I'm going to take
this opportunity

326
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,746
to be someplace else.

327
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,250
Steve's labs came back clean.
So?

328
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:56,889
So someone needs to
induce vasoconstriction.

329
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,878
Oh, nice try with the fancy word.

330
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,766
He needs an enema,
and the answer is no.

331
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:02,632
I can't do it.

332
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:03,905
Oh, come on.

333
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,721
You let a guy you pick up
in a bar, see you naked,

334
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:07,220
and you can't give
him an enema?

335
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:08,382
Totally uncalled for.

336
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,456
Well, I am keyed up and cranky.

337
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:11,579
I would do it for you.

338
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,048
Oh, really?
You'd give Burke an enema?

339
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:15,925
Yes.

340
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,110
Maybe.

341
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,091
No, but that's not the point.

342
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,958
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Here's how it goes.

343
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:23,288
I do this for you,
and you do every enema

344
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,992
I'm assigned to for
an entire month.

345
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:26,357
Deal.

346
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,883
Wow, you really don't
want to do this.

347
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,100
Have we heard
from the seller's agent?

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,464
I've been calling all morning.

349
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:36,727
Mr.Martin.

350
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:38,366
It's good to see you
back on solid ground.

351
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:40,992
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
My assistant Doyle says

352
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:42,525
I passed out and hit my head.

353
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,635
This guy says
it's some kind of cyst.

354
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,760
I want you to say
when I can get out of here.

355
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,062
A rathke's cleft cyst.

356
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:48,914
Whatever.

357
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,652
It's a congenital
tumor on your pituitary.

358
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:52,009
That's treatable, right?

359
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,087
You're gonna need surgery.

360
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,290
See, I'm going to use
an endonasal approach.

361
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:56,131
Endonasal?

362
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,560
You're gonna pull it
out through my nose?

363
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,267
Look him up.
Check his credentials.

364
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,154
It's a minimally invasive procedure,

365
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,196
so there won't be any scaring.

366
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,485
Good. So when?

367
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:08,420
Once we fully stabilize
your sodium levels.

368
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:09,656
That means no more water.

369
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:11,260
I'm thirsty.

370
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,563
It's a side effect
of the tumor.

371
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,014
We'll keep you hydrated
intravenously.

372
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,229
Right. Okay?

373
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,056
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

374
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,933
I'm just following
the doctor's orders.

375
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:29,393
I cannot believe
this is happening.

376
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,020
Try being me.

377
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,721
I mean, you meet
someone in a bar,

378
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,396
you have a few
drinks, a few laughs,

379
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,768
you make out in the car.

380
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,877
Roll over to your side.
Other side.

381
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,754
Bring your knees
up to your chest.

382
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,924
You have a good time.

383
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,665
Spend the night,
wake up the next morning

384
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,461
and... okay!

385
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,606
So you're still
not talking to me?

386
00:15:58,826 --> 00:15:59,698
You gave me syphilis.

387
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,089
And I am talking to you,

388
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,530
I just don't have
anything to say.

389
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,015
How's George?

390
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:09,730
O’Malley’s a fetus.

391
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:11,400
He's all whiney
and afraid of the light.

392
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:14,405
So you didn't tell him
you were doing me, big deal.

393
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:17,075
Minimal disclosure, that's my policy.

394
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:26,983
I've been looking for you.

395
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,567
I'm on the quints case.

396
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:29,670
I heard.

397
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,217
they're going to need

398
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:32,336
multiple surgeries
once they're delivered.

399
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:34,429
I put you on the pager
list so you're in, too.

400
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:35,925
I kind of got my own cases

401
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,255
to worry about, so

402
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,578
okay, Alex
was it me?

403
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:44,071
Because we seemed to be actually

404
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,284
having a normal time,

405
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,217
a good time.

406
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,873
we were having a good time.

407
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,874
Well, then was it me?

408
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:51,911
Was it something I did or

409
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,581
look, it wasn't you, okay?

410
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,613
It was just

411
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,859
I just didn't feel like doing it.

413
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,524
Well, do you feel like
doing it tonight?

414
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,248
Well...

415
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,032
I'm on call, so

416
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:09,906
okay. Well

417
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:13,360
do you feel like
doing it now?

418
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:16,550
What, right now?

419
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,519
People have sex
in this hospital all the time.

420
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:34,460
You hear about the quint

421
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,454
I heard.

422
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,380
Yeah. I got to get in on that.

423
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,064
well, that's Addison.

424
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,767
So I'm guessing
I don't stand a chance.

425
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:46,548
So how do you
break a guy's penis?

426
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:51,011
You know about Steve?

427
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:53,583
Why does every guy I meet

428
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,378
come with his own unique set
of nightmarish humiliations?

429
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,728
maybe it's a matter of volume?

430
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,788
Volume? What's that
supposed to mean?

431
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:04,846
Just, you know, there's quality
and then there's quantity.

432
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,956
So you think I'm sleeping
with too many guys?

433
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,988
You think
I'm some kind of slut?

434
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,557
I think you're taking some risks.

435
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:13,696
I think you'll find yourself
in hole in some guy's basement

436
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,451
being ordered to put
the lotion on the skin

437
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,578
or else you'll get
the hose again.

438
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:17,236
Oh, come on.

439
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,612
I think excuse me.
I'm talking.

440
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,858
So you're not over Derek.

441
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:21,361
You want to be, but you're not.

442
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,564
So you're trying to
find some replacement,

443
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:24,925
some temporary
way to feel better,

444
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:26,423
but it's not working
and it's not going to work

445
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,898
because a future of
meaningless one-night stands

446
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:31,344
and problematic penises
is not what you want.

447
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:34,511
You want better,

448
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:35,966
and you deserve better.

449
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,718
And not every guy's a nightmare.

450
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:49,070
If it's me, just tell me it's me.

452
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,289
Well, then is it
a medical thing

453
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,851
or,or a problem?

454
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,793
Because guys have
problems sometimes.

455
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,842
I don't have a problem.

456
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,188
Get back down here.

457
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,100
We're gonna do
this until we do it.

458
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,965
Okay.

459
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:20,850
Oh...9-1-1. I'm sorry.

460
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:24,883
Damn it.

461
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:36,540
Where have you been?

462
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,726
I, um, l...

463
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,394
the nurse was here.

464
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,408
I've loaded her up
with magnesium.

465
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:44,256
Start monitor her for toxicity.

466
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,590
Oh, it's too soon.
They can't come yet.

467
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:50,222
Mom says Graham started puking.

468
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,112
What is it?
What's going on?

469
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:54,395
Dorie's having contractions.

470
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,877
The babies’ vital signs are stable,

471
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,348
but your placenta's laying low.

472
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,786
We're going to have to
keep a close eye on that.

473
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:00,507
We want to keep them in
there as long as possible.

474
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,611
How are we keeping them in there

475
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:02,558
if she's having contractions?

476
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:03,602
It's all right, hon.

477
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:04,488
They can stop them.

478
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,376
You're gonna
trendelenberg me, right?

479
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:07,425
Yes, I am.

480
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,458
You've done your reading, Dorie.

481
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:10,816
They did it with the triplets.

482
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:13,120
Gravity, remember, Tom?

483
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:15,740
It worked fine then,
and it'll be fine now.

484
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:16,979
Hang in there, Tom.

485
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:18,706
There's no time
for second thoughts now.

486
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,373
We didn't think we'd survive
the first week with the boys,

487
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,262
and we did, and we'll be
the same with the girls.

488
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:24,738
We're ready.

489
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:28,561
Well, that's all
we can do for now.

490
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,811
Dr. Stevens, are you
on call tonight?

491
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:32,640
no.

492
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:33,643
You are now.

493
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:44,696
Enema didn't work.

494
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,643
Enema didn't work?
Enema didn't work.

495
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,815
Well, it was an
excellent enema.

496
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,807
So what's the next step?

497
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:53,974
Needle aspiration.

498
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:56,486
A needle?

499
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:57,554
My penis?

500
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,100
We have to drain the blood.

501
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,499
No way! No! Forget it.

502
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:06,126
Then you're looking
at impotence,

503
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,984
penile infarction
or gangrene,

504
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,533
so if you want it
to fall off...

505
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:10,740
no, no.

506
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,783
I really don't want that.

507
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:12,770
Then let's get to it.

508
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:14,690
What goes up
must come down.

509
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,280
I feel nauseous.

510
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,157
Just lie back, close your eyes
and try to relax.

511
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,070
If I could relax,
I wouldn't be here.

512
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:27,366
How is he?

513
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,017
Well, surgeries scheduled
for Tomorrow, so

514
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,153
is there anything I can do?

515
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,183
Don't let him drink any
water, even if he begs.

516
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:34,961
Is there any family
we should contact,

517
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,760
- No
- friends?

518
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,495
He doesn't really get along
well with most people.

519
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,764
Not big on the social skills.
Sad guy.

520
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,215
Well, he has me.
Three years as his assistant.

521
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:45,011
I guess I'm his friend.

522
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:45,981
Doyle!

523
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,211
What if I just gave
him back the key?

524
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,412
- He'll be hurt.
- What if I don't use it?

525
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,990
Well, then, if you had
no intention on using it,

526
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,536
you shouldn't have
taken it in the first place.

527
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:04,234
Oh, come on.

528
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,311
Fishing a key out of a coffee cup

529
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:06,497
isn't like some

530
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,470
binding legal contract

531
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,831
your boyfriend gave
you a key to his place?

532
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,800
Why is he talking?

533
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,046
I'm just saying,

534
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:15,406
the  guy put himself out there.

535
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:16,644
He's taking the next step.

536
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,789
You can't not use.

537
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,625
Do you think you might not be

538
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,552
in the best position right now

539
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,048
to be handing out
relationship advice?

540
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,358
Hey, he offered the key.

541
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,735
You took the key.

542
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:28,965
Just because I'm

543
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,542
look at that.

544
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,156
Congratulations.

545
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:34,419
You're flaccid.

546
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,106
I never thought I'd be
so happy to hear that.

547
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,029
Dorie, Tom,

548
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:50,335
Hey, Dorie, Tom,

549
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,136
this is Dr. Burke.

550
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,635
He's the head of
cardiothoracic surgery

551
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,212
and Dr. O’Malley who
will be assisting him.

552
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,126
Dr. Burke wanted to talk to you
about Emily’s, heart surgery.

553
00:22:58,249 --> 00:22:59,845
Emily needs heart surgery?
Yes.

554
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:01,240
Your daughter
has a condition called

555
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:03,068
hypo plastic left heart syndrome.

556
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:04,876
The surgery will be extensive.

557
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,048
And the odds are that

558
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:09,142
we don't believe in odds.
Good, neither do I

559
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,102
But it is important
that you both understand

560
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,984
medically what's going
on with your girls.

561
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,742
After she's born, there won't be
much time to ask questions so

562
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:16,831
okay.

563
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,379
We're listening.

564
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,368
What's wrong with Emily's heart?

565
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,120
The chambers on the left
side are underdeveloped.

566
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,511
In addition, the mitral valve,

567
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,067
which connects
these two chambers,

568
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:28,840
is abnormally narrow.

569
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,451
It's a key.

570
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,543
Just a key?

571
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:48,769
Just a key.

572
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,254
Well, good.

573
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:52,511
Good. Good.

574
00:23:59,242 --> 00:23:59,961
Or

575
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,062
you could start thinking
about moving in with me.

576
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:29,878
Don't mind me.

577
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:32,993
What's up with Doyle?

578
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:34,521
I had to fire him.

579
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,124
Get me some water.
I'm drying up.

580
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,113
well,
that's the tumor talking.

581
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,225
Your i.v.
keeping you hydrated.

582
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:44,192
So why you fire Doyle?
He seemed like a good guy.

583
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,144
I could see it in his eyes.
He didn't respect me anymore.

584
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:52,943
He thought
he was your friend.

585
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,823
Friend?
Doyle?

586
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:56,105
Oh, right, you don't
have any friends.

587
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,965
If I did, I wouldn't
let them see me like this.

588
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:00,967
Illness is a sign of weakness.

589
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:02,916
Once they see it, they never
look at you the same way again.

590
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,120
I mean, you're a hotshot doctor.

591
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:07,887
I'm sure you don't let
all the other hotshot doctors

592
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,355
around here, know anything
about your problems.

593
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,825
No, I'm a hotshot doctor.
I don't have any problems.

594
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:15,281
You probably don't have
any friends either.

595
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:24,107
Oh, my lord.
Ooh, child.

596
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:25,464
Don't tell me.

597
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:26,920
The flag is flying once again.

598
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,120
Hey, nothing I did.

599
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,259
Well, we tried everything.

600
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:30,450
So it must be neural.

601
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,519
Neural?

602
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:32,890
She already called for a consult.

603
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,155
A consult?

604
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,949
You called neural for a consult?

605
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,717
Hey, it's not my fault
you broke the boy's penis.

606
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:45,918
Well, hello, everybody.

607
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:46,775
What's up?

608
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:56,607
So when did this, um,problem begin?

609
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:58,959
Well, I had an erection last night

610
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,641
and woke up with one this morning.

611
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,403
Uh, Dr. Shepherd,
if you don't need me,

612
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:05,671
the other Dr. Shepherd needs
a consult on one of the quints.

613
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:06,817
no, we're fine.

614
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:08,840
So when did you last ejaculate?

615
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:12,409
I'm not sure.
Meredith?

616
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:15,850
Oh, I'm

617
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,757
I'm gonna go with Dr. Bailey.

618
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,069
Meredith, what time
did we

619
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,038
you know.

620
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:28,134
Yes, Meredith,
what time did you two

621
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:40,560
Here it is.

622
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,846
Right there the omphalocele.

623
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,188
look at that.

624
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:45,812
That's the scariest word yet.

625
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,801
Oh, all it means is some of
the baby's internal organs

626
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,923
are growing in a sac
outside its body.

627
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:50,936
Cristina!

628
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,170
"All it means"?

629
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,485
Her organs are growing
outside of her body.

630
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:57,607
That's all it means?

631
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:58,767
It's gonna be okay.

632
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:01,991
I'll remove the sac membrane
containing the organs.

633
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:04,127
Make a small incision
in the baby's abdomen

634
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,272
and put them back inside.

635
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:10,688
Oh, Julie.

636
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:13,643
She's the quiet one.

637
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:27,719
What makes you think

638
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:30,301
what makes you think
we can live together?

639
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,214
You don't know
anything about me.

640
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,768
I know that you prefer an
11 blade for your I and d's.

641
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:44,240
I know you prefer to say
"pick ups" instead of "forceps."

642
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,542
I know you like your coffee

643
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:48,480
from the cart by the front entrance

644
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:50,896
better than the coffee
in the cafeteria. I know you.

645
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,778
Those are little things
just details.

646
00:27:58,261 --> 00:27:59,157
I know you.

647
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:02,355
You don't wanna move.

648
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,859
But I can't always be the
one that takes the step.

649
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,931
Any more steps,
and I'm walking away.

650
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,267
Mr. Martin!

651
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,285
Mr. Martin, please!

652
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:28,610
Mr. Martin, please, you heard

653
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,566
what the doctor said!

654
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,553
I don't need any doctors.
I don't need anyone!

655
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,936
Open the door, Martin.

656
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:34,670
I am an island.

657
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,235
A beautiful island
surrounded by water.

658
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:39,279
What do you wanna do?

659
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,652
Shepherd gave me one job to do

660
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:43,660
just keep this dude
from drinking water.

661
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:44,765
Do you want me to page him?

662
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,394
No, I can handle this.
Just go get some restraints

663
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:47,619
and turn the water off to the floor.

664
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:49,926
Martin, open the door!

665
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,821
Your c.t. shows a tumor
on your lower spine

666
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:54,361
which is pressing against
your cavernous nerve.

667
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,557
Which is causing the erection.

668
00:28:57,856 --> 00:28:59,450
A tumor?
Right.

669
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:02,520
A-a tumor. So

670
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,121
I should be scared, right?

671
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:07,215
This is
this is the time for scared.

672
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:12,575
Um, it's going to be fine.

673
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,481
Dr. Shepherd is gonna
schedule a surgery.

674
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,556
Yes, I'll remove the tumor

675
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,495
and everything should return to normal.

676
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:20,862
"Normal" normal?

677
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,401
I have an urologist on his way
up to talk to you, but yes

678
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,809
"normal" normal.

679
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:28,347
Can you call my mom?

680
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,179
Her numbers
in my wallet.

681
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,176
Tell her to come, but don't
tell her about the tumor.

682
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,157
I don't wanna freak her out
when she has to get on a plane.

683
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:36,675
Sure. Okay.

684
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:38,533
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

685
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,877
We're not seeing each other.

686
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,130
We met last night at Joe's.

687
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:44,024
Joe's bar?

688
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,778
I met a girl there once myself.

689
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,475
A very long time ago.

690
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:58,132
The water's off!

691
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:59,737
We'll just have to wait
until he sobers up.

692
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,242
No, his sodium levels
will drop too low.

693
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:22,728
No! Leave me alone!

694
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:24,512
Let me go back!

695
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,365
I need the water.
I need it!

696
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,369
Martin, we're trying to help you.

697
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,285
I don't want your help!

698
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:31,787
I don't want people
to look at me.

699
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,678
I'm pathetic!

700
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,850
Stop looking at me!

701
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:37,852
Stop looking at me!

702
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,665
Give him a 3% hypertonic solution.

703
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:43,992
500 cc's per hour the next
4 hours to stabilize him.

704
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:48,105
You think you're such
a hotshot doctor.

705
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,149
You're not.
You're nothing!

706
00:30:50,828 --> 00:30:52,140
I'm gonna fire you, too.

707
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:54,862
Go ahead. Fire me.

708
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:11,829
I used the key.

709
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,488
That's a step.

710
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:25,184
So you really wanna know me?

711
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,294
There's nothing you can
reveal about yourself

712
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,797
that I wouldn't want to know.

713
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,749
This is where I live.

714
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,000
My mother decorated it.

715
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,845
I don't do laundry.
I buy new underwear.

716
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,165
See, and, uh,
under the table

717
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,993
six months of magazines
I know I'll never read.

718
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,445
But I won't throw out.

719
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,483
I don't wash dishes, vacuum,

720
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:13,322
or put the toilet paper on the holder.

721
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,311
I hired a maid once.
She ran away crying.

722
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,510
Uh, the only things in my fridge

723
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:21,101
are water, vodka and diet soda.

724
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,447
And I don't care.

725
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:25,178
But you do.

726
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,492
Still think living together is a good idea?

727
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:49,540
Hey, Addison wants me
to put you guys on notice.

728
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:50,635
When the quints are born,

729
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,008
we're gonna need
everyone available.

730
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:54,211
There's gonna be five babies,
at least three surgeries.

731
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,022
We're gonna need
all the hands we can get.

732
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,727
Okay.

733
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,467
Fine.

734
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,164
So I'll just page you guys
when we need you?

735
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,073
- Okay.
- Fine.

736
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:09,984
Okay, then.

737
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,985
I was studying.
What's your excuse?

738
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,234
I was staring at the
ceiling in abject horror.

740
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,584
I heard you broke his penis.
Nice.

741
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:21,833
So I'm having a lot of sex.
What's wrong with that?

742
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,626
Nothing wrong
with that at all.

743
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,927
It only gets problematic
when you start to care.

744
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,019
When you let your emotions
get in the way, you know?

745
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,253
right.

746
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,031
Damn it.

747
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:47,100
I'll just take the tea.

748
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,464
What is it?
Why'd you page me?

749
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:52,561
He was acting all jittery
and started slurring his words.

750
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,460
Martin,
can you hear me?

751
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:57,446
2 of ativan.
He started seizing.

752
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,838
How much sodium
did you give him?

753
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,174
500 cc over 4 hours.

754
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:03,875
Actually, doctor, you ordered
500 cc per hour over 4 hours.

755
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:04,836
Too fast.

756
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,045
His brain is swelling.

757
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:06,874
I thought I said

758
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:07,655
why didn't you do a follow-up?

759
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:08,545
I gave you one thing to do!

760
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:11,178
He's gonna be okay, right?

761
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:12,516
If he's permanently impaired,

762
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,532
I can't operate on him like this.

763
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,111
I'm sorry.

764
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,565
I wasn't trying
to get you in trouble,

765
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,127
but Dr. Shepherd needed to know.

766
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,487
It doesn't mean
you're not a good doctor.

767
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:43,674
well lately, I'm crap.

768
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:46,488
well,

769
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,268
things have been kind of
crappy for me, too, lately.

770
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:51,311
Also my fault.

771
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:54,521
We both made mistakes.

772
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,582
Let me ask you something

773
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:01,393
when we were together,

774
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,219
it was good, right?

775
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,362
You mean

776
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:17,347
It was good.

777
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,270
It was really good.

778
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,316
It was pretty great.

779
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,580
It was, wasn't it?
It was like easy, simple.

780
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:45,179
You better have
a condom this time.

781
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,285
Oh, there it is.
It's on the s1 vertebra.

782
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,097
So removing it
should fix the problem?

783
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:58,116
Doesn't look like
the's any nerve damage.

784
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:00,534
Shouldn't be any long-term effect.

785
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:03,237
I'd wait a few weeks
before I tested it out, though.

786
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,723
Funny.
You're a funny man.

787
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:09,549
I just didn't know
you two were dating.

788
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:13,175
Well, you knew it would
happen eventually.

789
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:15,391
Eventually feels a lot
different than actually.

790
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:18,690
I guess it does.

791
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:24,093
It's surprisingly painful.

792
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,196
It gets better.

793
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:31,094
Does it?

794
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:32,852
I don't know.

795
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,447
But I'm determined
to be optimistic.

796
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,215
So you've officially
signed your contract.

797
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,964
Congratulations.

798
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:53,816
Time to move forward.

799
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,762
it is.

800
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:01,704
We're okay, right?

801
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,435
we're okay.

802
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:08,127
It's Dorie.

803
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:17,159
What's going on?

804
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:18,112
There's fetal distress.

805
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:20,423
My contractions are really hurting!

806
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,705
And I think my water broke!

807
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:27,720
Her placenta's tearing.

808
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:29,739
Okay, Dorie,
we can't wait any longer.

809
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:31,345
The babies have to come out now.

810
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:33,728
It's okay.

811
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:34,640
We're gonna take
really good care of you.

812
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,267
Just keep breathing.

813
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:40,962
uh, Dorie, the o.r.'s prepped

814
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:42,393
and we're ready to go.
Where's Tom?

815
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:44,776
He's at home with the boys.

816
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:46,473
No, I called Tom.
He's on his way.

817
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:48,307
Izzie, go ahead and page
everyone on Dorie's team.

818
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:49,800
The list is posted
at the nurse's station.

819
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:53,636
No! No!

820
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:55,528
Dorie, Dorie,
you're fine.

821
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:56,515
You're gonna be fine.

822
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:58,809
Nothing about this is fine!

823
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,281
It's too early!
They're too hurt!

824
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,526
Dorie

825
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:04,565
you've carried your girls this far.

826
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:05,396
Now it's our turn.

827
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:07,942
You have to trust us to
bring them into the world.

828
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,545
- Tom's on his way?
- Tom's on his way.

829
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:20,913
Guess I'll just have to tell you
I'm happy to see you.

830
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:24,597
So Dr. Shepherd
removed the tumor

831
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:26,159
without any complications.

832
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,021
I just wanna
thank you

833
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,778
for being there for me.

834
00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:33,759
I mean, normally,

835
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,160
you don't expect
your one nightstand

836
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:37,901
to stick by you through a tumor.

837
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,006
Maybe when I get out
of here we could

838
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:41,930
I don't think so.

839
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,228
You sure about that?

840
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,495
you know, when I saw you
at Joe's, I was just

841
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,363
looking for a replacement.

842
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:52,544
Looking for something
to make me feel better.

843
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:55,793
You deserve better than that.

844
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,741
Sorry, I gotta go.

845
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,433
The quints.

846
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,044
Everyone answered their
page except Dr. Karev.

847
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:26,400
Where is he?
We need everyone!

848
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,977
I don't know.
He was on call last night.

849
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,387
He might be asleep.
Go find him!

850
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:41,650
It's time for the quints.
We need you.

851
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,280
How do you know
how much is too much?

852
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:28,085
Too much, too soon?

853
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:51,652
Too much information?

854
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:13,901
Too much fun?

855
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,280
Too much love,

856
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,178
too much to ask.

857
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:45,167
And when is it all just
too much to bare?

858
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:54,817
