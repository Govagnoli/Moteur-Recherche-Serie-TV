00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,662
<i>Previously  on "Grey's Anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:03,840
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

3
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:06,310
- I have to.
- Give me my husband back.

4
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:08,436
- Chief resident?
- The one 5th year resident

5
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:09,722
that rules all residents.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,554
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,996
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:15,993
What happened
to our small ceremony?

9
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,377
What happened to
you and me at city hall?

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,967
There's no guarantee the surgery's
gonna bring back your memory.

11
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:23,870
- Is there a man in my house?
- I'm so sorry, Richard.

12
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:26,457
And I'm finally ready to have a baby,
and I can't.

13
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,269
We're losing her pulse.
She's coding!

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,743
We did everything we could.

15
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:42,763
<i>A surgeon's education never ends.</i>

16
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:46,705
<i>Every patient, every symptom,
every operation...</i>

17
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:48,818
<i>is a test.</i>

18
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,990
<i>A chance for us to demonstrate
how much we know...</i>

19
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,465
<i>And how much more
we have to learn.</i>

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,653
How do you treat pancreatic divisum?
Izzie?

21
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,278
Oh, Cristina.
If you're not gonna let us sleep,

22
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:02,429
you at least have to let me
put coffee in my cup.

23
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,156
- Okay, so go. No one's stopping you.
- I'm too tired to go.

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,830
- Pancreatic divisum.
- Dorsal duct sphincterotomy.

25
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,454
Not your turn, but correct.
You do me.

26
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:11,900
Can't believe O'Malley's missing this.

27
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,822
- How's he gonna be ready?
- You're kidding, right?

28
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:16,406
- We have Callie's cards but George has-
- George has Callie.

29
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:21,054
What's the most frequent cause
of diarrhea in hospitalized patients?

30
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,781
Is she coming to
this bachelorette thing tonight?

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,770
Rotavirus. Yes.
No, no, no. Uh, salmonella.

32
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,554
Diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

33
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:31,993
The most frequent cause of diarrhea
in hospitalized patients is C. diff.

34
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:36,641
Which can lead to toxic megacolon,
perforation, sepsis and death.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,956
That's what killed Susan.

36
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,686
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

37
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,146
- Dude, she's messed up.
- Of course she's messed up.

38
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,071
Susan was basically
her surrogate mother.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,315
Yeah, her fake mom
was better than her real mom.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,016
Is she going to the hospital first
or the funeral?

41
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,317
First to the hospital,
then to the funeral,

42
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,194
then to the test this afternoon.

43
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,406
- Has she even studied?
- Yeah, she studied. She's fine.

44
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:03,433
She just needs
to be left alone, okay? So...

45
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,500
what's inside the carotid sheath?
Izzie?

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,733
<i>The internal carotid artery,</i>

47
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,934
<i>the internal jugular vein
and the vagus nerve.</i>

48
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,526
Ah, that was too easy.
Let's find you a hard one.

49
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,806
Uh, what is this?

50
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,919
<i>Uh, what is what?</i>

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,738
Yeah.
That just came this morning.

52
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,324
You got a spot at Mercy West!
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:28,559
Because it's pending the results
of the intern exam.

54
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,408
Oh, you know what this means,
don't you?

55
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:34,088
You, you got,
you got into Mercy West...

56
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:36,010
I haven't told the chief yet.

57
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,843
You'll tell him today.
He'll understand.

58
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,121
It's a smaller program,

59
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,778
fewer residents,
fewer distractions,

60
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,290
more surgeries.

61
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:49,141
And when I come home
and ask you how your day went,

62
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,614
you can actually tell me
because I won't already know.

63
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:20,750
Look, I...

65
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,022
I know this is a...
an impossible day for you.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,310
So...

67
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,212
I'm just want to say one thing.

68
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,733
I brought a black suit, just in case.

69
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,069
Thank you.

70
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,536
But I think this is something
I need to do by myself.

71
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,424
If you need me, just...

72
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,476
let me know.

73
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:54,358
- Oh, Cristina.
- What is M.E.N. syndrome?

74
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,457
Don't answer that.

75
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,881
The minister needs to see a copy
of your vows before the wedding.

76
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,472
Multiple endocrine neoplasia. Yes.

77
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,188
Look, I know it's test day,
and I'm not supposed to be

78
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:05,027
talking about the wedding
on test day.

79
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,881
- But since tomorrow's our wedding day--
- You have five seconds. Go.

80
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:12,269
Bill Adams can't make it.
I have no best man.

81
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,378
Oh, no. Baby, I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,316
- And I need your vows by--
- Okay, time's up.

83
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,080
Test day.

84
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,810
What am I supposed
to tell the minister?

85
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,406
Test day.

86
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:27,786
They paged you guys, too?

87
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,486
- Well, I think they paged all of us.
- That can't be good.

88
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,608
Sure it can. He could be letting us
know I won the race for chief.

89
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:34,821
Not today, he isn't.

90
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,046
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

91
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,243
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

92
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:40,293
Why were we all paged?

93
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,528
Oh, because search and rescue
found those lost

94
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:44,274
climbers who were up
on Mount Rainier.

95
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,787
- People, the climbers are on their way.
- Any specifics?

96
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,840
They found only 3 so far.
One's still missing.

97
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:50,891
They're reporting
severe dehydration

98
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,051
with traumatic head
and chest injuries.

99
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,645
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres,
you'll be my trauma team.

100
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,767
- Bad day not to have interns.
- What?

101
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,166
Today's the intern exam.

102
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,514
You'll all have to do your
own heavy lifting today.

103
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,103
And if you see an intern,
which you will,

104
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,713
because they can't help themselves,

105
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,778
turn them away
until after the exam.

106
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,395
The ambulances
are 5 minutes away.

107
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,261
It's time to do what we do best,
people. Let's roll.

108
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,981
What is a gerota's fascia?

109
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:14,075
Uh, the fascia surrounding the kidney.

110
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,519
Which is longer, the left...

111
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:19,603
- or the right renal vein?
- That's right. The left one.

112
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,884
- Looks and smarts-- Not bad.
- You think?

113
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,894
She's got my dad's nose, though.

114
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,391
Girl's gotta have a big personality
to pull off that nose.

115
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:28,932
What?

116
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,688
You-- You remember your dad?

117
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,825
No. I don't-- No.

118
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:35,619
- You just said--
- I know, but I...

119
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,872
I have no idea
where that came from.

120
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:40,004
That was a memory.
That's what it's like sometimes.

121
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,733
It doesn't always come back all at once.
It can happen in bits and pieces.

122
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,270
- Don't-- Don't get all--
- Dude, your memory's coming back.

123
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,909
How you feelin', Preston?
You ready?

124
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,513
I'm always ready for surgery.

125
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:58,926
I think he's talking
about the wedding.

126
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:00,409
Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,139
And apart from the fact that
Cristina hasn't written her vows,

128
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:04,538
my best man just canceled,

129
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:06,406
- and it's still raining...
- He's not ready.

130
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,146
You're never ready.

131
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:09,527
I certainly wasn't.

132
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,875
But then... the minute I saw
Adele coming down that aisle...

133
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:19,673
Well... have you picked
your best man?

134
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,268
- Actually, chief, I--
- You can't be his best man.

135
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,056
- Why not?
- Because it's unethical.

136
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,172
It's a conflict of interest.
The man wants to be chief of surgery.

137
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,008
- Actually, Derek--
- Not that that's why you're asking.

138
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:35,103
- I was... going to ask you.
- Ask me what?

139
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:42,379
- Really?
- We have been through a lot this year.

140
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,001
And everybody else turned you down.

141
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,477
Oh, what do I have to do?

142
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:49,341
Well, traditionally the best man
plans the bachelor party.

143
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,686
- Drinks at Joe's after work?
- Yeah.

144
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,470
I knew you were
the man for the job.

145
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,072
Dale winick, 32.
B.P. 90 over 50, tachy to 110.

146
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,772
Severe frostbite,
but no obvious internal injuries.

147
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,830
Got it.

148
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,088
My god.

149
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:09,726
Yeah, those aren't gloves.

150

151
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,700
Please someone tell me
if they heard the others guys are okay.

152
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,496
They're right behind you.
We'll let you know.

153
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,646
Get him a tet-tox
and push a gram of cefazolin I.V.

154
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,546
And let's get some warm, circulating
water to start thawing his hands.

155
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,928
I'll get someone on it.
Callie.

156
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,314
We're supposed to be studying.
If Bailey finds out we're down--

157
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:35,308
We are studying.
How do you treat frostbite?

158
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:38,223
Rewarm, avoid early surgery unless

159
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:41,011
there's a deep infection
due to autoamputation.

160
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,354
See? Studying.

161
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,325
Okay, okay,
Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer,

162
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,325
I'm gonna need you
to save your breath, okay?

163
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,500
We're gonna give you
some pain meds.

164
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:51,813
You have several broken ribs,

165
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,213
which are compromising your breathing.
You understand?

166
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,363
- Did you see that?
- That is freaky.

167
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,006
I think that was a flail chest.
I've never seen one before.

168
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,292
Come on. Come on.

169
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:03,184
Why, oh, why does today
have to be test day?

170
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:04,424
Oh, I know.

171
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,678
Look... I bet you
if you talk to the chief,

172
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,410
he'll let you take the test later
with the funeral and everything.

173
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,673
I don't need to take the test later.

174
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,362
- Can I get a little help here?
- I can't feel my legs!

175
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,670
Sir, you have a spinal injury.

176
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,435
You need to stop fighting me
and stay calm, okay?

177
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,794
You're only making it worse.
Where we going?

178
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:27,097
- You guys are going to trauma 3.
- All right. Trauma 3.

179
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,702
- You okay?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,190
I got accepted at Mercy West.

181
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,105
Wow that's...
Are you gonna go?

182
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,964
Well, I kinda have to now, right?

183
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,483
What are you fools doing here?

184
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:47,677
In a few hours,
you people are taking a test

185
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,391
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers

186
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,681
because the five interns
with the lowest test scores

187
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,023
will be cut from the program.

188
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:57,140
But are you studying for this test?
No, you're not.

189
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:00,494
Are you helping out in the E.R.?
You are most certainly not!

190
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:03,226
Are you getting the hell out of here
before I throw you out?

191
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:04,841
I think you are.

192
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:08,470
- Whoa, Dr. Shepherd.
- Aren't you supposed to be studying?

193
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,548
- Yeah, I just have a quick question.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:13,378
Could the craniotomy you performed
on Ava-- On Jane Doe-- Could--

195
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,555
- Could that have affected her memory?
- Uh, it's doubtful.

196
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,272
I was mostly working
in the speech center of her brain.

197
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,545
- But you never know. Why?
- I think she remembered something.

198
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,564
Can we test her to see
if anything's changed?

199
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,198
Yeah, you can run another W.M.S.R.

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,071
But we're gonna have to wait,
see if she remembers anything else.

201
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,705
- It's a good sign, though.
- Thanks.

202
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,163
- Nice work, Dr. Montgomery.
- Oh, thanks.

203
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:31,520
- I was just directing traffic.
- I was being sarcastic.

204
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,661
Oh, like brain surgery
is so impressive.

205
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,431
- It is, actually.
- Addison.

206
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,657
Yes? Oh, Joe, Walter.

207
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,895
What are you guys doing here?
Everything okay?

208
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,252
Yeah, we came to see you, actually.

209
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:46,250
- We need a consult.
- Don't tell me you're pregnant.

210
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,954
- Uh, no, but--
- Our birth mom is.

211
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,476
The potential birth mom.

212
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,997
She hasn't actually picked us yet.

213
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:53,170
You're adopting?

214
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:56,212
Well, we filed an application,
but we never thought we'd get picked.

215
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,992
You know, bar-owning gays
don't get picked very often.

216
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,368
I guess having a baby
is easier than we thought.

217
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,788
Yes, I guess so.

218
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,563
So I was hoping
you could take a look at her?

219
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:09,163
You know, kicking the tires,
checking underneath the hood?

220
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,703
Car metaphors? No.

221
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,740
I'd be happy to.
Just, uh, give me a call

222
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:13,979
and we'll set up an appointment.

223
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,478
Well, see, that's the thing, uh...

224
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:16,971
She lives in Portland,

225
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,148
and she's only gonna be
in Seattle for one day, so...

226
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,181
She's kind of here now.

227
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:22,986
Now, as in...

228
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,173
now.

229
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,010
- George, wait. Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

230
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,474
You don't have to do this.

231
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,138
You don't have to transfer
to Mercy West.

232
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,342
- Yeah, I do.
- No.

233
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,311
Just forget about you and me
for a second, OK?

234
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,677
What about Meredith?

235
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,057
What about Alex and Cristina?

236
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,063
Who's gonna hold us together
if you're not here?

237
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,131
You're the glue. You're George.

238
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:52,708
- I can't stay here. I can't...
- No one's making you go.

239
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:55,029
stay here
and see you every day...

240
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,950
and not...

241
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:01,893
I can't keep kissing you
in elevators.

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,668
I know. I know that.

243
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,883
I'm married.

244
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:09,249
I'm a married man.

245
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,077
- You busy?
- Cute. What are you doing here?

246
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,606
- Isn't the exam in like--
- I know, I know.

247
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:19,869
I just want to run
a quick neuro-psych test on you.

248
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,627
No. No! Go take your test.

249
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,383
I-I have a baby to feed.

250
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,521
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

251
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,024
You've been sitting in this bed
for weeks wishing

252
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,770
you could remember who you were
now suddenly you can.

253
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,756
I can't. It was something I said.

254
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,366
Well, you remember
your father's face.

255
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,150
Why are you acting like
it's no big deal,

256
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,237
- like it happens all the time?
- Alex, come on. I-I--

257
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,533
It-- That's not...

258
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,675
Unless it does happen all the time.

259
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,266
Tell me the truth.
Do you remember?

260
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,173
Do you know who you are?

261
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:55,279
- What is biloma?
- Cristina, I really don't have time.

262
00:11:56,518 --> 00:12:00,095
A biloma is an intraperitoneal
bile fluid collection.

263
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:01,813
- Excellent.
- Okay? I'll be fine.

264
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,268
- George, I gotta go.
- Your dad.

265
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,601
Hey.
I was just on my way to--

266
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:12,540
No, I-I came here to tell you,
you're not wanted.

267
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,878
I don't want you at any funeral,
Meredith.

268
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:17,022
- Thatcher, why don't you come--
- She trusted you!

269
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,701
She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

270
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,260
You did. You killed my wife.
You took her from me.

271
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,396
Dad!

272
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,617
So I don't--
I don't want to see you.

273
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,232
I don't want to hear from you,

274
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,107
and I do not want you
anywhere near her funeral.

275
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,021
- Do you understand me?
- Dad, dad, come on.

276
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:36,697
This-- Lexie's waiting in the car.
We have to go, dad.

277
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,370
She was everything to me,
all I had.

278
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:48,057
She was all I had.

279
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:51,184
She was all I had.

280
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,332
I can sit here all day.

281
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,576
I'll miss my test,
but I will sit here all day.

282
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:13,267
I don't-- I...

283
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,690
It happened a few days ago,
and I-I just...

284
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,943
I just woke up, and...

285
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,380
- it was all there again.
- And you didn't tell me?

286
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,487
Becau-- Because there's...

287
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,210
There's nothing to tell.

288
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,676
Why don't I believe that?

289
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,165
I was a pregnant woman,

290
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,393
in a lousy marriage,

291
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,037
to the nicest guy
anyone's ever met.

292
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:41,362
End of story.

293
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,226
Who-- who is he?
What does he do?

294
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,991
Wh-where--
Where did you meet him?

295
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,354
College.

296
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,757
We got married the year
after we graduated.

297
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:55,861
He...

298
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,861
I wanted--
I wanted to move to New York,

299
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,685
and he wanted to live
on the side of a mountain

300
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:00,922
and take over his dad's shop.

301
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,275
And he's a woodworker.
He makes beautiful furniture.

302
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:04,693
It's-- It's-- It's...

303
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,199
quiet, and he's quiet and...

304
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,224
- I was going out of my mind.
- So you just...

305
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,372
- took off?
- No, I...

306
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:14,853
No, I need-- I need-- I need--

307
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,418
I needed to think
and to be around other people.

308
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,825
So I came to Seattle, and I...

309
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:22,107
Thought I'd see the sights,
ride the ferry.

310
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,450
- Have you even called him?
- No.

311
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,122
- Why not?
- I left him, Alex.

312
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,887
So? He's your husband.

313
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,121
You should call him.
You want me to call him?

314
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,868
I mean, what's his name?
What's your name?

315
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:34,947
I'm not telling you that.

316
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,874
- We've got everything taken care of.
- You don't have to worry about a thing.

317
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,995
I've got number 2 pencils
and bottled water.

318
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,907
Oh, and-- And powerbars.

319
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,399
And you know the material.

320
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,103
You're gonna get a high score--
Not as high as mine--

321
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:50,578
But everything's gonna be fine.

322
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:52,851
What are you guys
all standing around for?

323
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,503
Don't we have a test to--

324
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:56,400
What happened?

325
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,954
You people need to head upstairs.

326
00:14:58,034 --> 00:14:59,494
Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.

327
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,282
You're not to blame for Susan Grey's
death, and you know it,

328
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,943
and your father knows it, too.

329
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,635
He's just...

330
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,279
Well, he's never been
the best communicator,

331
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:18,703
and he just lost his wife.

332
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:22,015
Stop acting
like my surrogate father.

333
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,454
- Meredith, I've...
- Just Because you slept with my mother,

334
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,411
that does not make you my father.

335
00:15:32,176 --> 00:15:33,636
Follow my finger. Up.

336
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,478
Okay. Good.

337
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,544
Let me know
if you can feel this, okay?

338
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,025
Yeah, I'm not enjoying that.

339
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,781
Good. That's a good sign.

340
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:47,692
It means I'm not paralyzed?

341
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:50,175
Well, the M.R.I. will show us
the full extent of the injuries.

342
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:51,296
But, uh...

343
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,639
can we ask you
what happened up there?

344
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,386
It was my fault.

345
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,145
- Dale--
- It wasn't your fault.

346
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,910
60 ways to get up Mount Rainier,
and I had to pick Liberty Ridge.

347
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,431
It wasn't the route.

348
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:07,816
It was the storm.

349
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,040
On a clear day,
you don't think about storms.

350
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,629
A minute later, the wind's pasting you
to the side of the mountain,

351
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,465
and you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

352
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,493
Is that why you fell,
because of the storm?

353
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,430
All I know is I felt the rope tug,
and...

354
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,078
- I was in midair.
- We all were.

355
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,385
We were tied together.

356
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,775
Must have been a 100-foot drop.

357
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,355
And when we came to,
Lonnie wasn't moving.

358
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,712
Lonnie?
He's your friend who's still missing?

359
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,744
Well, this Lonnie,
is that why he didn't make it back,

360
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,049
because he was hurt?

361
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,212
Because he was dead.

362
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,841
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,023
We had to leave him.

364
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:50,897
We had to get to the other side of
the mountain, or we'd be dead, too.

365
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,205
We had no choice.

366
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,937
You always have a choice.

367
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,912
You never leave a man behind.

368
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,153
Please take your seats,
doctors,

369
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,923
and put all study materials away.

370
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,911
Okay, if you don't know the answer,
choose "B." It's always "B."

371
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,395
And write your name in the upper
right-hand corner of your answer sheets.

372
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,239
You may open your test booklets...

373
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:22,499
Now.

374
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:28,419
W-we don't have to be here
if you're uncomfortable.

375
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,802
Oh, no, it's fine.
Unless you're uncomfortable.

376
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,224
- Actually, uh, I-I--
- He's fine.

377
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,671
So, Rina, how are you feeling?
Any problems?

378
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,918
Just the fact that I'm huge,

379
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:42,101
and I have, like, the worst heartburn
I've ever had in my life.

380
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,894
I can prescribe an antacid for that.

381
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:46,058
The first thing we're gonna do
is take a look at the baby.

382
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:47,871
This might be a little cold.

383
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,403
This baby deserves parents
who are gonna make it

384
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:53,765
their whole world, you know?

385
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,157
You know we're gay, right?

386
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:59,632
I figured, with you both
being boys and everything.

387
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,315
The other couple I'm considering,

388
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,672
they're, like, oh, 40.

389
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,148
She's been trying
to get pregnant for ten years.

390
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,688
It's so sad.

391
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:11,678
There's the heartbeat.

392
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,186
Oh, my god.

393
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:18,467
There's, like,
a person inside of me.

394
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,683
Actually... there are two people.

395
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,357
Twins.

396
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,573
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

397
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,587
Oh, my god.
I think I'm gonna pass out.

398
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:34,631
Doctors, we are halfway
through our allotted time.

399
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:38,724
You only have 60 minutes left
to complete the exam.

400
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,681
She didn't write anything on the test.

401
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,362
She didn't answer a single question.
She just sat there.

402
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,345
Wait, George, just--

403
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,580
Just give her a second.

404
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,660
I've got an extensive
antero-lateral flail chest.

405
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,371
He'll need surgical stabilization.

406
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,143
Dr. Torres, if you're available--

407
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,096
She's not.
My guy has bone fragments

408
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,049
in his spinal cord,
internal fixation.

409
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,744
Dr. Torres is gonna scrub in
with me.

410
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,424
Uh, we have more than one
orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.

411
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,900
And you'll need 'em,
because Dr. Torres and I are looking

412
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,290
at possible multiple amputations.

413
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,825
Guys, I can be there for all of you.
We just have to figure it out.

414
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:55,980
Dr. Burke asked first.

415
00:19:56,816 --> 00:20:00,027
- Well, I mean, with all due respect--
- okay, you all want Torres. Fine.

416
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,584
Rock, paper, scissors.

417
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,414
One, two, three.

418
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,105
All rocks. Very typical.
Ready?

419
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,241
And...

420
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,161
Rock smashes scissors.

421
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,644
- See you in the O.R.
- Best two out of three.

422
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:12,752
Dr. Burke!

423
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:18,394
What?

424
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,394
I just wanted to know
how it feels...

425
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,959
to not have to spend
the next 24 hours

426
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:25,438
wondering if Richard picked you
to be chief resident.

427
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,869
How's it feel to be the chosen one?

428
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,283
Feels just fine.

429
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:42,097
How'd it go?

430
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,125
Meredith.

431
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,172
Don't worry. I've got it.

432
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:51,823
It's not like
she actually flunked.

433
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,727
She-- She just
didn't write anything.

434
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,797
It's kinda like
she actually flunked.

435
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,099
One guy two years ago,

436
00:20:58,116 --> 00:20:59,928
he was on call three nights
before his test.

437
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,689
He slept through the whole thing.
He had to repeat his intern year.

438
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:04,591
She can't repeat her intern year.

439
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:06,047
It's pathetic.
We have to do something.

440
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,122
Cristina.

441
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,166
What? Okay, I don't know.

442
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,598
Mredith and I don't fail things.
This is not in my book.

443
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,812
It's Bailey. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

444
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,253
- We can't just leave her here.
- You got a better idea?

445
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, it's showtime, people.

446
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:35,699
Yang,
you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.

447
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,763
Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.

448
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:43,229
- You paged me, too.
- Mercy West.

449
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,565
Callie told you.

450
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:48,170
You're in the best surgical program
in the country,

451
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:51,436
the toughest, most competitive
most respected.

452
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,037
You want to leave
this for Mercy West?

453
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,778
- Mercy west--
- Is not Seattle Grace.

454
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,186
Are you trying to...

455
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,046
After all the work
that we've put into you,

456
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,913
are you trying to throw
your career away?

457
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,378
I'm trying to...

458
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,556
do what's best for me right now.
I've had some personal issues.

459
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:09,426
I-I don't know what your personal
problems are, and I don't care.

460
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:13,294
I do care about your career,
so let me make myself clear.

461
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,295
This is a mistake.

462
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,375
It's like we're on a train
that's going 200 miles an hour,

463
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:47,739
and it would just be
so nice to get off,

464
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,059
and just...

465
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,284
stand on the platform
just for a minute.

466
00:22:57,922 --> 00:22:59,631
Looks like I'm off the train.

467
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:05,439
Our parents died.

468
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:07,945
When a parent dies,
it doesn't make any sense.

469
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:10,966
So you make...

470
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,148
a lot of really terrible decisions...

471
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:18,798
that you're gonna end up having
to live with for a long time.

472
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:26,354
You should go.
You are still on the train.

473
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:39,689
It's okay.
You have to go.

474
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,423
Go.

475
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:45,864
Go. Go, go.

476
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,093
Addison.

477
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,438
Adele.

478
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:05,039
What are you doing here?
What happened?

479
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,029
A fender bender. I'm fine.

480
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,686
I told the E.R. resident I'm fine,
but...

481
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:12,311
All right, I'm gonna page Richard.
I'll let him know you're here.

482
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,337
Oh, you will do no such thing,
Addison.

483
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,074
Richard cannot know I'm here.

484
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:17,263
We're separated.

485
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,905
My life is none of his business.

486
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:22,093
I'm serious.

487
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:27,784
Uh, all right. Well...

488
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,421
let's get you checked out.

489
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,900
Do you have any, um,
any pain, any...

490
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,285
anything?

491
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,548
Well...

492
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,449
there's one thing
I should probably mention.

493
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,728
I'm pregnant.

494
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:54,160
The baby looks fine on the ultrasound
but you are spotting a little.

495
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,488
It's nothing severe,

496
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:58,689
but I would like to hold you
overnight for observation.

497
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,975
Overnight? Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:03,131
- But--
- For just a couple of hours at least.

499
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:04,389
Look, it could be nothing.

500
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,252
But a pregnancy at your age is--

501
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:10,041
Terrifying? Embarrassing?

502
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:12,066
I was going to say a miracle.

503
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,164
I don't know. I resigned myself
to the fact a long time ago

504
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:16,773
that I would never have kids,
and...

505
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:20,541
here I am, 52,
about to be divorced and...

506
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,066
pregnant.

507
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,109
May I ask who... the father is?

508
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,476
You may ask.

509
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,024
Look, all I'm saying...

510
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,319
is that if Richard finds out that
you're walking around this hospital

511
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:35,392
carrying another man's baby...

512
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:37,448
Richard is not going to find out

513
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,960
because neither one of us
are going to tell him.

514
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,142
- Chief.
- Addison.

515
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,491
I just heard the news.

516
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:53,946
You-- You heard?

517
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,907
Who told you?
What-- What did you hear?

518
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:59,151
That Joe and Walter are adopting.

519
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,395
Is the birth mom here?
I'd love to put in a good word.

520
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,353
Chief, you don't want to go in there.

521
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:05,496
It's a young girl...

522
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:07,472
in the stirrups, you know,

523
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,617
her equipment exposed, right?

524
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:11,153
You don't want to see that.

525
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:13,778
No, I-I don't want to see that.

526
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,110
Are you going to give me
an inspirational speech, too?

527
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,373
I can't talk.
I have a patient to prep.

528
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,061
This isn't about you and me.
This is about Meredith.

529
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,098
- What are we gonna do?
- There's nothing to do.

530
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:44,218
What?

531
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:46,712
I'm not even gonna be
here in a week, so...

532
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,069
So your transferring
to another hospital

533
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,831
means we're not gonna be
friends anymore?

534
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,742
Why are you doing this, George?

535
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:56,435
Didn't you hear a word
of what Bailey said?

536
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,778
<i>What were we supposed to do,</i>

537
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,065
<i>carry him down the mountain?</i>

538
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,358
<i>He was our friend,
and we left him there.</i>

539
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,112
If we hadn't, we'd be dead, too.

540
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:05,754
You know that.

541
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:08,457
Dale was right.

542
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:12,216
<i>You don't--
You don't do that.</i>

543
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:14,672
<i>You don't...</i>

544
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:17,972
<i>climb all the way up there together
just to leave a man behind.</i>

545
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,048
I am being stalked by pregnant women.

546
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,203
You're an obstetrician.

547
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,785
And barren.
You know, apparently as a healthy,

548
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,813
successful woman in her 30s,
I don't deserve to have a baby.

549
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,253
Maybe I'd have a fighting chance
if were gay,

550
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:35,770
or a teenager
or a member of the A.A.R.P.

551
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,286
Oh, that sucks.

552
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,136
It really...

553
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:46,938
No, no, not you, too.

554
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:49,060
Oh, no, no, I'm not. I'm just--
I'm thinking about it.

555
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,516
That's all.

556
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,113
Oh, I don't know.

557
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,098
I don't even know.
It's just that with George...

558
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,451
- going to Mercy West next year...
- He is?

559
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:02,482
Yeah, they have a spot for him,
and we need a fresh start.

560
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,524
We need to get away
from all this crap.

561
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,707
It might be a good time.

562
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,202
It's a great time.

563
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:13,760
Don't let me and my fossilized eggs
discourage you.

564
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:16,262
Are we gonna be friends still
if I get pregnant?

565
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,548
Absolutely not.

566
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,836
- Hi, chief.
- O'Malley.

567
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,452
Finally coming to see me
about that letter from Mercy West?

568
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,404
No, sir.

569
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:36,389
I'm here about Meredith.

570
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,042
I have to say, I don't get it.

571
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,689
Why would anybody
waste their time freezing

572
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,944
and climbing up
the side of a glacier?

573
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,123
It's a way to test yourself, you know,
your strength and endurance.

574
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:53,507
You put yourself through
a situation like that,

575
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:55,460
and you know exactly
who you are,

576
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:57,013
what you made of.

577
00:28:57,332 --> 00:28:58,820
Have you done it before,
Dr. Burke?

578
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:01,089
No. You?

579
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,084
I used to, all the time,
in college.

580
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,446
- Really?
- Really?

581
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,453
Yeah, it's, intense.

582
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,415
I mean, it's painful and hellish,

583
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:11,340
and you think your lungs
are shredding, but...

584
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,405
Man, when you get to the top,
there is nothing like it.

585
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,179
Makes the whole climb worth it.

586
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,098
How's it going?

587
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:32,995
Worse than I thought.
There's nothing here.

588
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:34,453
We're gonna amputate both?

589
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,928
You can't amputate
both of his hands.

590
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,411
I-Isn't the left hand less damaged?

591
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,530
I don't want to take
the man's hands, Dr. Stevens.

592
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:40,913
Once the infection gets that deep,

593
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,971
the only way to save his life
is to make the cut.

594
00:29:46,507 --> 00:29:49,399
The patient's laminotomy happens
at what level, Dr. O'malley?

595
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,539
The level of maximal neural
compressions between

596
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:54,455
the pedicles
of the fractured vertebrae.

597
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:55,628
Very good.

598
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,459
You must have aced
your exam today.

599
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,617
I don't know about aced.

600
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,274
How did Meredith do?

601
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,907
Yeah, she was kinda...

602
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:06,330
Don't worry, though.
I talked to the chief.

603
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,126
About what?

604
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:10,478
She didn't tell you?

605
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:18,085
All right, here's the thing--

606
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,648
The Seattle police department's
been on this for weeks.

607
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:23,623
They've been in contact with
missing persons from all 50 states...

608
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:25,167
Canada, the FBI--

609
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,454
You know how many people
are trying to find you?

610
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,106
- Yeah, yes.
- That's right. You do know.

611
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:31,181
You know exactly
how many relatives you have.

612
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,759
You know if your parents
are dead or alive.

613
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,309
You know if you've got a sister
somewhere who cries every day because

614
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:36,906
- she has no idea what happened to you.
- Stop it!

615
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:38,269
What do you think
it's like for your husband?

616
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:39,755
He didn't come looking for me, okay?

617
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,798
He obviously
doesn't want to find me.

618
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,442
- Besides,it's my life.
- No, not just yours.

619
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:47,919
What about your daughter?

620
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna lie for you.

621
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,802
If you're not gonna tell anybody,
I will.

622
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:51,957
What are you gonna say?

623
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,119
You don't know my real name.

624
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:55,885
You don't know anything about me.

625
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,458
It'll be my word against yours.

626
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,179
You're right. I have absolutely
no idea who you are.

627
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,312
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

628
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,049
I think I figured out
a way to help Meredith.

629
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:18,170
But I've got shepherd's post-op,
and...

630
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,105
I can't do it without your help.

631
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,567
And I won't leave
the program without...

632
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:24,135
knowing that she's still in it.

633
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,066
You're not leaving the program.

634
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:33,061
Listen... we made a mistake.

635
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,762
We had sex.

636
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,119
But that's all it was.

637
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,632
I think we both wanted it
to mean something because...

638
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:44,160
you didn't want to have to feel like
that guy that cheats on his wife,

639
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,606
I didn't want to have
to feel like that girl

640
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,015
who put you in that position
in the first place.

641
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,360
But the truth is...

642
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,186
It didn't mean anything.

643
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,939
I know you think
I have feelings for you,

644
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:56,911
but I don't.

645
00:31:58,728 --> 00:31:59,939
So you can stay.

646
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:01,736
You're not leaving the program.

647
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,481
Nice work today Torres...
Three surgeries at the same time.

648
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,608
I performed four osteosyntheses,
amputated two hands

649
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:44,811
and stabilized
one spine in two hours.

650
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,995
Impressive.

651
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:49,365
Looks like Bailey's not
a shoo-in for chief resident after all.

652
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:56,573
Uh, you're in the running
for chief resident, too?

653
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:00,808
Why wouldn't I be?

654
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,259
No. Uh, it makes sense.

655
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:05,747
I just... I hadn't thought about it.
That's all.

656
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,064
I'm good at what I do, Bailey.

657
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,798
I'm focused,
I'm disciplined, I'm--

658
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,510
I'm more than qualified
to be chief resident.

659
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:18,735
Look, we all know
that you're the chief's favorite,

660
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,409
but that doesn't mean
I can't take a shot.

661
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:26,535
Here she is.

662
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,549
Thank you, Stevens.
You can go now.

663
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,151
We'll be waiting right outside.

664
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:32,906
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

665
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,889
If you called me here
to lecture me--

666
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:44,556
There's a copy of
the intern's exam on the table,

667
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:47,265
some number 2 pencils,
a bottle of water

668
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:48,884
and a sandwich if you get hungry.

669
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,633
I'll send a proctor in,
and I'll come back

670
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:53,088
in a few hours and check on you.

671
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,296
You are not my father.

672
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:02,298
I know that.

673
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,103
I know.

674
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:52,056
Well, at least test day
is almost over.

675
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,990
Speak for yourself.

676
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:56,089
I'm getting married tomorrow.

677
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:13,812
This is what you invited me to?

678
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,658
This is your big bachelor party?

679
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:17,638
It was last-minute.
I needed some warm bodies.

680
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,576
Which would explain
why I'm here.

681
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,692
Why am I the only girl,
by the way?

682
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:23,636
What am I, the entertainment?
I am not stripping.

683
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,307
That's okay.
We've seen it already.

684
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:27,997
- True.
- I haven't.

685
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:31,470
Yeah, well, why don't I buy you
a drink instead?

686
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,038
First round's on me.

687
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,738
I'll give you a hand with those.

688
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:38,967
Cristina write her vows?

689
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:40,959
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

690
00:35:42,794 --> 00:35:44,089
How's Meredith doing?

691
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,609
I have no idea.

692
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:49,143
Shouldn't be this difficult,
should it?

693
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:51,434
Probably not.

694
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,837
Then again...

695
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:56,963
when I see Cristina walking down
that aisle tomorrow...

696
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,278
It'll all be worth it?

697
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:13,999
So how was L.A.?

698
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:18,792
L.A. was... different.

699
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:24,692
Look, Mark...

700
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:29,462
Things don't have to be
awkward between us.

701
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:31,143
We tried.

702
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,981
We tried, and we did our best

703
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,854
and just because we failed
as a couple, it doesn't mean--

704
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,020
I know.

705
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,344
So we're still friends?

706
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:44,936
With benefits?

707
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,158
Don't push it.

708
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:51,742
Thanks, Joe.

709
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:55,348
So hey, how'd it go with Rina?

710
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:58,766
Oh, well... Walter took her
to the bus station,

711
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,782
and I'm pretty sure he was wishing
it was me he was dropping off.

712
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,190
That bad, huh?

713
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:05,040
If I can't even make it
through an ultrasound

714
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,674
without breathing
into a paper bag,

715
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:08,146
how am I gonna handle a kid?

716
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:09,611
Forget about twins.

717
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:12,774
You two are gonna make
great parents, okay?

718
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,197
Whenever that happens.

719
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,948
You... ever think
about having kids?

720
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:19,898
All the time.

721
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:29,257
Adele?

722
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:38,439
Oh, come on.
I know you saw me.

723
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:41,499
Now this is just silly.

724
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:43,414
You don't have to hide.

725
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:46,701
I've moved on.

726
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:49,537
I'm dating now.

727
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:52,822
Okay, I'm not actually dating,

728
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,550
but I intend to...

729
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,057
at some point.

730
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:01,896
What the hell am I supposed to do
about the stupid vows?

731
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,229
You still haven't written anything?

732
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,145
- Well, it's stupid crap.
- No, it isn't.

733
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,455
Well, what am I supposed to say?

734
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:09,394
I swear to love and cherish you every
moment of every day of my life?

735
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,964
I mean, that's not real.
That's not how it works, right?

736
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:13,832
It does, at first...

737
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:15,954
- but then it...
- It passes.

738
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:17,269
No, it doesn't.

739
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:20,117
You guys are just used to it.
That's all. You already have it.

740
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:22,437
You have that thing
everybody else wants.

741
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:24,002
You can take it for granted.

742
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:25,881
But let me tell you,
if you didn't, if you couldn't...

743
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,111
be with the person
that you love,

744
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:28,439
I guarantee that...

745
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:31,246
hearing him promise
to love you and...

746
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,204
honor you and cherish you,

747
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:37,541
no matter what, it would be
pretty much all you could think about.

748
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:46,122
Wait, can you say that again,
just slowly?

749
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,647
You're talking about Denny,
right?

750
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:54,744
Yeah.

751
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:17,848
Hi.

752
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:19,238
Hi.

753
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,500
Can I buy you a drink?

754
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:24,681
Wow, you're forward.

755
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,352
Bad day.

756
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,901
I get to be forward today.

757
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,211
Yeah, I had a bad day, too.

758
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:35,717
So what do you say, one drink?

759
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,562
I'm with some friends.
It's a bachelor party. So...

760
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:43,060
I'm gonna...

761
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:47,797
I'm gonna say no.

762
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,729
That's too bad.

763
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,681
Maybe you're right.

764
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,671
Rebecca Pope.

765
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:36,343
That's my name.

766
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,756
Adele, come on.

767
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,550
Now you've got me
in this ladies' room.

768
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:55,829
The least you could do is an--

769
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,697
Oh, my god. Adele.

770
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,005
- What are you doing here?
- Sweetie, get Rina some water.

771
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,926
I thought you guys were
going to the bus station.

772
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:11,006
- We were.
- It's this heartburn.

773
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:13,324
It's like it's--
It's ripping through...

774
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:17,418
Call an ambulance.

775
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:22,644
Tucker, uh, since he's awake,
can you put him on?

776
00:41:25,654 --> 00:41:26,884
Let me call you back.

777
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,463
Nicole, what have you got?

778
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:32,256
We got the fourth climber.
Pressure's 70s, last pulse 135.

779
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,081
Severely hypothermic.
Started two large-bore I.V.S.

780
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,287
Oh, and, uh, obvious head trauma.

781
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,645
Is that an ax in his head?

782
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,780
What the hell happened up
on that mountain?

783
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,062
Let's go!

784
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:52,911
Somebody help me!
Please!

785
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,782
Somebody help!

786
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:03,462
Please, somebody help me!
