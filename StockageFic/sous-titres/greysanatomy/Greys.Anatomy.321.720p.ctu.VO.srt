1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,418
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:02,606 --> 00:00:04,803
I have sex last night
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,333
This is our secret, okay?

4
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:09,028
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

5
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:10,804
If I'm not having sex,
neither are you.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,682
- Chief resident?
- The one fifth year resident

7
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,071
that rules all residents.

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,038
I went to the board this morning
and told 'em I was retiring.

9
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,427
I came out here to be chief,

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,204
- and Meredith complicates that.
- So I just have to pick one?

11
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:22,364
If you don't pick one,

12
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:24,514
this is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

13
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,338
My name is not Ava!

14
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:28,540
You made it up!
It's not me!

15
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,917
What percentage of americans
will get an acute appy?

16
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,956
<i>As interns, we know what we want...</i>

17
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:43,416
<i>to become surgeons...</i>

18
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,228
<i>And we'll do anything to get there.</i>
7.

19
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,984
What are the signs
of residual eye infections?

20
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,498
Uh, pus, uh, redness and, uh, fever.

21
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,320
<i>Suffer through killer exams,
endure 100-hour weeks,</i>

22
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,097
<i>stand for hours on end
in operating rooms...</i>

23
00:00:56,115 --> 00:00:58,660
<i>- You name it, we'll do it.</i>
- What's conn's syndrome?

24
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:01,446
- Uh, w-wait, wait, I know this.
- Oh, tick tock, dude.

25
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:02,667
Cracking under the pressure.

26
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:06,148
No. Um...
Hypercortolis... Cortisolism!

27
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:08,881
Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Uh,
primary hyperaldosteronism.

28
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:10,260
Yes! Out of the seat.
My turn.

29
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,809
- No, it's my turn.
- No, it is not.

30
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,970
- Um, try this one.
- You know, I...

31
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:15,275
White sponge with vanilla buttercream.

32
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,096
Yeah, I'm trying to study for the most
important test of my intern career.

33
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:20,514
- I don't have time for wedding cake.
- Well, just try it.

34
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,056
Go! Go!

35
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:24,409
Uh, what is the strongest
layer of the small bowel?

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,440
Fine. Yummy. Go.

37
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,266
Damn it,
damn it, damn it.

38
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,393
It is not snot.

39
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,870
- Submucosa!
- Yes.

40
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:32,437
Wait, wait, wait.
How do you know that?

41
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,793
- Are you studying with the wife's cards
- What cards?

42
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,503
Callie was ranked number one
in her year after this test.

43
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:39,323
She has legendary flash cards.

44
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:42,196
We don't need the flash cards.
We are independently brilliant.

45
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,564
- Dream team.
- Yeah, I'm gonna hurl. Outta the seat.

46
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:46,399
No, my turn.
I'm gonna kick all your asses.

47
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:48,607
This is the lemon.
Might be a little tart.

48
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,627
What is actinic keratosis?

49
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,611
Uh... actinic keratosis is,
uh, a premalignant lesion.

50
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,860
- In old people.
- In anyone.

51
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:55,996
Too tart?

52
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:59,226
I don't care.
I mean, is Alex right or am I?

53
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,326
Learn to care,
or I'll get another bride.

54
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,679
I love it. I love all cakes.
Now break the tie.

55
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,199
Karev's right.

56
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,481
<i>The tough part, though,
is reconciling</i>

57
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,073
<i>this huge thing we want:</i>

58
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:15,594
<i>to be surgeons...</i>

59
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,672
<i>with everything else we want.</i>

60
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,165
I haven't seen you
in a few days.

61
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,799
- I left messages.
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:26,232
- I was just trying to--
- I know I told you to stop hovering

63
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,007
and you did,
and I appreciate that.

64
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,119
But now stop with the stopping.

65
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,138
No, you're right. It's ridiculous for me
to worry about you all the time.

66
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,845
It's sweet that you worry.

67
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,577
It is. I should communicate more.

68
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,378
- Right.
- You don't think I can do it.

69
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:40,626
- I can do it
- Really?

70
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:43,180
In a few seconds, I'll be
getting on that elevator.

71
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,890
And then I'll be going
on rounds.

72
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,760
See, uh, I'm, uh,
getting on the elevator.

73
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,464
Communicating.

74
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,388
28 more days and...

75
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,603
Then it's you and me
in a locked room

76
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,528
for a record-breaking,
earth-shattering,

77
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,776
- mind-blowing...
- Okay! I get it.

78
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,153
- Thank you.
- That was less than enthusiastic.

79
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,244
I'm gonna be
more enthusiastic when we...

80
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,520
cross the finish line.

81
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,168
Okay.

82
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,499
Just making sure you haven't
lost interest in the project.

83
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,649
Not at all.

84
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,403
Good.

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,800
What are you doing?

86
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,478
The bakery wants me to make
a decision by tomorrow.

87
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:39,117
So if you can tell me
your favorite by then,

88
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,877
that would be great.

89
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,709
Cakes and little place cards?
Okay, he's turning into a girl.

90
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,676
I think it's sweet. He obviously
cares about this stuff.

91
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,164
This white one
taste's pretty good.

92
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,830
I should bring a piece
to Derek, right?

93
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,854
That's what good girlfriend's do,

94
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,772
bring their boyfriend's cake
and communicate?

95
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:58,142
No. The best ones just keep
all that stuff to themselves.

96
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:00,048
- Did you bring Callie's cards?
- Uh, no.

97
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,879
- Oh, well, no cake for you.
- Dr. Bailey,

98
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,870
I saw a hemiglossectomy
on the board. Can I scrub in?

99
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,569
No, no. You're not
doing surgeries today.

100
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:07,888
- What?
- Your intern exams are in two weeks.

101
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,515
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

102
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,384
Oh, believe me,

103
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:14,619
when you won't have to repeat
your year as interns,

104
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,404
you'll be thanking me
for this opportunity.

105
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:20,099
So, Grey and Yang,
you're... doing scut.

106
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:23,090
O'Malley, Stevens,
you'll be joing me

107
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,028
in the clinic.
Karev, you're with Ava.

108
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,465
Um, I don't always
have to be on her case.

109
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,996
Someone else can have her.

110
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,617
Or not.

111
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,209
So...

112
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,031
Last night we studied together.

113
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,555
Today we're, uh,
treating patients together.

114
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,654
And we're fine.

115
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,255
We're not tortured,
it's not weird.

116
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,166
We made a mistake
and we've moved on.

117
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:46,013
If anything, I think it brings
us closer together as friends.

118
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,136
- We're very impressive.
- I think we are.

119
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,847
Larry Jennings just checked in
to the hospital.

120
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,780
- What's the matter with him?
- I have no idea.

121
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:00,040
His assistant said it was
a matter of the utmost discretion.

122
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,520
Oh, that's never good.

123
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,158
Yeah, whatever it is,
it was important enough

124
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,477
for him to cut short
his vacation and fly home.

125
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,259
I want you
on point on this one.

126
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:09,114
- No clinic today.
- Oh, I can do both.

127
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:10,330
Miranda, we are talking

128
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,831
the chairman of the board
of Seattle Grace hospital.

129
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,084
The clinic will survive
without you for a day.

130
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:17,948
- Learn to delegate.
- Who am I supposed to delegate to?

131
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:19,486
Chief Webber,
you paged me?

132
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,771
Sydney Heron
reporting for duty.

133
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,122
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you today.

134
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,847
- Where you been?
- Just getting my assignments.

135
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:35,412
Yeah, anything good?

136
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,952
Anything as good as a crazily
hormonal pregnant amnesiac

137
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,000
with a tendency to yell
at the wrong people?

138
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,416
Your blood pressure's higher
than it should be.

139
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:45,342
So what,
we're not friends anymore?

140
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,064
Fine.

141
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,899
Then I won't tell you about
Dr. Montgomery's sex bet...

142
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,450
with the overly hot Dr. Sloan.
Yeah.

143
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,333
If he can go 60 days without sex,
they're getting back together.

144
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:56,493
Apparently they used to be a thing

145
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,270
back when she was married
to Dr. Mcdreamy.

146
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,042
The question is, how do you
know all that?

147
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,210
I'm on bed rest 5 feet
from the nurses' station,

148
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,187
and I have excellent hearing.
I know everything.

149
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,196
It's like...
It's like watching a soap.

150
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,638
Do you know how many doctors in this
hospital nurse Olivia has slept with?

151
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,469
Wait. Who am I talking to?
You're one of 'em.

152
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,134
Anyway, I'd strongly advise you
to move on Dr. Montgomery

153
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,722
before you lose your shot,
or I would if we were friends.

154
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:19,057
- So if she wants to be with Sloan...
- Dude...

155
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,926
if she wanted to be with Sloan,
she'd be with Sloan.

156
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:26,327
The other board members have
a say in who gets to be chief,

157
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,928
but Larry... he's the one
who really decides, okay?

158
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,586
He knows it,
and they know it.

159
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:32,014
So if the attendings
find out he's here...

160
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,837
The man won't get
a moment's peace.

161
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,962
You have to leave now. I want
you all out of here, okay?

162
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:40,113
Look, go, go, go. Out.

163
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:41,496
All right. But you know
where to find me.

164
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,610
Celeste. Larry's assistant.

165
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,483
- He's in here.
- Okay.

166
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:46,605
- Go away.
- But we can help.

167
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,860
- <i>We</i> can help?
- What is that supposed to mean?

168
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,404
He doesn't have any woman parts.

169
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:51,837
It's not like we don't know
where he is.

170
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:53,583
- Right. We'd just come back anyway.
- Right.

171
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,230
Richard. Finally.

172
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:00,525
Oh, for God Sake. What are
the four musketeers doing here?

173
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:01,802
What happened
to "I'll be discreet"?

174
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,142
Larry, they're here
for the same reason I am,

175
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,302
to see if they can help.

176
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,378
Right.

177
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:07,852
Bunch of ghouls.

178
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,454
All right, one of you
wants to be the new chief...

179
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,782
Fix this...

180
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,108
and you got my vote.

181
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,286
And, no,
those are not grapefruits.

182
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,698
Well... looks as though you won't be
needing my services after all.

183
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,310
And suprapubic tenderness.

184
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,919
That's because I haven't
taken a leak in three days.

185
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,491
- Three days.
- Could be a hernia.

186
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,353
A hernia wouldn't do that.

187
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:51,940
Was there trauma?

188
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,845
Testicular torsion,
uh, you know...

189
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:55,516
- twisting?
- Twisting.

190
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,055
You'd have to tie him
in a triple knot

191
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,727
to get that kind of
fluid buildup.

192
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:00,603
Am I wrong?

193
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,316
I was taking a 2-week raft ride
down the Amazon.

194
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:04,808
Maybe it's a tropical disease.

195
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:06,577
Schistosomiasis?
Filariasis?

196
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,570
Well, now they're just guessing.
Richard!

197
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,953
Dr. Bailey, call Dr. Fischer
in urology

198
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,662
to do a suprapubic cath

199
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,906
an order an ultrasound
and K.U.B.

200
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,082
Larry, have you called Nancy?

201
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,786
I don't want to worry my wife
unless I have to.

202
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,570
She wasn't on the trip
with you?

203
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:31,861
White chocolate with...
hmmm, buttercream.

204
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:33,165
Dr. Montgomery.

205
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:34,832
I can't decide.

206
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,979
Triple berry at least has fruit,
so I could pretend it's healthy.

207
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,683
Yeah, Ava's B.P. is 171 over 118.

208
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,544
- She's preeclamptic.
- I ordered blood tests

209
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,224
and a biophysical profile
on the baby.

210
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,647
It was fine, but, uh,
Ava's got edema.

211
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,369
- Get her on mag and hydralazine.
- What about an epidural,

212
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,785
to get her blood pressure down?

213
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:53,629
- I mean, am I going overboard or...
- Believe me,

214
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,725
I wish I had someone

215
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,082
who cared that much
about my blood pressure.

216
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,027
Yeah, well, from what I hear,
in 28 days you will.

217
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,780
I've had a cold,
like forever.

218
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,749
And I've been here
three times,

219
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:10,171
and they keep telling me
it's gonna go away,

220
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,852
but my nose
just won't stop running.

221
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm like the most disgusting
fountain in the world.

222
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,274
Sometimes these things
just drag on.

223
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,815
- You might have to wait it out.
- No, I can't wait anymore.

224
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,737
See, there's, uh,
there's a girl, and...

225
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,471
we've been out a few times,
and now it's gotten to the point

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,617
where we're supposed to,
you know, seal the deal.

227
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,814
But the nose thing is so gross,
I can't get anywhere near her.

228
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,105
Well, I'm sure if she's really
into you, she'll hang in there.

229
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,728
No, no, no. You don't understand.

230
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:37,753
Have you ever met someone
where the attraction was so intense,

231
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,636
you thought it may just kill you?

232
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,311
Like you're in the same room,
and your skin is on fire.

233
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:44,886
You want to touch 'em so bad...

234
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,329
Yeah, okay, we get it.
We're...

235
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,432
- on the case.
- Yes, I will do an E.N.T.,

236
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,120
and you will listen to his, uh...

237
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:52,639
- Chest.
- Yes.

238
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,659
I'm on it.

239
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,293
Which fluid resuscitation
technique

240
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,631
is used in acute burns?

241
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,762
The parkland formula.
Come on, Mer. Step it up.

242
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,818
What is virchow's triad?

243
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:04,112
Oh, I hate George.
He married into the cards.

244
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,487
You think he knew? You think
that's why he married her?

245
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,145
Yeah, that's why
he married her.

246
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:09,487
We need those cards.

247
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,812
We don't need the cards.

248
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,975
- What is virchow's triad?
- Dr. Torres.

249
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,089
Um, Dr. Burke and I are trying
to choose a wedding cake,

250
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:18,093
and there are some samples
in the conference room.

251
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,027
If you have a moment, I would
really love your opinion,

252
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,492
because, you've got such great taste.

253
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,997
You're not getting my cards, Yang.

254
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:26,952
Dr. Bailey...
need an intern?

255
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,847
Uh, yeah. How's it going
in the clinic, O'Malley?

256
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,453
How's Sydney doing?

257
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,414
Oh, that's w-why
you wanted to see me,

258
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,977
to find out how things
were going? I...

259
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,153
- Dr. Bailey, um can I...
- Well...

260
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,726
- talk to you for a second?
- Oh, of course, Ms. Newman.

261
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,903
What can I do for you?

262
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,881
This is embarrassing.

263
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,106
Um, mortifying, actually...

264
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,058
I think I need to be tested.

265
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,692
Larry and I...
Whatever Larry has,

266
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,655
I probably have it as well.

267
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,238
Uh, O'Malley.

268
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,022
- Yeah.
- Page Dr. Montgomery.

269
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:06,550
How's it going, buddy bud?

270
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm getting a strep culture on bed 9
and discharging Mr. Benton.

271
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,187
The gentleman with the sinus issues?

272
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,326
It's a runny nose,
and I have a test to study for,

273
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,219
- and Bailey doesn't like us...
- Bailey's not here today, okay? I am.

274
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,032
And it's all well and good
to open a clinic

275
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,156
as some kind of power play
for chief resident,

276
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,316
but chief resident isn't really
about big think.

277
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,055
It's about patient care, okay?

278
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:27,290
So let's see what we can do
to improve

279
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,196
Mr. Benton's experience.

280
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,321
It's just a cold.

281
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:32,058
Nasal lavage.

282
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,281
- Because we care.
- Nasal lavage?

283
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:37,014
Get yourself a bulb syringe,
squeeze an isotonic solution

284
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,564
into one of Mr. Benton's nostrils.

285
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,146
It'll squirt right out the other
side. Incredibly restorative.

286
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,391
Rinse and repeat.
Rinse and repeat.

287
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:44,883
It's not what you think.

288
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,974
I-I mean, it is. It's, uh...
It's just not an affair.

289
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,974
Though, I guess technically
it is.

290
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:53,548
But we're in love.

291
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,126
The, uh, the kind of love you
think you're never gonna find,

292
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:58,739
and then you do and...
the fact that he's married

293
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:01,061
seems a small price to pay
for being happy, you know?

294
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,747
At least, most of the time.
But then five years go by,

295
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,329
and he still hasn't left
his wife, and...

296
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,095
you must think
I'm a terrible person.

297
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,013
- No, no. No judgment whatsoever.
- I mean,

298
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:14,043
I know I should
leave him, it's just...

299
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,024
Do you have any idea
how rare it is

300
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,296
to find someone you can work
and play with?

301
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,073
And we love each other.

302
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,407
How wrong can it be?

303
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,919
Richard, this thing
still hurts like hell,

304
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,632
and my boys here
are not getting any smaller.

305
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,361
I want to know
what you're doing about it.

306
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,196
Well, the urologist
just drained your bladder.

307
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,872
Next step is an ultrasound
and an X-ray.

308
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,663
The interns will be
taking you up quickly.

309
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,403
No, no, I mean,
what are you doing for me?

310
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,659
Getting some of the best surgeons
in the world to help you.

311
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,070
I came here for you.

312
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:48,732
You.

313
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,158
You're the best surgeon
in this place,

314
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,737
at least you used to be.

315
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,472
What's the problem, Larry?

316
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,698
Am I not taking
good enough care of you?

317
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,609
How does a man lose his...

318
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,116
desire at 53, 54,

319
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,403
however old you are?
How does that happen?

320
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:08,035
I haven't, okay?
There are other things in life.

321
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,261
Like what,

322
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:12,011
Adele leaving you?
Even more reason to keep the job.

323
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,365
You're a surgeon, man.

324
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,185
I have to go skinny-dipping in the
Amazon to get that kind of a thrill.

325
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,194
I'm not gonna let you browbeat
me into keeping this job.

326
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,045
Like I'd even want to
at this point.

327
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,951
When I appointed you
chief of surgery,

328
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,603
you were hungry,
you were the man.

329
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,218
Now you're a politician,

330
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,129
giving me excuses,
handing things off.

331
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:29,241
I hate to think that's the kind
of doctor that you've become,

332
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,289
but if it is...

333
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,984
maybe it is best
that you're stepping down.

334
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,835
I know I said you could use
the day to study,

335
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:44,746
but we've got
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

336
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,876
- A bad car accident?
- Multiple gunshot wounds?

337
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,862
A penis. The chairman
of the board's penis.

338
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:50,979
What's wrong with it?

339
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,643
His testicles have swollen,

340
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,448
which is the understatement
of the year.

341
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,867
Fantastic. How much?

342
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,102
No, you know, don't tell me.
Let it be a surprise.

343
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,590
Look, you and Grey can
take him for his ultrasound

344
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,337
- and his X-ray.
- The V.I. penis.

345
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:04,521
Just go.

346
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,242
Elephantiasis?

347
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:13,353
No way Jennings has that.
Did you check for brucellosis?

348
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,325
It could be
Fournier's gangrene.

349
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:16,953
I don't know.

350
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,831
I'd go to gonorrhea
before I went there.

351
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,497
Then again, I'll be there
at the finish line

352
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,539
to make him pretty,
which is what he'll remember.

353
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,211
Oh, uh, Derek.

354
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,160
Grey wanted me to tell you

355
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,127
that she's still working
on Jennings' X-ray,

356
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:31,259
and that she'll be in the, uh,
X-ray viewing room.

357
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,135
Good to know.

358
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,121
She's communicating.

359
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,899
Just when I need time to think,
she suddenly starts communicating.

360
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,271
Time to think about what?

361
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,677
All of it... the relationship,
the chief thing...

362
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,124
how to juggle both
without getting distracted.

363
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,100
With Cristina,
I have to be explicit.

364
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:50,030
There would be no wedding
if I wasn't.

365
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:52,413
- Oh, it's that easy, huh?
- Oh, no.

366
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,504
I never said it was easy.

367
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,243
Right.

368
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:08,639
- Hey
- Hey. How's it going?

369
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:10,228
I, uh...

370
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,651
caught George in a lie
the other day.

371
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,974
He said he spent
the day in the clinic

372
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,819
when he spent it doing god knows
what with Izzie Stevens.

373
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,686
- It's probably nothing, right?
- Right.

374
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,567
Right.

375
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:25,818
So how's your man-whore?

376
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,208
Miraculously reformed?

377
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
For now.

378
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:32,938
That's never gonna
turn him into...

379
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,144
- what I want.
- Which is?

380
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,290
The whole thing.

381
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,436
I want someone stable
who barbecues

382
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:42,018
and teaches little kids
how to play catch.

383
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,741
That's not Mark Sloan.

384
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,617
Which doesn't explain why
I spent the entire day

385
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:51,030
looking at Alex Karev
like a puppy at a chew toy.

386
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,062
Why don't you just
go there already?

387
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,447
Because he doesn't
barbecue either.

388
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,535
Plus, he's like 12 years old.

389
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,798
Could fit all of
his belongings in a milk crate.

390
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:02,052
I don't know.
Guys like Karev...

391
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,850
Look, at least you know
he'll never lie to you.

392
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,456
Guys like him, they...

393
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,986
They mess around in their 20s,
but, then they, you know...

394
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,170
pack it in and...

395
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,427
and teach their kids
to play catch.

396
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:14,802
Maybe.

397
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:17,299
I need to stop thinking
about both of them.

398
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,707
And I have to stop thinking
about Izzie Stevens.

399
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:21,765
Hey, Callie...

400
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,472
Here's the thing,

401
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,820
when you're obsessing
about something like that,

402
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,216
there's generally a reason.

403
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,543
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:40,848
Nasal lavage.

405
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,003
Why?

406
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,583
Because she's trying
to kill me.

407
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,443
Sydney.

408
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,988
Dr. Bailey, we've really
turned this place around today.

409
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,401
- Nasal lavage?
- Four visits in one month?

410
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,230
Oh, are you questioning
my patient care?

411
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:57,094
Miranda, I get it, okay?
You're protecting your turf.

412
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,869
Very mama bear.
Very chief resident.

413
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,404
But this is not about
hospital politics, okay?

414
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,574
This is about the patient.

415
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,109
The patient can go home.
Get that stuff out of his nose.

416
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,677
No, I'm not comfortable
discharging him

417
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:07,869
until we've addressed
his problem.

418
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,789
The 16 patients
in the waiting room

419
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:10,906
aren't comfortable either.

420
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:15,086
Sir, I...

421
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,424
I-I don't think there's
anything else we can do.

422
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:18,748
You know, colds drag on.

423
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,632
Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

424
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:25,716
- Oh, hell.
- What?

425
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:28,130
That come out of his nose?

426
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,986
See? This is why I'm never
gonna have sex again.

427
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:33,650
Uh, wait right here.

428
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,199
Um, order a head C.T.

429
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,749
Why? It's not a cold?

430
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,951
No, Dr. Stevens.
It's definitely not a cold.

431
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,404
Hey, just so you know,

432
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:54,456
I'll be over here
while you're over there, okay?

433
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,596
Cute.

434
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:56,986
Easy to locate, right?

435
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,819
Girlfriend comes with a G.P.S.

436
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,603
Looks like some kind
of foreign object.

437
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:04,933
- Ouch.
- That almost looks like...

438
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:07,385
A skeleton.
It's skeleton-like.

439
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:08,842
Definitely skeletony.

440
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,979
- Are those barbs?
- No.

441
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,389
- Can't be.
- Well, it could be.

442
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,998
It looks like a teeny,
tiny catfish.

443
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,453
That's close.

444
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:21,676
You see there?

445
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,075
Those are spines.

446
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:25,070
This is a candiru fish.

447
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:26,843
The penis fish?

448
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,033
This guy has the penis fish...

449
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:30,824
In his... in his...

450
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,347
What the hell
did you do to me?

451
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,300
You know, most pregnant
laboring women

452
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,180
- love their epidurals.
- I'm not in labor.

453
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,326
I'm trying to keep it that way.

454
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,803
By paralyzing me
from the waist down?

455
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,285
I can't even sit up
in the bed.

456
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:46,477
I'm missing the show...
the Seattle Grace show.

457
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:47,979
I can help with that.

458
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,433
So I guess you're
talking to me again.

459
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,160
Well, I can't stay mad at you.

460
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:53,504
I tried. But I couldn't do it.

461
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,531
You make your move
on the redhead?

462
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:58,927
I thought you already knew everything
that went on in this hospital.

463
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,559
As a matter of fact,
I have an update.

464
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:02,793
I saw her talking to
the ortho resident.

465
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,971
Yeah, and?

466
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,468
She's seizing.
She's seizing!

467
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:12,723
Somebody page Dr. Montgomery!

468
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,465
Somebody page Dr. Montgomery, now!

469
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:16,479
It's the candiru.

470
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:19,290
It's a freshwater fish
that lives in the Amazon.

471
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,398
It's a parasite.

472
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:22,454
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't drink from the Amazon.

473
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,530
- Did you urinate in it?
- No, I... What?

474
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,850
The candiru is attracted
to blood and urine.

475
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,700
It's been known to swim
up the stream of urine

476
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,662
and lodge itself
in a man's urethra.

477
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,070
You mean a fish swam up...

478
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,502
It's rare, but there are
documented cases.

479
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:36,843
One man actually saw it go in
and tried to grab it.

480
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:38,712
- It was too slippery.
- Yang.

481
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,329
- It's in the literature.
- So this thing is in my...

482
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,064
Is now in your bladder.

483
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,441
Well, right next to it.

484
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:47,380
It's stuck in your, uh,
prostatic urethra,

485
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,935
which is causing
the obstruction.

486
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,795
We need to get it quickly
before it causes sepsis.

487
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:52,964
Sepsis?

488
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,781
You mean I could die?

489
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,051
B.P. shot up to 202 over 134.

490
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,826
There's fetal distress.
The epidural didn't help.

491
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:05,504
- It'll help during delivery.
- What's going on? Alex?

492
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,429
Your blood pressure spiked.
You had a seizure.

493
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,663
The only way we can reduce
your blood pressure

494
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,112
and the swelling in your brain
is if we deliver the baby right now.

495
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:14,823
No. She's only 30 weeks.
I'm not in labor.

496
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,626
We're gonna do a c-section.
Don't worry.

497
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:19,490
The survival rate for preemies
at 30 weeks is extremely high.

498
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,802
Alex, tell her no.

499
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:22,580
- I'm not ready.
- You're ready.

500
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:24,478
But I can't do this
by myself.

501
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:26,403
Then it's a good thing
you're not by yourself.

502
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,555
I was on a consult

503
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,043
on the chairman of the board.
This better be good.

504
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,050
- What do we have?
- We had a patient in the clinic...

505
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,006
Chronic runny nose,
a halo sign on the pillow.

506
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,899
The fluids are still in the lab,
but as far as I can tell...

507
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,655
He's leaking spinal fluid
through his nose.

508
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,045
Thought you might like
this one.

509
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:44,999
Oh, okay. Look at that.

510
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,511
It's a brain herniation.

511
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,287
His brain is literally sinking
into his skull base.

512
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,594
And all along,
I thought it was a cold.

513
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,396
- Book an O.R.
- Dr. Bailey?

514
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:56,072
You're still studying.
You can watch from the gallery.

515
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:58,198
- I'll scrub in with you.
- Thought you're doing Jennings.

516
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:01,423
No, um, I'll do both. I sent
this guy home three times.

517
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,085
I can't not scrub in.

518
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,298
Your daughter is beautiful, Ava.

519
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:13,845
- She is?
- She is.

520
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,920
- Get her over to the warmer right away.
- I'll work on her.

521
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,239
Hand her off to peds.
I need an extra set of hands.

522
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,145
- We need to hang some blood.
- Why?

523
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,677
Why do we need blood?

524
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,240
Want me to get
the uterine arteries?

525
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:24,325
- Yeah.
- Clamp.

526
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,527
Uh, Alex, what's going on?

527
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,562
- Alex.
- If the bleeding vessels are deep...

528
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,934
- You what?
- Ligate around the hemostats.

529
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,333
- Got it.
- Oh my god.

530
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:34,923
I'm gonna die.

531
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:37,242
Oh, my god. I'm gonna die.

532
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:38,724
- Can I?
- Go ahead.

533
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,872
...and my baby's gonna be
all alone. Oh, my god.

534
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:42,664
Ava.

535
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,804
Ava, look at me, okay?
Look at me.

536
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,593
You're not gonna die.
You're doing great.

537
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:52,156
You're gonna be fine.
The baby's gonna be fine.

538
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,034
I just need you to breathe
for me, all right?

539
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,232
Nice slow, deep breaths.

540
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:58,355
That's it.

541
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,137
Just breathe. That's it.

542
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,696
Keep breathing.

543
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:06,486
Celeste.

544
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:08,702
Good news.
No chances of an S.T.D.

545
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:10,903
Now Larry's condition...

546
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,837
He's having surgery,
but you are fine.

547
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:16,839
You did hear the part
about being fine, right?

548
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:18,877
That's what
I keep telling myself,

549
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,371
that I'm fine with things
they way they are, but...

550
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,757
I probably won't be really fine
until...

551
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:27,753
I don't care
if he's fine anymore.

552
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:28,841
Celeste?

553
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,970
I got here as soon as...
Is he in surgery yet?

554
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,741
Um, no. They're taking him soon.
This is Dr. O'Malley.

555
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,985
Dr. O'Malley...
This is Mr. Jennings' wife Nancy.

556
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,235
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure. He's just in there.

557
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:41,576
- They're prepping him for surgery.
- Thank you.

558
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:43,942
I left my car in front
in a no parking zone.

559
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:45,069
Could you move it?

560
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,553
What are you going to do?

561
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,195
Move her car.

562
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:59,575
- Talk about divine retribution.
- What?

563
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:01,981
He sleeps with his assistant
and a carnivorous fish

564
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:03,606
lodges itself in his penis.

565
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,739
That's instant karma
if I've ever seen it.

566
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,364
Well, Derek wasn't
struck by lightning,

567
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,279
- and neither were you.
- Addison showed up.

568
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,778
I had months of pain
and self-loathing,

569
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:14,189
a crazy, ranting mother
and a near drowning

570
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,416
off the side of a dock.

571
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,890
I mean, it's no fish
in my hoo-hoo,

572
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,693
but it's certainly not
an easy ride.

573
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,770
Well, I've cheated
on my boyfriends, and I'm fine.

574
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,252
I mean, am I the only one?

575
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,548
Which cake is your favorite,
or have you chosen one yet?

576
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:28,895
Okay, clearly,
you're not getting the point.

577
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,806
I don't have favorite cakes.
That's why you're involved.

578
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:32,896
We gotta go.

579
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:34,933
If you see my boyfriend,

580
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,403
tell him I had some tuna salad
and a yogurt,

581
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,077
and now I'm off to the O.R.

582
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,047
Okay, this is not eating
for pleasure.

583
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:43,338
I really need a choice,
so mark down your favorite.

584
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,531
Sorry I froze there
for a little bit.

585
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,390
That's okay.

586
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,578
I... I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not getting weird.

587
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,338
- You know, it was a weird question.
- Shut up and eat some cake.

588
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:56,950
- Good?
- Disgusting.

589
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,375
- Karev.
- Hey.

590
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:05,712
I was just checking up on Ava.

591
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:08,079
Do I have another Denny Duquette
situation on my hands?

592
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:09,486
What? Are you serious?

593
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,796
I have never seen you
so attentive with a patient.

594
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:13,711
You're always there...
Checking her stats,

595
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,240
running tests, doing research.

596
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,737
- That's my job.
- No, it's my job.

597
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,029
I'm her doctor.
You're my intern.

598
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,236
Which is why I have to know
her stats at all times.

599
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:23,937
Because I'm not about to stand
next to you in your O.R.

600
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,673
And be anything less
than overprepared.

601
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:28,396
Okay? There's no way I'm gonna
go to work every day

602
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,918
with a surgeon like you and not
be at the top of my game.

603
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:33,248
So if you want to yell at me...

604
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:45,972
Uh, I know you have
to give him the cards

605
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,020
'cause you're married to him.
I respect that.

606
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,497
But there is an argument
to be made for female surgeons

607
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,291
- sticking together.
- You're relentless.

608
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,502
- "Sisterhood" and all that, you know?
- Scary, inhuman relentless.

609
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:58,905
You are like a role model
to me or... something.

610
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,793
Okay, you know what? Stop.
Okay?

611
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,829
This is just getting sad.
I will give the cards to George.

612
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:07,045
- I am sure he will share.
- No, he won't, with me anyway.

613
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,801
He'll just share them with Izzie.

614
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:11,383
They're like an exclusive
little unit. Whatever.

615
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:12,587
Yang.

616
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,786
Uh... my, uh...

617
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,832
My locker
is on the right side,

618
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:20,909
third one from the door.

619
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,242
The cards are on the top shelf.

620
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,992
- Really? You...
- They're all yours.

621
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,283
Oh, god. Um...

622
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,037
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Me, too.

623
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,536
- I was, uh...
- Yeah, I...

624
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,817
- So we're good?
- Yes, good.

625
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,339
Good. Okay, then.

626
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:59,078
Don't talk.

627
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,719
I know it's not fair,
and I know it's not your fault,

628
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,615
I know there's nothing
between you and George.

629
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,629
I know that.

630
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:08,233
Except there is.

631
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,030
You're his best friend.

632
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,111
He loves you.

633
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:15,723
He gets you. He needs you.

634
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,838
And I'm just...
I'm just... I'm his wife.

635
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:19,763
And I know, I know
I get the sex

636
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:21,734
and the commitment
and the life with him...

637
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,554
But I-I want him to get me

638
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,934
and to need me.

639
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:29,622
And I can't compete with you.

640
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,777
So I'm asking you...

641
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,429
to please stop.

642
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:36,896
Just stop.

643
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:38,717
Find another friend.

644
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:41,213
Or whatever you do,
just give me my husband back.

645
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,464
What about the forked stone grasper?

646
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,375
It can lead to urethral injury.

647
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,033
Well, the forceps aren't working.

648
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,912
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

649
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:01,711
All right. Stone grasper.

650
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,050
<i>- Coming in.</i>
- Did we miss anything good?

651
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,252
Hello? You okay?

652
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:17,253
I've had better days.

653
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:19,245
Where's Dr. Bailey?

654
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,092
Page her.

655
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:24,542
V-tach.

656
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:26,448
Does he have a pulse with that?

657
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,542
- Oh, he's going down.
- Yes.

658
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:30,615
He needs 150 of amiodarone.

659
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,976
How much longer
you think it'll take?

660
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,844
You worry about getting
his arrhythmias down.

661
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,615
We're gonna have to change
our game plan.

662
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:37,698
The scope isn't working.
Excuse me, Dr. Fischer.

663
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,094
We're gonna have to
open him up.

664
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,770
I don't know how I missed it.

665
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,616
It presented as a cold, Miranda.

666
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:47,888
This sort of thing, at some point,
ou think it's gonna get better.

667
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:50,635
You don't figure it's something
that could ruin your whole life.

668
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:52,557
- The chief.
- The candiru?

669
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:54,985
- Go ahead. We're almost done here.
- Okay.

670
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,022
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

671
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,401
You want to quiz me
on the G.I. stuff?

672
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,596
No, I'm still trying to get
through my cardio notes.

673
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:10,414
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

674
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,014
I should've snuck in
to the candiru surgery

675
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,788
- with Mer and Cristina.
- You still can...

676
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:16,928
George, can you maybe
stop talking

677
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,529
so I could concentrate?

678
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,724
What's your problem?

679
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:26,616
My problem... is you.

680
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:29,737
You're my penis fish.

681
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,840
Your what?

682
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,084
You've crawled in,
and latched on,

683
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,962
and now I can't move

684
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:39,088
or talk or think or even pee
without the nagging feeling

685
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:41,012
that something is eating
through my organs.

686
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,187
You don't
even have a penis.

687
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,456
- How am I the fish?
- It's a metaphor, George.

688
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,923
What happened to us being fine?

689
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:52,631
I don't know.

690
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,285
Maybe we're not.

691
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,091
A little more suction
there, please.

692
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,696
Those barbs won't let go.

693
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,692
Dr. Bailey,
glad you could join us.

694
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:19,373
Oh, this is useless.

695
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,232
We're gonna have to
cut it out, Dr. Fischer.

696
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,448
- I'll repair the bladder.
- Okay, let's do it.

697
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:26,388
How's his heart holding up?

698
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:27,816
Occasional runs of V-tach.

699
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,666
He can't take much more.

700
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:31,321
Forceps.

701
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,070
Okay. Almost there.
Come on, you.

702
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,816
Almost there.

703
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:47,280
Got it.

704
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:56,805
Oh, man. Unbelievable.

705
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,133
You see that thing?

706
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:11,138
Remind me never
to pee the Amazon.

707
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:13,761
What?

708
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:17,874
What do you say we have a real
meeting of the dirty mistresses club?

709
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:20,761
Like what it should've been
from the beginning.

710
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,414
- What are you doing?
- Once.

711
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,531
20 minutes in the on call room.
Nobody ever finds out.

712
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,884
- Mark.
- What you're telling me

713
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:28,593
everything's great
between you and Derek?

714
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:30,676
What makes you think
there is something wrong

715
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:32,101
between me and Derek?

716
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:35,080
Something's always wrong
between you and Derek.

717
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,533
Enough.
What is wrong with you?

718
00:30:39,394 --> 00:30:40,915
Nothing. I'm... I'm...

719
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:44,230
Addison and I were gonna
try and make a go of it.

720
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:45,788
Things are not
gonna work out.

721
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,970
So you make a pass at me?
Like that'll help.

722
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,873
She doesn't want me.

723
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,935
Something's gotta help.

724
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:55,725
Revenge sex is not the answer.

725
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,623
If you're letting her go,
let her go.

726
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,652
Be an adult.

727
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:09,385
Thanks... for the baby

728
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:11,544
and for me not dying
and stuff.

729
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:14,791
Well, it's always a nice bonus
when a patient doesn't die.

730
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,047
You and red
make a pretty good team.

731
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,482
Don't tell Sloan.

732
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,982
Oh, she and Sloan
aren't happening.

733
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,740
She wants you.

734
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:26,131
- How do you know that?
- I know everything, remember?

735
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,624
I heard her talking
to the ortho doc

736
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:30,265
about how she wants someone
who barbecues and plays catch.

737
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,723
She wants someone
who's committed.

738
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,275
Yeah. Well, that's not me.

739
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,847
I hate to tell you this,
but it is.

740
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:41,098
You may talk tough,
but you're a decent guy, Alex.

741
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,977
Whether you want
to admit it or not,

742
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:44,555
you're actually
one of the good ones.

743
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:49,761
Mrs. Jennings.

744
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:52,869
Your husband's out of surgery.
Everything went very well.

745
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,006
Oh. Oh, thank you.

746
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:58,131
Thank you.
That's... That's wonderful.

747
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,718
Dr. Webber will be down
to fill you in soon.

748
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,743
Uh, Dr. O'Malley,
um, do me a favor.

749
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,643
Could you go tell Celeste?

750
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,571
She's a basket case,
and I just don't have it in me

751
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,806
to take care of my husband's
girlfriend right now.

752
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:17,493
Of course I know.

753
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,868
The wife always knows.

754
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,220
- Dr. O'Malley.
- Yes.

755
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,909
Mr. Jennings', uh,
personal physician

756
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,694
would like a copy
of his medic records.

757
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,327
Um, here's the number.

758
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,663
Mr. Jennings, I've canceled
your appointments for next week.

759
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,184
There's just a conference call

760
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,428
that's proving a little bit
difficult to reschedule.

761
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:53,177
But I'm sure Danny
can handle it.

762
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:56,340
Wait, what's...
What's Danny got to do with it?

763
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,759
I've asked him to step in,

764
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:58,938
temporarily,

765
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,759
until you find someone else.

766
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,911
Now, w-wait, Celeste...

767
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,590
What the hell was that all about?

768
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,609
Well, I think she just left you.

769
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,303
Good-bye, Larry.

770
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,386
What...
What the hell's going on here?

771
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,799
I think I'm done here.

772
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,904
Can you be a vault?

773
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:54,977
I think I need a vault
'cause I've eaten like

774
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:58,192
a cake and a half,
and it's just not cutting it.

775
00:33:58,285 --> 00:33:59,980
- And you don't gossip.
- Because...

776
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:01,569
nobody tells me anything.

777
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,040
I was with a married man.

778
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:05,614
- It was...
- I don't mind

779
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,187
that nobody tells me anything.

780
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:10,466
It was George.

781
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:13,862
I was with George.

782
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:27,598
It should be firm inside,
not spongy.

783
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,807
The frosting,

784
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,052
like meringue...

785
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,521
Light and not too sweet.

786
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,099
I always thought
chocolate inside,

787
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:42,441
but, um, well,
I'm leaning away from that.

788
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:46,047
You've thought a lot
about this cake.

789
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:50,461
This cake...

790
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,748
for this day...

791
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:56,071
with this woman.

792
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:01,866
The red velvet's your winner,
by the way.

793
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:12,346
What are you doing here?

794
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:14,291
I wanted you to know
where I was,

795
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,831
so I thought I'd come
and tell you.

796
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,141
Oh, you're mocking me.

797
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,152
I'm apologizing to you.

798
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,297
You're making light
of things.

799
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,794
I'm running my fingers
through your hair.

800
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,761
I'm standing in your bedroom,

801
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:40,703
unbuttoning my shirt.

802
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,570
And now I'm taking off my pants.

803
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,598
And now...

804
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,335
I'm getting in your bed naked.

805
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,957
Mark...

806
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:08,992
we need to, um...

807
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:13,054
We should go get a drink,
um, and maybe talk.

808
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,303
Do you have some time?

809
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:16,582
Uh, I mean...

810
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,142
just something's always wrong
with you and me...

811
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:26,859
You don't want to have
a drink with me.

812
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,626
I'm not what you're looking for.

813
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,600
What are you talking about?

814
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,340
I slept with someone.

815
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:37,002
Couldn't hold out.

816
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:41,601
Once a man-whore,
always a man-whore, right?

817
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,156
Miranda, go home.

818
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,565
I'm almost done.

819
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,359
Go home. See your family.

820
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:56,597
You have to accept there are
days where you can't do it all.

821
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:58,579
- You have to delegate.
- I did.

822
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,226
And then you do
all the work anyway.

823
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,649
And you're still doing it.

824
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,371
You didn't have
better things to do today

825
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:05,212
than to ride herd
on that V.I.P. case?

826
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,114
There was a fish
in a man's penis.

827
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:10,387
There's always gonna be
a fish in a man's penis, chief.

828
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,455
You can say you movin' on
all you want,

829
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,779
but are you really?

830
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:17,924
If you don't slow down,

831
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,703
you might end up without
a family to go home to.

832
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,022
Good night, Miranda.

833
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:29,816
Now see,
you can't do that.

834
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:30,942
Do what?

835
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:34,487
Not look happy after sex.
It's bad for the ego.

836
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:35,532
I'm fine.

837
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:39,240
- Are we fine?
- Sure.

838
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,378
Not so convincing.

839
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,570
I shouldn't have
accused you of hovering.

840
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:46,596
It wasn't nice.

841
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:48,477
You were just trying
to be there for me.

842
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:52,127
But...

843
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:55,230
now I'm being available,

844
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:57,714
communicating
and getting naked

845
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,108
and doing all of your
favorite things.

846
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:02,066
Mm. Good things.

847
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,001
Then why are you
still staring at the ceiling?

848
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,743
I-I don't know.
I just... I...

849
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:11,134
That day...

850
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,421
You came out of the water...

851
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:18,258
I spent the scariest hour
of my life

852
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:19,760
trying to breathe for you.

853
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:25,415
I love you and I want you,
but I don't know what to...

854
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,217
You didn't swim.

855
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:34,622
You didn't swim,
and you know how to.

856
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:39,093
And I don't know if I can...

857
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,789
I don't know if I wanna...

858
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,580
keep trying to breathe for you.

859
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,220
I should go.

860
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:06,286
I'll go.

861
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,206
<i>Too often,
the thing you want most</i>

862
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,373
<i>is the one thing
you can't have.</i>

863
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:17,056
What acid-based finding

864
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,176
do you classically get
with significant vomiting?

865
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,993
Hypokalemic hypochloremic
metabolic alkalosis.

866
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,270
Unbelievable.

867
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,807
Did you pick a cake?

868
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:32,239
Uh... I like the red one.

869
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,389
The red velvet?

870
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:04,726
That's the girl?

871
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:06,604
Runny nose guy's big love.

872
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:13,508
I don't know
how we do this.

873
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:16,703
I don't know
how we work together

874
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:18,947
and be friends
and act like it's all okay.

875
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:23,393
I, um...

876
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,640
There's a spot available
at Mercy West.

877
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,661
I called them.

878
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:31,922
You're gonna transfer
to Mercy West?

879
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:35,975
I have to.

880
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,904
<i>Desire leaves us heartbroken...</i>

881
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:41,826
<i>It wears us out.</i>

882
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:46,413
<i>Desire can wreck your life.</i>

883
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,915
I was gonna go get a drink.
You want to, uh...

884
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,483
head over to Joe's?

885
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,464
Yeah. Well, I'm kinda under it
with this test.

886
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,106
You know, um...

887
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:06,259
I, uh, took that test
once upon a time.

888
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:08,910
We could, um...

889
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,821
go back to my hotel.

890
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:12,117
I could quiz you.

891
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:14,627
Look, uh, this...

892
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:16,007
This isn't, uh...

893
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,436
You're not my girlfriend.

894
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:21,916
Okay?

895
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:23,732
What?

896
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:25,592
I mean, no offense.
Today was awesome.

897
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:27,883
It's just...
I'm... I'm really busy.

898
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,311
I have a lot of work to do.

899
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:31,066
I don't have time for...

900
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:32,667
No, of course.

901
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:36,975
Uh... study.

902
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,280
That's what you're here for,
right?

903
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:50,439
<i>but as tough as wanting
something can be...</i>

904
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,438
<i>the people who suffer
the most...</i>

905
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,615
<i>are those who don't know
what they want.</i>
