1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:02,263
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,648
I have sex last night
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,178
This is our secret, okay?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,873
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,649
If I'm not having sex,
neither are you.

6
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,527
- Chief resident?
- The one fifth year resident

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,916
that rules all residents.

8
00:00:13,944 --> 00:00:16,883
I went to the board this morning
and told 'em I was retiring.

9
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,272
I came out here to be chief,

10
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,049
- and Meredith complicates that.
- So I just have to pick one?

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,209
If you don't pick one,

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,359
this is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

13
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:26,183
My name is not Ava!

14
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,385
You made it up!
It's not me!

15
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:39,762
What percentage of americans
will get an acute appy?

16
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,801
<i>As interns, we know what we want...</i>

17
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,261
<i>to become surgeons...</i>

18
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,073
<i>And we'll do anything to get there.</i>
7.

19
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:46,829
What are the signs
of residual eye infections?

20
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:49,343
Uh, pus, uh, redness and, uh, fever.

21
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:53,165
<i>Suffer through killer exams,
endure 100-hour weeks,</i>

22
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,942
<i>stand for hours on end
in operating rooms...</i>

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,505
<i>- You name it, we'll do it.</i>
- What's conn's syndrome?

24
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,291
- Uh, w-wait, wait, I know this.
- Oh, tick tock, dude.

25
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:02,512
Cracking under the pressure.

26
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,993
No. Um...
Hypercortolis... Cortisolism!

27
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:08,726
Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Uh,
primary hyperaldosteronism.

28
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,105
Yes! Out of the seat.
My turn.

29
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:11,654
- No, it's my turn.
- No, it is not.

30
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:13,815
- Um, try this one.
- You know, I...

31
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:15,120
White sponge with vanilla buttercream.

32
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,941
Yeah, I'm trying to study for the most
important test of my intern career.

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,359
- I don't have time for wedding cake.
- Well, just try it.

34
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:21,901
Go! Go!

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,254
Uh, what is the strongest
layer of the small bowel?

36
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,285
Fine. Yummy. Go.

37
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:27,111
Damn it,
damn it, damn it.

38
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,238
It is not snot.

39
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:30,715
- Submucosa!
- Yes.

40
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:32,282
Wait, wait, wait.
How do you know that?

41
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:34,638
- Are you studying with the wife's cards
- What cards?

42
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,348
Callie was ranked number one
in her year after this test.

43
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,168
She has legendary flash cards.

44
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,041
We don't need the flash cards.
We are independently brilliant.

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,409
- Dream team.
- Yeah, I'm gonna hurl. Outta the seat.

46
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,244
No, my turn.
I'm gonna kick all your asses.

47
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,452
This is the lemon.
Might be a little tart.

48
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,472
What is actinic keratosis?

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,456
Uh... actinic keratosis is,
uh, a premalignant lesion.

50
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:54,705
- In old people.
- In anyone.

51
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:55,841
Too tart?

52
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:59,071
I don't care.
I mean, is Alex right or am I?

53
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,171
Learn to care,
or I'll get another bride.

54
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,524
I love it. I love all cakes.
Now break the tie.

55
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:10,044
Karev's right.

56
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,326
<i>The tough part, though,
is reconciling</i>

57
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:13,918
<i>this huge thing we want:</i>

58
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,439
<i>to be surgeons...</i>

59
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,517
<i>with everything else we want.</i>

60
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,010
I haven't seen you
in a few days.

61
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:23,644
- I left messages.
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,077
- I was just trying to--
- I know I told you to stop hovering

63
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,852
and you did,
and I appreciate that.

64
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,964
But now stop with the stopping.

65
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,983
No, you're right. It's ridiculous for me
to worry about you all the time.

66
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:34,690
It's sweet that you worry.

67
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:37,422
It is. I should communicate more.

68
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,223
- Right.
- You don't think I can do it.

69
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,471
- I can do it
- Really?

70
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,025
In a few seconds, I'll be
getting on that elevator.

71
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,735
And then I'll be going
on rounds.

72
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:50,605
See, uh, I'm, uh,
getting on the elevator.

73
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,309
Communicating.

74
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,233
28 more days and...

75
00:02:58,786 --> 00:03:00,448
Then it's you and me
in a locked room

76
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,373
for a record-breaking,
earth-shattering,

77
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,621
- mind-blowing...
- Okay! I get it.

78
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:06,998
- Thank you.
- That was less than enthusiastic.

79
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,089
I'm gonna be
more enthusiastic when we...

80
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,365
cross the finish line.

81
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,013
Okay.

82
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,344
Just making sure you haven't
lost interest in the project.

83
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,494
Not at all.

84
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,248
Good.

85
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,645
What are you doing?

86
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,323
The bakery wants me to make
a decision by tomorrow.

87
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,962
So if you can tell me
your favorite by then,

88
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,722
that would be great.

89
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,554
Cakes and little place cards?
Okay, he's turning into a girl.

90
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,521
I think it's sweet. He obviously
cares about this stuff.

91
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,009
This white one
taste's pretty good.

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,675
I should bring a piece
to Derek, right?

93
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:53,699
That's what good girlfriend's do,

94
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,617
bring their boyfriend's cake
and communicate?

95
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:57,987
No. The best ones just keep
all that stuff to themselves.

96
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,893
- Did you bring Callie's cards?
- Uh, no.

97
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,724
- Oh, well, no cake for you.
- Dr. Bailey,

98
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:03,715
I saw a hemiglossectomy
on the board. Can I scrub in?

99
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,414
No, no. You're not
doing surgeries today.

100
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,733
- What?
- Your intern exams are in two weeks.

101
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,360
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

102
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,229
Oh, believe me,

103
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,464
when you won't have to repeat
your year as interns,

104
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,249
you'll be thanking me
for this opportunity.

105
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,944
So, Grey and Yang,
you're... doing scut.

106
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,935
O'Malley, Stevens,
you'll be joing me

107
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,873
in the clinic.
Karev, you're with Ava.

108
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,310
Um, I don't always
have to be on her case.

109
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,841
Someone else can have her.

110
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,462
Or not.

111
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,054
So...

112
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,876
Last night we studied together.

113
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,400
Today we're, uh,
treating patients together.

114
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,499
And we're fine.

115
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,100
We're not tortured,
it's not weird.

116
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,011
We made a mistake
and we've moved on.

117
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,858
If anything, I think it brings
us closer together as friends.

118
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,981
- We're very impressive.
- I think we are.

119
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:54,692
Larry Jennings just checked in
to the hospital.

120
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,625
- What's the matter with him?
- I have no idea.

121
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:59,885
His assistant said it was
a matter of the utmost discretion.

122
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,365
Oh, that's never good.

123
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,003
Yeah, whatever it is,
it was important enough

124
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,322
for him to cut short
his vacation and fly home.

125
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,104
I want you
on point on this one.

126
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,959
- No clinic today.
- Oh, I can do both.

127
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,175
Miranda, we are talking

128
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,676
the chairman of the board
of Seattle Grace hospital.

129
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,929
The clinic will survive
without you for a day.

130
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,793
- Learn to delegate.
- Who am I supposed to delegate to?

131
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,331
Chief Webber,
you paged me?

132
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,616
Sydney Heron
reporting for duty.

133
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,967
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you today.

134
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,692
- Where you been?
- Just getting my assignments.

135
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:35,257
Yeah, anything good?

136
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,797
Anything as good as a crazily
hormonal pregnant amnesiac

137
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,845
with a tendency to yell
at the wrong people?

138
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,261
Your blood pressure's higher
than it should be.

139
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,187
So what,
we're not friends anymore?

140
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:46,909
Fine.

141
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,744
Then I won't tell you about
Dr. Montgomery's sex bet...

142
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,295
with the overly hot Dr. Sloan.
Yeah.

143
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,178
If he can go 60 days without sex,
they're getting back together.

144
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,338
Apparently they used to be a thing

145
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,115
back when she was married
to Dr. Mcdreamy.

146
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,887
The question is, how do you
know all that?

147
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,055
I'm on bed rest 5 feet
from the nurses' station,

148
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,032
and I have excellent hearing.
I know everything.

149
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,041
It's like...
It's like watching a soap.

150
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,483
Do you know how many doctors in this
hospital nurse Olivia has slept with?

151
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,314
Wait. Who am I talking to?
You're one of 'em.

152
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:13,979
Anyway, I'd strongly advise you
to move on Dr. Montgomery

153
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,567
before you lose your shot,
or I would if we were friends.

154
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,902
- So if she wants to be with Sloan...
- Dude...

155
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,771
if she wanted to be with Sloan,
she'd be with Sloan.

156
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,172
The other board members have
a say in who gets to be chief,

157
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,773
but Larry... he's the one
who really decides, okay?

158
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,431
He knows it,
and they know it.

159
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,859
So if the attendings
find out he's here...

160
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,682
The man won't get
a moment's peace.

161
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,807
You have to leave now. I want
you all out of here, okay?

162
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,958
Look, go, go, go. Out.

163
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,341
All right. But you know
where to find me.

164
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:42,455
Celeste. Larry's assistant.

165
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,328
- He's in here.
- Okay.

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,450
- Go away.
- But we can help.

167
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,705
- <i>We</i> can help?
- What is that supposed to mean?

168
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,249
He doesn't have any woman parts.

169
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,682
It's not like we don't know
where he is.

170
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,428
- Right. We'd just come back anyway.
- Right.

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,075
Richard. Finally.

172
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,370
Oh, for God Sake. What are
the four musketeers doing here?

173
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,647
What happened
to "I'll be discreet"?

174
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,987
Larry, they're here
for the same reason I am,

175
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,147
to see if they can help.

176
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,223
Right.

177
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,697
Bunch of ghouls.

178
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,299
All right, one of you
wants to be the new chief...

179
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,627
Fix this...

180
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:16,953
and you got my vote.

181
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,131
And, no,
those are not grapefruits.

182
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,543
Well... looks as though you won't be
needing my services after all.

183
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,375
And suprapubic tenderness.

184
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,984
That's because I haven't
taken a leak in three days.

185
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,556
- Three days.
- Could be a hernia.

186
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,418
A hernia wouldn't do that.

187
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,005
Was there trauma?

188
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,910
Testicular torsion,
uh, you know...

189
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,581
- twisting?
- Twisting.

190
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,120
You'd have to tie him
in a triple knot

191
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,792
to get that kind of
fluid buildup.

192
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:58,668
Am I wrong?

193
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,381
I was taking a 2-week raft ride
down the Amazon.

194
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,873
Maybe it's a tropical disease.

195
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,642
Schistosomiasis?
Filariasis?

196
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,635
Well, now they're just guessing.
Richard!

197
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:10,018
Dr. Bailey, call Dr. Fischer
in urology

198
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,727
to do a suprapubic cath

199
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,971
an order an ultrasound
and K.U.B.

200
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:16,147
Larry, have you called Nancy?

201
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,851
I don't want to worry my wife
unless I have to.

202
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,635
She wasn't on the trip
with you?

203
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:29,926
White chocolate with...
hmmm, buttercream.

204
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,230
Dr. Montgomery.

205
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:32,897
I can't decide.

206
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:36,044
Triple berry at least has fruit,
so I could pretend it's healthy.

207
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,748
Yeah, Ava's B.P. is 171 over 118.

208
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,609
- She's preeclamptic.
- I ordered blood tests

209
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,289
and a biophysical profile
on the baby.

210
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,712
It was fine, but, uh,
Ava's got edema.

211
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,434
- Get her on mag and hydralazine.
- What about an epidural,

212
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:48,850
to get her blood pressure down?

213
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,694
- I mean, am I going overboard or...
- Believe me,

214
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:52,790
I wish I had someone

215
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,147
who cared that much
about my blood pressure.

216
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,092
Yeah, well, from what I hear,
in 28 days you will.

217
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,845
I've had a cold,
like forever.

218
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,814
And I've been here
three times,

219
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,236
and they keep telling me
it's gonna go away,

220
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,917
but my nose
just won't stop running.

221
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,481
I'm like the most disgusting
fountain in the world.

222
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,339
Sometimes these things
just drag on.

223
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,880
- You might have to wait it out.
- No, I can't wait anymore.

224
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,802
See, there's, uh,
there's a girl, and...

225
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,536
we've been out a few times,
and now it's gotten to the point

226
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,682
where we're supposed to,
you know, seal the deal.

227
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,879
But the nose thing is so gross,
I can't get anywhere near her.

228
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:31,170
Well, I'm sure if she's really
into you, she'll hang in there.

229
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,793
No, no, no. You don't understand.

230
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,818
Have you ever met someone
where the attraction was so intense,

231
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,701
you thought it may just kill you?

232
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,376
Like you're in the same room,
and your skin is on fire.

233
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,951
You want to touch 'em so bad...

234
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,394
Yeah, okay, we get it.
We're...

235
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,497
- on the case.
- Yes, I will do an E.N.T.,

236
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,185
and you will listen to his, uh...

237
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,704
- Chest.
- Yes.

238
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,724
I'm on it.

239
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,358
Which fluid resuscitation
technique

240
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:54,696
is used in acute burns?

241
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,827
The parkland formula.
Come on, Mer. Step it up.

242
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,883
What is virchow's triad?

243
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,177
Oh, I hate George.
He married into the cards.

244
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,552
You think he knew? You think
that's why he married her?

245
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,210
Yeah, that's why
he married her.

246
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,552
We need those cards.

247
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,877
We don't need the cards.

248
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,040
- What is virchow's triad?
- Dr. Torres.

249
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,154
Um, Dr. Burke and I are trying
to choose a wedding cake,

250
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:16,158
and there are some samples
in the conference room.

251
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,092
If you have a moment, I would
really love your opinion,

252
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,557
because, you've got such great taste.

253
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,062
You're not getting my cards, Yang.

254
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,017
Dr. Bailey...
need an intern?

255
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,912
Uh, yeah. How's it going
in the clinic, O'Malley?

256
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,518
How's Sydney doing?

257
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:33,479
Oh, that's w-why
you wanted to see me,

258
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:36,042
to find out how things
were going? I...

259
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:38,218
- Dr. Bailey, um can I...
- Well...

260
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,791
- talk to you for a second?
- Oh, of course, Ms. Newman.

261
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,968
What can I do for you?

262
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:45,946
This is embarrassing.

263
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,171
Um, mortifying, actually...

264
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,123
I think I need to be tested.

265
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:54,757
Larry and I...
Whatever Larry has,

266
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,720
I probably have it as well.

267
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,303
Uh, O'Malley.

268
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,087
- Yeah.
- Page Dr. Montgomery.

269
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:04,615
How's it going, buddy bud?

270
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,825
I'm getting a strep culture on bed 9
and discharging Mr. Benton.

271
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,252
The gentleman with the sinus issues?

272
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,391
It's a runny nose,
and I have a test to study for,

273
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,284
- and Bailey doesn't like us...
- Bailey's not here today, okay? I am.

274
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,097
And it's all well and good
to open a clinic

275
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,221
as some kind of power play
for chief resident,

276
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,381
but chief resident isn't really
about big think.

277
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,120
It's about patient care, okay?

278
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:25,355
So let's see what we can do
to improve

279
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,261
Mr. Benton's experience.

280
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:28,386
It's just a cold.

281
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,123
Nasal lavage.

282
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,346
- Because we care.
- Nasal lavage?

283
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,079
Get yourself a bulb syringe,
squeeze an isotonic solution

284
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,629
into one of Mr. Benton's nostrils.

285
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,211
It'll squirt right out the other
side. Incredibly restorative.

286
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,456
Rinse and repeat.
Rinse and repeat.

287
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:42,948
It's not what you think.

288
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,039
I-I mean, it is. It's, uh...
It's just not an affair.

289
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:50,039
Though, I guess technically
it is.

290
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:51,613
But we're in love.

291
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,191
The, uh, the kind of love you
think you're never gonna find,

292
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,804
and then you do and...
the fact that he's married

293
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,126
seems a small price to pay
for being happy, you know?

294
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,812
At least, most of the time.
But then five years go by,

295
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,394
and he still hasn't left
his wife, and...

296
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,160
you must think
I'm a terrible person.

297
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:10,078
- No, no. No judgment whatsoever.
- I mean,

298
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,108
I know I should
leave him, it's just...

299
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,089
Do you have any idea
how rare it is

300
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,361
to find someone you can work
and play with?

301
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,138
And we love each other.

302
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:21,472
How wrong can it be?

303
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:26,984
Richard, this thing
still hurts like hell,

304
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:28,697
and my boys here
are not getting any smaller.

305
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,426
I want to know
what you're doing about it.

306
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:33,261
Well, the urologist
just drained your bladder.

307
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,937
Next step is an ultrasound
and an X-ray.

308
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,728
The interns will be
taking you up quickly.

309
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:40,468
No, no, I mean,
what are you doing for me?

310
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,724
Getting some of the best surgeons
in the world to help you.

311
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,135
I came here for you.

312
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,797
You.

313
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,223
You're the best surgeon
in this place,

314
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:51,802
at least you used to be.

315
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,537
What's the problem, Larry?

316
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,763
Am I not taking
good enough care of you?

317
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,674
How does a man lose his...

318
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,181
desire at 53, 54,

319
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:03,468
however old you are?
How does that happen?

320
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:06,100
I haven't, okay?
There are other things in life.

321
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:07,326
Like what,

322
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,076
Adele leaving you?
Even more reason to keep the job.

323
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,430
You're a surgeon, man.

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,250
I have to go skinny-dipping in the
Amazon to get that kind of a thrill.

325
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,259
I'm not gonna let you browbeat
me into keeping this job.

326
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,110
Like I'd even want to
at this point.

327
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,016
When I appointed you
chief of surgery,

328
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,668
you were hungry,
you were the man.

329
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:23,283
Now you're a politician,

330
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,194
giving me excuses,
handing things off.

331
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,306
I hate to think that's the kind
of doctor that you've become,

332
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:28,354
but if it is...

333
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,049
maybe it is best
that you're stepping down.

334
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,536
I know I said you could use
the day to study,

335
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,447
but we've got
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

336
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,577
- A bad car accident?
- Multiple gunshot wounds?

337
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,563
A penis. The chairman
of the board's penis.

338
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,680
What's wrong with it?

339
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,344
His testicles have swollen,

340
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,149
which is the understatement
of the year.

341
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,568
Fantastic. How much?

342
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:55,803
No, you know, don't tell me.
Let it be a surprise.

343
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:58,291
Look, you and Grey can
take him for his ultrasound

344
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:00,038
- and his X-ray.
- The V.I. penis.

345
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,222
Just go.

346
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:06,943
Elephantiasis?

347
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,054
No way Jennings has that.
Did you check for brucellosis?

348
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,026
It could be
Fournier's gangrene.

349
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:13,654
I don't know.

350
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,532
I'd go to gonorrhea
before I went there.

351
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,198
Then again, I'll be there
at the finish line

352
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,240
to make him pretty,
which is what he'll remember.

353
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:21,912
Oh, uh, Derek.

354
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,861
Grey wanted me to tell you

355
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,828
that she's still working
on Jennings' X-ray,

356
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:27,960
and that she'll be in the, uh,
X-ray viewing room.

357
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,836
Good to know.

358
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:31,822
She's communicating.

359
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:35,600
Just when I need time to think,
she suddenly starts communicating.

360
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,972
Time to think about what?

361
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,378
All of it... the relationship,
the chief thing...

362
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:42,825
how to juggle both
without getting distracted.

363
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,801
With Cristina,
I have to be explicit.

364
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,731
There would be no wedding
if I wasn't.

365
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,114
- Oh, it's that easy, huh?
- Oh, no.

366
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,205
I never said it was easy.

367
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:53,944
Right.

368
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:05,340
- Hey
- Hey. How's it going?

369
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:06,929
I, uh...

370
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,352
caught George in a lie
the other day.

371
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:13,675
He said he spent
the day in the clinic

372
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:16,520
when he spent it doing god knows
what with Izzie Stevens.

373
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,387
- It's probably nothing, right?
- Right.

374
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:21,268
Right.

375
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,519
So how's your man-whore?

376
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,909
Miraculously reformed?

377
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,041
For now.

378
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:29,639
That's never gonna
turn him into...

379
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,845
- what I want.
- Which is?

380
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,991
The whole thing.

381
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,137
I want someone stable
who barbecues

382
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:38,719
and teaches little kids
how to play catch.

383
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,442
That's not Mark Sloan.

384
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,318
Which doesn't explain why
I spent the entire day

385
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,731
looking at Alex Karev
like a puppy at a chew toy.

386
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,763
Why don't you just
go there already?

387
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,148
Because he doesn't
barbecue either.

388
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:54,236
Plus, he's like 12 years old.

389
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,499
Could fit all of
his belongings in a milk crate.

390
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,753
I don't know.
Guys like Karev...

391
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,551
Look, at least you know
he'll never lie to you.

392
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:04,157
Guys like him, they...

393
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,687
They mess around in their 20s,
but, then they, you know...

394
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:07,871
pack it in and...

395
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,128
and teach their kids
to play catch.

396
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,503
Maybe.

397
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,000
I need to stop thinking
about both of them.

398
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,408
And I have to stop thinking
about Izzie Stevens.

399
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,466
Hey, Callie...

400
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:21,173
Here's the thing,

401
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,521
when you're obsessing
about something like that,

402
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,917
there's generally a reason.

403
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,244
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,549
Nasal lavage.

405
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,704
Why?

406
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,284
Because she's trying
to kill me.

407
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,144
Sydney.

408
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,689
Dr. Bailey, we've really
turned this place around today.

409
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,102
- Nasal lavage?
- Four visits in one month?

410
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,931
Oh, are you questioning
my patient care?

411
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,795
Miranda, I get it, okay?
You're protecting your turf.

412
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,570
Very mama bear.
Very chief resident.

413
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:58,105
But this is not about
hospital politics, okay?

414
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,275
This is about the patient.

415
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:01,810
The patient can go home.
Get that stuff out of his nose.

416
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,378
No, I'm not comfortable
discharging him

417
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,570
until we've addressed
his problem.

418
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,490
The 16 patients
in the waiting room

419
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,607
aren't comfortable either.

420
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:11,787
Sir, I...

421
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,125
I-I don't think there's
anything else we can do.

422
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,449
You know, colds drag on.

423
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,333
Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

424
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,417
- Oh, hell.
- What?

425
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:24,831
That come out of his nose?

426
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,687
See? This is why I'm never
gonna have sex again.

427
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:30,351
Uh, wait right here.

428
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,900
Um, order a head C.T.

429
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:36,450
Why? It's not a cold?

430
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:39,652
No, Dr. Stevens.
It's definitely not a cold.

431
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,105
Hey, just so you know,

432
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:51,157
I'll be over here
while you're over there, okay?

433
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,297
Cute.

434
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:53,687
Easy to locate, right?

435
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,520
Girlfriend comes with a G.P.S.

436
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,304
Looks like some kind
of foreign object.

437
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,634
- Ouch.
- That almost looks like...

438
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,086
A skeleton.
It's skeleton-like.

439
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:05,543
Definitely skeletony.

440
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:08,680
- Are those barbs?
- No.

441
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,090
- Can't be.
- Well, it could be.

442
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,699
It looks like a teeny,
tiny catfish.

443
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,154
That's close.

444
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:18,377
You see there?

445
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:19,776
Those are spines.

446
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,771
This is a candiru fish.

447
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:23,544
The penis fish?

448
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,734
This guy has the penis fish...

449
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,525
In his... in his...

450
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,048
What the hell
did you do to me?

451
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,001
You know, most pregnant
laboring women

452
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,881
- love their epidurals.
- I'm not in labor.

453
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,027
I'm trying to keep it that way.

454
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:39,504
By paralyzing me
from the waist down?

455
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,986
I can't even sit up
in the bed.

456
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,178
I'm missing the show...
the Seattle Grace show.

457
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,680
I can help with that.

458
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,134
So I guess you're
talking to me again.

459
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,861
Well, I can't stay mad at you.

460
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,205
I tried. But I couldn't do it.

461
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,232
You make your move
on the redhead?

462
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,628
I thought you already knew everything
that went on in this hospital.

463
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:57,260
As a matter of fact,
I have an update.

464
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,494
I saw her talking to
the ortho resident.

465
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,672
Yeah, and?

466
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,110
She's seizing.
She's seizing!

467
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,424
Somebody page Dr. Montgomery!

468
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,494
Somebody page...

469
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,194
It's the candiru.

470
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,005
It's a freshwater fish
that lives in the Amazon.

471
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,113
It's a parasite.

472
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,169
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't drink from the Amazon.

473
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,245
- Did you urinate in it?
- No, I... What?

474
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,565
The candiru is attracted
to blood and urine.

475
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,415
It's been known to swim
up the stream of urine

476
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,377
and lodge itself
in a man's urethra.

477
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:27,785
You mean a fish swam up...

478
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:30,217
It's rare, but there are
documented cases.

479
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,558
One man actually saw it go in
and tried to grab it.

480
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,427
- It was too slippery.
- Yang.

481
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:37,044
- It's in the literature.
- So this thing is in my...

482
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,779
Is now in your bladder.

483
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,156
Well, right next to it.

484
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:43,095
It's stuck in your, uh,
prostatic urethra,

485
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,650
which is causing
the obstruction.

486
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:47,510
We need to get it quickly
before it causes sepsis.

487
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:48,679
Sepsis?

488
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,496
You mean I could die?

489
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:56,766
B.P. shot up to 202 over 134.

490
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,541
There's fetal distress.
The epidural didn't help.

491
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,219
- It'll help during delivery.
- What's going on? Alex?

492
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:03,144
Your blood pressure spiked.
You had a seizure.

493
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,378
The only way we can reduce
your blood pressure

494
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:07,827
and the swelling in your brain
is if we deliver the baby right now.

495
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:10,538
No. She's only 30 weeks.
I'm not in labor.

496
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,341
We're gonna do a c-section.
Don't worry.

497
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,205
The survival rate for preemies
at 30 weeks is extremely high.

498
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,517
Alex, tell her no.

499
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,295
- I'm not ready.
- You're ready.

500
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,193
But I can't do this
by myself.

501
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:22,118
Then it's a good thing
you're not by yourself.

502
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,270
I was on a consult

503
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:27,758
on the chairman of the board.
This better be good.

504
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,765
- What do we have?
- We had a patient in the clinic...

505
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,721
Chronic runny nose,
a halo sign on the pillow.

506
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:35,614
The fluids are still in the lab,
but as far as I can tell...

507
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,370
He's leaking spinal fluid
through his nose.

508
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:38,760
Thought you might like
this one.

509
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,714
Oh, okay. Look at that.

510
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,226
It's a brain herniation.

511
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:45,002
His brain is literally sinking
into his skull base.

512
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,309
And all along,
I thought it was a cold.

513
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,111
- Book an O.R.
- Dr. Bailey?

514
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,787
You're still studying.
You can watch from the gallery.

515
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,913
- I'll scrub in with you.
- Thought you're doing Jennings.

516
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,138
No, um, I'll do both. I sent
this guy home three times.

517
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,800
I can't not scrub in.

518
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:06,013
Your daughter is beautiful, Ava.

519
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:09,560
- She is?
- She is.

520
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,635
- Get her over to the warmer right away.
- I'll work on her.

521
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:13,954
Hand her off to peds.
I need an extra set of hands.

522
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,860
- We need to hang some blood.
- Why?

523
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,392
Why do we need blood?

524
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,955
Want me to get
the uterine arteries?

525
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,040
- Yeah.
- Clamp.

526
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,242
Uh, Alex, what's going on?

527
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,277
- Alex.
- If the bleeding vessels are deep...

528
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,649
- You what?
- Ligate around the hemostats.

529
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:29,048
- Got it.
- Oh my god.

530
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,638
I'm gonna die.

531
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:32,957
Oh, my god. I'm gonna die.

532
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,439
- Can I?
- Go ahead.

533
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:36,587
...and my baby's gonna be
all alone. Oh, my god.

534
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,379
Ava.

535
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,519
Ava, look at me, okay?
Look at me.

536
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:45,308
You're not gonna die.
You're doing great.

537
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,871
You're gonna be fine.
The baby's gonna be fine.

538
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,749
I just need you to breathe
for me, all right?

539
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,947
Nice slow, deep breaths.

540
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,070
That's it.

541
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:56,852
Just breathe. That's it.

542
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,411
Keep breathing.

543
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,201
Celeste.

544
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:04,417
Good news.
No chances of an S.T.D.

545
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,618
Now Larry's condition...

546
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,552
He's having surgery,
but you are fine.

547
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,554
You did hear the part
about being fine, right?

548
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:14,592
That's what
I keep telling myself,

549
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,086
that I'm fine with things
they way they are, but...

550
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,472
I probably won't be really fine
until...

551
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,468
I don't care
if he's fine anymore.

552
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:24,556
Celeste?

553
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,685
I got here as soon as...
Is he in surgery yet?

554
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,456
Um, no. They're taking him soon.
This is Dr. O'Malley.

555
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,700
Dr. O'Malley...
This is Mr. Jennings' wife Nancy.

556
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,950
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure. He's just in there.

557
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,291
- They're prepping him for surgery.
- Thank you.

558
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,657
I left my car in front
in a no parking zone.

559
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,784
Could you move it?

560
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,268
What are you going to do?

561
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:50,910
Move her car.

562
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,290
- Talk about divine retribution.
- What?

563
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:57,696
He sleeps with his assistant
and a carnivorous fish

564
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,321
lodges itself in his penis.

565
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:01,454
That's instant karma
if I've ever seen it.

566
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,079
Well, Derek wasn't
struck by lightning,

567
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:04,994
- and neither were you.
- Addison showed up.

568
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,493
I had months of pain
and self-loathing,

569
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:09,904
a crazy, ranting mother
and a near drowning

570
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,131
off the side of a dock.

571
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,605
I mean, it's no fish
in my hoo-hoo,

572
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,408
but it's certainly not
an easy ride.

573
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,485
Well, I've cheated
on my boyfriends, and I'm fine.

574
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:17,967
I mean, am I the only one?

575
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:22,263
Which cake is your favorite,
or have you chosen one yet?

576
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,610
Okay, clearly,
you're not getting the point.

577
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,521
I don't have favorite cakes.
That's why you're involved.

578
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:28,611
We gotta go.

579
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,648
If you see my boyfriend,

580
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:33,118
tell him I had some tuna salad
and a yogurt,

581
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:34,792
and now I'm off to the O.R.

582
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:36,762
Okay, this is not eating
for pleasure.

583
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,053
I really need a choice,
so mark down your favorite.

584
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,246
Sorry I froze there
for a little bit.

585
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,105
That's okay.

586
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:47,293
I... I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not getting weird.

587
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:50,053
- You know, it was a weird question.
- Shut up and eat some cake.

588
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,665
- Good?
- Disgusting.

589
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:00,090
- Karev.
- Hey.

590
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:01,427
I was just checking up on Ava.

591
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,794
Do I have another Denny Duquette
situation on my hands?

592
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:05,201
What? Are you serious?

593
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,511
I have never seen you
so attentive with a patient.

594
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,426
You're always there...
Checking her stats,

595
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:10,955
running tests, doing research.

596
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,452
- That's my job.
- No, it's my job.

597
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:14,744
I'm her doctor.
You're my intern.

598
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:16,951
Which is why I have to know
her stats at all times.

599
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,652
Because I'm not about to stand
next to you in your O.R.

600
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,388
And be anything less
than overprepared.

601
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,111
Okay? There's no way I'm gonna
go to work every day

602
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,633
with a surgeon like you and not
be at the top of my game.

603
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:28,963
So if you want to yell at me...

604
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:40,252
Uh, I know you have
to give him the cards

605
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,300
'cause you're married to him.
I respect that.

606
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,777
But there is an argument
to be made for female surgeons

607
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,571
- sticking together.
- You're relentless.

608
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,782
- "Sisterhood" and all that, you know?
- Scary, inhuman relentless.

609
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:53,174
You are like a role model
to me or... something.

610
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,212
Okay, you know what? Stop.
Okay?

611
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,832
This is just getting sad.
I will give the cards to George.

612
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:01,325
- I am sure he will share.
- No, he won't, with me anyway.

613
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,081
He'll just share them with Izzie.

614
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,663
They're like an exclusive
little unit. Whatever.

615
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:06,867
Yang.

616
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,066
Uh... my, uh...

617
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,112
My locker
is on the right side,

618
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,189
third one from the door.

619
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,522
The cards are on the top shelf.

620
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,272
- Really? You...
- They're all yours.

621
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:32,563
Oh, god. Um...

622
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:34,317
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Me, too.

623
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:35,816
- I was, uh...
- Yeah, I...

624
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,097
- So we're good?
- Yes, good.

625
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:38,619
Good. Okay, then.

626
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:53,358
Don't talk.

627
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,999
I know it's not fair,
and I know it's not your fault,

628
00:25:58,008 --> 00:25:59,895
I know there's nothing
between you and George.

629
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:00,909
I know that.

630
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,513
Except there is.

631
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,310
You're his best friend.

632
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,391
He loves you.

633
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:10,003
He gets you. He needs you.

634
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,118
And I'm just...
I'm just... I'm his wife.

635
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,043
And I know, I know
I get the sex

636
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:16,014
and the commitment
and the life with him...

637
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:18,834
But I-I want him to get me

638
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:21,214
and to need me.

639
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:23,902
And I can't compete with you.

640
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:27,057
So I'm asking you...

641
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:28,709
to please stop.

642
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:31,176
Just stop.

643
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:32,997
Find another friend.

644
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:35,493
Or whatever you do,
just give me my husband back.

645
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,744
What about the forked stone grasper?

646
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,655
It can lead to urethral injury.

647
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,313
Well, the forceps aren't working.

648
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,192
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

649
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,991
All right. Stone grasper.

650
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:59,330
<i>- Coming in.</i>
- Did we miss anything good?

651
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,532
Hello? You okay?

652
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,533
I've had better days.

653
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,525
Where's Dr. Bailey?

654
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,372
Page her.

655
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:18,822
V-tach.

656
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:20,728
Does he have a pulse with that?

657
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:22,822
- Oh, he's going down.
- Yes.

658
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:24,895
He needs 150 of amiodarone.

659
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,256
How much longer
you think it'll take?

660
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,124
You worry about getting
his arrhythmias down.

661
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,895
We're gonna have to change
our game plan.

662
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,978
The scope isn't working.
Excuse me, Dr. Fischer.

663
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,374
We're gonna have to
open him up.

664
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,050
I don't know how I missed it.

665
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:38,896
It presented as a cold, Miranda.

666
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,168
This sort of thing, at some point,
ou think it's gonna get better.

667
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:44,915
You don't figure it's something
that could ruin your whole life.

668
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,837
- The chief.
- The candiru?

669
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,265
- Go ahead. We're almost done here.
- Okay.

670
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,302
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

671
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,681
You want to quiz me
on the G.I. stuff?

672
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:00,876
No, I'm still trying to get
through my cardio notes.

673
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:04,694
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

674
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,294
I should've snuck in
to the candiru surgery

675
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:09,068
- with Mer and Cristina.
- You still can...

676
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,208
George, can you maybe
stop talking

677
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,809
so I could concentrate?

678
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,004
What's your problem?

679
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,896
My problem... is you.

680
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,017
You're my penis fish.

681
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,120
Your what?

682
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:28,364
You've crawled in,
and latched on,

683
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,242
and now I can't move

684
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,368
or talk or think or even pee
without the nagging feeling

685
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:35,292
that something is eating
through my organs.

686
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:36,467
You don't
even have a penis.

687
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:38,736
- How am I the fish?
- It's a metaphor, George.

688
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,203
What happened to us being fine?

689
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,911
I don't know.

690
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:50,565
Maybe we're not.

691
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:01,371
A little more suction
there, please.

692
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:03,976
Those barbs won't let go.

693
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,972
Dr. Bailey,
glad you could join us.

694
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:13,653
Oh, this is useless.

695
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,512
We're gonna have to
cut it out, Dr. Fischer.

696
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,728
- I'll repair the bladder.
- Okay, let's do it.

697
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,668
How's his heart holding up?

698
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:22,096
Occasional runs of V-tach.

699
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,946
He can't take much more.

700
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:25,601
Forceps.

701
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,350
Okay. Almost there.
Come on, you.

702
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,096
Almost there.

703
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,560
Got it.

704
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,085
Oh, man. Unbelievable.

705
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:58,413
You see that thing?

706
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:05,418
Remind me never
to pee the Amazon.

707
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:08,041
What?

708
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:12,154
What do you say we have a real
meeting of the dirty mistresses club?

709
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:15,041
Like what it should've been
from the beginning.

710
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:16,694
- What are you doing?
- Once.

711
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,811
20 minutes in the on call room.
Nobody ever finds out.

712
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,164
- Mark.
- What you're telling me

713
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:22,873
everything's great
between you and Derek?

714
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,956
What makes you think
there is something wrong

715
00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:26,381
between me and Derek?

716
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:29,360
Something's always wrong
between you and Derek.

717
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,813
Enough.
What is wrong with you?

718
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,195
Nothing. I'm... I'm...

719
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,510
Addison and I were gonna
try and make a go of it.

720
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,068
Things are not
gonna work out.

721
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:43,250
So you make a pass at me?
Like that'll help.

722
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,375
She doesn't want me.

723
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,215
Something's gotta help.

724
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:50,005
Revenge sex is not the answer.

725
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:52,903
If you're letting her go,
let her go.

726
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,932
Be an adult.

727
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:03,665
Thanks... for the baby

728
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,824
and for me not dying
and stuff.

729
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,071
Well, it's always a nice bonus
when a patient doesn't die.

730
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:12,327
You and red
make a pretty good team.

731
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:13,762
Don't tell Sloan.

732
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,262
Oh, she and Sloan
aren't happening.

733
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,020
She wants you.

734
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,411
- How do you know that?
- I know everything, remember?

735
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,904
I heard her talking
to the ortho doc

736
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,545
about how she wants someone
who barbecues and plays catch.

737
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,003
She wants someone
who's committed.

738
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,555
Yeah. Well, that's not me.

739
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,127
I hate to tell you this,
but it is.

740
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:35,378
You may talk tough,
but you're a decent guy, Alex.

741
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:37,257
Whether you want
to admit it or not,

742
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:38,835
you're actually
one of the good ones.

743
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,041
Mrs. Jennings.

744
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,149
Your husband's out of surgery.
Everything went very well.

745
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,286
Oh. Oh, thank you.

746
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,411
Thank you.
That's... That's wonderful.

747
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:54,998
Dr. Webber will be down
to fill you in soon.

748
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,023
Uh, Dr. O'Malley,
um, do me a favor.

749
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:00,923
Could you go tell Celeste?

750
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,851
She's a basket case,
and I just don't have it in me

751
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,086
to take care of my husband's
girlfriend right now.

752
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:11,773
Of course I know.

753
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,148
The wife always knows.

754
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,223
- Dr. O'Malley.
- Yes.

755
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:32,912
Mr. Jennings', uh,
personal physician

756
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:34,697
would like a copy
of his medic records.

757
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,330
Um, here's the number.

758
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:40,666
Mr. Jennings, I've canceled
your appointments for next week.

759
00:32:40,713 --> 00:32:42,187
There's just a conference call

760
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:44,431
that's proving a little bit
difficult to reschedule.

761
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:46,180
But I'm sure Danny
can handle it.

762
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,343
Wait, what's...
What's Danny got to do with it?

763
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:50,762
I've asked him to step in,

764
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,941
temporarily,

765
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:53,762
until you find someone else.

766
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:55,914
Now, w-wait, Celeste...

767
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,593
What the hell was that all about?

768
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:03,612
Well, I think she just left you.

769
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,306
Good-bye, Larry.

770
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,389
What...
What the hell's going on here?

771
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:21,802
I think I'm done here.

772
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,907
Can you be a vault?

773
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:47,980
I think I need a vault
'cause I've eaten like

774
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,195
a cake and a half,
and it's just not cutting it.

775
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:52,983
- And you don't gossip.
- Because...

776
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,572
nobody tells me anything.

777
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:56,043
I was with a married man.

778
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:58,617
- It was...
- I don't mind

779
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,190
that nobody tells me anything.

780
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,469
It was George.

781
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:06,865
I was with George.

782
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:20,601
It should be firm inside,
not spongy.

783
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:24,810
The frosting,

784
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:27,055
like meringue...

785
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,524
Light and not too sweet.

786
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,102
I always thought
chocolate inside,

787
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:35,444
but, um, well,
I'm leaning away from that.

788
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,050
You've thought a lot
about this cake.

789
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:43,464
This cake...

790
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,751
for this day...

791
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,074
with this woman.

792
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:54,869
The red velvet's your winner,
by the way.

793
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:05,349
What are you doing here?

794
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:07,294
I wanted you to know
where I was,

795
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,834
so I thought I'd come
and tell you.

796
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,144
Oh, you're mocking me.

797
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,155
I'm apologizing to you.

798
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,300
You're making light
of things.

799
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,797
I'm running my fingers
through your hair.

800
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:30,764
I'm standing in your bedroom,

801
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:33,706
unbuttoning my shirt.

802
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,154
And now I'm taking off my pants.

803
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,601
And now...

804
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,338
I'm getting in your bed naked.

805
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,960
Mark...

806
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:01,995
we need to, um...

807
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:06,057
We should go get a drink,
um, and maybe talk.

808
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,306
Do you have some time?

809
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,585
Uh, I mean...

810
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:13,145
just something's always wrong
with you and me...

811
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:19,862
You don't want to have
a drink with me.

812
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,629
I'm not what you're looking for.

813
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:25,603
What are you talking about?

814
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,343
I slept with someone.

815
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,005
Couldn't hold out.

816
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,604
Once a man-whore,
always a man-whore, right?

817
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:43,159
Miranda, go home.

818
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:44,568
I'm almost done.

819
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,362
Go home. See your family.

820
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,600
You have to accept there are
days where you can't do it all.

821
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,582
- You have to delegate.
- I did.

822
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:53,229
And then you do
all the work anyway.

823
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:54,652
And you're still doing it.

824
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:56,374
You didn't have
better things to do today

825
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,215
than to ride herd
on that V.I.P. case?

826
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,117
There was a fish
in a man's penis.

827
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:03,390
There's always gonna be
a fish in a man's penis, chief.

828
00:37:03,477 --> 00:37:05,458
You can say you movin' on
all you want,

829
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:06,782
but are you really?

830
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:10,927
If you don't slow down,

831
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:13,706
you might end up without
a family to go home to.

832
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,025
Good night, Miranda.

833
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,819
Now see,
you can't do that.

834
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:23,945
Do what?

835
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:27,490
Not look happy after sex.
It's bad for the ego.

836
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:28,535
I'm fine.

837
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,243
- Are we fine?
- Sure.

838
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:34,381
Not so convincing.

839
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:38,573
I shouldn't have
accused you of hovering.

840
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:39,599
It wasn't nice.

841
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,480
You were just trying
to be there for me.

842
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:45,130
But...

843
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,233
now I'm being available,

844
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,717
communicating
and getting naked

845
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,111
and doing all of your
favorite things.

846
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,069
Mm. Good things.

847
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:58,004
Then why are you
still staring at the ceiling?

848
00:37:58,023 --> 00:37:59,746
I-I don't know.
I just... I...

849
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,137
That day...

850
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:07,424
You came out of the water...

851
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:11,261
I spent the scariest hour
of my life

852
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,763
trying to breathe for you.

853
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:18,418
I love you and I want you,
but I don't know what to...

854
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:23,220
You didn't swim.

855
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,625
You didn't swim,
and you know how to.

856
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:32,096
And I don't know if I can...

857
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:35,792
I don't know if I wanna...

858
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:38,583
keep trying to breathe for you.

859
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,223
I should go.

860
00:38:58,275 --> 00:38:59,289
I'll go.

861
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:05,209
<i>Too often,
the thing you want most</i>

862
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:07,376
<i>is the one thing
you can't have.</i>

863
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:10,059
What acid-based finding

864
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:12,179
do you classically get
with significant vomiting?

865
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:14,996
Hypokalemic hypochloremic
metabolic alkalosis.

866
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,273
Unbelievable.

867
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:20,810
Did you pick a cake?

868
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,242
Uh... I like the red one.

869
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:29,392
The red velvet?

870
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:57,729
That's the girl?

871
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,607
Runny nose guy's big love.

872
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:06,511
I don't know
how we do this.

873
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:09,706
I don't know
how we work together

874
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:11,950
and be friends
and act like it's all okay.

875
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:16,396
I, um...

876
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,643
There's a spot available
at Mercy West.

877
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:21,664
I called them.

878
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,925
You're gonna transfer
to Mercy West?

879
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:28,978
I have to.

880
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:32,907
<i>Desire leaves us heartbroken...</i>

881
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:34,829
<i>It wears us out.</i>

882
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:39,416
<i>Desire can wreck your life.</i>

883
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:45,918
I was gonna go get a drink.
You want to, uh...

884
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,486
head over to Joe's?

885
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:50,467
Yeah. Well, I'm kinda under it
with this test.

886
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:54,109
You know, um...

887
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:59,262
I, uh, took that test
once upon a time.

888
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:01,913
We could, um...

889
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,824
go back to my hotel.

890
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:05,120
I could quiz you.

891
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:07,630
Look, uh, this...

892
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,010
This isn't, uh...

893
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,439
You're not my girlfriend.

894
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:14,919
Okay?

895
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:16,735
What?

896
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:18,595
I mean, no offense.
Today was awesome.

897
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:20,886
It's just...
I'm... I'm really busy.

898
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,314
I have a lot of work to do.

899
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,069
I don't have time for...

900
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:25,670
No, of course.

901
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:29,978
Uh... study.

902
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,283
That's what you're here for,
right?

903
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,442
<i>but as tough as wanting
something can be...</i>

904
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:51,441
<i>the people who suffer
the most...</i>

905
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,282
<i>are those who don't know
what they want.</i>
