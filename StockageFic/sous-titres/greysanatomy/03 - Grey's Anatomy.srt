[The Ditty Bops: There's a Girl]

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,772
[Meredith] We live out
our lives on the surgical unit.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,233
Seven days a week, 14 hours a day.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,141
We're together more than we're apart.

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,443
Aah!

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,313
George's room is bigger than mine.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,010
[Sighing]

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,180
[Thudding] Augh!

9
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,450
After a while...

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,358
- I should have the bigger room.
...the ways of residency...

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,623
- I got here first.
- Meredith should decide.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,164
...become the ways of life.

13
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,166
[George] My room is two inches bigger.

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,862
- Number one...
- [lzzie] You have a bigger closet.

15
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,201
- Why is everything a competition?
- Always keep score.

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,971
Number two: Do whatever you can
to outsmart the other guy.

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,877
Everywhere else is filled
with Meredith's mom's boxes.

18
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,710
Meredith? When is your mom
coming back to town, anyway?

19
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,217
[George] Maybe we can
put her boxes in storage.

20
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,118
[Lzzie] Unpack a few things,
make this place more homey.

21
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,486
Some throw pillows,
lamps, a few paintings.

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,320
[George] Paintings would be nice.

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,451
You have this amazing stuff packed away.

24
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,587
I found this box
with tapes of your mother

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,722
performing amazing medical procedures.

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,063
We should watch them.
Do you want to watch...?

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,373
Meredith, do you want some privacy?

28
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,673
[Sighing]

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,112
Number three:
Don't make friends with the enemy.

30
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,755
- Morning, Dr. Bailey.
- Shut up.

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,255
You realize that I'm an attending,
and you're only a resident.

32
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,725
- That you work for me?
- I know I've forgotten something.

33
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,595
Something is happening today.

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,296
I know I should know what it is,
but I just can't...

35
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,271
- Nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey.
- It's in front of my face.

36
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,935
- [Gasps] Doctor!
- Whoo-hoo!

37
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,808
[Horns honking]

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,972
Whoo!

39
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,037
Augh!

40
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,105
Now I remember.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,478
[Horns honking]

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,785
[Bailey] Watch out. Watch out.

43
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,679
Ooh!

44
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,156
Whoa!

45
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,219
Fools on bikes, killing themselves.
Natural selection is what it is.

46
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,856
So, what's up with the Nazi?
Is she off her meds?

47
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,593
You never heard of the race?

48
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,500
[Richard] Excellent board,
well-timed, balanced, efficient.

49
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,131
If all goes well,
we'll have an early night.

50
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,971
Chief, Dead Baby Bike Race
started 20 minutes ago.

51
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,534
All right, people!
Dead Baby Bike Race day!

52
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,979
- Every year, this bar...
- The Dead Baby bar.

53
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,539
Every year, they hold
this underground bike race.

54
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,951
You wonder why someone would
name a bar something so disgusting?

55
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,989
Keep your panties on, Nancy Drew.

56
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,355
- The race is completely illegal and...
- Crazy.

57
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,951
Bike messengers
racing against traffic,

58
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,657
trying to beat each other
for free shots of tequila.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,292
No-holds-barred competition,
sounds like fun.

60
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,359
The race doesn't even have any rules,

61
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,370
except eye-gouging. No eye-gouging.

62
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,804
We'll be trapped
in the pit Band-Aiding idiots

63
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,273
when we could be up in the OR.

64
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,539
What kind of people engage in
a race that has, as its only rule,

65
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,604
that you can't rip out the eyeballs
of another human being?

66
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,842
Men, Georgie. Men.

67
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,718
[Bailey] I need someone to get up to the
OR floor. The chief needs a right hand.

68
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,224
[Meredith] Oh, and yeah, number four...

69
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,192
[sighing] George.

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,420
[All sigh]

71
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,123
Everything, everything,
is a competition.

72
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,326
OK, people. The rules of trauma.
Don't mingle with interns.

73
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,528
They don't know
their ass from esophagus.

74
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,697
Sew fast, discharge faster.
Get bodies up to the OR.

75
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,799
And don't let me catch you
fighting over patients. Got it?

76
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,844
Come on, let's go.

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,752
Oh, it's like candy, but with blood,
which is so much better!

78
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,914
- Oh, my God.
- Mine.

79
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,821
No! I saw him first!

80
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,861
[Meredith] Whoever said
winning wasn't everything...

81
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,395
Ooh. I'll take that guy.

82
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,363
You'll have to beat me to him first.

83
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,866
...never held a scalpel.

84
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,601
[Psapp: Nobody Knows]

85
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,629
Heads, he's mine. Tails, he's yours.

86
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,096
Why do you get to be "heads"?

87
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,463
I have a head,
and honey, you are a tail.

88
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,762
Excuse me.

89
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,031
How do you manage
to make everything dirty?

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,835
Ha! Tails.
There are plenty of other cases.

91
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,603
So, go get one. I was here first.

92
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,579
I am not backing down so I can do
sutures all day while you're in the OR.

93
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,673
This is a surgical case,
and you know it.

94
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,310
It's superficial.
It's cool, but it's superficial.

95
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,253
You know those things
didn't rupture his peritoneum?

96
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,756
Because he's sitting up
and he's talking to us.

97
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,622
Hello. Excuse me,
I was wondering if you could

98
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,561
take these out and sew me up,
so I could go and win my race.

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,860
- We can't just pull them out...
- [grunts]

100
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,457
- We have to do some tests
- Ow, wicked.

101
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,129
[Meredith] Are you out of your mind?

102
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,001
It's a superficial wound.

103
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,940
Sew him up and let him finish his race.

104
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,806
Hey, good man.

105
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,971
[Cristina] John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian,

106
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,845
hit by a motorist swerving
to avoid a bike.

107
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,009
GCS 3. Pupils fixed and dilated.

108
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:24,045
Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s.
BP 183 over 112. Pulse-ox 98 percent.

109
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,057
Chest showed widened mediastinum

110
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,286
and head CT revealed cerebral edema.

111
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,852
He's gotten 70 of mannitol,
dexamethasone 10

112
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,330
- and a gram of phenytoin.
- Give him to the OR?

113
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,367
- Is he gorked?
- Looks like.

114
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,871
[Burke] The bike race
claims its first victim.

115
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,202
I'll make my AAA repair after all.

116
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,805
Uh, Dr. Shepherd?
He's not going to the OR?

117
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,335
No. Do an EEG and confirmatory tests.

118
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,612
If he doesn't respond
in six hours, declare him.

119
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,112
- Declare him? Declare him what?
- Brain-dead.

120
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,293
[Sighs]

121
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,861
Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me.
Should I scrub in?

122
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,769
No. I'm stuck here all day.
I need you on the floor,

123
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,798
- monitoring pre and post-op patients.
- Oh.

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,875
- You got a problem with that, O'Malley?
- Oh, uh, no, sir.

125
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:27,377
A buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd Mackie.
Give him whatever he needs.

126
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,883
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,268
[O'Malley] Mr. Mackie...

128
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,171
No smoking!

129
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,870
- There's no smoking.
- Why not?

130
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,845
Oh, my God... You're in a hospital!

131
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,006
Your point being...?

132
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,083
I don't know if you've listened
to the surgeon general lately,

133
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,054
say, in the past 20 years,

134
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,114
but smoking is bad.
Smoking will kill you.

135
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,422
Liver cancer will kill me.

136
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,793
Smoking will just
speed up the process.

137
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,463
You're at the top of the
donor list for a new liver.

138
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,968
There's hope.

139
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,597
Sweetheart, I've been
at the top of the list for...

140
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,074
...eight months.

141
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,508
I'm not in a batter's cage.

142
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,979
I'm in a dugout, about to be traded.

143
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,576
- You like baseball?
- No.

144
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,513
Oh.

145
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,421
Um, well, um, the chief
wanted me to look in on you.

146
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,480
Hmm.

147
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,652
Richard's a dear old friend.

148
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,322
He's been my doctor for 30 years.

149
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,834
Well, whatever you need, I'm your man.

150
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,129
Just name it.

151
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,670
Well...

152
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,301
I'm sure I'll think of something.

153
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,175
- [Machine beeping]
- Absent corneal reflexes.

154
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,812
It's been 55 minutes.

155
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,880
If he doesn't respond to tests
in the next five hours, what?

156
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,892
We stand here and watch him die?

157
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,155
[Cristina] If he doesn't
respond to tests,

158
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,527
it's because he's already dead.

159
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,657
[Scoffing] Technically. Legally.

160
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,601
- Actually, lzzie. Actually dead.
- He's breathing. He has a heartbeat.

161
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,434
Look at his EEG.
There's no higher-brain function.

162
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,702
He'll never talk, move or think again.

163
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,608
There's no one in there.
Think like a doctor, lzzie.

164
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,205
He could wake up.
What about a miracle?

165
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,750
[Lzzie] There are
medical miracles, you know.

166
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,343
I know. You're right, miracles happen.

167
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,149
[Derek] People do wake up.

168
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,453
That's why we do a series
of tests over a number of hours.

169
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,084
So when we call time of death,

170
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,357
we know that we've
done everything to make sure

171
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,159
it's actually his time of death.

172
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,599
That there isn't gonna be any miracles.

173
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,571
This is the hard part.

174
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,872
To stand around as surgeons and not cut.

175
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,107
That's what "do no harm" means.

176
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,352
I wish he'd just go into the light
already so I can get on another case.

177
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,584
Oh, I'm the devil
because I'd rather be in surgery

178
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,220
instead of standing watch
over the death squad?

179
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,763
It's depressing.

180
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,131
Look at his sneakers.
They're brand-new.

181
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,673
And somebody sewed
this tear in his shirt.

182
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,403
And he has one of those
electronic key cards.

183
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,739
He belongs to someone.

184
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,372
An hour ago, he was out there, alive.

185
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,576
To simply stand here
and wait for him to die...

186
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,710
- It would be a waste of life.
- Exactly.

187
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,482
It'd be a waste of organs.

188
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,962
Ahh. You've got a nice touch.

189
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,762
[Sighs] And, by the way,
you are a rockin' babe.

190
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,895
Seriously, do you actually
think you have a shot here?

191
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,372
I'd like to think
I've got a shot anywhere.

192
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,806
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

193
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,935
Look, you really have
to let me take you for some tests.

194
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,877
You could have internal bleeding.

195
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,415
No, thank you,
I've got a race to get back to.

196
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,417
Why? You can't win now, anyway.

197
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,045
Doesn't mean I can't cross
that finish line.

198
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,248
There's a party at the finish line.

199
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,257
Do you want to meet me there?

200
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,385
One test. A CT.
I'll have you out of here in an hour.

201
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,726
I can't do it. Got to go.

202
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,526
[Groaning]

203
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,591
Well, you realize you're leaving
against medical advice,

204
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,637
and that I strongly urge you to stay.

205
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,467
The frat guy said I could go.

206
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,973
The frat guy is an ass.

207
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,342
OK, well, you have to sign an AMA form.

208
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,746
Darling, I will do
anything you want me to.

209
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,717
What is it with you guys

210
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,686
and your need
to dirty everything up?

211
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,020
I don't know.
Maybe it's just testosterone, eh?

212
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,217
Maybe.

213
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,557
You might want to see
a doctor about that too.

214
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,891
Come here.

215
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,163
[Grunting]

216
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,896
[Sighing]

217
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,309
That was for good luck.

218
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,572
Don't worry, darling,
you'll see me again.

219
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,676
For your sake, I hope not.

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,115
[Door closing]

221
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,044
[Sighing]

222
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,627
What do you want?

223
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,860
You make out with patients now?

224
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,868
What, are you jealous?

225
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,394
I don't get jealous.

226
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,543
- We had sex, once.
- And we kissed in an elevator.

227
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,680
And we kissed in an elevator, once.

228
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,741
- No, seriously. Go out with me.
- No.

229
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:04,288
You know, I almost died today.
Yeah, I came, like, this close.

230
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,883
How would you feel if I died and you
didn't get a chance to go out with me?

231
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,629
- Get over yourself, already.
- Come on.

232
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,827
- It's the chase, isn't it?
- What?

233
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,163
The thrill of the chase.

234
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,863
I've been wondering to myself,

235
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,032
"Why are you so hell-bent
on getting me to go out with you?"

236
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,407
You know you're my boss,
you know it's against the rules,

237
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,776
you know I keep saying no.
It's the chase.

238
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,678
Well, it's fun, isn't it?

239
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,240
You see? This is a game to you.

240
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,115
But not to me.

241
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,644
Because, unlike you,
I still have something to prove.

242
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,726
[Bailey] I know you see me
resecting this bowel.

243
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,389
Do I strike you as someone
who enjoys multitasking?

244
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,490
We have a John Doe.
In three hours, we have to declare him.

245
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,661
- We want to harvest his organs.
- Why are you wasting time?

246
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,069
You know how many patients
we have downstairs.

247
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,700
If he dies, and he could still live,

248
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,937
his death should mean something.

249
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,543
And you want a harvest surgery.

250
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,243
- I want to save lives.
- [Bailey scoffs]

251
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,248
OK, I want a harvest surgery.

252
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,550
Getting organs from
a John Doe is a long shot.

253
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,750
Without ID,
you can't contact the family.

254
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:17,091
Without the family, you can't get
consent. Let the poor man die in peace.

255
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,687
What if we can find the family?

256
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,256
- [Bailey] And get consent.
- We could harvest the organs?

257
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,858
If you find the family.

258
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,275
What are you doing?

259
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,332
Hiding.

260
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,709
There's this VIP patient...

261
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,974
He likes me.

262
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,640
That's good, right?

263
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,446
He "likes me," likes me.

264
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,148
Go for it, man. Get yours.
I'm down with the rainbow.

265
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,094
Oh. Are you not gay?

266
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,031
- No.
- Really?

267
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,299
Dude, sorry.

268
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,306
Uh, Cristina?

269
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,480
Do you...? Do you think...?

270
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,708
Does Meredith think I'm gay?

271
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,273
Are you?

272
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,013
- No.
- Really?

273
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,217
[Lzzie] Hey,
I found this on our John Doe.

274
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,726
It's a hotel key card.

275
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,628
The police are going to send
someone over, figure out

276
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,166
what hotel he was staying at,
get his ID from there.

277
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,203
- I'll make sure the police get it.
- It's really important.

278
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,000
We only have a few hours
before we have to declare him,

279
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,007
and I'd really like to find his family.

280
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,669
You want their permission
for organ donation?

281
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,807
I just... really want to find them.

282
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,445
You have a potential donor?

283
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,148
What's his blood type?

284
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,917
Uh, O-neg.

285
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,259
[Breathing apparatus hissing]

286
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,318
[Monitor beeping]

287
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,059
OK.

288
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,468
I know you probably can't hear me,

289
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,406
and you're feeling this big push
to go towards the light,

290
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,569
where everything's all halos

291
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,546
and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff.

292
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:21,183
And, I mean, sharing your organs
is really great and all.

293
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,450
But I think you have a family.

294
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,218
I can feel it.

295
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,590
So I think it'd be really great

296
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:33,189
if you could do me a favor,
and... get better.

297
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,659
Just...

298
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,766
...live.

299
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,405
So, you think you can
give that a shot for me?

300
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,710
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

301
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,391
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

302
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,957
Oh, no.

303
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,959
Meredith!

304
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,501
- Meredith. He's crashing.
- What?

305
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,234
What are you doing? Call a code!

306
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,742
I can't, I'm not supposed to.
He's brain-dead.

307
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,904
If he's brain-dead,
you have to let him go.

308
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,244
No. It's only been
five hours and 33 minutes.

309
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,942
He's supposed to get six hours.

310
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,453
We can't do anything.
It's not our place to make that call.

311
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,045
He's a person. We're doctors.

312
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,353
We should have every right
to make that call.

313
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,452
We can't just stand here
and do nothing while he dies.

314
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,589
He has a right
to the next 27 minutes.

315
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,192
Screw it.

316
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,366
I'll get the dopamine.
You get the blood. We'll transfuse him.

317
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,778
[George] Do you feel any pain here?

318
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,681
No.

319
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,016
You know, you really do have...

320
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,078
...beautiful eyelashes.

321
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:08,991
Um... Thank you.
Uh, what about here?

322
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,053
No. And nice eyes.

323
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,120
Kind.

324
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,496
I like a man with kind eyes.

325
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,365
Really? You think I have kind eyes?

326
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,426
Mmm.

327
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,996
I mean, uh... You can, um...

328
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,269
What are you examining me for?

329
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,940
Oh, you know,
just routine medical stuff.

330
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,448
You're doing very well.

331
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,610
Because I'm enjoying the view.

332
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,023
OK. Well... I gotta go.

333
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,594
- He's stable.
- For now.

334
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,600
I had a radiologist look at his chest.
He has a traumatic aortic injury.

335
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,364
- He's gonna rupture and bleed out.
- He needs surgery.

336
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,566
- If he's gonna remain an organ donor.
- If he's gonna live.

337
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,734
- Izzie...
- No, I'm not giving up on him.

338
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,176
He has surgery, he lives.
That's the point.

339
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,873
I'm going to find the family.
You get him into surgery.

340
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,416
She's vice president of Fantasyland.

341
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,975
So who do we go to
for the surgery. Bailey?

342
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
We need to go higher than Bailey.

343
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,052
Dr. Burke.

344
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,649
- Hello!
- OK.

345
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,919
[Sighing]

346
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,692
Dr. Burke, um, I know you're busy,

347
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,826
but our John Doe needs an aortic repair.

348
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,836
The guy from this morning?

349
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,565
Isn't he legally dead?

350
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,608
Well, yeah... He's kinda still around.

351
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,772
We gave him two units PRVCs
and put him on pressors.

352
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,212
On whose orders?

353
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,379
[Meredith] Mine.

354
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,521
You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood
transfusion without consulting anyone.

355
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,755
And now you want me
to repair his heart?

356
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,296
Well, yes.

357
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,461
You do enjoy crossing the line,
don't you?

358
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,437
He is an excellent candidate
for organ donation.

359
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,667
I am a surgeon. I save lives.

360
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,436
This guy is already dead.

361
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,410
Now, this is the men's room.

362
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,311
Either whip one out, or close the door.

363
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,785
- You're asking my advice?
- Yes.

364
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,286
Now who's chasing?

365
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,347
- Not funny. This is important.
- OK.

366
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,756
You want to get around Burke?

367
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,456
You gotta find a way
to get the chief involved.

368
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,088
What'd I do?

369
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,136
How close a match for the liver
is your guy to our John Doe?

370
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,366
Very. Same type, same size.
Couldn't find a better match. Why?

371
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,033
He's the chief's VIP, right?

372
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,440
Right.

373
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,173
How much would you kill to be
in on the transplant surgery?

374
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,442
You underestimate me.

375
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,010
I'm not a baby. I'm your colleague.
You don't have to manipulate me.

376
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,954
If you want something,
all you have to do is ask.

377
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,993
We want you to go over
Burke's head, to the chief.

378
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,493
Ask me something easier.

379
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,997
Sir.

380
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,896
- O'Malley. How's Mackie?
- Fine.

381
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,368
Actually, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

382
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,897
I kinda think that...
Me and the other interns... We think...

383
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,535
O'Malley, I'm not getting any younger.

384
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,238
We found Mackie a liver.

385
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,474
[Meredith] We are so going to hell.

386
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,382
- Burke is sending us to hell.
- On an express train.

387
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,885
If it works.

388
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,387
What are you doing?

389
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,582
[All] Nothing.

390
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,960
Yes!

391
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,332
[Laughing]

392
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,999
Oh, crap.

393
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,102
Dr. Burke! Dr. Burke!

394
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,171
[Monitor beeping]

395
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,547
[Alex] Excellent work, sir.

396
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,051
Excellent.

397
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,143
Flawless.

398
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,949
It's a shame he's brain-dead.

399
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,957
If he wasn't, he would be
on his feet in a few days.

400
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,357
I'm amazed at what's going on.

401
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,327
I seriously hate that guy.

402
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,887
Alex is vermin. That surgery is ours.

403
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,399
[Lzzie] At least Burke
is doing the surgery.

404
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,095
I don't care about Alex.

405
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,796
George, you did good.

406
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:17,433
I'm gonna have to dodge Burke
for the rest of my career.

407
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,070
He could kill me
and make it look like an accident.

408
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,410
[Door opening]

409
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,715
The police called.
They've identified your John Doe.

410
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,220
His wife is on the way.

411
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,483
[All sigh]

412
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,818
[Monitor beeping]

413
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,402
Oh, my God. [exhales]

414
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,298
Kevin!

415
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,309
- [Derek] It's OK.
- [Woman] Oh, my God!

416
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,005
Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens.

417
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,175
Now, if you have any questions
at all, please call me.

418
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,489
Is there...?

419
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,357
Is there still a chance?

420
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,433
We can hold off till morning,

421
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,473
but if there's still no change, we'd...

422
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,676
We'd like to talk
to you about organ donation.

423
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,203
[Monitor continues beeping]

424
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,053
[Richard] Mackie?

425
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,422
Mmm.

426
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,654
How are we treating ya?

427
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,321
Oh, fine.

428
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,624
Except that beautiful boy
won't let me smoke.

429
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,067
[Mackie] You should reprimand him.

430
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,231
Make him change bedpans.

431
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,605
[Laughing]

432
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,507
Mackie.

433
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,070
That beautiful boy
may have found you a liver.

434
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,357
[Sobs]

435
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,921
[Tegan and Sara: I Won't Be Left]

[Pager beeping]

437
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,834
God, I smell good!

438
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,501
You know what it is?

439
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,480
It's the smell of open-heart surgery.

440
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,886
[Sniffing] It's awesome. It is awesome.

441
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,511
You gotta smell me.

442
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,852
I don't want to smell you.

443
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,221
Oh, yes you do.

444
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,852
You have got to be kidding me!

445
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,125
OK, I have more important
things to deal with than you.

446
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,497
I have roommates,
boy problems and family problems.

447
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,433
Wanna act like a frat-boy bitch?

448
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,336
That's fine.
You wanna take credit for your saves,

449
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,465
and everybody else's? That's fine too.

450
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,703
- Just stay outta my face.
- [Door opening]

451
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,111
And for the record, you smell like crap!

452
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,210
[Sighing]

453
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,277
She attacked me.

454
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,517
Meredith! Meredith!

455
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,888
Meredith! Meredith!

456
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,389
You might want to leave
before I change my mind,

457
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:30,163
and let her beat you to a pulp
with her tiny, ineffectual fists.

458
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,329
[Sighing]

459
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,643
What?

460
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,111
Nothing.

461
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,681
It's just...

462
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,786
Nothing.

463
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,732
Oh! This one is skin grafting!

464
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,863
Skin grafting? No way!
I've never seen that done.

465
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,134
Are those my mother's surgical tapes?

466
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,506
We should watch the
skin grafting one first.

467
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,213
Where did all this stuff come from?

468
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,374
Oh. I unpacked some of your
mother's things. I was upset.

469
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,577
And when I'm upset, I like to nest.

470
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,747
Oh... Hemipelvectomy!

471
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,120
I think we should watch this one first.

472
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,351
No.

473
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:32,385
We're not watching my mother's surgery
tapes. We're not unpacking boxes.

474
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,730
We're not having conversations where
we celebrate the moments of our lives.

475

They're everywhere. All the time.

Izzie's perky,
and George does this thing

480
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,886
where he's helpful and considerate.

481
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,786
They share food, and they say things,

482
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,882
and they move things
and they breathe.

483
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,725
- Ugh. They're, like, happy.
- Kick them out.

484
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,323
I can't. They just moved in.
I asked them to move in.

485
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,767
So you're gonna repress everything
in a deep, dark, twisted place

486
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,701
until, one day, you snap and kill them?

487
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,637
Yep.

488
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,232
This is why we are friends.

489
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,245
Why is the Nazi making us stay
in the pit two days in a row?

- Leftovers.

Gotta get the cyclists
who were too drunk, stupid or scared

492
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,410
to get to a hospital yesterday.

493
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,613
She gets to do a freakin' organ harvest.

494
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,281
- Kills you, doesn't it?
- What?

495
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,881
Two women caught the harvest.

496
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,519
No, it kills me that anybody
got the harvest but me.

497
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,586
Boobs do not factor into this equation.

498
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,598

00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,793
- I'm gonna become a lesbian.
- [Cristina] Me too.

501
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,341
[Cristina] Now, Mrs. Davidson,
this form simply says

502
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,473
you consent to the donation
of your husband's major organs.

503
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,541
Heart, lungs, liver and kidneys.

[Sighing]

505
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,122
Now, I need to ask you a few questions.

506
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,058
Are you willing to donate his corneas?

507
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,988
You want his eyes?

508
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:21,161
Um, corneal transplants
can give someone back their sight.

509
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,643
I suppose that's OK.

510
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,518
[Sighing]

511
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,760
What about his skin?

512
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,323
What? [clears throat]

513
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,800
It's used to help burn victims.

514
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,606
You want to cut off his skin?

515
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,869
What about the funeral?

516
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,711
You want me to have a funeral
and have people look at him...

517
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:09,311
Have his daughter look at her father
and he doesn't have any skin?

518
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,914

- No kidding.

- Who?

Not "gorked guy." Not "John Doe."
Kevin Davidson.

He's someone's husband, someone's son,

how about I take you and my new liver
out for a night on the town?

Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything.

but, I, um, I'm not...

But then, why have...?

545

Because dying
is a "get out of jail free" card.

I can be as bold as I want,

547
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,780
and there's nothing
anybody can say about it.

548
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,117
So I flirt.

549
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,757
Haven't you been attracted
to someone you know you couldn't have?

550
