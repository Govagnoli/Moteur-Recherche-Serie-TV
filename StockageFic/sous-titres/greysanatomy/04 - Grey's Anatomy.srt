and elevated liver enzymes.

173
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,327
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

174
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,961
Aggressive little witch, isn't she?

175
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:29,235
She stole my chart during pre-rounds
so she could scrub in on my surgery.

176
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,333
She's hoping for a Whipple.

177
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,005
Well, actually, Liz, I was gonna
give you to Meredith Grey.

178
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,139
Ellis's daughter?

179
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,240
Yes, she's an intern this year.

180
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,751
Thought you'd have
something to talk about.

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,809
Oh, I doubt that.

182
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:46,621
I was Ellis's scrub nurse for 18 years,
practically lived with that woman.

183
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,183
I didn't meet that daughter once.

184
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,058
Anyway, Shepherd has her on the guy
with the nails in his head.

185
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,192
There's a guy with nails in his head?

186
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,327
Seven of them.

187
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,598
Shot himself in the head
with a nail gun.

188
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,900
"Nail" nails?

189
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,635
Sixteen pennies,
three and a half inches long.

190
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,438
- Still alive?
- Fully conscious.

191
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,502
Should be a pretty interesting surgery.

192
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,810
But I guess you've got the Whipple.

193
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,850
I'm gonna need a full blood
work-up and abdominal CT.

194
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,981
CTs are down this morning.

195
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,319
Then an MRI.

196
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,589
She needs an enema,
an ERCP for a stent

197
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,926
and brush biopsy this afternoon.

198
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,455
Take care of her.
Liz is an institution around here.

199
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,659
Good call, doctor.

200
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,365
Grey's got the human two-by-four,

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,501
and you have the institution
in need of an enema.

202
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,442
You'd say your health's
been good recently?

203
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,950
Maybe some headaches.

204
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,714
Nothing compared to now.

205
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,187
Sona, that's my wife.

206
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,883
Sona, she'll say,

207
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,553
"Why you think
they call it a gun, moron?"

208
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,755
She hates the damn things.

209
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,422
With good reason.

210
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,936
- Baby?
- [Jorge] Sona.

211
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,204
You are in so much trouble.

212
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,245
Get a history from her
before you scrub in.

213
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,681
- OK.
- Thank you.

214
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,643
Twenty-three.

215
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,385
People have been accidentally
shot in the head with nails 23 times.

216
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,927
One was attempted suicide,
doesn't count.

217
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,896
Oh, so he pointed a nail gun
at his head on purpose?

218
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,431
That makes me feel better.

219
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,057
So, uh...

220
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,297
Grey and Stevens really
walk around in their underwear?

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,598
Not all the time.

222
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,007
I mean, some of the time, you know.

223
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,408
But not all the time.

224
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,276
Sexy underwear?

225
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,147
Yeah. I mean...

226
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,415
[Alex] And they just,
uh, let you look at them?

227
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,821
Well, uh... yeah.

228
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,554
Like sisters.

229
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,062
No, well, not like sisters. [laughing]

230
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,292
I don't think of them as sisters.

231
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,891
But they're not coming on to you.

232
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,803
- Not exactly.
- They don't expect you to do anything.

233
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,170
No.

234
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,674
But...

235
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,607
Like sisters.

236
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,112
Just like sisters.

237
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,215
Is he prepped?

238
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,193
I think they're doing it right now.

239
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,285
You think?

240
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,330
He's having a prostate biopsy.

241
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,992
Trust me. If you'd been in there,
you'd know.

242
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,199
OK, Mr. Humphrey.
We're gonna get started.

243
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,978
Get her out of here.

244
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,480
I want her out of here!
Just get her out of here!

245
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,485
Just you go! Now! Just go now!

246
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,114
Hey, relax! Relax, Mr. Humphrey.

247
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,719
[Sona] Will he be able to see again?

248
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,524
We won't know until the nails come out.

249
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,895
Did he tell you he takes photos?

250
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,434
Beautiful photos. It's his hobby.

251
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,996
I just got him a new digital camera,
and now he can't stop, you know?

252
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,042
He always has it out,
always taking pictures of me.

253
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,601
Jorge said he's been having headaches.

254
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,978
Can you tell me about them?
Have they been recent?

255
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,778
Um...

256
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,615
I'm not sure.
Maybe the last couple of months.

257
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,021
Have you seen him experience
any dizziness or disorientation?

258
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,186
Yes, yes, I have.

259
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,858
OK.

260
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,335
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

261
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,601
Nothing.

262
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,666
He's probably just crazy or something.

263
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,418
Bethany Whisper.

264
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,546
- What?
- Bethany Whisper.

265
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,557
I did a new Bethany Whisper
lingerie ad.

266
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,526
- He saw it in a magazine.
- You got time to pose for magazines?

267
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,755
No, the shoot was last year.
It just came out.

268
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,424
- So because he saw you in a thong...
- It wasn't a thong.

269
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,228
...you're hiding in the hallway.

270
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,428
Might be easier
if you assign another intern.

271
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,904
Easy is not in your job description.
You are a doctor. He is a patient.

272
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,964
He's your patient. Biopsy these.

273
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,136
If they come back positive,
I expect to see you in surgery.

274
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,014
Hey, you're on this. You understand me?

275
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,353
- Vertiginous or light-headedness?
- Light-headed.

276
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,022
Sometimes he'd have
to brace himself to get out of bed.

277
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,531
Could be a million things.
Simple orthostasis.

278
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,897
What?

279
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,799
What made him fall with a nail gun?

280
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,894
He said he tripped.

281
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,633
Just because you hear hoofbeats,
don't assume zebras.

282
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,165
Something caused him to lose
consciousness and fall down the stairs.

283
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,404
He could have a tumor.

284
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,708
Look, I have no idea
why this guy's still alive,

285
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,248
let alone moving and talking.

286
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,546
Not a clue.
Let's just get him through this

287
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,109
before we start digging around
for something else.

288
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,283
- Shepherd. Twenty-three cases?
- One was attempted suicide.

289
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,057
- Doesn't count. Talk about procedure.
- Problems: Bleeding and infection.

290
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,859
Odds improved with shorter surgery.

291
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,958
Bottom line was get them out
quickly and watch for bleeding.

292
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,765
I got it. Other words, I'm on my own.

293
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,277
You coming?

294
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,441
Dude, I don't need an escort.

295
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,375
Go.

296
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,977
Go ahead.

297
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,851
[Receiver clicking]

298
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,221
Well, well, well.

299
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,491
Dr. Bethany Whisper.

300
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,428
That's so nice.

301
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,461
[Whistling]

302
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,778
[Humming]

303
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,112
She had this thing for red when we met.

304
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,744
Red car, red dresses, red hats.

305
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,120
Personally, I hated the color.
Too obvious, you know?

306
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:31,788
But a couple years ago,
I took her up to the mountains.

307
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,298
She was in a red dress,

308
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:38,359
and there was this field of red...

309
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,428
...poppies, I think.

310
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,475
And she jumped out of the car

311
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,601
and ran into them

312
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,306
and started laughing...

313
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,110
...laughing at all the red.

314
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,959
The good news is it hasn't spread
from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

315
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,427
With a radical prostatectomy,
we could probably get it all.

316
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,964
- Good prognosis.
- Spare some nerves?

317
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,762
Give him a chance at a normal sex life?

318
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,066
Young puppies like
to take chances with cancer.

319
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,971
Old dogs like me, we do what works.

320
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,065
Yes, sir, of course.

321
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,736
- We on the schedule tomorrow?
- 10:00am.

322
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,975
Good. Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

323
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,108
An ass who deals in asses.

324
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,588
We call him "Limp Harry."
He never spares the nerves.

325
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,993
[Richard] As you can see,
the patient has shot seven nails

326
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,966
directly into the skull
without doing significant damage

327
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,972
other than the optic nerve,
and we may be able to save that.

328
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,941
The idea is to remove the nails

329
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,070
at exactly the angle they entered.

330
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,137
Any wiggle, and we risk

331
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,376
doing more damage
than when they went in.

332
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,418
Where are they?
Move over.

333
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,477
They're just pulling them out.

334
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,818
Hey, I heard you got a Whipple.

335
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,050
A maybe Whipple.

336
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,888
Burke is running my butt off.

337
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,689
Oh, man. Look at those films!

338
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,093
[Laughing]

339
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,528
It's Hellraiser.

340
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:17,558
[Woman] Maybe try to an 87.

341
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,131
[Man] Small increase,
then it will stabilize.

342
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,536
- Gelfoam.
- Here you go.

343
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,845
There goes the third grade.

344
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,781
[Burke] Dr. Yang...

345
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,212
...did you put in the blood work?

346
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,483
Oh, right before I got here.

347
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,787
Hmm. Take her to Radiology for the MRI.

348
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,258
Beep me when you're done.

349
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,993
[Sighing]

350
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,965
You want the Whipple, right?

351
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,662
Yeah.

352
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,934
[Door opening]

353
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

354
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,270
Here. My share of the grocery money.

355
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,506
- When are you going?
- Tonight.

356
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,481
Seriously, George. Please don't...

357
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,347
Yeah, could we not talk about it here?

358
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,612
What, tampons?

359
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,486
Did you not hear a word I said?

360
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,753
You're a man. We know.

361
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,331
Talk about shrinking the salamander.

362
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,169
I always divided surgeons
into two categories:

363
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,973
Those that remember
the names of their patients

364
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,741
and those who didn't.

365
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,578
They all remember
their surgeries, of course.

366
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,743
Every damn suture.

367
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,515
But the good ones
remember the names, right?

368
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,715
I didn't say that.

369
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,417
Now, some of the best ones,

370
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,893
you know,
distance themselves on purpose.

371
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,899
They believe that the
personal stuff clouds the medicine.

372
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,594
- Hi, Liz.
- Hey.

373
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,431
But? I'm waiting for the "but."

374
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,995
I'm sure there's a big,
fat qualifier coming.

375
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,439
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

376
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,136
Looking good.

377
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,905
Oh, you liar.

378
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,003
How you doing, honey?

379
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,810
Oh, fabulous. Just fabulous.

380
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,147
- Hey, Liz.
- [Liz] Hey.

381
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,378
Hey, Liz.

382
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,118
- Bleeding?
- It's clean.

383
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,021
All right. Way to go, team.

384
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,151
Good job, everybody. Thank you.

385
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,627
[Derek] I don't think we made it worse.

386
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,597
The big question is the optic nerve.

387
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,827
We'll know in the morning.

388
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,802
Should I order the MRI?

389
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,271
He needs to stabilize.
We'll do it tomorrow.

390
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,404
[Man] One of the most
amazing things I ever saw.

391
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,743
Is it over? Hey, is it over?

392
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,145
Yeah, it's over.

393
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,155
Hey, does Burke have
a Whipple scheduled?

394
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,093
[Cristina] I wanted to know
if you've seen Fallon's labs.

395
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,827
- I have.
- They're getting worse.

396
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,335
The stent doesn't seem
to be helping her jaundice.

397
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,393
[Burke] No.

398
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,405
- Should we be doing something?
- We are.

399
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,910
You didn't have the Whipple on the
board. Want me to schedule it for you?

400
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:17,074
I want to see the results of her biopsy,
and have a look at her overnight labs.

401
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,879
- Overnight?
- You're on-call, right?

402
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,887
Um... Sure, yeah.

403
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,513
Well, good. Stick with her.

404
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,287
You're doing the surgery, right?
Y-you're still doing the Whipple?

405
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,590
The woman has pancreatic cancer,
Dr. Yang.

406
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,959
We're gonna do something.

407
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,157
OK.

408
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,860
OK.

409
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,903
- [Liz] Kiss the baby for me.
- [Woman] Get some sleep, Liz.

410
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,768
OK. Good night.

411
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,534
[Woman] See you later, hon.

412
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,836
[Man] Bye-bye, Liz.

413
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,274
Bye-bye. Take care.

414
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,642
[Woman 1] I'll catch up
with you guys later.

415
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,408
[Woman 2] I'm gonna check later.

416
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,247
Oh. Your mom's a bigger woman.

417
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,751
You were her scrub nurse.

418
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,481
Liz Fallon. Come in.

419
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,650
Meredith Grey.

420
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,386
She wanted me to send her regards.

421
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,360
That doesn't sound like her.

422
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,554
Excuse me?

423
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,190
Well, the Ellis Grey I know

424
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,293
didn't have regards
for anyone except Ellis Grey.

425
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,702
But you know that already, don't you?

426
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,000
Where is she now?

427
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,271
Traveling.

428
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,368
- Traveling?
- Yeah.

429
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,039
Huh.

430
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,810
Is she practicing?

431
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,248
Not so much.

432
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,751
Oh.

433
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,447
Doesn't sound like her, either.

434
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,184
She was all work, just like me.

435
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,885
She never left the hospital.

436
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,190
But you know that, too, don't you?

437
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,461
Is she well?

438
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,557
She's fine.

439
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,124
Good.

440
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,330
Just wanted to send her regards.

441
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,964
- Take care.
- Yeah.

442
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,578
[Meredith] I think these were
taken at the old house.

443
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,654
There's you in your scrubs.

444
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,252
Who is that?

445
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,296
That's Dad.

446
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,354
Who?

447
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,866
Your husband. Thatcher Grey.

448
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,163
You called him Thatch.

449
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,831
Thatch.

450
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,808
That's the red wagon
he got me for my birthday.

451
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,972
I'm about four years old in this photo.

452
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,538
This is your family.

453
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,308
Sure, sure.

454
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,857
I saw Liz Fallon at the hospital today.

455
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,057
[Laughing] Liz. I love her.

456
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,656
How is she?

457
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,828
Is she still a scrub nurse?

458
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,098
She was excellent.

[Get Set Go: Break Your Heart]

460
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,035
[Lzzie] I reminded you before you went.

461
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,978
I forgot when I got there.

462
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,608
No, no. You were so
passive-aggressive.

463
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,879
Naked. I am naked in the shower.

464
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,184
They're just tampons, George.
I really needed tampons.

465
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,655
God!

466
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,589
I'm not riding in the same car with him.

467
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,457
Unless you're going like that,
you're not riding with me.

468
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,690
- Where are the tampons?
- He didn't buy them.

469
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,323
[Meredith] You didn't buy them?

470
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,163
Men don't buy tampons.

471
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,931
You are gonna have to
get over the man thing, George.

472

We're women!
We have vaginas! Get used to it.

Cold pizza.

477
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,650
- Is he awake?
- Even better.

478
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,021
Really? Let's see what his nurse says.

479
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,757
Hi, Sona, Jorge.
How are you this morning?

480
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,424
Tell them what color my dress is, Jorge.

481
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,798
I'd know the answer
to that even if I couldn't see.

482
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,029
We can go over there
and check it out...

483
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,870
It's not a problem at all.

484
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,410
[Man] Let's do it. Uh-huh.

485
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,446
I'm taking the elevator.
Take the stairs.

486
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,037
I was going to, anyway.

487
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,309
Good.

488
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,748
Hold it.

00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,376

[Laughter]

491
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,315
What?

492
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,801
You don't wake a patient like that.

493
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,396
What do I have to do
to get through to you?

494
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,600
Cut me some slack.

495
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,007
I was on call last night.
I didn't get much sleep.

496

Oh, stop whining.

497
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,775
You'd rather be here, and you know it.

No.

Hey, come on, come on, come on!

- Let's go.
- What's going on?

Oh, boy, I guess they do
airbrush out the tattoo, don't they?

519
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,680
You want to see it?

Fine.

up close and personal, shall we?!

00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,998
And what do we got back here?

526
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,065
Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

527
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,245
Glutes, right?

528
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,213
Let's study them, shall we?

529
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,374
Gather around and check out the booty

530
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,850
that put lzzie Stevens
through med school.

531
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,387
Have you had enough
or should I continue?

532
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:34,084
Because I have a few more
very interesting tattoos.

533
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,224
You want to call me Dr. Model?

534
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,662
That's fine.

535
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:45,499
Just remember that while you're sitting
on 200 grand of student loans...

536
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,268
...l'm out of debt.

537
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,867
- I'll take them down.
- Don't bother.

538
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,612
Go!

539
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,678
[Vaughan Penn: Truth]

540
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,319
Can you tell me what you had
for breakfast on Monday?

541
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,515
Cheese omelet.

542
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,717
And on Sunday.

543
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,158
And on Saturday.

544
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,559
And on Friday.

545
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:16,293
Sona gets up every morning
and makes me a cheese omelet.

546
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,097
It's the only thing he likes.

547
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,467
It's the only thing
you know how to cook.

548
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,369
OK, well, things look good.

549
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,070
But I need Jorge to get an MRI this
morning to check for residual bleeding.

550
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,373
OK?

551
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,155
This is who I was.

552
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,819
It has nothing to do with who I am now.

553
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,589
I'm a physician, a surgeon.

554
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,064
And I am just as qualified
as any other intern on this floor.

555
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,532
So, you're just gonna have

556
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,628
to get over your chauvinist crap
and allow me to do my job.

557
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,610
I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

558
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,438
Then what is your problem?

559
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,277
Look...

560
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,678
I fantasized about you...

561
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,617
...about the woman
in this photo, whoever she is.

562
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,595
I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact.

563
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,470
Do you know what
they're gonna do to me today?

564
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,897
I have cancer.

565
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,142
And they're gonna lift up my legs
and expose me to the world

566
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,013
and cut out my prostate and my nerves,

567
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,245
effectively neuter me.

568
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,547
So, is it so hard to understand

569
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:51,118
that I don't want the woman
who's in that photo to witness...

570
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,390
...my emasculation?

571
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,006
- Have you seen her overnight labs?
- I have.

572
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,738
- Did you check her liver panel?
- They're not good.

573
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,939
No, they suck. She's choking on bile.

574
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,209
- She's jaundiced.
- A very sick woman.

575
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,581
Why haven't you scheduled the Whipple?

576
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,142
Well, are you a surgeon now?

577
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,247
I'm her cruise director,
pushing her around all day.

578
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,589
The woman is circling the drain.
We need to do something.

579
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,628
I'll take a look at her biopsy.

580
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:25,720
Screw the biopsy.

581
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,094
- Dr. Yang...
- Enough.

582
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,292
You know... I... I...
You know what I think?

583
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,528
I think you never intended
to do the Whipple.

584
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,537
I think this entire thing has been bull,

585
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,200
and you're behaving like the only reason
she's in this hospital is to die.

586
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,325
[Derek] There. That's a tumor.

587
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,368
It's midline near the hypothalamus.

588
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,698
- [Sighing]
- Damn.

589
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,080
Best practice,
probably to remove the tumor.

590
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:22,609
"Probably" because I can't get it all.
Ninety-nine percent, but not all of it.

591
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,813
Radiation and chemo,

592
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,356
you're looking at maybe
five to ten good years.

593
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,292
Let's do it.

594
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,821
You haven't heard the downside.

595
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,628
See, the tumor is located
in a part of your brain

596
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,329
where your memory
and your personality resides.

597
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,567
And because of the fuzzy edges
of this type of tumor,

598
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,505
I have to cut out a lot.

599
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:49,013
Jorge, you stand a good chance
of losing your memories,

600
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,881
- of losing who you are.
- [Sona] Is there any other way?

601
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,388
The alternative is gamma or cyberknife
treatment with focus radiation.

602
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,581
It's less evasive.

603
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,921
There's little chance of memory loss
or him losing himself,

604
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,723
but it would only give Jorge
maybe three to five years.

605
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,661
Three to five years?

606
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,464
[Sniffling]

607
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,595
[Derek] This is an
incredibly difficult decision.

608
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:19,338
If you have any more questions or
you need to talk to me, I'm here, OK?

609
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,477
[Breathing heavily]

610
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,994
Hey.

611
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,327
[Meredith] I told my mother about you.

612
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,027
She remembers you very well.

613
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,865
Of course she would.

614
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,067
Ellis Grey never forgot a thing.

615
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,771
[Chuckling] Mmm.

616
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,355
I'm sorry. It's not really funny.

617
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,518
It's not funny, but...

618
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,062
What's her diagnosis?

619
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,430
Alzheimer's,

620
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,560
early onset.

621
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,536
And she doesn't want anyone to know.

622
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,769
No.

623
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,834
She's in a nursing home,

624
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,973
and I'm the only person
she'll allow to see her.

625
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,919
But if I know Ellis Grey,

626
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,617
she made the nursing home
sign a contract to that effect.

627
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,593
You know my mother well.

628
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,962
What a bitch.

629
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,989
[Both laughing]

630
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,697
[Lzzie] The woman's life
was this hospital.

631
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,740
It was her home.
It's a sweet thing for them to do.

632
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,333
It's a waste of a bed,
and it's a waste of my time.

633
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,900
Who are we talking about?

634
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,447
Liz Fallon.
They brought her here to die.

635
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,675
Wouldn't you want
the same thing for you?

636
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,310
No, I'd want the doctors
to do everything they could.

637
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,650
I want them to cut me open
until the minute I die.

638
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,384
Sometimes doing everything
can be worse than nothing.

639
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,985
You are eight feet tall.

640
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,654
Your boobs are perfect.

641
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,790
Your hair is down to there.

642
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,128
If I were you, I would
walk around naked all the time.

643
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,229
I wouldn't... I wouldn't have a job.

644
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,036
I wouldn't have skills.
I wouldn't even know how to read.

645
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,736
I'd just be...

646
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,937
...naked.
- [Laughing]

647
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,607
It's makeup. It's retouching.

648
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,775

652
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,992
Any patient who spanks to his
doctor's pictures forfeits his rights.

653
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,291
You're seriously not gonna give up
the prostatectomy, are you?

655
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,757
Oh, forget it.

656
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,861
You know, sometimes it is actually,
you know, painful to be around you.

657
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,407
Where the hell have you been?

658
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,879
When I page, you answer.
It's not that difficult to understand.

659
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,439
O'Malley answered his page.
He's doing your prep.

Dr. Hammond to OR. Room 3.

If I hear the words
Bethany Whisper one more time...

663
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,752
I can't, OK?

664
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,264
I just... can't.

665
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,993
He doesn't want me in there.

666
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,434
No, what he wants
is to not have cancer.

667
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,334
What he wants is to be saved.

668
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,932
You want to stay in the scrub room,
that's your choice.

669

All right.

670

They were never gonna operate.

678
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,140
You could have told me.

679
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,907
[Liz] What fun would that have been?

680
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,442

- Here we go. Bag her.

- You got it.

00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,019
Come on, people!
Push another epi! Come on!

700
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,254
You need to consider what you'll lose.

701
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,787
What good is five years
if he doesn't joke about your omelets

702
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,664
and he can't remember
seeing you in that red dress?

703
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,202
It's still five more years.

704
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,464
You don't understand.

705
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,699
He'll be there, but he won't be Jorge.

706
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,607
- He won't even recognize you.
- This is our business.

707
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,407
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

708
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,210
Isn't five good years
better than ten bad ones?

709
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,682
What the hell are you doing?

710
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,777
- She needs to understand.
- I do understand.

711
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,688
You think that I'm being selfish,
that I don't want to give him up.

712
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,090
- I don't.
- This is Jorge's decision.

713
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,425
And if that means
ten bad years for me, fine.

714
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,932
I'll give him those years because
I will give him whatever he wants.

715
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,434
Look, I am so sorry, Sona.
Just please forgive her.

716
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,402
[Sona] And if he doesn't remember me,

717
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,666
if he doesn't remember what we are,

718
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,300
he's still my Jorge.

719
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,573
And I'll remember for us both.

720
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,204
OK, all right.

721
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,352
- Five, breathe, one, two.
- What the hell are you two doing?

722
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,116
- We lost pulse.
- Let her go.

723
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,021
- Where's that epi?
- Let her go!

724
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,684
She's DNR. Let her go down.

725
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,159
Four, five.

726
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,559
One, two...

727
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,722
Do not resuscitate.

728
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,027
- It is on her chart.
- All right!

729
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,692
Let her go down.

730
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,360
Let her go down.

731
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,701
[Machine flatlining]

732
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,017
[Woman] Call the lab again.

733
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,745
Where are they?

734
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:15,690
He's resecting the prostate,
coming up on the distal nerve.

735
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,527
You said, "I am not your sister."

736
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,334
Do you feel like I was emasculating you?

737
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,563
No. [sighing] No.

738
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,401
I'm too masculine to be emasculated.

739
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,031
[Chuckling]

740
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,841
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,247
Guess you put Dr. Model to rest.

742
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,651
I guess I did.

743
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,280
Dr. Victor, I'm sorry.
But these are viable nerves.

744
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,825
We should save them.

745
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:53,262
It'll take at least an hour longer,
and we might not get it all.

746
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,232
[Lzzie] You know,
they call him Limp Harry.

747
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,933
[Bailey] But his prognosis
with chemo is nearly as good.

748
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,940
Frankly, if you're worried
about missing your tee time,

749
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,737
I'd be more than happy to finish.

750
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,038
Dr. Stevens.

751
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,635
[Victor] Can we help you?

752
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,910
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Victor, I agree with her.

753
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,109
You just can't...

754
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,709
You have to save the nerves.

755
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,811
- What?
- The nerves, you have to save them.

756
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,412
Dr. Stevens, I can handle this.

757
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,220
Most important is giving
the patient what they want.

758
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,662
- What Humphrey wants is his erection.
- She's yours. You get her out.

759
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,959
Can't do that, sir.

760
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,432
You know how these young puppies are.

761
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,929
I'm going to tell Richard
about both of you.

762
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,403
You do that. In the meantime,

763
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,169
let's pretend it's you
on this table and give this a try.

764
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,905
[Tegan and Sara:
Where Does the Good Go?]

765
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,352
Dr. Pinosky.

766
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,839
You ever called one?

767
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:21,844
No.

768
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,686
Call it, doctor.

769
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,787
Time of death, 11:43.

770
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,369
[Meredith] I wish there were
a rule book for intimacy.

771
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,275
Some kind of a guide

772
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,009
that could tell you
when you've crossed the line.

773
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,423
You can't lose it like that.

774
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,223
[Meredith] It would be nice
if you could see it coming.

775
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,320
I'll get her.

776
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,594
- [Sighing]
- Let her go.

777
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,397
[Meredith] And I don't know
how you fit it on a map.

778
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,631
We have to let her go.

779
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,979
Of course, now you know
every time he gets a rise,

780
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,884
he'll be thinking of you.

781
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,719
[Meredith] You take it
where you can get it...

782
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:40,093
...and keep it as long as you can.

783
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,932
[Meredith] And as for rules...

784
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,741
Better not be using my toothbrush.

785
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,476
I'm not.

786
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,814
Maybe there are none.

787
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,155
Maybe the rules of intimacy

788
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:16,063
are something you have
to define for yourself.
