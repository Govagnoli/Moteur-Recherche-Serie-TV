- How hot is the sex?

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,266
- [Derek] Some call this a relationship.
- [Meredith] I know nothing about you.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,865
We're having sex every night.

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,275
- I deserve details.
- You have more than most.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,711
What makes a hotshot
leave the Big Apple for Seattle?

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,873
Thanks for the coffee.

[Gasping]

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,718
[Woman] Adoption? Keeping the baby?
I know this is a difficult decision.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,780
- I'm not interested.
- I am not your sister!

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,519
I am a man!

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,618
You need to get laid.
See that nurse there?

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,322
She's single.
She's got red hair.

13
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,489
Go ask her out.

14
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,532
Smooth moves, doctor.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,727
- Who is that?
- That's Dad.

16
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,066
- [Woman] Diagnosis?
- [Meredith] Alzheimer's.

17
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,696
She doesn't want anyone to know.

18
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,571
I'm the only person
she'll allow to see her.

[Meredith]
Secrets can't hide in science.

21
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,812
Medicine has a way of exposing the lies.

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,913
Within the walls of the hospital,

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,118
the truth is stripped bare.

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,923
How we keep our secrets
outside the hospital...

25
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,556
Well, that's a little different.

You locked the door.
I need to take a shower.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,074
Uh, uh, I'll be out in a minute.

30
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,042
What are you doing in there?

31
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,170
[George] It's private.

32
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,612
Oh. Oh, God.
I'm sorry. I get it.

33
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,742
- [Laughing] I don't mean to interrupt.
- No, it's not that!

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,616
[Lzzie] It's OK.
Take your time.

35
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,247
I am not doing
what you think I'm doing.

36
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,052
There's really no need to explain.

37
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,457
I'll wait. You just... finish.

00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,893
No, I'm... I'm coming.
I'm coming out!

[Meredith] One thing is certain.

Whatever it is
we're trying to hide,

41
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,328
we're never ready for that moment

42

- when the truth gets naked.
- [Cell phone ringing]

Dr. Grey, this is Ms. Henry
from the nursing home.

- I'm calling about your mother.
- Is she all right?

45
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,345
Oh, it's nothing like that.

46
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,904
Can I call you later, then?

47
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,110
- Uh, I just wanted to...
- I have to go.

Who is calling you at this hour?

50
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,152
It's a wrong number.

51
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,862
There's no reason to be ashamed.

52
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,490
It's normal.
Healthy, even.

53
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,263
I'm not ashamed 'cause
I wasn't doing anything.

54
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,569
- I don't have to. I have a girlfriend.
- An imaginary girlfriend?

55
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,700
An actual girlfriend.

56

You know what?
It's no big deal.

00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,847
You don't have to lie.
I get it. You have needs.

Oh!

Aren't you gonna get that?
Might be the hospital.

It's not. Breakfast?

No, look, I told you people

74

Uh, well, I made my decision,
and I made my appointment.

I'll be there on the 16th.

until they take over everything.

- I paged you last night.
- Oh, I wasn't on-call.

78
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,404
That's not why I paged you.

79
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,113
You could give me your home number.

room for anything else.

Until you're so full of secrets,

you feel like you're going to burst.

I had a really good time
the other night.

00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,438
Yeah, me too.

Are you, uh, feeling OK
and everything?

I'm good.

90

Great, now that I
got to see you. Why?

91
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,181
Oh, no reason.
I'm good too, you know?

Really good. You know.

Hi, Dr. Stevens.

97
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,455
I'll see you later.

98
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,858
OK.

99
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,157
Bye.

100
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,432
Yeah. She's into me.

101

Way to go, George.
She's cute.

102
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,739
So this morning,
you really weren't...

103

Anytime you want to apologize...

104
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,011
Then what were you doing
in the bathroom for so long?

105
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,481
I have to go.

106
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,799
Um...

107
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,395
I know I'm pretty to look at
and all, George, but back up.

108
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,405
I need to ask you something.

109
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,872
I'm waiting.

110
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:13,401
I seem to be having
this skin thing going on,

111
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,776
like a rash, really.

112
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,906
And I think I know what it is,

113
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,850
but I can't get close enough
to tell for sure.

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,250
Let's see it.

115
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,087
It's kind of located in an,
um, you know, private...

116
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,388
You're a doctor, George.
It's called a penis.

117
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,394
You have a rash on your penis?

118
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,364
I think I can describe it.

119
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,128
Um, it's k... Red.

120
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,395
Look, just come on.

121
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,029
Just show me your junk
so we can get this over with.

122
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,552
So?

123
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,221

abdominal pain and blood in his urine.

127
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,504
Once his workup
came back unrevealing,

128
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,703
the urologist suggested a cystoscopy.

129
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,768
Reason?

130
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,781
To get a look inside the bladder.

131
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,044
I appreciate you
doing this, Preston.

132
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,552
I know this is a little
out of your field.

133
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,419
That's not a problem.
It gives my interns something to do.

134
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,515
I have a feeling
you keep them plenty busy.

135
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,958
We were in the same frat at Tulane.

136
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,963
It's gone from torturing pledges
to torturing interns.

137
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,191
Am I right?

138
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,030
Be very careful
how you two answer that.

139
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,899
[Man] I could tell some stories.

140
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,370
Bill, you have a camera
snaking up your mojo.

141
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
It's not the time to cross me.

142
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,665
It isn't anything too serious?

143
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,303
That's what this procedure will tell us.

144

You don't worry about anything
but growing my godson in there.

A badass, just like his father.

147
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,885
Move a little to the right.

148
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
[Burke] Your other right.

149
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,056
There.

150
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,820
What do you see?
What is it?

151
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,758
[Burke] Could be
any number of things.

152
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,560
O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass.
Dr. Karev, schedule a CT.

153
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,497
Let's not worry until we have to.

[Monitor beeping]

155
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,374
[Richard] There's too much damage.

156
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:04,473
We'll have to remove most of the colon
instead of a local resection.

157
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,711
Mmm.

158
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,316
You gotta push it up.

More suture.

162
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,904
And what's with these
damn lights in here?

163
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,381
[Cristina] Mr. Franklin, how long
has your abdomen been like this?

164
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,544
It's been getting bigger for a while.

165
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,145
I told him there was something wrong.

166
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,884
No one gets fat like this so fast.
I told him.

167
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,220
Everybody told him.

168
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,853
He has dullness to percussion
and spider angiomas.

169
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,556
What's all that mean?

170
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,064
We have to run some tests.

171
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,565
Great.

172
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,966
What's that gonna cost us this time?

173
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,833
Alice, don't.

174
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,211
Hi, uh, results
for George O'Malley?

175
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,647
I don't see it here.
What's the patient's name?

176
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,412
O'Malley, George. Look,
it's just a simple blood test.

177
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,953
Here you go.

178
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,249
Thank you.

179
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,989
[Sighing]

180
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,921
Franklin, Jordan.
I need these back ASAP.

181
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,726
What a shocker.

182
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,790
Hey, what did you get,
something good?

183
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,428
Syphilis? That's not surgical.
Who has syphilis?

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,099
Excuse us. Sorry.

185
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,170
- You have syphilis?
- Shh!

186
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,321
- I don't know how this happened.
- Of course you do.

187
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,289
Olivia must really be getting around.

188
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,586
She's not like that.

189
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,354
It's a new millennium, George.

190
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,886
The only people who aren't like that
are the Amish and, apparently, you.

191
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,798
You don't know.
Maybe I've been sleeping around.

192
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,425
Maybe I got ladies.

193
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,963
Shut up.

194
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,529
- What am I gonna do?
- It's no biggie.

195
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,634
- Penicillin'll knock it out.
- What am I gonna do about Olivia?

196
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,576
For starters,
stop sleeping with her,

197
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,546
unless you want that thing to fall off.

198
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,607
[George] OK, that is twice
that you have trash-talked

199
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,982
the girl that I could
one day potentially...

200
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,544
Well, not love,
but like a whole lot.

201
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,614
If she gave it to you,
you have to tell her.

202
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,953
Three.

203
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,926
Fine.
She didn't give it to you.

204
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,826
She was a virgin when you met.

205
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,626
You still have to tell her
so she can get tested.

206
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,961
Oh, yeah?

207
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,195
How am I gonna tell her?

208
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,203
"Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing?

209
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,762
By the way, I got the syph.
How about you?"

210
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,138
Maybe not quite like that.

211
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,234
No, it's good advice,
really good advice.

212
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,300
Thank you very much.

213
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,370
[Richard] Retract here.

214
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,415
Oh! This just isn't holding.

215
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,782
Give me a bigger retractor, please.

216
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,413
[Woman] Sorry, doctor.

217
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,013
[Richard] It wasn't you.

218
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,615
[Clearing throat]

219
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,752
Dr. Bailey,
you can finish this.

220
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,855
Uh, thank you, chief.
I appreciate the opportunity.

221
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,126
I'll just...

222
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,176
[Alex] I gotta say, George,

223
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,341
I didn't think you had it in you.

224
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,214
It's always the quiet ones.

225
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,480
- So who's the woman?
- None of your business.

226
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,748
Oh, come on.

227
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,949
Who gave you the cooties
on the playground?

228
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,584
You must have had something
like this before, right?

229
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,356
I never talk about my penis
with other men.

230
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,859
I don't n... either, normally.

231
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,272
We better get Burke.

232
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,579
[Knocking on door]

233
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,343
Mr. Franklin?

234
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,941
You have a condition
known as ascites.

235
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,714
Oh, my God.
I knew it was terrible.

236
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,517
It just means there's fluid
in the peritoneal cavity.

237
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,989
The abdomen.

238
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,253
The swelling is pressing
against your lungs,

239
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,591
which is why you're having
trouble breathing.

240
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,631
It looks like
a symptom of liver disease.

241
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,189
And it all comes together.

242
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,360
Alice, not now.

243
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,405
Is there something we should know?

244
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,602
I drink a bit.

245
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,076
That's the understatement of the year.

246
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,340
- That's enough out of you.
- Hey!

247
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,711
I'm only here for Mom,

248
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,148
to make sure you don't pull
any of your usual crap.

249
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,912
There's definitely a growth
protruding into the bladder,

250
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,617
but look at the edges.

251
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,855
- I don't think it's a tumor.
- Kind of shaped like an ovary.

252
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,260
That the answer you're
gonna give your patient?

253
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,299
This's one of my oldest friends.

254
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,926
- You might want to take this seriously.
- I'm sorry.

255
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,629
You better be.

256
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,763
I got the rest of the labs back.

257
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,569
They did a chromosome analysis
of the tissue.

258
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,167
You won't believe this.

259
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,774
Bill has an ovary?

260
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,284
Um, according to his daughter,
Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

261
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,025
Six to eight drinks a day,
an alcoholic by any standard.

262
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,033
- Protocol?
- Schedule a paracentesis.

263
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,090
Reason?

264
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,194
Draining the fluid'll relieve pressure.

265
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,966
Good, but don't schedule it. Do it.

266
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,269
You want us to do the procedure?

267
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,707
- You've seen one, right?
- Absolutely.

268
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,301
Well, now do one.

269
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,079
I've never seen one.

270
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,673
You're about to.

271
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,979
Oh, my God.

272
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,111
God, an ovary.

273
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,884
It gives new meaning
to the term "metrosexual."

274
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,992
- Hi, George.
- Olivia.

275
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,618
What am I, invisible?

276
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,128
Alex.

277
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,757
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you later.

278
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,001
About time
I got you alone today.

279
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,774
- Olivia...
- What time is your shift done?

280
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,341
Because mine's over at 8,

281
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,444
and I thought maybe
you could come over.

282
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,920
I need to tell you something.

283
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,516
What's wrong?
Are you breaking up with me?

284
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,756
What? No.
Oh, no. Really, no.

285
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,320
It's just...

286
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:31,126
OK, you're the only person
that I've been with in a long time.

287
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,400
I mean, not unusually long
or anything, you know?

288
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,805
Just a normal amount of long time.

289
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,334
But it wouldn't matter to me if
you've been with someone else.

290
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,709
Maybe you have?

291
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,739
I'm not accusing you of anything
or, you know, judging you

292
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,720
or handing out scarlet letters
or anything, you know?

293
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,653
You're a woman, you know?

294
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,089
A very attractive woman.

295
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,353
Of course you've been
with other men.

296
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,590
Not that you've been with a lot of men,
like you're a prostitute...

297
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,894
- A prostitute?
- No! Not a...

298
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,127
Not a prostitute. Wha...?

299
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,433
No, the opposite
of a prostitute, a lady.

300
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,836
You're very ladylike.

301
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,102
I mean, you're very bendy, but...

302
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,076
- George, breathe.
- OK.

303
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,841
It's just...
OK, here's the thing.

304
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,008
I really like you, Olivia.

305
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,744
I like you a lot.

306
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,911
Well, I like you too.

307
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,418
I have syphilis.

308
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,902
That could have gone better.

309
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,882
[Knocking on door]

310
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,554
You dropped a retractor.

311
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,790
Fine.

312
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,261
A few weeks ago, I was operating,

313
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,826
and the vision in
my right eye became blurry.

314
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,600
After a few hours, it was fine.
It's come back again.

315
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,540
- Did you have it checked out?
- The examination was normal.

316
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,840
My ophthalmologist tells me
I'm just getting older.

317
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,280
But you know what a decline
in my visual acuity can mean.

318
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,011
I'll set up some tests.

319
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,417
Shep,

320
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,285
I know how the rumor mill
runs around here.

321
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,518
Let's just keep this to ourselves.

322
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,526
Absolutely.

323
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,755
Yeah.

324
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,896
[George] Do you think
she's talking about me?

325
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,767
She's absolutely talking about you.

326
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,034
[Alex] Dude, that's a good thing.

327
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,507
[George] No. No, it's not.

328
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,838
Georgie, get a clue.

329
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,811
Syphilis is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

330
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,814
In their eyes, you're a player.

331
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,484
[Cristina] Hey, syph-boy.

332
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,611
You told her?

333
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,746
Just Cristina.

334
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,119
[Alex] "Syph-boy."

335
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,623
It's got a nice ring to it,

336
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,557
kind of like Superboy,
only diseased.

337
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,357
[Cristina] lzzie didn't say a word.
Here, the only thing

338
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,591
that spreads faster
than disease is gossip.

339
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,566
That's not true. Just 'cause lzzie
can't keep her mouth shut

340
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,296
doesn't mean everyone knows.

341
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,702
How are you feeling?
Sorry about the syphilis.

342
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,537
Everyone in this hospital knows?

343
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,311
Knows you're a player.

344
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,347
- You're disturbed.
- True.

345
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,475
Everybody's got a secret.
Be glad yours is out in the open.

346
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,246
Oh, yeah, Alex?
What's yours?

347
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,287
You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

348
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,825
I bet you've got some seriously
kinky skeletons in your closet.

349
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,456
What's in my closet
is none of your business.

350
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,365
Well, I don't have any secrets.
My life is boring.

351
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,903
Everybody's got something to hide.

352
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,313
Well, the mass we found
is not a tumor.

353
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,746
Well, that's good, right?

354
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,784
Anything's got to be
better than cancer.

355
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,842
That's where it gets a little tricky.

356
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,820
The chromosomal tests have revealed

357
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,686
that your body contains DNA
from two different embryos

358
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,023
that merged in the womb at the
very beginning of development.

359
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,960
In rare cases such as yours,

360
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,828
the condition can produce
gonadal hermaphroditism.

361
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,094
I'm hearing scary words
here, Preston,

362
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,136
you know, pay-cable kind of words.

363
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,469
In English, the mass
in your bladder is an ovary.

364
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,768
Huh?

365
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,072
Don't worry.
We're gonna remove it.

366
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,477
We have an excellent
gynecological surgeon on staff.

367
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,744
You're telling me
I'm a guy with an ovary?

368
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,786
It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

369
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,250
[Exhaling]

370
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,953
What am I gonna tell Holly?

371
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,086
That you're gonna be fine.

372
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,790
I'm still a man, right?

373
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,299
A man's man, a Kappa man.

374
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,825
I mean...
you know, my sex life.

375
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,895
You been having any problems?

376
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,306
[Laughs] Was it my very pregnant wife
that gave it away?

377
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,934
[Both laughing]

378
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,469
Come on, man, don't worry.
You never knew it was there.

379
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,812
You won't miss it when it's gone.

380
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,147
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

381
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,086
It's a shot of penicillin, George.

382
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,954
Be grateful I'm even doing this.

383
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,959
I've seen more of you
than I ever wanted.

384
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,961
I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

385
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,189
Know what? Forget this.

386
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,129
Do you want to get rid
of the syph or not?

387
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,632
Just shut up and drop 'em.

388
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,697
I cannot believe this.

389
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,069
Meredith, go away!

390
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,200
Oh, George. Thought you
could use some moral support.

391
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,108
No.
No moral support.

392
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,703
I'm indisposed here.

393
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,180
George, it's not a big deal.

394
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,274
And you have a cute butt.

395
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,252
[Alex] I have a cute butt too.
You want to see?

396
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,551
Oh, get out.
You're doing it wrong.

397
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,557
- Be my guest.
- What...? Alex.

398
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,149
Alex.

399
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,353
Wha...?

400
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,459
Hey!

401
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,431
[Lzzie] What are we doing here?

402
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,058
Breaking George's spirit.

403
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,263
- Curing George's syph.
- I don't like needles.

404
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,499
[Meredith] Good thing
you became a doctor.

405
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,700
Other side.

406
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,174
- [Cristina] lzzie?
- Yeah?

407
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,371
Mr. Franklin's procedure's been
scheduled for after lunch...

408
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,038
Oh, what are we doing?

409
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,880
We're saving George from a future
of festering sores and insanity.

410
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,613
- Oh, cute butt.
- Told you.

411
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,587
It is cute, like a baby's.

412
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,356
You know, I have spent
hours, days, years,

413
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:34,161
imagining myself half-naked
in a room with three women.

414
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,662
The reality is so much better.

415
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,704
I think he's gonna cry.

416
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,897
[All laughing]

417
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,703
Hi. It's Ms. Henry again.

418
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,266
- Is this a better time?
- Sorry about this morning.

419
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,041
I wasn't alone and...
What were you calling about?

420
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,741
I just wanted to remind you

421
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,943
that tonight's our
monthly family dinner.

422
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,919
You know, you haven't been
to any of our family functions.

423
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,615
You have to understand.

424
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,022
I'm a surgical intern,
so my time isn't my own.

425
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,561
Our residents really respond
to these events.

426
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,120
They always enjoy themselves,
which is so rare.

427
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,167
I think it's important you attend.

428
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,861
I'll be there.

429
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,838
I'll try to be there.
I'll definitely try.

430
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,931
I've cleared some time
for your MRI.

431
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,340
Good.
Let's get going.

432
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,434
OK.

433
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,537
Uh, sorry to bother you
with this, chief.

434
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,912
We've got kind of a situation.

435
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,610
What now?

436
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,381
Three interns, four residents

437
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,218
and six nurses on this surgical floor

438
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,727
have been diagnosed with... syphilis.

439
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,390
[Woman] There are over
70,000 new cases every year.

440
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:45,061
Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to
blindness, insanity and death.

441
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,833
If you are having unprotected sex

442
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,501
with another member
of the staff, get tested.

443
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,306
This is not a request.

444
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,313
[All laughing]

445
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,178
[Sighing]

446
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,277
Patricia will now give you
a safe-sex demonstration.

447
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,618
[Laughing continues]

448
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,351
When the time is right,

449
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,360
and, gentlemen, you'll all
know when that time is,

450
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,364
carefully open the condom packet

451
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,662
and roll it onto the banana.

452
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,168
We should try and get down
to do the MRI now.

453
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,897
This isn't really a good time.

454
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,565
If you want to do this
without anybody else knowing,

455
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,903
you should do it now.

456
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,741
[Patricia] Open communication
is essential to a healthy relationship.

457
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,838
In a responsible relationship...

458
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,543
- [Meredith] Poor George.
- [Cristina] Yeah.

459
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,415
You know, I think he
really likes Typhoid Mary.

460
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,751
Well, not many
budding relationships

461
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,018
survive a good dose of VD.

462
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,322
Yeah.

463
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,555
[Patricia] When the banana
is finished...

464
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,221
Yeah.

465
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:50,166
...gently peel off the condom
and dispose of it properly.

466
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:54,228
With every fresh banana,
always use a fresh condom.

467
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,568
[Laughter]

468
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,835
[Nellie McKay: The Dog Song]

469
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,012
[Elevator dings]

470
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,661
[Sighing]

471
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,466
You're avoiding me.

472
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,872
I'm busy, at work.
I-I'm working.

473
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,510
Why are you in this line?

474
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,547
It's the syphilis line.

475
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,606
You don't need to be in this line.

476
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,776
I don't?

477
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,683
There's no one else.

478
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,319
That surprises you?

479
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,292
Nothing surprises me.

480
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,591
Do I need to be in this line?

481
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,831
No.

482
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,129
- OK.
- OK.

483
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,833
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

484
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,274
- Mr. Franklin is prepped and ready.
- Excellent.

485
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,503
God, look at this line.

486
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,739
Well, at least we don't
have to stand in line.

487
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,748
That's the one good thing
about the fact

488
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,011
- neither of us is getting any, right?
- Yeah.

489
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,178
Mr. Franklin, we've given you
a local anesthetic,

490
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,416
but you might feel some pressure.

491
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,128
OK. I'm ready.

492
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,031
- Grab the skin.
- OK.

493
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,468
I'm in the peritoneal cavity.

494
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,904
That fluid is bloody.
Is it supposed to be bloody?

495
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,777
You've done this before, right?

496
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,749
Of course.
Millions of times.

497
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,876
You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

498
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,086
OK. Wait, wait.

499
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,389
OK, go.

500
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,023
[Cristina] Good.

501
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,760
[Sighing]

502
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,962
Now all we have to do is wait.

503
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,800
- You see that right there?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:14,312
It's a tumor, and it's
pressing against your optic nerve.

505
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,710
Is it operable?

506
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,077
Oh, definitely.

507
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,049
It does have its risks.

508
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,450
You mean I could lose my sight?

509
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,513
Just what I need, a syphilis
outbreak and a tumor.

510
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,989
It's probably unrelated.

511
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,987
All right, Derek, let's see
how good you really are.

512
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,531
All right. I'll put a team together.

513
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,725
All my people only.

514
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,995
And I still want this
kept under wraps.

515
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,367
The vultures will be
circling soon enough.

516
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,837
Aren't I one of the vultures?

517
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,034
Why do you think I want
to keep an eye on you?

518
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,441
Get going.
We're doing this tonight.

519
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,637
Right.

520
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,412
[Clearing throat]

521
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,111
[Meredith] You paged.

522
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,983
Yeah, I need you to help me out
on something for the chief.

523
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,855
- Can you keep a secret?
- Better than you think.

524
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,418
How much fluid can one body hold?

525
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,793
Shh!

526
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,027
There's a lot of fluid
in there, Mr. Franklin,

527
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,863
but we're almost finished.

528
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:15,168
[Sighing] Mr. Franklin,
are you sleeping?

529
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,435
Mr. Franklin?

530
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,101
- He has no pulse.
- What?

531
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,508
[Lzzie] He has no pulse!

532
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,747
[Woman over PA]
Code blue. Code blue.

533
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,054
How could he die like that
with no warning?

534
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,927
There was blood when it first went in.

535
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,593
What if it's our fault?
What if we did something wrong?

536
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,466
We didn't do anything wrong.
We did a textbook procedure.

537
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,165
[Clearing throat]

538
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,969
I checked your chart.
You did everything by the book.

539
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,602
He died on our watch.
We must have missed something.

540
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,703
There was no history
of heart problems.

541
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,441
His death wasn't your fault.

542
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,641
When's the autopsy?

543
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,344
There isn't gonna be an autopsy.

544
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,909
What? How are we supposed
to know the cause of death?

545
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,286
It's going down
as cardiopulmonary arrest

546
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,120
complicated by liver disease.

547
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,887
But an autopsy would...

548
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,952
The family decided
they didn't want an autopsy.

549
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,430
- But, Dr. Bailey...
- They don't want an autopsy.

550
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,830
Let it go.

551
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,762
[Woman over PA] Dr. Burke to Cardiology.
Dr. Burke to Cardiology.

552
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,441
How goes our special super secret
silent sunset surgery?

553
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,039
I've been practicing that.

554
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,948
You have too much time
on your hands.

555
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,714
Uh, tell the chief I'll be there.

556
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,755
Just let me know
when and where. I'm in.

557
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,084
[Meredith] OK.

558
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,647
[Laughing]

559
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,455
- Are you nervous?
- It's a complicated surgery.

560
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,758
I make one mistake,

561
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,732
I end a fellow surgeon's career,
my mentor's career.

562
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,325
Oh, no, I'm not nervous.

563
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,767
- So just for the record...
- Mm-hm.

564
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,535
...you'd tell me if I need
to get tested, right?

565
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,169
- You think I have syphilis?
- No, I don't.

566
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,009
It's just... We never made
any rules or anything.

567
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,481
I mean, we never said,
"We have rules,"

568
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,711
and I wouldn't hold it against you.

569
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,254
When would I have time
to go out and get syphilis?

570
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,050
You're a handful enough as it is,

571
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,614
and besides, we're, like,
practically a condom ad.

572
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,684
But no more
glow-in-the-dark ones.

573
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,025
You see?
There's nothing to worry about.

574
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:22,066
Maybe we should, you know,
make some rules, I mean.

575
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,498
We should.

576
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,298
- OK.
- OK.

577
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,368
- Just for the record...
- Uh-huh?

578
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,875
...I like the glow-in-the-dark ones.

579
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,740
[Laughing] I bet you do.

[Cell phone ringing]

[Woman] That's the last
of the ovarian material.

582

I just need to sew up the
perforation on the bladder wall.

583
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,029
- Uh...
- [Burke] Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?

584
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,258
Well, you said this man's
wife is pregnant?

585
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,163
Due in five weeks. Why?

586
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,067
Our patient has a blind vas deferens.

587
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,900
Bill is sterile?

588
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,600
And always has been.

589
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,878
Then who got his wife pregnant?

590
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,416
- Oh.
- Oh.

591
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,510
[Alex] Sucks to be Bill right now.

592
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,782
How's Burke gonna tell him
the baby's not his?

593
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,619
- Burke's not gonna tell.
- He has to.

594
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,215
Bill's better off not knowing.

595
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,453
You think Holly knows
Bill's not the father?

596
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,554
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Bill should know his wife's cheating.

597
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,758
I don't remember asking
for your opinions,

598
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,300
so keep them to yourselves.

599
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,926
Sorry, sir.

600
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,994

[Iron & Wine: Naked as We Came]

602
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,706
[Lzzie] We know how confusing
this must be,

603
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,748
your husband dying so suddenly.

604
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,841
But an autopsy will tell us why.

605
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,887
So you think we should do the autopsy?

606
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,751
[Alice] No, we want this to be over.

607
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,917
But don't you want to know
for certain what killed him?

608
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,394
My father was a mean drunk
who couldn't hold a job.

609
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,055
That's what killed him.

610
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,122
I understand that you're angry.

611
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,431
But knowing for sure might help
give you some closure.

612
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,064
It was awfully sudden, Alice.

613
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,630
Sudden?

614
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,903
He's been killing himself for years.

615
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,070
He was a good man.

616
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,273
Maybe...
maybe they're right.

617
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,906
Maybe we should do the autopsy.

would have wanted...

You do not want to be
known as the new 007.

- Cristina, no.
- What about Franklin's wife?

631
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,863
You saw the way she was looking at me.
She wants the autopsy.

with her daughter.

OK, I'm in.

and knows everything.

a real patient because of this,

we're gonna do it right.

OK.

671
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,649
- OK, got it.
- You sure?

672
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,777
It's not like we can kill him twice.

673
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,083
Let me cut.

674
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,955
You'll get your turn.

675
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,929
- You should be using the ten-blade.
- Will you stop backseat cutting?

676
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,833
Go get the saw.

677
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,733
OK, I've sutured the drain in place.

678
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,238
The staples look fine.
All right, we're done here.

679

you want to wrap him?

680
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,738
Nice work, everybody.
Nicely done.

681
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,937
- Thanks.
- Good.

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,341
Do you think the optic nerve is damaged?

683
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,480
If it is, when he wakes up, he'll...

684
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,354
He'll be blind?
For how long?

685
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,723
Forever.

covering your patients.

and monitor the chief.

With what?

692
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,542
Labs. They had to check
on some labs.

I hate a bad liar.

697
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,128
Take over for me.

698
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,256
I know exactly where they are.

699
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,822
Here. Take over for me.

700
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,566
[Sighing]

701
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,168
[Burke] Your whole
relationship is a lie.

702
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,768
We're happy.

703
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,575
We've wanted a child for a long time.

704
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,616
Why do you want to
take this away from him?

705
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,651
Does he know
you've been cheating on him?

706
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,049
This is between Bill and me.

707
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,556
The man has a right to know
that this isn't his child.

708
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,786
Please, just let this go.
Why can't you let this go?

709
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,691
Bill is my best friend. That's why.

710
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,923
If you were his friend,
you wouldn't do this.

711
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,430
Please! Tell him the truth!

712
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,230
Why? I'm not gonna ruin my life,
because you think this is wrong.

713
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,271
Your life?
What about his life?

714
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,203
What about this child's life?

715
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,764
What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

716
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,909
Fine.

717
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,075
Maybe his friend
wouldn't tell him the truth.

718
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,778
But I'm also his doctor,

719
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,822
and his doctor is not
going to lie to him.

720
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,320
[Meredith] I know,
but something came up,

721
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,261
an important surgery,
and I couldn't.

722
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,493
Sorry you couldn't
be there for your mother.

723
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,230
Ms. Henry, if my mother were lucid,
she would understand.

724
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,603
She's a surgeon.
She's done this countless times.

725
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,007
And besides, she doesn't even
know who I am, anyway, so...

726
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,739
[Henry] Today she did.

727
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,802
What?

728
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,280
Your mother's been asking

729
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,613
when her daughter Meredith
gets off from work.

730
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,585
Hey.

731
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,952
[Cell phone closing]

732
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,320
Hey.

733
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,155
A lot of secret phone calls today.

734
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,724
Yeah, it's my mother.

735
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,106
She isn't traveling.

736
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,644
She isn't writing a book.

737
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,110
She isn't anything.

738
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,444
I've been lying to everyone.

739
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,710
Why?

740
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,651
She has Alzheimer's.

741
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,711
How advanced?

742
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,778
[Meredith] Very.

743
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,051
She's in a home,

744
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,492
and I'm the only one
who even knows she's sick.

745
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,623
I just don't know what to do
anymore, you know?

746
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,234
[Monitor beeping]

747
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,812
Don't even tell me you're doing
what I think you're doing!

748
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,061
Um...

749
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,863
Not only did you disregard
the family's wishes,

750
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,164
you broke the law!

751
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,536
You could be arrested for assault!

752
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,767
Do you like jail?

753
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,536
The hospital could be sued!

754
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,340
I could lose my license, my job!

755
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,902
I like my job!

756
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,744
Did you think about any of this

757
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,444
before you started cutting open
a poor man's body?

758
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,043
I could seriously kick
both of your asses right now.

759
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,248
[Bailey] Do you have anything to say?

760
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,922
Look at his heart.

761
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,893
It's huge!

762
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,189
It's over 600 grams,

763
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,595
and there's some kind of
grainy material in it.

764
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,463
- We want to run some tests.
- Oh, now you want to run tests?

765
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,900
At this point,
what could it hurt?

766
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,403
I hate both of you right now.

767
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,505
[Monitor beeping]

768
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,149
Meredith?

769
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,588
He's an attending.
You're an intern.

770
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,216
You saw us?

771
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,386
You can see.

772
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,361
I'm gonna tell you

773
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,228
what your mother would say
if she were here.

774
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,027
You're making a mistake, a big one.

775
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,370
And I would tell my mother
it's not a mistake.

776
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,309
We specifically said no autopsy.

777
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,475
I understand why you're upset.

778
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,075
[Alice] You understand?

779
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,451
We're gonna get an attorney.

780
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,682
[Alice] Come on, Mom.

781
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,087
We know what killed him.

782
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,092
[Cristina] He had a blood condition

783
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,684
known as hemachromatosis.

784
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,059
The disease causes
an excess amount of iron

785
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,392
to build up in the body,

786
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,660
and that's what caused
the heart failure,

787
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,463
not the paracentesis.

788
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,165
But I thought he was always
so sick 'cause of the drinking.

789
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,036
And you never let him forget it.

790
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,439
- Or me.
- Mom...

791
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,501
There's something else.
The disease is genetic.

792
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,377
- You think Alice could have it?
- A blood test will tell us.

793
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,747
If you have it,
we'll have caught it to treat it,

794
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,184
before the condition becomes critical.

795
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,349
[Bailey] Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang
may have saved your life.

796
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,030
If you could just

797
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,864
sign this consent form
for the autopsy.

798
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,130
[Bailey] Just a formality.

799
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,764
[The Radio: Whatever Gets
You Through Today]

800
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,204
[Meredith] The thing people forget

801
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:44,077
is how good it can feel when
you finally set secrets free.

802
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,084
Whether good or bad,

803
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,280
at least they're out in the open,

804
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,381
like it or not.

805
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,397
Um, about before...

806
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,533
George, I want you to understand,

807
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,544
when we started dating,

808
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,843
I was already
kind of seeing someone.

809
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,179
I didn't know how much I'd like you,

810
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,913
and when I realized,
I broke it off with the other guy...

811
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,784
Other guy?

812
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,589
Who's the other guy?

813
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,391
You and Alex?

814
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,365
You and Alex?!

815
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,365
You gave me syphilis?!

816
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,235
- George!
- George!

817
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,603
George, back off!

818
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:44,766
[Meredith] Alex!

819
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,036
[Cristina] George!

820
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,338
Back off, Alex.

821
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,014
[Meredith] Once your secrets
are out in the open,

822
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,176
you don't have to
hide behind them anymore.

823
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,346
[Derek] Long day.

824
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,721
Yeah.

825
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,556
Somewhere out there is a steak
with your name on it

826
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,289
and maybe a bottle of wine.

827
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,092
This is why I keep you around.

828
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,599
So we need to talk.

829
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,226
Wine first, talk later.

830
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,467
You trying to, uh, get me drunk
so you can take advantage of me?

831
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,802
[Laughing]

832
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,810
I think I like this rules thing.

833
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,311
Me too.

834
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,621
Meredith, I am so sorry.

835
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,630
[Meredith] The problem with secrets is

836
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,826
even when you think
you're in control...

837
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,027
Addison.

838
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,194
...you're not.

839
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,635
What are you doing here?

840
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,798
You'd know if you'd
bothered to return

841
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,603
any one of my phone calls.

842
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,701
Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd.

00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,144

844
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:02,083

who's been screwing my husband.
