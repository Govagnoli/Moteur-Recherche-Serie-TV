1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:03,115
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,328
Patient's name?

3
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:06,985
- Ellis Grey.
- Meredith's mother.

4
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:10,855
It's not that Burke broke up with me,
it's how he broke up with me.

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:13,273
Have you even bothered to
tell Burke about the baby?

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,663
Cristina!

7
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,230
It was an
extrauterine pregnancy.

8
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:17,173
She's bleeding out.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,580
Stop talking to me like
you're my boyfriend.

10
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:21,582
Stop talking to me at all.

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,992
If you came out here to try to win
me back, you can forget about it.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,033
I just know I still love you.

13
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:29,487
Hating you is the
most exhausting.

14
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:42,096
The key to surviving a
surgical internship is denial.

15
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,452
We deny that we're tired.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,061
We deny that we're scared.

17
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,070
We deny how badly
we wanna succeed.

18
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:52,638
And most importantly,
we deny that we're in denial.

19
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:54,671
I don't know.
When I left, Cristina said she was okay.

20
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:57,471
Nobody goes through what she went
through and is totally over it by now.

21
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,760
Cristina can.

22
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,098
She's fine.

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,749
Too fine. She's cold.

24
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,899
No, she's hard-core.
She's got ice in her veins.

25
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,575
She does what she has
to to get through.

26
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,085
She lost a baby.

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,220
She lost a fallopian tube. And she's
acting like she doesn't even care.

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,527
She's all, "hello,
I'm totally fine" person.

29
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:16,024
I mean, she's my friend, too, but she's
acting like she has no emotions or warmth,

30
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,067
like she's missing a soul.

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,783
- God, she is gonna make a great surgeon.
- George.

32
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,849
It's true.

33
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,124
You show no weakness,
you make it to the top.

34
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,406
Some people just keep their
feelings to themselves.

35
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:31,021
We only see what we want to see and
believe what we want to believe.

36
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,002
And it works.

37
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:38,232
We lie to ourselves so much that, after
awhile, the lies start to seem like the truth.

38
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,018
Meredith kissed me.

39
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:41,283
Addison kissed me.

40
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:44,510
My wife and my girlfriend
kissed me on the same day.

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,415
Joe... do I look
friendly to you?

42
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,529
Oh, you're a tiny little
kitten of joy and love.

43
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,871
- What? He saved my life.
- His first mistake.

44
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,122
Mcdreamy, go sit by
someone who cares.

45
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:03,403
We deny so much that we can't recognize
the truth right in front of our faces.

46
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,888
Everything's gonna be fine.

47
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,578
Addison will go
back to New York,

48
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:10,532
Meredith and I will start over.
Everything's gonna be fine, right?

49
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,766
You so damn stupid.

50
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,016
I want everyone focused today.

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,529
With Cristina out, we're short an intern,
and I have a feelin' it's gonna be one of those days.

52
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,223
- And, Karev, see the chief by the end of the day.
- What for?

53
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,599
Do I look psychic to you?
He's the chief.

54
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,802
He asked, you go.

55
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,110
What did he do now?

56
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,884
Maybe he gave the
chief syphilis.

57
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:40,218
So we're in the middle of the belizean jungle,
and this jaguarundi jumps out and bites one of the guides.

58
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,827
They all look at me.

59
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,881
They're yelling, "You're a doctor.
Help him."

60
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:46,792
This is one time a
PHD does no good.

61
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:49,377
I'm sorry.
Did I miss the bell for social hour?

62
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,022
- Tales of missionary life.
- You're a missionary?

63
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,563
No, my parents.

64
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,757
- We traveled a lot. They still do.
- Oh, wow.

65
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,136
This stuff is great.

66
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:01,275
- Um, this is Dr. Burke's patient-- Kalpana Vera.
- Kalpana.

67
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,699
Named by villagers in Nepal.

68
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:06,419
Uh, she presents with
multiple syncopal episodes

69
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,469
- and ventricular arrhythmia.
- So you've been passing out?

70
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:10,620
Yeah, and having palpitations.

71
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:13,582
Past medical history of rheumatic heart
disease with mitral valve stenosis.

72
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:18,475
They had to ship me from Zambia to the
States for 3 months of treatment when I was 8.

73
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:20,842
Rheumatic fever
almost killed me.

74
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:24,846
Dr. Stevens, what are the primary
causes of ventricular arrhythmias?

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,243
Valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse,
stimulants, drugs  and metabolic abnormalities.

76
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,704
- What?
- Out.

77
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,893
- I'm fine.
- Out.

78
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,882
You better be in your room
by the time we round on you.

79
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:43,456
- And when will that be?
- In 15 seconds.

80
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,517
14... 13...

81
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:49,447
- 12... 11...
- Nice panties, Yang.

82
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,931
In your dreams evil spawn.

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,463
Cristina Yang.

84
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:01,720
- Post-op, day three, from a unilateral salpingectomy--
- And ready to get back to work.

85
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:02,914
Is she?

86
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:06,868
I'm taking solids and my pain is
controlled with oral meds. I'm ready.

87
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:09,566
Didn't the nurse say this
morning you had a fever?

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,615
Mother.

89
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,996
Cristina, did you have a fever?

90
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:18,199
Temp spiked to 101 last night.
Big deal.

91
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,337
- She worked 2 shifts last month with a 102-degree flu.
- Yes, exactly, George. Thank you.

92
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,290
And we appreciate your dedication, but
you're staying in bed until it normalizes.

93
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:30,221
I keep telling her there's more
to life than surgery and career.

94
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,809
Mother, go upholster something.

95
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:35,152
Look, I need you to relax,
shut up and get better.

96
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,869
You're a patient this week so you can
be a doctor next week. Understand?

97
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,268
Mere, come here.

98
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,311
You cannot leave
me alone with her.

99
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,629
I am flying over the cuckoo's nest here.
You have to save me.

100
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:46,614
- You need time to heal.
- I'm healed.

101
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,108
I'm healed!

102
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,257
Oh,  god.

103
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,575
Okay, Dr. O'Malley, you're presenting.

104
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:01,902
Okay, Dr. Grey is post-op,
day three, from a tumor resection.

105
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,051
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.
- Sh--

106
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,369
He's got it all wrong.

107
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,216
It's not asthma, it's gerd.

108
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,958
He  needs a
nissen fundoplication.

109
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,174
I don't want her in the room.

110
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:10,438
Mom.

111
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:12,587
She's a child,
and I won't have her on my team.

112
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,952
We'll meet you outside,
Dr. Grey.

113
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,045
- You skipping rounds?
- Avoiding mother.

114
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:25,655
Meredith...

115
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:28,734
- You've got a wife.
- Yes.

116
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,581
- Your life is complicated.
- Yes.

117
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,890
I don't need complicated.

118
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:34,307
- I have complicated all on my own.
- Yes.

119
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,915
Stop saying yes.

120
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,804
Try not to make any
sudden movements.

121
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:41,341
You think this is funny.

122
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:42,565
Addison's leaving.

123
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,215
She doesn't have any more
patients in this hospital.

124
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,219
There's no reason
for her to be here.

125
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,488
- No reason?
- None whatsoever.

126
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,426
Well, isn't this cozy?

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,506
Can I join in,
or are you not into threesomes?

128
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:58,159
- I have to go.
- Meredith...

129
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,790
You really are Satan.

130
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,923
You realize that, right?

131
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,294
If Satan were to take physical form,
he'd be you,

132
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:07,837
- everywhere, all the time.
- I am so not Satan.

133
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:10,228
How come you haven't gotten on your broomstick
and gone back to New York where you belong?

134
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,858
- Stop being petty.
- Stop being an adulterous bitch.

135
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:17,036
You know you are going to
forgive me eventually, right?

136
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,798
I mean, you can't just--

137
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:21,521
I mean, there was a time where you
thought of me as your best friend.

138
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:24,405
There was a time where I thought
you were the love of my life.

139
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:25,969
Things change.

140
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,418
Divorce papers.

141
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,928
Your lawyer said they're okay.

142
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,475
I haven't signed 'em yet.

143
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,964
The ball's in your court.
If you sign, I'll sign. I'll...

144
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,132
sign and be on the
first plane out of here.

145
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,853
I'll sign them immediately.

146
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,037
I want you out of here
as soon as possible.

147
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,124
Derek, have you ever thought
that even if I am Satan

148
00:06:56,154 --> 00:07:00,039
and an adulterous bitch that I still
might be the love of your life?

149
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:30,691
Nobody knows where they
might end up nobody knows...

150
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,357
Oh, oh

151
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:44,562
Suppose you'll never know.

152
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,577
It's my chart.

153
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,349
You're the patient,
not the doctor.

154
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,523
Act like one.

155
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,812
It's been tough
finding you alone.

156
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,317
- Yeah. Well...
- How are you doing?

157
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,582
Well, you have my chart.
You tell me.

158
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,148
How are you doing?

159
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,936
I'm fine. Perfectly okay.

160
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:29,216
I had a right to know.

161
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,667
- Well, now you do.
- Cristina--

162
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:34,445
Look, now you know. It's over.

163
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,982
There's nothing for you to deal with,
so I don't know

164
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,162
what else is there
really left to say?

165
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,683
- Plenty. For starters, you could've come to me--
- Oh, look, it's my mother.

166
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:47,601
Dr. Preston Burke.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Yang.

167
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,407
Actually, it's Rubenstein.

168
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:53,349
Dr. Saul Rubenstein of Beverly Hills,
the oral surgeon.

169
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,801
I'm remarried.

170
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:58,423
Been remarried since Cristina was,
what, about 3?

171
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,188
Mom, that's too
much information.

172
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,547
He has other things to do.

173
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:04,141
You're good-looking.

174
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,469
He's good-looking.

175
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:08,694
Why don't you ever bring home
a man as good-looking as him?

176
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,540
- Stop.
- What?

177
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,630
- Stop talking.
- Cristina!

178
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,892
Forgive her.

179
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,556
I don't know what I ever did to
raise such an unpleasant girl.

180
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,425
- Oh, me, unpl-- I'm unpleasant?
- Excuse me.

181
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,199
- Do you know who that was?
- Who?

182
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:26,988
That was my--

183
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,398
- that was my boss.
- I was very nice to him.

184
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:31,043
Why did you have to call my
"unpleasant" in front of my boss?

185
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,996
Lighten up, please.

186
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:36,213
Okay, I was thinking that
maybe we might wanna--

187
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,501
you might...

188
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,835
- okay, we both have tonight off, so--
- You are so into me.

189
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:41,779
Shut up.

190
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,906
It's sad--the worship,
the adoration.

191
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:47,720
- And I'm so handsome, I intoxicate you.
- Okay, you know what? Forget it.

192
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,722
Izzie, would you like to go
out with me tonight on a date?

193
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,621
You wear something gorgeous,
I pay for food.

194
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:55,637
Are you making fun of me?

195
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,819
I'm not making fun of you.

196
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,543
Okay, then.

197
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,942
G ood.

198
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:01,270
Good.

199
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:04,622
Thought I told you I never
wanted to see you again.

200
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,450
That's only because you're too
lazy to learn anything more.

201
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,832
Dr. Meredith Grey,
Jeremiah Tate.

202
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,780
Thinks he knows so much because he was
one of my first patients as an intern.

203
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,543
I  knew as much as she did.

204
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:16,521
She was clueless about how
to treat cystic fibrosis.

205
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,623
A simple cholecystectomy
turned into a month-long stay.

206
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,388
You better not be
alleging malpractice.

207
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:26,835
Guy raises about 100 grand a year for cystic
fibrosis runnin' triathlons thinks he's a big shot.

208
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,948
- You run triathlons?
- Why not?

209
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,390
Pain, for one.

210
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,091
It says here you're finally
admittin' to feelin' a little.

211
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,319
- A little.
- How little?

212
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:35,128
Truth.

213
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:38,635
Well, enough to keep
me awake at night.

214
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:44,018
Had some seizures. Um...
too weak to work out.

215
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,107
Anyone been through here
with your C.T. results?

216
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:51,498
No. It's probably just my
pancreatitis kicking up again.

217
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:52,754
All right, then.

218
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:55,805
We'll be back with your
results and a plan.

219
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:58,596
Where do your parents
think you are this time?

220
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,703
New Jersey.

221
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:07,741
What about his parents?

222
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:11,539
No, he doesn't like to bother them until
he's well or about to get discharged.

223
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,396
He understands his reality.

224
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,038
He just chooses to ignore it.

225
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:16,574
Denial works for him, Grey.

226
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:19,966
"Abdominal pain".
"Abdominal pain".

227
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,145
"Perirectal abscess".

228
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,003
"Gunshot wound to the head."

229
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,326
What the hell is this G.S.W.
to the head?

230
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,088
Why wasn't the
trauma team called?

231
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,280
Hello?

232
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,878
Are you people insane?

233
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,809
There's your gunshot victim.

234
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:37,418
Him?

235
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:48,022
I'm redoing the living room
in beige silks, I'm thinking.

236
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:52,245
And modern. Very mid-century.

237
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:55,436
- And the dining room--
- Mother, give me back my toes.

238
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:58,974
Okay. I'll change the subject.

239
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,952
Who's the father?

240
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,455
Mid-century, did you say?

241
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,429
Someone you work with, right?

242
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,659
Or is it just for sex?

243
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:10,605
You made such a point of
not forming attachments.

244
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:14,259
20 minutes. Just gime-- All I want
is 20 minutes of peace and quiet.

245
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:19,169
The daughter I raised would
appreciate her mother's help.

246
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:23,298
The daughter you raised is
begging for you to go now.

247
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,424
I didn't have to come here.

248
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,513
You know, I'm very busy.

249
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,579
I know.
Yeah, I know, redecorating your house.

250
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,741
Well, can you get me
a mocha latte, please?

251
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,865
A non fat one.

252
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,667
No, a fat one.

253
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,566
Ah. Well, you're walking.

254
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:52,393
You're talking.
There's no exit wound.

255
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,302
This mark here looks
more like a burn.

256
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,012
I'm telling you,
I shot myself--

257
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,978
pulled the trigger while
I was cleaning my .22.

258
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:00,654
I thought the clip was out.

259
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:02,326
If you're thinkin'
suicide, don't.

260
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,839
People make mistakes.
I made a mistake...

261
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,345
And now I'm payin' for it.

262
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,733
But I did shoot myself.

263
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,158
-  Where's your I.V.?
- I'm taking solids. I hep-locked it.

264
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,462
On whose orders?

265
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:22,967
Mine.

266
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,828
Okay. "Yang."

267
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,338
How about this order?

268
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,224
"Bed rest, out of bed to chair,
bathroom privileges."

269
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,745
Nothin' about stealing charts
at the nurses' station.

270
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,069
Okay, you know what?
Hey, hey, hey! Give me that.

271
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,068
Ah. Ah. There. Satisfied?

272
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,634
I'm out of bed to chair.

273
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:46,263
I'm telling your intern on you.

274
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,879
- Meredith?
- Yeah.

275
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,645
Ooh, I'm so scared.

276
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,086
Dr. Grey, how are you doin'?

277
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,052
You're here. Good.

278
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,095
I need the results of the barium esophagram
or the E.G.D., and you have neither. Okay.

279
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,488
No worries.
I'll be here when you get back.

280
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,964
So today,
you're her intern, hmm?

281
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:13,143
Well, that's better
than bein' her husband.

282
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,626
Well, that's a
matter of opinion.

283
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,194
Good morning, Ellis.

284
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,480
Richard, good to see you.

285
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,067
I need those labs immediately.

286
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,802
Chief, um...

287
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,818
she's not a surgical patient anymore,
and I'd really like to get back to the O.R.

288
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:28,980
So, uh, do you think I could
hand her off to someone else?

289
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:35,154
O'Malley, Alzheimer's causes her reality
to shift, depending on the situation, her mood.

290
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,877
She needs stability right now.

291
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:40,124
That's why I'm depending on you
to keep a special eye on her.

292
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:45,292
Yes, I know, sir, but, you know,
it doesn't seem fair to me.

293
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:47,148
I need those studies yesterday.

294
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,116
You heard the doctor.

295
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,046
Get movin'.

296
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,998
I saw that.

297
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,723
I saw you take that pill.

298
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,603
Oh, it's--it's my pill.

299
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,117
You know, "the pill."

300
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:10,638
It's, uh, it's not in your chart, and you're
supposed to tell us all the meds you're on.

301
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,903
You're not my doctor.

302
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:13,398
You shouldn't even be here.

303
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,332
She's right.

304
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,307
You shouldn't be here.

305
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:17,256
I saw her take
unauthorized medication.

306
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:20,162
I'm on the pill,
and I had grapefruit juice this morning.

307
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,545
Since the juice inhibits enzymes
involved in the metabolism of O.C.Ps,

308
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:26,979
I thought I'd avoid the interaction
by taking it two hours after my meal.

309
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,117
She is a doctor in
neuropharmacology, Cristina.

310
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,558
- Well, Izzie, I don't see oral contraceptives...
- Guys.

311
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,306
- Okay, well now you will.
- Would you just go back to bed...

312
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:35,336
Would you just go back to bed
and stop poaching my patients?

313
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,022
- She's in v-fib.
- Call the code.

314
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,496
Code blue, second floor.

315
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,855
Code blue, second floor.

316
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,874
- No code?
- Not anymore.

317
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,007
Can you help us get
her back in the bed?

318
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,947
I'll help.
Just give me a minute.

319
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,812
Would you just go back to bed, please?
Seriously, go.

320
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:07,157
Oh, god, you know, Izzie, if she's on
O.C.Ps, then we mark it down, okay?

321
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:08,704
Yeah.

322
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:19,594
Jeremiah's got a mass in his mid-epigastrium,
a diffused enlargement of the pancreas.

323
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:24,200
- That, with his hypoglycemic seizures...
- He's going to need an exploratory laparotomy...

324
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:29,658
but despite his triathlons,
his lungs still make me hesitant to cut.

325
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,465
What are we going to do?

326
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:34,007
I don't know that yet.

327
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,321
Doctors.

328
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,219
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

329
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,963
- How old is he?
- He's 26.

330
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,391
- Survivor, huh?
- And then some.

331
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:44,653
My patient for at
least five years.

332
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:46,250
I'm not going to lose him now.

333
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,314
- You planning a laparotomy?
- Yeah, but his lungs...

334
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,230
You know what?
I think I could help you with this.

335
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,117
I've seen one case like this
before in a 9-year-old.

336
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,640
We ended up having to do
a total pancreatectomy.

337
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:59,410
I'd  be honored to take any
help you could give me.

338
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,642
You're a neonatal specialist.

339
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,817
What--I--this isn't your area.

340
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,701
I'm just saying. I--

341
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:10,283
I did two years genetics
research in cystic fibrosis.

342
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,641
- I've pretty much seen it all, Dr. Grey.
- Oh.

343
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:19,622
Just because she offered her services,
doesn't mean she intends to stay.

344
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,924
Well what does it mean?

345
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,847
- Because it seems to me...
- It means that she's a good doctor.

346
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:26,049
Oh ho ho.
Why are you suddenly defending her?

347
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,889
I'm not. Meredith, she gave me
divorce papers which she filed.

348
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,896
Oh. Well, that's good.

349
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:36,831
All I have to do is sign,
and I'm free.

350
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,052
We're free.

351
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,822
Is there anything
to think about?

352
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:45,401
No, of course not.
I have to read through them, sign,

353
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,545
and then Addison's on the
next plane out of here.

354
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,930
You say he got
shot in the head?

355
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,550
He says he got
shot in the head.

356
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,284
I say he's a mental defect.

357
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,713
Um, hi.

358
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:59,575
- Ma'am, you can't be in here.
- Yeah, I know. I'm looking for Samuel Linden. He...

359
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,796
Oh, my god. Samuel.

360
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,404
Well, how--how--how--how
bad is it?

361
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:08,714
- Are you his wife?
- Yes, for 21 years.

362
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:09,535
Just tell me how he is.

363
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:12,169
Fine, for a man who
says he shot himself.

364
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,124
He shot himself.

365
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,001
He was cleaning his gun.

366
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,068
What is wrong with you people?

367
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,362
We'll know everything
when we finish his C.T.

368
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,257
- This is a restricted area, ma'am. You have to leave.
- No, no. My husband has a bullet in his head.

369
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,508
Then we'll find it.

370
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,639
If you could just wait outside, I'll be
with you as soon as we know something. I promise.

371
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,230
Of all the fine doctors in this city,
you accept a consult from Addison Shepherd?

372
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,898
Montgomery-Shepherd, isn't it?

373
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,987
The point is that she
should be on her way home.

374
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,139
You're tryin' to drive me crazy,
aren't you?

375
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,004
- Oh, hey, now, don't do this.
- Do you think this has somethin' to do with you?

376
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:55,097
Do you think I'm even thinking about
you and your romantic problems?

377
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,843
I'm tryin' to help a patient
very near and dear to my heart,

378
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,130
and if consultin' with your wife, your ex,
your mistress, whatever it is that she becomes,

379
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:07,050
if that's the thing I have to do to save
my patient, then I'm damn well gonna do it.

380
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,773
I understand that.

381
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,065
I deserve that.

382
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:11,510
It's--come on, it's just...

383
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,962
look, you have put yourself between two very
fine women and you lookin' for an easy way out.

384
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:20,544
You want to use me
and the hospital--

385
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:24,074
somebody to make the decision for you,
and it's not gonna happen.

386
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:27,886
Could I just--

387
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:30,462
- could I just say a couple things?
- Just--deh, deh, deh.

388
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,329
You scared us a little there.

389
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:40,498
How's her workup coming?

390
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:44,709
Uh, electrolytes are within normal limits,
urine tox was negative and E.K.G.'s fine.

391
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:46,079
Tilt test is
scheduled for noon.

392
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,616
- Oh, and she's on contraceptives.
- So?

393
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,028
That's what I said.

394
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,384
That other doctor made
such a big deal of it.

395
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,273
Well, she didn't
tell us before.

396
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:55,537
So I documented it
in her med list.

397
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,214
What other doctor?

398
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,552
Cristina.

399
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,025
She was wandering the halls.

400
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:04,416
Fine. Take her
down for an echo.

401
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:07,197
An echo?
What about cardioversion or ablation?

402
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,819
Won't I need a pacemaker or a
permanent internal defibrillator?

403
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:14,715
Although it would be unusual for rheumatic
heart disease to cause ventricular dysrhythmias,

404
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,710
we've still got to
check your valves.

405
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:24,037
I thought your doctorate was in
neuropharmacology, not medicine.

406
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:25,438
It is.

407
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:34,704
Addison gave Derek divorce papers,
which is good.

408
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:39,258
I mean, she's still here being Addison,
but it's not like I'm jealous or anything.

409
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,244
That's odd.

410
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,737
It's odd that I'm not jealous?

411
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,112
No, you have every
right to be jealous.

412
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,982
It's your territory,
and she's peeing all over it.

413
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,056
What's odd is Burke's patient.

414
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,112
She's been in four other
hospitals this year.

415
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,873
You know,
something's not right.

416
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:52,873
You seem awfully interested
in Burke's patient.

417
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,894
This has nothing
to do with Burke.

418
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,119
Cristina, you lost a fallopian tube,
a baby and a boyfriend all in one day.

419
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,009
You have the right to be upset.

420
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,590
And you're losing McDreamy
to his perfect wife.

421
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,233
You have a right to be jealous.

422
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,925
I did not lose McDreamy.

423
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,252
Divorce papers, remember?

424
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:08,534
- And I'm not jealous.
- And I'm not upset.

425
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,056
You really should
be in your room.

426
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:15,908
Okay, if the situation was reversed, would you want
to spend time with your mother in a confined room with one window?

427
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:21,490
Do you think we're like them,
our mothers?

428
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:25,829
<i>Dr. James...</i>

429
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:31,266
- Uh, where's your mom?
- Exactly.

430
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,676
Where is my mother?

431
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:34,180
Where's your mother?

432
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:35,706
Funny you should ask.

433
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:37,232
Oh, crap.

434
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:41,589
Oh, man,
you are not gonna believe this.

435
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,849
No. It can't be.

436
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,518
The guy was readin'
a freakin' magazine.

437
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:50,098
It's definitely a bullet,
one that tracked clear through his head.

438
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:56,457
Now are you people just going to sit
here, or are you going to get him into surgery?

439
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,709
Here's the missile track.

440
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:04,748
As you can see, it doesn't even
cross the midline. He's lucky.

441
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,471
This guy may have even been
sitting there talking to you.

442
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:12,751
He'll need debridement of the entrance wound
and repair the dura, but we don't need to remove the bullet.

443
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:15,458
That's an excellent diagnosis,
Dr. Grey.

444
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,646
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
I'm your neuro consult.

445
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:19,981
Dr. Grey...

446
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,357
they need you upstairs.

447
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,276
You'll book the O.R. and stat?

448
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm on it.

449
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,564
- Unbelievable.
- O'Malley.

450
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:35,542
Can you not handle
this, Doctor?

451
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:39,546
I can't handle a lot of things.

452
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,970
We won't know for sure until we
go in there, but it looks like

453
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:49,673
that I'm gonna have to take out your
pancreas and reroute your intestines.

454
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,610
Did you tell her that my lungs
don't do well with anesthesia?

455
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:54,167
Don't I always have your back?

456
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,618
Your kidney function is decreasing
rapidly, and I'm afraid you're gonna go

457
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:59,987
into multisystem organ
failure if we don't operate.

458
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:01,574
If I say no?

459
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:03,888
There's no guarantees, Jeremiah.
You know that.

460
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:08,162
It's going to be a long, hard surgery
and put a lot of stress on your body.

461
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,658
Yeah, but I'm me.

462
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,697
But you're you.

463
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:20,542
So if we don't operate, I die,
and if we do operate, I may die.

464
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,481
Basically, yes.

465
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:24,775
Well, I like those odds.

466
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:29,608
And 26 years with this disease is
awesome, and that's the reality.

467
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:31,135
So if I get lucky...

468
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:35,108
great, and if I don't...

469
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:43,503
It's been sweet.

470
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,500
It's going to stay sweet.

471
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:50,485
You understand,
we'll need to do a psych evaluation?

472
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,720
How many times do we
have to tell you?

473
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,626
He wasn't trying
to kill himself.

474
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:56,430
It was an accident.

475
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,449
They're just trying
to do their job, hon.

476
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,260
Well, no.
Their job is to make you better.

477
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:01,162
Where were you when
the gun went off?

478
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:05,864
I was in the next room,
and I heard the shot and it was awful.

479
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,364
It's over now.

480
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,052
Why didn't you call 9-1-1?

481
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:13,197
'Cause he was only unconscious
for a moment, and then--

482
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:16,112
then he was--he was
walking and talking and...

483
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,351
- We're going to have to give a report to the police.
- The police?

484
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,219
What--what do we need to
talk to the police about?

485
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:23,042
We have to report any
gunshot wounds to the police.

486
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:23,967
It's the law.

487
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,518
You're officially A.W.O.L.,
you know.

488
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:40,238
I'm working, trying to figure out what's
going on with the crazy woman in four.

489
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,888
You are the crazy
woman on four.

490
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,269
I made a break for freedom.

491
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:44,628
Will you hand me
that dictionary?

492
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:50,117
Unh. You have a better patient than me,
and you don't even have a patient.

493
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:54,463
Meredith's got a C.F. case, Alex has got
the gunshot wound, Izzie's got the mystery arrhythmias.

494
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,157
I'm not a nanny.

495
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:59,187
I'm a surgeon, a cutter.

496
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:00,401
But, no.

497
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:05,090
I'm gettin' fake labs for fake
patients so she can do a fake surgery.

498
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:09,335
She's faking it.

499
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,469
It's real to her.
It's Alzheimer's.

500
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:14,981
The missionary. Kalpana.

501
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:18,761
Oh. God. Oh. Thank you.

502
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,133
Ow.

503
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,570
Uncalled for.

504
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,706
- Hey, Izzie, how have her studies been?
- Hey, I have been looking for that everywhere.

505
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,230
Negative, right?

506
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,623
Oh, the echo tests showed
mild mitral stenosis.

507
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,806
The tilt test was negative.

508
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:34,999
We're doing E.P. studies.

509
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:38,052
I can tell you what's wrong with her
without sticking electrodes in her heart.

510
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:39,824
Really? Just by the chart.

511
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:41,610
No, from the pill she took.

512
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:42,614
They were
contraceptives, Cristina.

513
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:45,697
Why are you so obsessed with this?
Just go back to bed.

514
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:47,295
I think she's doing
this to herself.

515
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:50,156
You think she's inducing ventricular arrhythmias?
She'd have to be crazy to do that.

516
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:52,586
No, no, no, no.
She'd have to have Munchausen's.

517
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,665
Okay, wait. You think she's secretly
ingesting something to produce real symptoms?

518
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:57,838
Seriously?

519
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:59,759
Yep. Just run it by Burke
and tell me what he thinks.

520
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,129
Tell him yourself.
He's standin' right behind you.

521
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,590
Dr. Burke.

522
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,314
Where are we?

523
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:17,707
O.R. 2 in 30 minutes.
He's prepped. Transpo's on the way.

524
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,206
Do you understand that?
21 years.

525
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,379
What's that all about?

526
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:25,490
I love you, okay?

527
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:26,518
I forgive you.

528
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:28,053
You cheated on me.

529
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:29,529
You cheated on me,

530
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:32,055
- and you do not get to play the martyr here.
- I got a bullet in my head.

531
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:35,237
- And that doesn't make us even.
- You shot me.

532
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:37,531
I think we need to get the
police up here right now.

533
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:40,632
I mean,
she obviously loves the patient role.

534
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:42,127
I mean,
she practically lives in hospitals.

535
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:47,409
And--and we're like an imaginary family
to her because her real family blows her off

536
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,582
to go take care of other people,
and I saw her take something.

537
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:51,953
It's not enough.

538
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:53,888
We have to rule out everything else,
everything physical.

539
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:55,601
She even lied about her job.

540
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,366
She's a pharmacy tech,
not a PHD.

541
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,560
So she's a liar.

542
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:00,063
I've been lied to before.

543
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,276
Hey, we're not
talking about us here.

544
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:05,478
Maybe we should be.

545
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,441
- I didn't lie.
- You withheld the truth.

546
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,184
- How do I know--
- Okay, you know what?

547
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:12,152
I distinctly remember you breaking things
off with me, and you didn't seem so upset about it.

548
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:13,936
Okay, this--this is not--

549
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:15,107
this is not a relationship.

550
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,912
- This is not real.
- Cristina.

551
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:20,429
Okay, and--and so what's with the big,
fake display of hurt and drama?

552
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,462
- Cristina.
- I'm supposed to be in bed.

553
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,707
Cristina.

554
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,778
Officers, thanks for coming.

555
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:41,961
Ma'am, why don't
you have a seat?

556
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,321
We need to ask you
a few questions.

557
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:46,163
Oh, um, of course.

558
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:50,042
Well, nothing like a domestic
dispute to liven up a pre-op, huh?

559
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:55,242
Where do I sign?

560
00:27:54,894 --> 00:27:57,075
Here for consent...

561
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:03,030
and here for D.N.R.
and no extraordinary measures.

562
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,336
Good. Okay, lift up for me.

563
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:13,966
Ow. You should probably
call my parents.

564
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,162
Call 'em yourself when
you walk out of here.

565
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:29,821
Dr. Grey, I have those labs...
oh, no, you didn't.

566
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:31,616
You lost her again?

567
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,058
Again?

568
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:34,771
I am a surgeon.

569
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,393
A surgeon.

570
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:40,708
Yeah, well, you won't be when Dr. Webber
finds out you lost Ellis Grey again.

571
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:47,803
We're using three
different catheters.

572
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,608
Why are we doin' that,
Dr. Stevens?

573
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:52,443
Programmed electrical stimulation
maps the heart's electrical system

574
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:54,739
- to find the focus of the irregular--
- Um, Doctors?

575
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,590
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Yes.

576
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,696
Her urine's blue.

577
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:01,004
What?

578
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:05,660
Why is her urine blue?

579
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,876
- She says she has a surgery scheduled with Dr. Shepherd.
- I turned my back for five minutes.

580
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:12,967
Why did you turn
your back at all?

581
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:14,774
I told you to take care of her.

582
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,085
Just get out of here.

583
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:23,833
You want to find a hot surgery,
then find one.

584
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,701
You're free.

585
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:27,974
I'll take care of her.

586
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:37,744
This is one sick bastard.

587
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:39,168
Should flip him over
and give him a spine.

588
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:41,458
Pull back on the retractor,
Dr. Karev.

589
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:42,911
A little suction?

590
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,079
Covering for his wife
after she shot him.

591
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,531
He did cheat on her.

592
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:48,793
Yeah, and that guilt's
worth a bullet in the head?

593
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:51,802
Relationships are
built on sacrifice.

594
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,360
Not that kind of sacrifice.

595
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,512
Mm, I don't know.

596
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,035
Sometimes, the
bullet's worth it.

597
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:08,374
Oh, Richard.

598
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:10,773
I thought you'd never get here.

599
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:12,705
Look, the O.R.'s empty.

600
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,770
I have a little time
before my surgery.

601
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,230
I don't think I'm
supposed to be here.

602
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,968
No.

603
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,015
No, you're not.

604
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:41,436
Come on.
I'll take you back to your room.

605
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,934
I need more traction, Dr. Grey.

606
00:30:57,777 --> 00:30:59,915
Here. Give me some
suction there.

607
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,511
Now, Grey,
retract the duodenum.

608
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:06,804
Good. How's he doin'?

609
00:31:06,652 --> 00:31:08,670
Harder to ventilate.
No urine output since we started.

610
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,019
He's shutting down.

611
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:11,710
Did you increase
his peak pressures?

612
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,172
Any higher,
it'll blow his lungs.

613
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,577
Bradycardia.

614
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,182
Pushing 1 of atropine.

615
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,909
Try ventilating him manually
see if he starts coming back up.

616
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:23,191
Did we miss any bleeders?

617
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:24,666
The surgical field is clear.

618
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,899
Agonal rhythm.

619
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,270
Any pulse with that?

620
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:28,764
No carotid.

621
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:30,009
Okay, starting C.P.R.

622
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:31,348
Push 1 of epi.

623
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,455
No extraordinary measures,
Dr. Bailey. He's D.N.R.

624
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:35,155
This is just good medicine.

625
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:40,861
Blue urine?

626
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:44,118
A second drug screen was
positive for amitriptyline.

627
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:47,926
Which, I'm sure you know,
causes ventricular arrhythmias.

628
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,790
You knew it wouldn't show up
on a routine drug screen,

629
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,554
but I'm guessing you didn't realize
it would turn your urine blue.

630
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,577
I didn't do this to myself.

631
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:56,675
You have to believe me.
I'm sick.

632
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:57,660
I'm sick.

633
00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:58,959
- I have something--
- No.

634
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:00,714
You're just
deceiving yourself...

635
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:05,517
manufacturing things that really aren't
there, seeing only what you want to see...

636
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:10,289
wasting our time, our resources
and throwin' away your own life.

637
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,751
Your illness is in
your head, Kalpana.

638
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,865
We will be transferring
you to psych.

639
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:20,873
Come on.

640
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:24,526
Come on, don't give up.

641
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:26,030
Come on.

642
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:27,056
You're getting tired.

643
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:28,178
Let me take over, Dr. Bailey.

644
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,568
Dr. Bailey,
his intestines are cyanotic.

645
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:41,373
There is no blood circulating.

646
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:42,843
It's being shunted to his
brain where he needs it.

647
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:44,695
You call those compressions?

648
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,002
1, 2, 3...

649
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:54,025
Fight it.

650
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:55,476
Come on.

651
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,725
Why isn't anyone moving?

652
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,551
Who's recording?

653
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:07,955
It's been ten minutes since
we've had a perfusing rhythm.

654
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,491
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

655
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,513
Asystole.

656
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,235
Time of death--19:26.

657
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:37,351
It's hard to accept the
end when you're too close.

658
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,165
Look.

659
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,341
I don't want someone who
doesn't want me, Meredith,

660
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,162
but if there's the slightest
chance that he does...

661
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,695
I'm not leaving Seattle.

662
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,418
What'd she tell 'em?

663
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:13,107
That you cheated on her, that she was
drunk, you were cleaning your guns in the kitchen.

664
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:16,054
- I'm not gonna press charges.
- It doesn't matter. She confessed.

665
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:17,749
Assault in the first degree.

666
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:19,459
They arrested her?

667
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:21,577
Man, you should be grateful.

668
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:22,883
You know what I am?

669
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,052
I'm stupid.

670
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:28,987
Nothin' would make you feel more stupid
than cheating on the woman you love.

671
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:31,054
You don't know what
you're missin'.

672
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:48,130
Your latte is by your bed,
and I'm pretty sure it's cold.

673
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:49,427
I don't need it.

674
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,281
- You should be in bed.
- Stop it.

675
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:55,831
I'm fine, okay? My brain is fine,
my body's fine, I'm fine.

676
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,334
I don't know why I came.

677
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,516
Then why did you?

678
00:35:58,394 --> 00:35:59,556
You know, I'm--

679
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,748
you know, just stop it.

680
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:02,678
I don't--I'm sorry
I'm not that person.

681
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:05,416
I'm sorry I don't--I don't need
you here taking care of me.

682
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,147
Well?

683
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,329
You were right.

684
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,725
Kalpana definitely
suffers from Munchausen's.

685
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,946
See? I was right.

686
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,793
I was right.

687
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,731
I was right.

688
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,323
I was right.

689
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,411
I was...

690
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:27,737
right. I was right.

691
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:30,625
Oh, I was--I was...

692
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:35,553
I was right. I was...

693
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,549
I'm right. I'm...

694
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:47,193
You took the clinical skills section of
your medical board exams after most interns.

695
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:49,370
So the results are
only now coming out.

696
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,305
I got a call from U.S.M.L.E.
this morning.

697
00:36:56,249 --> 00:37:00,392
Oh. So you're--
you're saying...

698
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,199
Karev, you're still an M.D.

699
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,284
You still get to
practice medicine.

700
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:07,179
The hospital grants you four
months to retake the exam.

701
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:09,763
You study it, you pass it,
you put it behind you.

702
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,808
One misstep doesn't
affect your career.

703
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,692
Yeah. Right, right, right.

704
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:14,824
Thanks. Thanks.

705
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,949
What happens, uh, if I--if I take the
exam for a second time and I don't pass?

706
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,529
You will no longer be a surgical
resident at Seattle Grace.

707
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:25,126
Failing again is not an option.

708
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:01,105
What's going on?

709
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:03,344
I can't stop. I can't.

710
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:06,049
- I can't stop.
- Crying.

711
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:08,177
- She can't stop crying.
- I can see that.

712
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,252
- What did you guys do to her?
- Nothing.

713
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,265
She's going to dehydrate.

714
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:14,246
Cristina, do you
want some water?

715
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:17,026
No. No. No.

716
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:18,538
- No!
- No!

717
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,617
I already tried that.

718
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,728
It just made it worse.

719
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:25,685
I knew she'd break sooner or later.
Just a matter of time.

720
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:28,217
I will kill her!

721
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,619
I am her mother.

722
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:32,558
We don't do well
with mothers here.

723
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:34,738
Why don't you leave
and come back later?

724
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:38,058
Cristina.

725
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:39,905
Make--make it stop.

726
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,367
Make it stop.

727
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,433
Somebody sedate me!

728
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:53,974
Sometimes, reality has a way of
sneaking up and biting us in the ass...

729
00:38:56,704 --> 00:39:00,375
and when the dam bursts,
all you can do is swim.

730
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,392
The world of pretend is a cage,
not a cocoon.

731
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,348
We can only lie to
ourselves for so long.

732
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,977
We are tired.

733
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:34,741
We are scared.

734
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,490
Denying it doesn't
change the truth.

735
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,827
Hi. M-Mrs. Tate?

736
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:52,891
It's Miranda.

737
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:54,385
Miranda Bailey.

738
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:59,687
I'm calling about Jeremiah.

739
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,330
I'm so sorry.

740
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:47,318
She doesn't want to be touched.

741
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:01,979
Shh, shh...

742
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:17,124
Sooner or later,
we have to put aside our denial

743
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:22,601
and face the world head-on,
guns blazing.

744
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

745
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,789
- You look great.
- Thanks.

746
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,915
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you ready to go?

747
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,738
Yeah, are you--you just--

748
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:41,669
you don't seem like yourself.

749
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:44,366
No. Uh, look,
we got dinner reservations.

750
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,891
We should go. So, uh...

751
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:47,561
- let's go.
- Okay.

752
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:51,846
Denial--it's not just
a river in Egypt.

753
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:53,692
It's a freaking ocean.

754
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,690
I'm glad we're doing this.

755
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,833
- Me, too. Want a drink?
- Yes.

756
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:02,253
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

757
00:42:12,284 --> 00:42:15,763
So how do you keep
from drowning in it?
