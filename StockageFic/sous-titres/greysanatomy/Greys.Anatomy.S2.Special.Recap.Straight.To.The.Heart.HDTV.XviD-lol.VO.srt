1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,500
okay,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,500
so this is the story of five surgical interns...

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,200
all of them fresh out of med school,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,100
all of them pretty smart,

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,700
all of them very driven

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,300
and all of them just maybe a little scared.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,900
Of course, it's not always about the medicine.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,500
Ugh!
You have to go.
I'm late.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,800
Which isn't what you wanna be
on your first day of work, so...

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,700
so, uh,
you actually live here?

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,800
You know what? We don't
have to do the thing.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh. We can do
anything you want.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,100
No, the thing... exchange
the details, pretend we care.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Good-bye...

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,500
uh...

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,000
derek.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,600
Derek.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
Right. Meredith.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,300
Bye, derek.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
The seven years you spend here
as a surgical resident

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
will be the best and worst
of your life.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,100
You will be pushed
to the breaking point.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,500
Look around you.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,200
Say hello to your competition.

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,600
Only 6 women out of 20.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,200
Yeah.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,900
I hear one of them is a model.

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,200
Seriously, that's gonna help
with the respect thing?

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
You're cristina, right?

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Which resident are you
assigned to? I've got bailey.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
The nazi? Me, too.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
You got the nazi?
So did i?

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,500
At least we'll be
tortured together, right?

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm george. O'malley.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Uh, we met at the, uh,
at the mixer.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,600
You had on a black dress

37
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,300
with a slit up the side
and strappy sandals and...

38
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,400
now you think i'm gay.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Uh, no, i'm not gay.
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
It's... it's just that, uh...

41
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,200
(miranda) o'malley, yang,
grey, stevens.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's the nazi?

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
(george) i thought the nazi
would be a guy.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
I thought the nazi
would be... a nazi.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,300
Maybe it's
professional jealousy.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Maybe she's brilliant

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,400
and they call her a nazi
because they're jealous.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Maybe she's nice.

49
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,100
Let me guess,
you're the model.

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,300
Hi, i'm isobel stevens,
but everyone calls me izzie.

51
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,000
Rule number one,
don't bother sucking up.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,900
I already hate you.
That's not gonna change.

53
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,300
Your first shift starts now
and lasts 48 hours.

54
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,000
You're interns,
grunts, nobodies,

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,300
bottom of
the surgical food chain.

56
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,400
You run labs, write orders,
work every second night

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,100
until you drop
and don't complain.

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,400
No one holds a scalpel

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,700
till i'm so happy
i'm mary freakin' poppins.

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,600
If you make
your resident look bad,

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,500
she'll torture you until
you beg for your mama.

62
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Now get out there

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,200
and don't let me catch you
fighting over patients.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stop.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,600
No.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Oh, mine.

67
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,400
No, i saw him first.

68
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

69
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,200
Katie's parents
have questions.

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
Do you talk to them
or do i ask burke?

71
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
No, burke's off the case.

72
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,300
Katie belongs to
the new attending now...

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,900
dr. Shepherd.He's over there.

74
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
Unfortunately,

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
on your first day,

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,600
the surprises aren't always going to be... 

77
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,000
surgical.

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,900
Meredith,

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
could i talk
to you for a second?

80
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Actually, i was...

81
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,900
i'm not the girl in the bar
anymore, and you're not the guy.

82
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
You took advantage of me and now
you want to forget about it.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,600
I did not take...

84
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
i was drunk, vulnerable
and good-looking,

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and you took advantage.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Okay, i was the one
who was drunk,

87
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
and you are not
that good-looking.

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Maybe not today.

89
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,900
Last night? Last night
i was very good-looking.

90
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,000
I had my red shirt on,
my good-looking shirt.

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
You took advantage.

92
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,800
I did not take advantage.

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
You wanna take advantage again,

94
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,200
say friday night?

95
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop looking at me
like that.

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Like what?

97
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
Like you've seen me naked.

98
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
(preston)
Good afternoon, interns.

99
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
As you know, the honor
of performing the first surgery

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
is reserved for the intern
that shows the most promise.

101
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
George o'malley.
Me?

102
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Congratulations.

103
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,300
(man) he's gonna faint.
He's a fainter.

104
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,300
Nah, code brown,
right in his pants.

105
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,100
He's all about the flop sweat,
gonna sweat himself unsterile.

106
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
10 bucks says
he messes up the mcburney.

107
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,700
$15 says he cries.

108
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll put $20
on a total meltdown.

109
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,100
$50 says he pulls
the whole thing off.

110
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
That's one of us down there,

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the first one of us.

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,500
Where's your loyalty?

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
$75 says he can't even
i.d. The appendix.

114
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,100
I'll take that action.

115
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay, o'malley,
let's see what you can do.

116
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
(george) scalpel.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,700
(woman) scalpel.

118
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,100
(cheering)

119
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
(man) o'malley!

120
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
(preston) let's invert
the stump into the cecum

121
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,300
and simultaneously
pull up on the purse strings.

122
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,100
But be careful not to...

123
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
break them.

124
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh, man.
You ripped the cecum.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Get out of the way!
Pansy-ass idiot.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Get him out of here.

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,400
He's 007.
(man) 007, yeah.

128
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,900
(man)
Yep, a total 007.

129
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,200
What's 007 mean?
Licensed to kill.

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Maybe i should've gone
into geriatrics.

131
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,800
No one minds when you
kill an old person.

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Geriatrics is for freaks
who live with their mothers

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
and never have sex.

134
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I have gotta get
my own place.

135
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,300
I'll work with you, but i
don't want in on the surgery.

136
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,200
You can have it.

137
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you kidding?

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,100
It's the biggest opportunity
any intern will ever get.

139
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't want to spend
any more time

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
with shepherd than i have to.

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,100
What do you have against shepherd?

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,200
You can't comment, make a face
or react in any way.

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,300
We had sex.

144
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,300
Dr. Shepherd, you said that

145
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,000
you'd pick someone
to scrub in if we helped?

146
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Oh, yes, right.

147
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,400
Um, i'm sorry
i can't take you both,

148
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
but it's gonna be
a full house.

149
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,900
Meredith, i'll see you
in o.r.

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,300
Oh, screw you. I don't get
picked for surgeries

151
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,100
'cause i slept with my boss.

152
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,100
There is a reason we don't
sleep with the attendings.

153
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,300
It's not her fault,

154
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,200
He's the attending.
He should know better.

155
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
He's taking advantage of her.

156
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,100
What is your problem?

157
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,700
Um, you.

158
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,300
'Cause apparently
you can help dr. Mcdreamy

159
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,000
in ways the rest of us can't.

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can't do me favors.
Okay.

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
I can take care of myself.

162
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Look, i'm not being seen
with you in this hospital.

163
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,500
Think of it as an attending

164
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
getting to know
one of his interns.

165
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
He slept with the intern.
Barely knew her.

166
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,800
And it should stay that way.
You want me to be professional?

167
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Nice talking to you,
dr. Grey.

168
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
(izzie) why do you
put up posters for roommates

169
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,200
if you don't want roommates?
I do want roommates.

170
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,800
We're together 100 hours a week.
You wanna live together, too?

171
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,900
My mom irons my scrubs.
I have to get out of there.

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,700
I can cook
and i'm an obsessive cleaner.

173
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,400
Look, i'm sure
you're very nice,

174
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,700
but i'm very particular
about who lives in my house

175
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,500
and you're just not right.

176
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,700
Look, i'm quiet...
no loud music, no parties.

177
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Where were you when
the "challenger" exploded?

178
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,800
The what?

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Exactly. No.

180
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
Okay, fine,
george and izzie,

181
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,400
you can move into the house.

182
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Yes!

183
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,300
I can't believe she caved!

184
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Aah!

185
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
George's room is bigger
than mine.

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
I got here first.
It's meredith's house.She should decide.

187
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm not riding
in the same car with him.

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
Unless you're going like that,
you're not riding with me.

189
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,200
Where are the tampons?
He didn't buy them.

190
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,500
You didn't buy them?

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
I am a man!

192
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,400
I don't buy girl products.

193
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want you walking in
while i'm in the shower,

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and i don't want to see you
in your underwear.

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you like izzie?
Is that what this is about?

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Do you have a crush on izzie?

197
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
N... izzie, no?
I don't like izzie.

198
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
She's not the one
i'm attracted to.

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,300
Not the one?So there's a one?
This is not...

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
you know, you're not
the only one to put things off.

201
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I mean, i never do anything
till the last possible minute.

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Like what?

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,500
I've had this thing
for my roommate since,

204
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,900
like, day one, and i just...

205
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
i can't tell her.

206
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
You know, she probably wouldn't
go out with me anyway,

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,500
but how do know that for sure

208
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,400
if i don't ever ask?

209
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,400
Seriously?

210
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,200
You're equating
your pathetic love life

211
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,500
with my record-breaking tumor?

212
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,700
Seriously?

213
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,300
After dealing with all that life and death,

214
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,000
where does a doctor go to unwind?

215
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
They come to see me at my bar,

216
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
right across the street from the hospital.

217
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I know that look.

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Can only be
one of two things...

219
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,700
either your boss is giving
you hell or your boyfriend is.

220
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Which is it?
My boyfriend is my boss.

221
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,500
This one is on the house.

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm not going out with you,

223
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
i'm not dating you,

224
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,700
and i'm definitely not
sleeping with you again.

225
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,800
You're my boss.
I'm your boss' boss.

226
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Look, i'm drawing a line.

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
The line is drawn.

228
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,100
So this line...
is it imaginary

229
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,700
or do i need to get you
a marker?

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
male, 55, victim of
a head-on collision.

231
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Mistakes... they happen.

232
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
And imagine what happens

233
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,100
with doctors who aren't that experienced.

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Just one more reason i'm glad i'm a bartender.

235
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
(meredith) i popped a glove.

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
(preston) what?
I think
i may have nicked her heart.

237
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Your ass is on the line here,
dr. Grey.

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
You've done this before, right?
Of course.

239
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Millions of times.

240
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,700
2 of ativan.
He started seizing.

241
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,700
How much sodium did you give him?
100 cc over 4 hours.

242
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,000
Actually, doctor, you ordered
500 cc per hour over 4 hours.

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Why didn't you do a follow-up?
I gave you one thing to do.

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Karev, it's over, it's done.
You screwed up.

245
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,700
Deal with it.

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,900
We stole a body.

247
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,000
The thing about being dead is
people stop looking for you.

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You brought a textbook?

249
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah. Okay, got it.

250
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,200
You sure?
It's not like we can kill him twice.

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Don't even tell me you're doin'
what i think you're doin'.

252
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,700
Who here feels like they have
no idea what they're doing?

253
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
Morning, dr. Model.

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,300
Dr. Evil spawn.

255
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,600
Ooh, nice tat.

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
They airbrush that out
for the catalogues?

257
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,600
I don't know.

258
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,300
What do they do for the 6-6-6
on your skull?

259
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,400
I'd know you anywhere.

260
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
You're the spitting image
of your mother.

261
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,800
(cristina)you know
meredith is inbred?

262
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Like it's uncommon
around here to be a doctor

263
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
whose parents are doctors?
No, really inbred.Her mother is ellis grey.

264
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,100
Shut up. "the" ellis grey?
Who's ellis grey?

265
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
El... the grey method?

266
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,400
Where'd you go
to med school, mexico?

267
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,100
She was one of the first
big chick surgeons.

268
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,800
I mean, she practically invented
the abdominal retractor.

269
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
She's a living legend.
She won the harper-avery, twice.

270
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
Well, the ellis grey i know

271
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,600
didn't have regards for anyone
except ellis grey.

272
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,400
But you know that already,
don't you?

273
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Where is she now?

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,700
Traveling.

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Traveling?

276
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,800
Yeah.

277
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,700
Huh.

278
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,700
So we're kissing,
but we're not dating?

279
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
I have no idea
what that was about.

280
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,400
Is it gonna happen again?

281
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
'Cause if it is,
i need to bring breath mints,

282
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
(whispers) put a condom in my wallet.
Shut up now.

283
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Well, well, well.

284
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
Dr. Bethany whisper.

285
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,500
That's so nice.

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,600
Thank you.

287
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,400
What?

288
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,300
It's the chase, isn't it?

289
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,400
What?

290
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
The thrill of the chase.

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,700
I've been wondering to myself,
why are you so hell-bent

292
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,900
on getting me to go out
with you?

293
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,500
You know you're my boss,
you know it's against the rules,

294
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,000
you know i keep saying no.

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,900
It's the chase.

296
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
But it's fun, isn't it?

297
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,800
Izzie.

298
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,500
George.

299
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Le...
stop.

300
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
(whistling and cheering)

301
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,400
Shh. Shh. Shh.

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
(whispers) we have
bethany whisper

303
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,200
in our locker room.

304
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
(normal voice) oh, boy,
i guess they do, uh,

305
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,200
airbrush out the tattoo,
don't they?

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,300
Fine.

307
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
Let's look at that tattoo
up close and personal,

308
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,500
shall we?

309
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
And what are these?
Oh, my g! Breasts.

310
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,300
Gather around
and check out the booty

311
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,100
that put izzie stevens
through med school.

312
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,700
You want to call me
dr. Model?

313
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
That's fine.

314
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
Just remember
that while you're sitting

315
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,100
on 200 grand of student loans,

316
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,400
i'm out of debt.

317
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Go!

318
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,900
(cristina) come on.
Let's bag her.

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
Push epi and atropine.

320
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,700
Somebody page burke.

321
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,000
One and two and three...
breathe.

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,500
She's d.n.r.

323
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,200
One, two, three...
she's d.n.r.

324
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,300
Do not resuscitate.
Dr. Yang.

325
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,800
Come on, people.
Push another...

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
do not resuscitate.
All right!

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
It is on her chart.
All right!

328
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,300
Let her go down.

329
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Yea-ye...
let her go down.

330
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
We have to let her go.

331
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Just coffee.

332
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,200
It's not the chase.

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,600
What?

334
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,100
You and me...

335
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
it is not the thrill of the chase.

336
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
It's not a game.

337
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,500
It's...

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
(meredith) i'm still not going out with you.

339
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,300
Listen to me.

340
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,900
What?

341
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,700
You should probably
sneak inside now.

342
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,100
We've done enough
sneaking for the night.

343
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
It was good sneaking,
but enough sneaking.

344
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, i'd say
we're pretty good sneakers.

345
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You mind moving
this tail wagon?

346
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,100
You're blocking me in.

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Late night, grey?

348
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
And while we're
on the subject,

349
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
you care to tell me what
you think you're doing?

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Look, i'll jump through hoops
if you want me to,

351
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,000
but what i do when i leave
this hospital is my business.

352
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Half this hospital
knows your business.

353
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
I made a choice,

354
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
and i know you don't
respect me for that choice,

355
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
so whatever else you got,
bring it on.

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
(all) eww!

357
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,800
Thanks for the coffee.

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,300
(Iranda) hey, there's
a new surgical case

359
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,600
coming up from the pit.
Let's go.

360
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
(ellis) watch it!
Hands off me!

361
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,900
I could report you to the chief,
and you'd be out on your ass!

362
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,700
(cristina)
Patient's name is, uh...
where is the chief?

363
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,200
Complaining of intermittent
cramping, pain and diarrhea.

364
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,900
Also suffers from...
alzheimer's.

365
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,700
(miranda) patient's name?

366
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,700
Um...

367
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,600
come on, yang.
The patient's name.

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,300
What the hell
are you doing here?

369
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Ellis grey.

370
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,600
(george) meredith's mother.

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,800
George,
take care of dr. Grey.

372
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,900
Yes. She needs a friend
right now.

373
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,900
Oh, you mean

374
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,400
ellis, the...

375
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,600
mother.

376
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
Dr. Grey.

377
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,100
Goddamn it, thatcher.
I'm at work.

378
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,000
I've already told you, i'm
too busy to deal with you now.

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
No more cartoons.
Darling, i'm not in the mood

380
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,500
to play doctor now.
Hands off. I'm busy.

381
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,100
Damn it, thatch,
i mean it. No!

382
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Who's thatch?

383
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,500
My dad.

384
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Funny, you... you do look
a bit like thatcher.

385
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
But... i look like
meredith's dad?

386
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
It looks like you'll be able
to go home today, ellis.

387
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,200
You should know, i'm thinking
of leaving thatcher.

388
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
I'll leave him,
you leave adele.

389
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,900
Why don't you get her meds
ready for discharge, nurse?

390
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,200
Thank you.

391
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,500
Ellis...

392
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,200
that was a long time ago,
remember?

393
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
We had this discussion
21 years ago.

394
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,800
Think about it, richard.
We should make the break now.

395
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
We could end up
at opposite ends of the country.

396
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
It'll be too late.

397
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,900
And if old flames aren't enough of a problem,

398
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,100
there's always new flames to deal with.

399
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,700
It's just that i hardly know
anything about you.

400
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
You know i'm from new york,
you know i like ferry boats.

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Enough with the ferry boats.
What about your friends?

402
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,900
I'm a surgeon.
I don't have friends.

403
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
What are
your grandparents names?
I don't have grandparents.

404
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,200
Where did you grow up?

405
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,300
What's your favorite flavor
of ice cream?

406
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,700
What is your problem?

407
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,600
We're having sex every night.
I think i deserve details.

408
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
And until i get them,
my pants are staying on.

409
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
Or you could
just roll with it,

410
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
be flexible,
see what happens.

411
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm not flexible.

412
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,300
Ah, there, i disagree.

413
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,500
We'll find these things out.

414
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,000
That's the fun part,
you know?

415
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,100
That's the gravy.

416
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You're using up
my oxygen, o'malley.

417
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
How does a pompous,
cocky jackass like you

418
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,100
always have women
all over him?

419
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,700
O'malley...
you think too much.

420
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Can't you see it?

421
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,000
You gotta dance and jab.
Dance and jab.

422
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,300
Like me.

423
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:28,200
I am the ali of this place.

424
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,700
Smooth moves, doctor.

425
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I kicked ass.

426
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,300
This, uh, is george.

427
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,100
George has a hot date.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
It's kind of located
in a, you know,

429
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,700
a private...
you're a doctor, george.

430
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,500
It's called a penis.

431
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
You have a rash on your penis?

432
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,100
So?

433
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Dude, you've got syphilis.

434
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

435
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,200
It's a shot of penicillin,
george.

436
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,700
Be grateful
i'm even doing this.

437
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,600
I've already seen more of you
than i ever wanted to.

438
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,500
I cannot believe this.

439
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,700
Meredith, go away!

440
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,500
Oh, george.

441
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm indisposed here.

442
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,700
George, it's not
a big deal.

443
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,700
And you have a cute butt.

444
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,000
(alex) be my guest.
Wh... alex?

445
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,900
Hey.

446
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Ah, what are
we doing here?

447
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,700
Breaking george's spirit.

448
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,600
Mr. Franklin's procedure's
been scheduled for after lu...

449
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,200
what?!

450
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Oh, what are we doing?

451
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,700
We are saving george from
a future of festering sores

452
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,800
and insanity.

453
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Hmm. Cute butt.
Told ya.

454
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
It is cute,
like a baby's.

455
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,300
(cristina) mm-hmm.

456
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,100
You know, i have spent hours,
days, years,

457
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
imagining myself half naked
in a room with three women.

458
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,100
The reality
is so much better.

459
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Where are we?

460
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Shh. I'm gonna tell you.

461
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,100
All right, my mother's
maiden name... maloney.

462
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I have four sisters.

463
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
I have, um, nine nieces,

464
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,200
five nephews.

465
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
I like coffee ice cream,

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
and i live in that trailer.

467
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,700
So that's it.

468
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,300
That's all you've earned
for now.

469
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
The rest, you're just...

470
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,300
just gonna have to take
on faith.

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,400
I really needed that.

472
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,400
Thanks.

473
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is this, uh...

474
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
should we talk about this?

475
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
(sighs) yeah, definitely.

476
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,500
When we started dating,

477
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,700
i was already
kind of seeing someone.

478
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,600
I didn't know how much
i'd like you,

479
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,300
and when i realized,

480
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,100
i broke it off
with the other guy and...

481
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,600
other guy?

482
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
Who's the other guy?

483
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,200
You and alex?

484
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
You and alex?

485
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,700
You gave me syphilis!

486
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
(meredith) george!
(cristina) george!

487
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,100
Meredith, i am so sorry.

488
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,200
Hi, i'm addison shepherd.

489
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,600
Shepherd?

490
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,300
And you must be the woman
who's been screwing my husband?

491
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,600
Just wait.

492
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,400
We should discuss this.

493
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,700
Here's a thought...
no. Quit following me.

494
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
At least let me explain.

495
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,100
Explain? You know when
you should've explained?

496
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,900
The night we met in the bar,
before any of the rest of it.

497
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
I know how you feel.
Do you?

498
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,900
Somehow i doubt that,

499
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
because if you did,
you would shut up

500
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,200
and you would turn around
and go back inside

501
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
because you would realize
that i am this close

502
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,300
to getting in my car
and running you down

503
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,100
in the parking lot!

504
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
If you came out here
to try to win me back,

505
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,800
you can forget about it.
I did.

506
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
I flew all the way
across the country

507
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,900
to reminisce over
wedding photos, get drunk,

508
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,300
fall into bed

509
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,500
and ma you realize
you can't live without me.

510
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,900
Relax.
I'm here for work.

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
Here's the thing about hospitals

512
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
and the people who work in them,

513
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,200
the complications are not just surgical.

514
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,100
Let's play a game
of whose life sucks the most.

515
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,700
Let's not.
I'll win.

516
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
Well, you don't want
to play with me.

517
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Oh, i do.
I'll even go first.

518
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Derek's married.

519
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,400
(joe) okay.

520
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,100
George, beer is dripping
from your nostrils.

521
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,100
Told you i'd win.

522
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Nothing you could say
could top that.

523
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,700
I'm pregnant.

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,200
I win.

525
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
What are you gonna do?

526
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
You know what happens
with pregnant interns.

527
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,900
I am not switching
to the vagina squad

528
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,400
or spending my life
popping zits.

529
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm too talented.
Surgery's my life.

530
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,100
There are other options
besides termination, you know?

531
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,300
Adoption.

532
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,100
I know this is
a difficult decision.

533
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
Okay, you know,
the talking part?

534
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Mm-hmm.

535
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm not interested.

536
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,900
You look nice today.

537
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,000
Wore my new lip gloss.

538
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,900
'Cause my ex-boyfriend's wife

539
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
looks like isabella freakin' rossellini

540
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
and i'm, like...

541
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,500
me.

542
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,300
I'm trying to outdo her

543
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
when she's the victim here.

544
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
How crazy is that?

545
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Ex-ex-boyfriend?

546
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm an evil mistress.

547
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,600
E.t.t.s. Is usually
impossible to correct

548
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,900
unless you happen to be
one of a handful of surgeons

549
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,700
in the world who knows how
to separate fetal blood vessels,

550
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,200
which, luckily for you,
i am.

551
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
And dr. Grey will be back to
check on you a little bit later.

552
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,100
Actually, i'd prefer it

553
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,600
if dr. Grey were
taken off the case.

554
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
You understand.

555
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
No, no, i don't understand.

556
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,700
Well, she's sleeping
with your husband, right?

557
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,300
Ms. Phillips...

558
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,000
i lack dr. Grey's class
and patience,

559
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,700
so let me set
the record straight.

560
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
My husband didn't cheat on me.
I cheated on him.

561
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,700
So the wronged woman here...
dr. Grey.

562
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,800
So, i think you owe her
one hell of an apology.

563
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
So i go upstairs

564
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,700
and i step on a man's jacket
that doesn't belong to me.

565
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,300
It's a jacket
that i recognize.

566
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,300
And what i know now is that
when i go into my bedroom,

567
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,000
i'm not just gonna see
that my wife is cheating on me.

568
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,900
I'm gonna see that my wife
is cheating on me with mark,

569
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,600
who happened to be
my best friend.

570
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
I left, i came out here.

571
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,400
And you met me.

572
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
And i met you.

573
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,700
It'll be years
before i retire.

574
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,600
Chief of surgery is mine.
Chief of surgery is mine.

575
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,300
It was yours,
now i'm not so sure.

576
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,600
I am the best surgeon at grace
with the lowest mortality rate.

577
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,100
You can't just bring
some guy in from...

578
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,900
now ask me why i'm not
so sure about you.

579
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,300
You wanna be chief?
You put the job first.

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Hey, um, do you still have
those reservations?

581
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,100
'Cause i'm starving.

582
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,000
Cristina, i think there's
something we should discuss.

583
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

584
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's pretty clear.

585
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,800
It is?

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,300
We've been fooling ourselves,

587
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
to think that we could
continue like this

588
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
without consequences.

589
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh, you're ending this?

590
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,700
It's nothing personal.

591
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,100
He dumped me.

592
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,900
You realize
this constitutes hugging?

593
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,300
Shut up.

594
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,800
(cristina) what is she doing?

595
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
She's hanging out
with alex.

596
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
Why?

597
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,000
I think
they might be friends.

598
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,700
Do another one.

599
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
Make the lambs
stop screaming.

600
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,700
(izzie) yeah, i know.
I know.

601
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,100
You guys hate him. Fine.

602
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,900
Yeah, we do.

603
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,000
But i just want to say
that...

604
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
that he's different
once you get to know him.

605
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,400
Izzie, would you like
to go out with me tonight

606
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,300
on a date?

607
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,200
You wear something gorgeous,
i pay for food.

608
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Are you making fun of me?

609
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,500
I'm not making fun of you.

610
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,800
Okay, then.

611
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,500
Good.

612
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,700
Good.

613
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,000
Yang?

614
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
What? Sorry.

615
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,400
Is my surgery interfering
with your daydreaming?

616
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,200
no.

617
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,700
Cristina.

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,500
Cristina.

619
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
(miranda) let's get her
out of here.

620
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
There's a tient
on the table. Lift.

621
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Good, good, good.

622
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
Dr. Bailey, when you get
her stabilized,

623
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
i need a report, please.
Dr. Bailey.

624
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Right, dr. Burke.

625
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,500
(addison) it was
an extrauterine pregnancy.

626
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,100
The tube burst.
She's bleeding out.

627
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
She doesn't want
to be touched.

628
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,000
how come you haven't
gotten on your broomstick

629
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,500
and gone back to new york
where you belong?

630
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Stop being petty.
Stop being an adulterous bitch.

631
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
You know you are going
to forgive me eventually, right?

632
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,100
I mean, you can't just...

633
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,000
i mean, there was a time

634
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
where you thought of me
as your best friend.

635
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,800
There was a time where i thought
you were the love of my life.

636
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,400
Things change.

637
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,900
Divorce papers?

638
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
The ball's in your court.

639
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,700
You sign, i'll sign.

640
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,100
I'll sign and be on
the first plane out of here.

641
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll sign them immediately.

642
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,600
I want you out of here
as soon as possible.

643
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,900
Derek, have you ever thought
that even if i am

644
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,500
an adulterous bitch

645
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,700
that i still might be
the love of your life?

646
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
Meredith, she gave me
divorce papers.

647
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,700
Well, that's good.

648
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,700
All i have to do is sign,
and i'm free.

649
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,700
We're free.

650
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,600
Is there anything
to think about?

651
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
No, of course not.

652
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,400
I have to read through them,
sign,

653
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,900
and then addison's on
the next plane outta here.

654
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,900
I had a good time.

655
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,000
I gotta go.

656
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Seriously?

657
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Seriously?

658
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,400
So, uh, thanks for,
you know, being there.

659
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,600
No thanks needed.

660
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,400
Okay.

661
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,900
So where are we?

662
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,000
Uh, the northeast corner
of the hospital.

663
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Oh, i'm... i'm getting back
on my feet.

664
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Fine.

665
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
That doesn't mean that...

666
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,100
cristina.

667
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,700
It's my first day back.
I've got...

668
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
i'm not waiting forever.

669
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,300
I'm glad we're doing this.

670
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,700
Me, too. Want a drink?

671
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,300
Yes.

672
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,900
 Oh.

673
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,800
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

674
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
You didn't sign
the divorce papers.

675
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,600
Fine, i get it.
End of discussion.

676
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Meredith...

677
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,300
what?

678
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
What is that?
Hey, stop it.

679
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Seriously?

680
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,800
Seriously.

681
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,400
This is a very small bed.

682
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I look fantastic.
I shaved my legs.

683
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,500
He's a brain surgeon.
How can he be so brainless?

684
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,600
Hello! Seriously.

685
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Seriously.

686
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,700
Shh.

687
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,400
Dr. Bailey...

688
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,300
henry lamott, age,
is scheduled with dr. Shepherd

689
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
for a spinal impnt

690
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
to control the pain
of his herniated disk.

691
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Is allergic
to all pain medication.

692
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,100
Is that...

693
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,400
porn.

694
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Porn? As in porn?

695
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,700
We can't have porn in here.
This is a hospital.

696
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
It's for my pain.

697
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,600
My doc says it releases
endorphins in the brain.

698
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,600
That does not look comfortable.

699
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,900
Trust me, it's not.

700
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,100
Get the hall.

701
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
(alex) hey, izzie.

702
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,900
Izzie.

703
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,600
Hey, doll fa.

704
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,600
I was gonna ask you
a favor.
No.

705
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
You haven't even heard
what i'm...
no. No.

706
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
No.No.No.

707
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
What's up with you?

708
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,100
She's really mad at you.

709
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
(alex) so, dude,
what's the deal with izzie?

710
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,000
She shaved her legs
for you.

711
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,900
And?

712
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,700
And you didn't even
kiss her good night.

713
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,000
She shaved her legs for you
and you didn't follow through?

714
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,900
Hey, i follow through.
I always follow through.

715
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,200
You didn't last night.

716
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Mind your own business.

717
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,500
Dude, we're not moving.

718
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
It's bad?
How bad is it?

719
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Two interns and a g.s.w.
To the chest.

720
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,400
(man) it's all jammed up.
We can't get it open.

721
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
How's the patient?

722
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,200
He's not looking so good.

723
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You guys are gonna have to
open up his chest.

724
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,700
How are we doing?

725
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh, can you move me
to another room?

726
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
The lights and the tv
went out.

727
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Power outage in the east wing.
They'll have it back on soon.

728
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,500
God, well, what am i gonna do?

729
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,100
You mean...

730
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,700
without my porn?

731
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sure you can find

732
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,300
some normal way
of amusing yourself.

733
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,100
No, i need my porn.

734
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,200
You're really in pain.

735
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,800
What do you think,
i'm some kind of pervert,

736
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,500
watching that stuff
in front of you?

737
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,100
Well, yes.

738
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,000
Take these.

739
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,900
Alex, come on.

740
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Alex!

741
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,500
(izzie) poor george. He doesn't
have the steadiest hands.

742
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
Izzie.
Yeah.

743
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,500
He can hear you.

744
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
O'malley...
how you doin' down there?

745
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
"Oh, yes, i'm so very,
very naughty," bianca said

746
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,300
as she, uh, dropped
her stethoscope.

747
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,800
And then there was marta...

748
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,400
(sighs) where was i?

749
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Marta.

750
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,100
Contact social services,
see if we can get

751
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,300
somebody down here
to talk to 'em.

752
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,400
Look, do you need me
for anything else work related?

753
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,000
Look, i was married
for 11 years.

754
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,400
Addison is my family.

755
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,500
That is 11 thanksgivings,
11 birthdays

756
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,400
and 11 christmases.

757
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,600
And in one day, i'm supposed
to sign a piece of paper

758
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,400
and end my family?

759
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
A person doesn't do that,
not without a little hesitation.

760
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm entitled to
a little uncertainty here.

761
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,900
Just a moment to understand
the magnitude

762
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,800
of what it means to cut
somebody out of my life.

763
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,900
I'm entitled to at least
one moment...

764
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,800
of painful doubt.

765
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,900
And a little
understanding from you

766
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
would be nice.

767
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,300
I think i can feel his heart
starting to fill more.

768
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,200
It's beating
a little stronger.

769
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,800
(preston) excellent.

770
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,100
Okay, now what?

771
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,400
That's it.

772
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's it?

773
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
O'malley.

774
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes, sir.

775
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,400
You just flew solo.

776
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,100
Way to go, george.

777
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,800
I have my finger in a heart.

778
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Very cool.

779
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,800
(meredith)Dude, you lost youmojo.

780
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,300
I have one off day...
you chickened out.

781
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,500
I hesitated briefly.

782
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,000
Why didn't you kiss izzie?

783
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,600
And now i'm leaving.

784
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
I've never had a boyfriend.

785
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,100
I've never even been kissed.

786
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Alex...

787
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,400
would you kiss me?

788
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,300
For a kiss to be really good,
you want it to mean something.

789
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,400
You want it to be with someone
you can't get out of your head.

790
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,700
You can't cheat
your first kiss.

791
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,500
Trust me.

792
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,000
What?

793
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,500
Because when you find
that right person,

794
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,100
the first kiss...

795
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
is everything.

796
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,700
Good night.

797
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Seriously.

798
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,400
So, uh,
here's where we are.

799
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I work too much,
i'm competitive,

800
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,400
i'm always right.

801
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
And i snore.

802
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,300
What?

803
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,300
I'm trying here.

804
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,900
So?

805
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Okay, we're a couple.
Whatever.

806
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,000
Don't make a big deal
about it.

807
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,000
Look...

808
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,300
i don't want someone
who doesn't want me, meredith.

809
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,500
But if there's
the slightest chance

810
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,100
that he does,

811
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,800
i'm not leaving seattle.

812
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,400
(meredith) your choice,
it's simple...

813
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
her or me.

814
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,900
Ani'm sure
she's really great,

815
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,600
but, derek, i love you...

816
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,900
in a really, really big,

817
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,500
pretend to like
your taste in music,

818
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
let you eat the last piece
of cheesecake,

819
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,100
hold a radio over my head
outside your window,

820
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,600
unfortunate way
that makes me hate you

821
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,700
love you.

822
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,700
So pick me.

823
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,300
Choose me.

824
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,600
Love me.

825
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
I'll be at joe's tonight.

826
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,000
So if you do decide
to sign the papers,

827
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,000
meet me there.

828
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,900
I actually said,
"pick me.

829
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
"Pick me"?

830
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,300
I think it's romantic.

831
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,200
It's not romantic, joe.

832
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,300
It's horrifying.

833
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,100
You think he'll show?

834
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,300
Hey.

835
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,200
It is getting
a little hard to watch.

836
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,700
It was hard to watch
an hour ago.

837
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Now it's just pathetic.

838
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,200
Who's pathetic?

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,700
(man) joe, turn up the tv.

840
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,900
a massive train wreck occurred...

841
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,700
(joe) a train wreck...

842
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
that'll empty a bar pretty fast.

843
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,000
(whispers) george.

844
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,400
You're staying with her.

845
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,400
Yeah, she's my wife.

846
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
(miranda) dr. Shepherd,
she's crashing.

847
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You took
the clinical skills section

848
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,300
of your medical board exams
after most interns,

849
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,000
so the results are only now
coming out.

850
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,900
I failed the medical boards.

851
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
If i tell izzie,
she'll be nice about it,

852
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,900
all supportive and optimistic.

853
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,300
She might as well
rip my nads off

854
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
and turn 'em into earrings.

855
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,400
What happens, uh
if i take the exam

856
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
for a second time
and i don't pass?

857
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,600
You will no longer be
a surgical resident

858
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,500
at seattle grace.

859
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,100
Failing again
is not an option.

860
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
(izzie) well, do you feel
like doing it tonight?

861
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,900
Well, i'm on call so...

862
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
god, what is wrong
with you?

863
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Why do you have to be so...
what is wrong with you?

864
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,200
Ow.

865
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,200
do you feel like
doing it now?

866
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
What, right now?

867
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,700
People have sex
in this hospital all the time.

868
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
(preston) it's a key.

869
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,900
Just a key?

870
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,100
Just a key.

871
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Well, good.

872
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Good.

873
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,000
Or...

874
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,900
you could start thinking
about moving in with me.

875
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
If it's me,
just tell me it's me.

876
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,000
It's not you.

877
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,700
Well, then is it
a medical thing

878
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,900
or... or a problem?

879
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,200
Because guys have problems
sometimes.

880
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't have a problem.

881
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,100
This is where i live.

882
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,200
I don't do laundry.
I buy new underwear.

883
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,500
I hired a maid once.

884
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,100
She ran away crying.

885
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,800
Still think living together
is a good idea?

886
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Let me ask you something.

887
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
When we were together,

888
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,600
it was good, right?

889
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,700
(izzie) everyone answered
their page except dr. Karev.

890
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,000
Where is he?
We need everyone.

891
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Uh, i don't know.
He was on call last night.

892
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,000
He might be asleep.
Go find him.

893
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,200
(izzie) he cheated on me.

894
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,800
He cheated on me.

895
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,500
He cheated on me with george's
skanky syph nurse.

896
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
That is just plain rude!

897
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,700
Hell hath no fury like a girl
whose non-boyfriend

898
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,000
screws a nurse.

899
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,600
Bitch.

900
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,200
How about here?
Does it hurt here?

901
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,500
Yes, it does.

902
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay, seriously,
if you're that lonely,

903
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,200
there are excellent vibrators.

904
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,500
I can give you catalogues.

905
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
He failed his boards.
I'm helping him study.

906
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,700
You failed your practical?

907
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,100
Glad to know you can keep
a secret, grey.

908
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
I kept your secret,
it didn't do you any good.

909
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
He needs our help.

910
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,500
What's going on? Are you mad,

911
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,800
are you depressed, what?

912
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,600
No,

913
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,700
everything's fine.

914
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,300
We're fine, addie, you know?

915
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
Just... i'll see you at home.

916
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,500
Okay?

917
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
(meredith) do you love her?

918
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,300
I don't know.

919
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
It's good that you're trying.

920
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
You wouldn't be you

921
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,700
if you weren't the kind of person

922
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,200
who was trying to make it work.

923
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
You think so?

924
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah.

925
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,900
It means i wasn't wrong
about you.

926
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,500
Wake up.

927
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,200
God, no wonder
you failed your boards.

928
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
What, do you expect to learn
this stuff by osmosis?

929
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Why would you want to help me
after what i did?

930
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,600
Because it's what jesus
would freakin' do!

931
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
Double scotch,single malt.

932
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,700
You're a good man.

933
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
The way i see it,

934
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,300
sometimes you get what you want in life...

935
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,900
i'm not saying this
to hurt you

936
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,900
or because i want
to leave you,

937
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,700
because i don't.

938
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,600
Meredith wasn't a fling.

939
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,100
She wasn't revenge.

940
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,600
I fell in love with her.

941
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,700
Sometimes you don't.

942
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,700
That doesn't go away

943
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,300
because i decided
to stay with you.

944
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,800
And sometimes, well...

945
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,700
sometimes you get something in between.
