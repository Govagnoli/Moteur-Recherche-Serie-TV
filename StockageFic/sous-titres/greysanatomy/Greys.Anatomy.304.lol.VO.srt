00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:03,766
<i>previously on
"grey's anatomy"...
(richard) who's mark?</i>

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,161
Derek found us
In bed together.

3
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,538
You're in love with me.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,547
I'm well off, but i'm not
Into money, and i'm hot.

5
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,778
I'm a catch. You know, if you
Can wrap your head around

6
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,706
The enlarged, failing heart
And the dependency to i.v. Meds.

7
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,138
I'm not ready for us
To move in together.
I'll be out in an hour.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,026
(izzie) an hour ago,
He was proposing.

9
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:22,889
Are you gonna tell shepherd
About...

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,233
(preston) not yet.
(meredith) if i haven't
Made a decision

11
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,897
By the end of the day,
I'm flipping a coin.

12
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:30,093
A girl can only hold out
For so long.

13
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,823
<i>(meredith) at some point
During surgical residency,</i>

14
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,317
<i>and the kinds of surgeons
They're going to become.</i>

15
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,565
<i>if you ask them,
They'll tell you--</i>

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,787
<i>they're going
To be general surgeons...</i>

17
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,915
<i>orthopedic surgeons...</i>

18
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,251
<i>neurosurgeons...</i>

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,309
<i>distinctions which do more</i>

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,107
<i>than describe their areas
Of expertise.</i>

21
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,531
<i>they help define who they are.</i>

22
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,401
<i>because outside
The operating room,</i>

23
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:10,036
<i>not only do most surgeons
Have no idea who they are,</i>

24
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>they're afraid to find out.</i>

25
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:20,336
Time me.

26
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:21,774
I've been timing you.

27
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,138
My last time was off
By six seconds.

28
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,425
Well, it's not about speed,
It's about accuracy.

29
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:28,847
I mean,
Your sutures are fine.

30
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,997
My sutures are textbook.

31
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,933
The edges
Are perfectly aligned.
Mm-hmm. You're ready.

32
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:35,477
I need more chickens.

33
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,044
No more chickens, okay?

34
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:39,026
It's bad enough that meredith
Is dating a vet.

35
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,057
I'm not dating
A chicken surgeon.

36
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,573
Stop second-guessing.
It's not like you.

37
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,341
Your hand is fine, and shepherd
Will clear you for surgery.

38
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:53,611
Cristina.

39
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:54,675
Yeah, baby?

40
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,610
Nothing.

41
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:00,658
Okay.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,558

44
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,128
(george) so izzie left
The house this morning.

45
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,199
That's a good sign.
Are you okay?
Yeah.

46
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,998
I'm just not feeling
Like myself.

47
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,870
O'malley seems to have
That affecon women.

48
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:20,004
Ask dr. Torres.

49
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:21,588
What's that supposed to mean?

50
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,995
Dude... (chuckles) you
Threw her out on her ass.

51
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,355
I did not.
Who told you that?

52
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,267
Torres.

53
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:29,418
Oh...

54
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:30,321
Don't worry. I get it.

55
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,480
She's hot,
But she's not for you.
Why is that?

56
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,160
Because she's hot.

57
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:34,882
Mm.

58
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,154
(george) callie.
Mnh-mnh.

59
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,488
Hey, come on. Wait.

60
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,375
Before you start yelling,
You were right.

61
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,351
I should have told you how
I felt about you moving in,

62
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:45,285
Not that you were moving in.

63
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,990
It's just, i'm not good
At the whole...

64
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,478
"talking about feelings"
Thing.

65
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,186
I bet you told meredith how
You felt, though, didn't you?

66
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,293
And izzie--
You don't seem to have

67
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,917
Any trouble talking
To them, george, but me--
(miranda) let's go, people.

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,765
I've been in surgery since
2:00 a.m. I'm in no mood.

69
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:01,925
(meredith whispers) george.

70
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,611
I miss you.

71
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,194
(cristina) no cutting.
No cutting.

72
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,443
Yang, you're late!
Hey, i got here
Before george.

73
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,202
I'm here. I was here.

74
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:17,561
Nice of you to join us, yang.
Yeah, what are you
Smiling about?

75
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,466
Aren't you supposed to be
On the gynie brigade?
Yeah, whatever.

76
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:21,705
Woman troubles?

77
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,176
Oh. Men troubles.

78
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,821
I think this dating two guys
Thing is getting to me,

79
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:27,048
The stress of it.

80
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,852
Finn, derek, derek, finn.

81
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,851
I think i'm getting
An ulcer.

82
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,770
Mcdreamy and the vet
Are making you sick?

83
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:34,538
I just need to make a choice
And get it over with.

84
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:36,634
Shawn sullivan, 62,

85
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,901
Had minimally invasive
Bypass surgery two days ago

86
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,659
To remove a blockage
From his l.a.d.--

87
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,980
But i'm all better now.
Thank you, george.

88
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,899
So what do you think, miranda?
Can i stop being a burden

89
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,124
To you good people
And go on home?

90
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,538
You need to stop interrupting
The doctors, shawny.

91
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,353
You just need to listen
To what they say.
I need to get back
To the dealership.

92
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,260
They're gonna can me
If i'm out too long.
They can't can you, sweetie.

93
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:57,668
You're the best salesman
They got. Come on.
(miranda) what do you sell?

94
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:58,571
Cars.

95
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,675
My shawny could sell...
Anything.

96
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:03,635
Yeah, i believe he can.
What he can't sell me on

97
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,930
Is going back to work before
He gets his oxygen levels up.

98
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:09,619
So you put that oxygen
Back on, mr. Sullivan,

99
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,594
Before i even think about
Letting you out of here.

100
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:14,593
You know, and if i do,
I want your word--

101
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,392
Nothing fried, no alcohol
And no cigarettes.

102
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,696
Boy, you're tough, miranda.

103
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,080
I need your word, mr. Sullivan,
Or i'm not gonna sign

104
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,441
Those discharge papers.
I give you my word.

105
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:27,649
Hmm. All right, then.
Mrs. Sullivan, you need to go

106
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,407
To the front desk
To fill out some paperwork,

107
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:30,710
And then you can take
Your husband home.

108
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:32,310
(addison)
How are we doing, guys?

109
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:33,797
She's at 8 centimeters,

110
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,278
But the baby's
Still at minus 3 station.

111
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:40,062
So what do we do, uh,
Patterned breathing, squatting?

112
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:42,153
Dude, squatting?
Dr. Karev,

113
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,856
How do we normally proceed
In a situation like this?

114
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:45,105
We monitor
The baby's progress.

115
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:49,555
If the descent stops entirely
During active labor,

116
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:51,399
We perform a c-section.

117
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,707
Not on me, you don't.

118
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,458
I'm sorry, dr. Karev,

119
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,466
But jeff and i have
A natural birth plan,

120
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,656
And dr. Montgomery-shepherd
Promised us that--

121
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,497
I promised that we would
Do what we can,

122
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,697
But if your labor intensifies
And the baby doesn't descend--

123
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:06,546
Well, then we'll wait
Until he does, right?

124
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:09,583
I'm not having a c-section.

125
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:11,752
A c-section is actually
The safest way--

126
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,190
To what, avoid a lawsuit?

127
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,999
We don't have to decide
Right now.
I'm not gonna miss out

128
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,703
On an experience
That my body was made for

129
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:19,367
Just because it's
More convenient for you.

130
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,941
You all right, dr. Grey?

131
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,125
Yeah, dr. Bailey.

132
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:30,404
I just...

133
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:32,572
Oh.

134
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,685
Need to make a choice is all.

135
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,493
Karev. Dr. Grey, i am clipping
A basilar tip aneurysm.

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,668
Any interest?

137
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:51,658
Dr. Bailey, can i get...

138
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,559
Oh, my god.

139
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,504
Oh... My... God.
Oh, my god.

140
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,419
Is that...
Mcsteamy.

141
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,283
No, mr. Sullivan,
Don't light that!

142
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,025
(derek) somebody get
A fire extinguisher!

143
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,139
(miranda) call a code red.

144
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,593
Make sure he has an airway.
Sir, can you hear me? Sir?

145
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:34,796
No, he's out.
Hit his head.

146
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,482
Small hematoma
In the occipital region.

147
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,383
Get him to the burn unit
Till he's stabilized,

148
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:39,078
And then get a c.t.

149
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:40,982
Go.

150
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,094
Right away, doctor.
Come on.

151
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:47,423
You're burning up.
I'm fine.

152
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,385
You don't look fine.

153
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,480
You look beautiful,
But you don't look fine.

154
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:51,857
Now i'm gonna throw up.

155
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,569
Go, you have aneurysms
To clip

156
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,183
And surgeons to confront.

157
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,589
You're gonna be all right?
Yeah, i'm fine.

158
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,076
Will you look after her,
Please?
Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,700
You think i'd miss this?
What kind of idiot lights
A cigarette in a hospital?

160
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,435
Apparently people do
Idiotic things all the time.

161
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:13,267
(derek) chief.

162
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:14,297
Chief.

163
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,570
I thought you were going
Back to new york.

164
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,153
I thought it was time
For a change.
You can't do this.

165
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,197
You can't be here.
Sure i can.

166
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,268
It was easy.

167
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,147
Sublet the apartment,
Sold the practice.

168
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,771
(derek) he is a liar
And a cheat.
The man is one of

169
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,397
The finest plastic surgeons
In this country.

170
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,779
His department will generate

171
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,461
Twice the revenue
Neurosurgery does.
Money, that's why he's here?

172
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:38,233
<i>why do you think i'm here?
This? This is why
I left you.</i>

173
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,596
I thought you left me
For derek.

174
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:41,623
I left new york
Because of him.

175
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,912
He was your best friend
For years.

176
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,887
Right up until the point
Where he had sex with my wife.
We all make mistakes.

177
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:49,791
Oh.

178
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,332
Holy crap! Are you pregnant?

179
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:58,819
Oh, this is just perfect...

180
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:03,738
An adulterous love child.

181
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,546
Goes along with
An adulterous sociopath.

182
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:08,689
(derek) meredith.

183
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,251
Unh-unh.
You've done enough already.

184
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,221
(derek) meredith.

185
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:16,356
Oh, uh, doctor, i-i finished
Filling out the paperwork.

186
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:17,787
When do you think i can
Take shawny home?

187
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:20,083
Um...

188
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,129
So who's the father?

189
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,473
I'm not pregnant.

190
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:29,633
I didn't think i was pregnant.
When i was pregnant, either.

191
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:33,607
But the abdominal pain, fever
And the nonstop vomiting--
I'm not pregnant.

192
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:35,687
You don't know who
The father is, do you?

193
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,223
It would have to be derek's.

194
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,983
There's no way
It could be finn's.

195
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,071
You haven't had sex
With the vet yet?

196
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,134
(scoffs) well, you gotta get
Outta that relationship,

197
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,045
Immediately.

198
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,270
Oh, i can't be pregnant,
Can i?

199
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,366
With mcbaby.
Oh!

200
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,463
Oh, okay.
Was i this mean to you
When you were pregnant?

201
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:53,577
Oh, i thought you said
You weren't pregnant.

202
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,997
She's not.
We'll have to run more tests.

203
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,324
In that case,
Can i have some morphine?

204
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,748
I want you checking
The fetal monitor

205
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,443
Every 30 minutes.
What's the point?

206
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:07,723
The baby's nowhere near
Where it needs to be,

207
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:09,105
And you know you're gonna
Have to cut her open,

208
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:12,463
So why not get it over with?
Because it's not what
The patient wants.

209
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,266
And it's our job as doctors

210
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:16,130
To balance the desires
Of the patient

211
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:17,658
Against the risk
Of complications.

212
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,905
So if the patient wants
To have a natural birth--
So if the patient wants

213
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,017
A natural birth,
It's not surgical.

214
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,431
So why not just cut me loose
And let me in on a surgery?

215
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,771
I might actually learn
Something.
Like sloan's burn case.

216
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,620
I'm going into plastics
Anyway.

217
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,666
Do you think that mark sloan
Has anything to teach you?

218
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,779
He is just like you. He is
Only looking out for himself.

219
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,394
So what? Your patient's
Looking out for herself,

220
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:37,730
You're looking out
For yourself--
No, i'm not, actually.

221
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:38,970
Well, maybe you should be.

222
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:43,706
Go. Go find sloan.

223
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:46,153
Do whatever you want. Just get
Out of my face, karev. Go!

224
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:55,935
You know, i'm not saying
He's a bad doctor.

225
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,327
Of course not. Listen--

226
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,566
I'm--i'm saying that he's,
Like, a bad person.

227
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,646
The man has no morality,
No ethics.

228
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,942
Yeah. But there's no pain,
There's no numbness, but, um--

229
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,783
I mean, the question is
Do we really want our interns

230
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:07,819
Learning from
Somebody like that?
Derek, my arm.

231
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,493
Yeah. Oh, it's good.
It's great.

232
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,836
You have great range of motion.
I can clear you for surgery.

233
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,596
Really? U're sure?

234
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,299
Yeah, absolutely.
Complete recovery.

235
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,788
You're not having
Any problems, right?

236
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,539
No. Uh... I-i've been doing
His physical therapy with him

237
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,427
Every night, so...

238
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,619
He's perfect. He's burke.

239
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:28,002
Good. Glad to hear it.
Welcome back, dr. Burke.

240
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:28,786
Yeah.

241
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,619
Uh, dr. Bailey wanted to know
If you still needed an intern?

242
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,929
No, i'm fine.
How's, uh, dr. Grey?

243
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,993
Oh, she's not pregnant
With anyone's baby, so...

244
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:40,429
(whispers) yeah.

245
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,452
Izzie...
Good to see you.

246
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:56,772
You want some lunch?

247
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:58,507
I'm meeting somebody.

248
00:10:58,946 --> 00:10:59,571
Anybody i know?

249
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,282
Actually,
I don't even know him.

250
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,466
You never met?
Know what he looks like?

251
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,539
So for all you know,

252
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:11,186
He could be an older, rugged,
Ex-marine-looking dude?

253
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:17,672
Dr. Stevens?

254
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:19,905
Mr. Duquette.

255
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:22,379
Please...

256
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:24,315
Call me denny.

257
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:34,906
Not denny's type at all.

258
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:37,904
Really?

259
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:39,943
What was his type?

260
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,816
Um...

261
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,039
Dark-haired girls, smart.

262
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,270
Uh... Well, not that
You're not smart.

263
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:48,830
You're a doctor.

264
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:50,541
Obviously--
I was.

265
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,149
I was a doctor.
I'm not anymore.

266
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:55,370
Oh, that's right.
Dr. Webber said you'd quit.

267
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,964
You...
Talked to dr. Webber?

268
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:02,243
Uh, yes,
And he said that, well,

269
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,268
If i wanted to hear the whole
Story, i should talk to you.

270
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:05,684
So if you don't mind,
Dr. Stevens--

271
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:06,499
Izzie.

272
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:07,466
Izzie...

273
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,091
If you don't mind,

274
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:11,898
I need to hear
The whole story.

275
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:18,562
Dr. Sloan.

276
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:20,880
You my intern?

277
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,561
Yeah. Uh, i'm your intern.

278
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,880
(shawn) my face... Oh.

279
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:25,360
No need to talk,
Mr. Sullivan.

280
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,432
That's gonna be painful
For a while.
My face.

281
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,408
He wants to know that you
Can fix his face.

282
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,167
He needs to know
That you can fix it.

283
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,095
I'm going to remove
The burned tissue

284
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,614
And then bandage your face
With a dressing of live cells.

285
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,942
And that'll do it? His face
Will be back like it was?

286
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,542
Because his face was--
It's a nice face. (sobs)

287
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,693
He's a salesman.

288
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,108
I'm gonna do absolutely
Everything i can, mrs. Sullivan.

289
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,365
We'll need a neuro consult
Fore we operate.

290
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,433
Anything else? I mean, uh,
I could do debridement or, uh--

291
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,659
Actually, there is
One more thing.

292
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,796
Bone dry cappuccino.
Make it a double.

293
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:03,714
You're a good friend.

294
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:05,849
You are so high right now.

295
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,744
Actually, you're my best friend
In the whole entire world.

296
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:10,865
Now i just feel sorry
For you.
Why?

297
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:12,873
Because i could die today?

298
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,273
This is why i hate
Being around stoned people.

299
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:16,447
And if i did die today,

300
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,783
I'd only be remembered
As the slutty intern

301
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,114
<i>who dated two doctors.
No, one doctor, one vet.</i>

302
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,169
Derek, finn. Derek or finn?

303
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,207
I'd die as the girl who
Couldn't make a choice, right?
Probably.

304
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:30,079
But none of that matters,
Because you'll be dead.

305
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,663
Dr. Grey...

306
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,256
You've got a fever,
High white count

307
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,200
And tenderness over
Mcburney's point,

308
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,294
Which suggests--

309
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:38,789
(george, cristina and meredith)
Appendicitis.

310
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,486
Dr. O'malley,
Prep dr. Grey for surgery.

311
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,574
You're scrubbing in.

312
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,958
I am,
In meredith's appendectomy?

313
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,150
I, uh... Am i the only one
Who remembers

314
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,349
The last time george scrubbed in
On an appendectomy?

315
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,869
He almost killed the guy.
Sorry, george.

316
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,003
I don't have to scrub in,
Dr. Bailey. I could just, uh...

317
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:56,979
Uh... Unless you want me to,
Which...

318
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:58,900
No. It's not
Gonna happen again.

319
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:00,393
That good enough for you,
Dr. Grey?

320
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:02,730
You're pretty.

321
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,288
George! Ice chips.

322
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,071
Hey.

323
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,486
I, uh, heard meredith's
Having an appy.

324
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,861
It wasn't my idea to scrub in.
I tried to get out of it.

325
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,158
George... I was just...

326
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,448
I just thought maybe

327
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:23,861
We could have a late supper
At the archfield.

328
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:26,444
Why would we have dinner
At a hotel?

329
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:27,919
Because they bring it
Right to your room.

330
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,853
You're staying
At the archfield.

331
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,901
How--how are you
Affording that?

332
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,621
I still have some secrets,
O'malley.

333
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,370
And if you
Come see me tonight,

334
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:38,763
I just might show you
One or two.

335
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:42,581
(miranda) dr. Sloan.

336
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:43,642
I was just checking
On the sullivans,

337
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,307
And how is he doing
Because he
You are?

338
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,474
Dr. Bailey.
We met this morning.

339
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,738
I was the resident
On mr. Sullivan's bypass.

340
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,803
Well, i don't need a resident
On this case, so...

341
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,770
Excuse me. I wasn't asking
To be your resident.

342
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,993
I was asking how my patient
Was doing.
He's not
Your patient anymore.

343
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,189
Hey, so congratulations.
I told you.

344
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:07,728
Yeah.

345
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,448
What? What?

346
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:12,951
Shepherd shouldn't have
Cleared me.

347
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,647
Burke, you're back.
You're back and you're fine.

348
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:17,646
Burke.

349
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:18,478
What?

350
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,102
What?

351
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:23,750
He just...

352
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,453
Shouldn't have cleared me.

353
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,797
(woman) another contraction,
Dr. Montgomery-shepherd.

354
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:32,045
You're fully dilated.

355
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,413
But the baby's
Only at minus 2 station.

356
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,164
He just needs more time.
We don't have it, rebecca.

357
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,109
His heart rate's slowing
With each contraction.

358
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,332
If he starts having
Late decels, i--

359
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:44,458
Is he having late decels?
Not yet, but--

360
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:45,732
Then stop trying to scare me

361
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:47,595
Into an operation
I told you i don't want.

362
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,259
I have a birth plan.

363
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,259
Look, i'm not--

364
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,170
I'm not gonna be one of
Those weak-ass women

365
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,281
Who give all that up the minute
Things start to get scary.

366
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,433
I...
Rebecca...

367
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,849
Your birth plan is just that,
It's a plan.

368
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,703
Jeff, get her out of here.
Honey, i think she's just
Trying to be cautious.

369
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,695
Just get out! Just get out!
Get out! Aah!

370
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,476
! Get out!

371
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,163
Since when do you "get out"?

372
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,195
Clearly,
I am not myself today.

373
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:26,673
Never would've figured
Mark sloan to be your type.

374
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:27,954
He's not.

375
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:29,361
<i>he's not. (sighs)</i>

376
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,872
What is he doing here?
He's not supposed to be here.

377
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:34,985
I can't have him here.
I can't.

378
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,959
He's supposed to be
In new york. I can't--

379
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,104
I can't function
With him here.

380
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,952
I'm a professional here.
People respect me here.

381
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,407
But when he's here,
I'm just--i'm--

382
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,591
A woman who gets the hots
For man-candy

383
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,076
And cheats on her husband.
That is rude...

384
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,696
And unkind...

385
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:51,879
And completely true.

386
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:53,976
Oh, my god.
What am i gonna do?

387
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,470
For starters, you can keep
Your knees closed

388
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:57,550
In his presence.

389
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:58,868
Miranda.
You asked.

390
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,448
And also, you can remember
That no man--

391
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,515
Not derek, not mark--

392
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,401
Defines who you are.

393
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:14,743
Well, let's see--

394
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,016
Your complexion is flushed...

395
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:18,824
Abdominal wall is tender.

396
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:21,660
Are you happy you have
A boyfriend

397
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:22,597
Who works in a hospital?

398
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,748
You... Are just
One of many men

399
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:28,570
That i happen to be dating
At the moment.

400
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,411
Really?
Mm-hmm.

401
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:30,546
How many of us are there?

402
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,974
Uh...
Well, there's, uh, you...

403
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:36,137
Mm-hmm.

404
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,589
And finn and...

405
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,549
Well, forgive me
For pointing out the obvious,

406
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:42,888
But i don't see
Any practitioners

407
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:46,041
Of veterinarian medicine
At your bedside.
You would
If you turned around.

408
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:48,369
Ah, finn.

409
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:49,986
Derek.

410
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,993
Oh, can i just say
How much it helps

411
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,496
That i am on drugs
Right now?

412
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,422
(derek) so.
(finn) so.

413
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,918
So how's life
In the animal kingdom?

414
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:03,590
What about you, derek?
Slow day?

415
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,125
If you need to take off,
That's--
No, it's fine. I can stay.

416
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:09,733
Great.
Great.

417
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,460
Great.
(george) okay, let's get you
Prepped and ready for...

418
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,180
Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Finn.

419
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:17,758
Now all my boys are here.

420
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,334
You're all so handsome...

421
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,013
And such good kissers.

422
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,516
Oh, god.
Excuse me?

423
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:25,308
She's on drugs.

424
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,371
He's an excellent kisser.

425
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,523
You two... Dated?
You didn't know?

426
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,054
It wasn't a date so much as

427
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,546
A disastrously uncomfortable

428
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:37,810
Sexual experience.

429
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,769
Oh... I-i--
I can't be here.
None of you can be here.

430
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,184
This woman is being prepped
For surgery,

431
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,600
Which means you all
Need to leave.

432
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,148
Gladly.
Now! Not you, o'malley.

433
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:48,924
Dr. Bailey,
All my boyfriends are here.

434
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:50,739
Not for long.
Y good-bye, dr. Grey.

435
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,562
I'll be here
When you wake up.
So will i.

436
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,514
Now!

437
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:05,608
What are you doing?

438
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:09,886
What does it look like
I'm doing?

439
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,343
You're not in med school.

440
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,470
You don't need to practice
Procedures on a corpse.

441
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:15,382
(instrument buzzes)
Better than on a patient.

442
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,462
Burke, your hand is fine.

443
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,246
Right.

444
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,173
Are you... Mad at me?

445
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:25,740
Hey, hey, you're mad at me?

446
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:31,515
Forget it.

447
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:34,228
Just...
Don't worry about it.

448
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:35,387
You have patients.

449
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,907
I'm on call for the pit.
Cristina--

450
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,227
I-i am not leaving.

451
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:48,232
Time me.

452
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,880
The transplant went better
Than anyone expected,

453
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:55,759
And he was better.

454
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,992
He was... So much better.

455
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:00,608
But denny, um...

456
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:02,735
Before the surgery,

457
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,528
He was hooked up
To a machine called--

458
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:05,551
You're not answering
My question.

459
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,054
I'm trying.
I-i'm getting there.

460
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,326
It--it was complicated,
And his heart was--

461
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:11,757
I don't give a damn about
The medicine.

462
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,277
I know what killed my son.

463
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,756
He had a bad heart.

464
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,524
He had a bad heart
For a long time.

465
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:21,260
I get that.

466
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,203
What i don't get is how
A girl like you

467
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,731
Goes from being my son's doctor
To--to his fiancée

468
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,858
On the very day he's supposed
To get a new heart.

469
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,170
What i don't get is how you
Got him to propose to you

470
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:34,561
Hours before he died.

471
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,553
Mr. Sullivan,
I'm gonna recommend

472
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,497
A night of observation
In the i.c.u.

473
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,617
Before dr. Sloan proceeds
With your surgery.

474
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:46,296
Oh.
Is that really necessary,
Dr. Shepherd?

475
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,798
The longer we wait, the higher
The risk of infection.

476
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,215
I think it's important
That we attend to

477
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,635
Potential life-threatening
Injuries

478
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:55,613
Before moving on to cosmetic,
Dr. Sloan.

479
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,292
He's not here for a face-lift,
Derek. He's a burn victim.

480
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,996
Why did you ask for a consult
If you've already established

481
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:02,052
A course of action?
Because i thought you were
Good enough at your job

482
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,292
To put aside the personal and do
What's best for the patient.
My job? You're telling me
How to do my job?

483
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,772
Now you're telling me
How to do my--
Please, i'm sure
It's complicated.

484
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,682
And i know shawny's soy
For lighting that smoke.

485
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,352
He was trying to keep his word
To dr. Bailey.

486
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,696
He told her he wasn't
Gonna smoke when he got home,

487
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:16,263
And he was... Just trying
To keep his word.

488
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:18,288
He knows he did wrong.

489
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,401
But he's...

490
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,461
He's a salesman.
That's who he is.

491
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:26,558
So could you please
Just fix his face?

492
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:28,773
Could you do that
For us, please?

493
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:36,876
If what happened
Between me and addison

494
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:39,083
Is so unforgivable,
How do you justify

495
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,555
What happened
Between you and meredith?

496
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,963
What the hell are you
Talking about?
You need me to be
The bad guy? Fine.

497
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,050
But i'm not the only
Bad guy here, derek.

498
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,889
You and me, we're the same.

499
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:54,549
Addison.

500
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:57,550
Dr. Montgomery-shepherd.

501
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:01,253
||
You bellowed, dr. Grey.

502
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:02,374
Hi.

503
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,077
You certainly are,
Aren't you?

504
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,628
But your not pregnant.

505
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:12,379
No.

506
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:17,411
Are you okay?

507
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,018
Fine.

508
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:21,130
How are you?

509
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,194
I'm trying to choose
Between two men.

510
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:29,088
<i>okay, well,
Good luck with that.</i>

511
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,462
How did you know
Derek was the one?

512
00:22:36,512 --> 00:22:37,128
Excuse me?

513
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:40,095
I know you hate me and all,

514
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,527
And you don't
Owe me anything.

515
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:44,966
<i>nothing. (sighs)</i>

516
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,182
No... Thing.

517
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:53,093
What was i saying?

518
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:53,892
Derek.

519
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:55,940
Right.

520
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,411
I want him to be the one.

521
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,066
But i would know if he was
The one, right?

522
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,049
You knew, right? (sighs)

523
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:13,564
You don't...

524
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:15,588
I didn't... Know.

525
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:17,980
I just...

526
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:21,379
Derek's the kind of guy...

527
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,515
I just knew
He wouldn't hurt me.

528
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,918
I mean, not on purpose,
Anyway,

529
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,337
Not the way i hurt him.

530
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,112
He hurt me...

531
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,560
When he chose you.

532
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,711
??

533
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:43,733
(sighs)
I should've stepped aside,

534
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:45,244
Been a better person.

535
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,116
I... Should've...

536
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,371
A lot of things.

537
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:53,772
Me, too.

538
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:55,386
A lot of things.

539
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,547
I don't hate you.

540
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,289
How come we never
Talked like this before?

541
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,881
The only reason we are
Talking like this right now

542
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,353
Is because i know
You won't remember

543
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:12,584
A single word of this
Once the drugs wear off.

544
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:18,694
Dr. Karev,
You need to see this.

545
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:20,502
I'm off the case.
Page dr. Montgomery-shepherd.

546
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:21,359
We did, but...

547
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:23,334
Oh, man.

548
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,558
Were you just talking
To meredith?

549
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:28,197
Yeah.

550
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:32,709
What?

551
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,667
Don't, um...

552
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,148
Don't hurt her again.

553
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:46,551
You planning on killing
A woman today?

554
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,184
What?
The c-section

555
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:50,119
You should've performed on
Rebecca bloom this morning?

556
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,778
At this point, it may be
Too late for her and the baby.

557
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,908
Nice work, doc.
Get an o.r.
And an anesthesiologist.

558
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,193
We're doing
A crash c-section.

559
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,646
Oh! What is happening?

560
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:10,797
Rebecca, your baby
Is having late decels.

561
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,763
He's in distress. We have to
Get you into the delivery room

562
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,804
And get him out right now.

563
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:17,412
Oh, no, please.
This is no longer
A conversation.

564
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:19,842
I am your doctor, and i am
Responsible for your life

565
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,866
And your baby's life,

566
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,297
And i'm not about to lose
Either one of yo are we clear?

567
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:27,997
You just gonna stand there,
Karev, or are we doing this?

568
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,617
Mr. Duquette, denny and i--

569
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,918
He--he was my patient
For months.

570
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:35,312
And the minute he died,
You quit your job.

571
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:37,143
Because i couldn't--
Four years of medical school,

572
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,634
Now that's a whole lot
Of debt.

573
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:41,040
How were you planning
On paying that back, huh?

574
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,695
Did you think that denny
Would pay for everything?

575
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,023
Why are you... What--
What are you talking about?

576
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,774
I'm talking about
Otecting my son.

577
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,173
Oh, where were you
When you needed you?

578
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,333
<i>because i was there
The whole time.</i>

579
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:54,204
<i>i was there.</i>

580
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:58,116
<i>i was working 80-hour weeks,
And i was still always there.</i>

581
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,472
He had so many surgeries,
So many procedures.

582
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:03,575
He was so scared.

583
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:06,853
Where were you then?
Where were you?

584
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:10,397
You may not get me,
But you don't have to

585
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:11,707
Because i don't
Get you either.

586
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:14,840
<i>i don't get how a father
Abandons his dying son.
Wait.</i>

587
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:15,785
Wait.

588
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:18,398
Is that what he told you,

589
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,919
That i--that his mother
And i abandoned him?

590
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:23,899
Well...

591
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,262
Heidn't tell you
The truth.

592
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:40,675
What?

593
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:43,252
What?

594
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,402
Oh, burke. I thought you--
You told me--

595
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,210
I can't hold it still
Long enough to attach the graft.

596
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,123
You told me your hand
Was fine.
I can't--

597
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:53,613
You told me you
Your hand was fine.
It's not fine!

598
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:56,461
You wanted to believe
I was fine.

599
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,163
You wanted me to be fine.
You wanted--

600
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:01,061
I wanted--damn it.

601
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:07,603
My hands... Are
The only things that i have

602
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,227
That are of any value
To me, to you.

603
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,682
Not to me--
Oh, yes, to you.

604
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:12,906
You want preston burke.

605
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,216
My hands...

606
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,079
These are who i am.

607
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,255
If i can't do this,

608
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,837
If i can't finish
This surgery, then...

609
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:49,609
What if i hold the vessel?

610
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:54,867
What if i hold the vessel?

611
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:56,365
Come on.

612
00:27:59,308 --> 00:27:59,835
Burke...

613
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:02,187
If i hold the vessel...

614
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:05,530
I can attach the graft.

615
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:06,171
Okay, so...

616
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:08,953
I--okay, i put my hand...

617
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,463
Nobody has to know.

618
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:33,302
Derek. Excuse me. Look,
I know you're mad at me,

619
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,134
But mark sloan
Is the best in his field.

620
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,700
Any surgical unit
In this country

621
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:39,612
Would be lucky to have him.
You did what you thought
Was best for this hospital.

622
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:40,268
I did.

623
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,420
Uh... Are you all right?

624
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,108
(sighs) can i ask you a...

625
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:49,596
Personal question?

626
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,587
Why did you leave
Meredi's mother?

627
00:28:59,081 --> 00:28:59,833
I could've left adele.

628
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:02,993
I could've gone away
With ellis.

629
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,528
But i would've had
So much baggage,

630
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:09,032
So much guilt.

631
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,200
Ellis couldn't see it,
But i wasn't...

632
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,439
I never
Would've made her happy,

633
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,519
Not like she deserved
To be happy.

634
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,150
I s a better man
For walking away.

635
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:26,557
I loved her enough
To walk away.

636
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,381
Oh, oh, on the table,keep me draped

637
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:33,861
Too many people
Have seen me naked already.

638
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:36,472
I'd like to keep
Whatever dignity i have left.

639
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:38,679
Mcsteamy.
(whispers) meredith--

640
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:40,397
Mcsteamy! Whoo-hoo!

641
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,549
Is that what you're
Calling me now--mcsteamy?

642
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,892
Yeah, but i don't think
You were supposed to know that.

643
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,600
How's my favorite
Dirty mistress?

644
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,099
Haven't you heard?
Now i'm an adulterous whore.

645
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:53,495
(laughs) he's so beautiful.

646
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:56,656
He's so beautiful.

647
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:58,319
Thank you.

648
00:29:59,174 --> 00:29:59,815
You're welcome.

649
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:09,443
The appendix is out.

650
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:11,546
Now what do i do,
O'malley?

651
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,472
You invert the stump
Into the cecum

652
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,776
And pull up
On the purse strings.

653
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:17,392
Show me.

654
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,842
Okay, straight hemostats
And zero chromic.

655
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:25,774
Where's my coffe
Karev?

656
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:28,111
I got pulled into
An emergency c-section. Sorry.

657
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:29,542
That's too bad.

658
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,191
I was gonna let you scrub in
On a real surgery.

659
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:33,695
But, um...
Oh, well.
Maybe next time...

660
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,414
If o.b. Can spare you.

661
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:37,158
See ya.

662
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:43,738
Finn.

663
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,082
Derek.
She's still in surgery.

664
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:47,673
Yeah. Yeah, i fired
I'd wait for her here.

665
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:50,488
Meredith, uh, tells me
That you fish.

666
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:52,135
She does?

667
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:53,719
She tells me a lot of things.

668
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,607
Have you been
Up to cornet bay?

669
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,277
It's mostly chinook,
Some rockfish.
You fish?

670
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:02,795
Yeah, as much as i can.
Uh-huh.

671
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,451
My wife hated it.
(chuckles)
You had a wife?

672
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,402
Yeah. She died.

673
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:10,817
I'm sorry. I-i didn't know.

674
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:15,427
Meredith doesn't tell you
A lot of things. Only me.

675
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:17,676
Yeah. Funny. Very funny.

676
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,345
You know, when i heard
That she was sick, i...

677
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,345
People come through
Appendectomies all the time.

678
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:24,216
I mean, she'll be fine,
Right?

679
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:25,617
Mm-hmm.

680
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:28,036
You really like her,
Don't you?

681
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:29,113
Yeah.

682
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:32,815
You're a good guy.

683
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:34,574
Uh, yeah, i think so.

684
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,014
(laughs) i-i hope so.

685
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:43,208
Okay.

686
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,320
See you later.

687
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,063
I'll see you.

688
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:49,735
It was doctor after doctor.

689
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:53,471
Everybody had a--
Had a different opinion.

690
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,622
Everybody had
A worse opinion.

691
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,412
Before that, denny had never
Been sick a day in his life.

692
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:00,726
Before that, he had been...

693
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,044
You know, the...

694
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:09,044
The thought of having
To bury your own son...

695
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:11,892
His mother and i,
We didn't--

696
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:12,955
We didn't
Handle it very well.

697
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,938
One day, we came home
And found a note

698
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,010
Saying, uh, he didn't want us
To have to watch him die,

699
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,617
That he left.

700
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:25,601
We thought...

701
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,305
We thought he was dead
All this time.

702
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:34,896
I had no idea.

703
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,831
Believe me, if i had known,
I would...

704
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,335
Never have let him
Get away with that.

705
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:44,638
I believe it.

706
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:51,217
I worked my way through
Med school.
You--

707
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:52,729
I paid off my debt.

708
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:55,029
Look, i'm, uh, sorry
About before.

709
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,864
You--you don't have to
Explain--

710
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:58,566
I do. I do.

711
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,429
You're his dad and you're
Trying to protect him.

712
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:05,210
And i want you to know
That i've paid off all my debt.

713
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:08,312
And when i met denny,
I was gonna be a surgeon,

714
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:10,492
So i didn't need his money.

715
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,071
I had everything i needed.

716
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,813
I had everything i needed
Un-until, um...

717
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:23,476
(sighs) we miss him.

718
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:26,452
My god, we miss him.

719
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:27,892
Yeah.

720
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,003
I, um...

721
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:33,562
Yeah.

722
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:43,448
What is this?

723
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:45,225
It's for you.

724
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:46,896
It's from denny.

725
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:57,599
Hey. You ready to go?

726
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,132
I'm sorry
I have to do this,

727
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:03,589
But i have to go home.

728
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:04,950
It's izzie.

729
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:10,980
It's always izzie
Or meredith.

730
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:13,372
It's... It's never me.

731
00:34:14,404 --> 00:34:16,355
Oh, come on.
That is not true.

732
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:19,960
?????

733
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,737
Whoam i your girlfriend?

734
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:23,656
Am i somebody
You mess around with?

735
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:25,559
Do you even know?

736
00:34:29,295 --> 00:34:30,079
Well, guess what.

737
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,687
Now you don't have to bother
Figuring it out.

738
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,390
How's he doing,
Mrs. Sullivan?

739
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:41,269
We're just getting
An update now, dr. Bailey.

740
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,836
The surgery went well.

741
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,796
We removed
The necrotic tissue,

742
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:47,853
Applied the live cells,

743
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,676
And if his body responds,
In three or four weeks--

744
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:51,709
He'll have his face back?

745
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:54,811
Mr. And mrs. Sullivan,

746
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:58,027
Your face may never be
Exactly what it was.

747
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,409
Even if everything goes
Perfectly well,

748
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:01,386
There will be scarring.

749
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:02,521
But he's a salesman.

750
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:05,744
He has such a nice face.

751
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:18,023
You have an incredible wife,
Mr. Sullivan,

752
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,807
And half a dozen
Car salesmen in the lobby

753
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:21,767
Waiting to visit you.

754
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:26,272
Your face may be different,
But you know as well as i do,

755
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,877
It's not about
What you look like

756
00:35:28,717 --> 00:35:31,565
Or your job
Or how successful you are.

757
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:35,523
It's about having people
In your life that you love

758
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,120
And who love you.

759
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,224
That--that's all
That matters.

760
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:51,566
How you feeling?

761
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,885
Oh, mortified.

762
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,397
I was just explaining

763
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,293
The "meredith on morphine"
Experience.

764
00:35:57,485 --> 00:35:59,517
Ahh. You don't remember?
Was it memorable?

765
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:02,715
I'll let finn tell you.
I'll come back.

766
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:03,861
No, a-actually, i've--
I've just been sent

767
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:06,371
On a mission to get
The, uh, patient's ice chips.

768
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:07,753
Be right back.
(sighs)

769
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:11,974
How badly
Did i embarrass myself?

770
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:15,597
What?

771
00:36:16,645 --> 00:36:17,869
Mnh-mnh.

772
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,876
You deserve to be
With somebody

773
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,052
Who makes you happy,

774
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:30,907
Somebody who's not gonna
Complicate your life,

775
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:33,578
Somebody who won't hurt you.

776
00:36:44,784 --> 00:36:46,384
He's a better guy,
Meredith.

777
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:49,248
Finn's the better guy.

778
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:53,391
???

779
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,750
Oyñçññc|qgç
I'm walking away.

780
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,582
He left a message.

781
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,341
Denny left a message
For his parents

782
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,039
The night...

783
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,446
His father gave me
The number and the code,

784
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,733
But, um...

785
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:37,963
I just couldn't
Do it alone.

786
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,197
Addison... Can we talk?

787
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:51,733
I don't want you here,
Mark.

788
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,516
I think i've made that
Abundantly clear.

789
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:57,260
So... If you insist
On staying,

790
00:37:57,427 --> 00:38:00,419
Just... Know that
We're coworkers

791
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:02,132
And nothing more.

792
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:07,177
Karev.

793
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,072
As of right now, you are
Officially off my service.

794
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:13,152
But for what it's worth,

795
00:38:14,112 --> 00:38:14,984
I think you're gonna
Miss me.

796
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,303
<i>(denny sr.) Hello,
You've reached the duquettes.</i>

797
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:26,934
<i>(denny) dad, mom, it's me.</i>

798
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,845
<i>i'm calling from
Seattle grace hospital,</i>

799
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:32,430

A brand-new heart</i>

802
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:39,644
<i>and promised to marry me.</i>

803
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:42,907
<i>i know we've had
Our differences,</i>

804
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,813
<i>and i'm sorry
We've been out of touch.</i>

805
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:48,522
More chicken surgery?

806
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:51,682
I'm making you dinner.

807
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:53,858
<i>believe it or not,</i>

Everything better.</i>

<i>i know you're angry.
I hope you'll forgive me.</i>

810
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:05,856
<i>turns out, sometimes you
Have to do the wrong thing...</i>

811
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:07,863
Mcsteamy, right?

812
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:11,088
You must be a frie
Of meredith's.

813
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:13,934
Not really. Dr. Torres.

814
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:14,719
Callie.

815
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,389
Mark sloan.

816
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:19,446
Bad day?

817
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:22,758
You could say that.

818
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:24,413
You?

819
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:25,325
Oh, yeah.

820
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:29,595
So what have you heard
About me, exactly?

821
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:32,060
Mostly things
That involve the words

822
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,306
"dirty" and "bad."

823
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:37,202
Right.

824
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:42,915
I guesthere, uh, really is
No starting over, is there?

825
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,483
Can i buy you a drink,
Callie?

826
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,769
Only if you have it
Delivered to my hotel room,

827
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:02,841
Because i'm off to bed.

828
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,487
<i>sometimes you have to make
A big mistake...</i>

829
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:11,831
You comin'?

830
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:16,702
<i>to figure out
How to make things right.</i>

831
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,989
So what time
Do they let us visitors

832
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:20,821
Start visiting
In the morning?

833
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:26,333
You shouldn't do that.

834
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:27,509
I don't mind.

835
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:29,189
No, finn.

836
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,717
Really,
You shouldn't do that.

837
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:45,642
So it's derek.

838
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:47,490
I'm sorry.

839
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,672
Can i ask why?

840
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:57,936
You are a great guy...

841
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:00,344
You're a wonderful guy,

842
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,660
And you may even be
The better guy.

843
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:06,332
But...

844
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,843
He's the one.

845
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:09,386
And i wish he wasn't.

846
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:14,706
He's gonna hurt you again...

847
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:18,512
And when he does,

848
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,543
I won't be here.

849
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:28,159
<i>mistakes are painful...</i>

850
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,141
Take care of yourself,
Meredith.

851
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:35,173
<i>but they're the only way
To find out who you really are.</i>
