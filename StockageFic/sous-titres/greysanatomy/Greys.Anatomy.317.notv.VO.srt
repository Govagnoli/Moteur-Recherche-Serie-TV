1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,371
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:03,822
I raised you to be
an extraodinary human being.

3
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,366
Imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

4
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,883
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

5
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,014
An hour ago, he was proposing.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,621
And now he's going to the morgue.

7
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:13,823
You did good.

8
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:19,048
Do you believe in heaven?

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,514
<i>There are medical miracles.</i>

10
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:28,420
<i>Being worshippers
at the altar of science,</i>

11
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:31,548
<i>we don't like to believe
miracles exist.</i>

12
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,689
<i>But they do.</i>

13
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:36,553
<i>Things happen.</i>

14
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,039
<i>We can't explain them,</i>

15
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:41,682
<i>we can't control them...</i>

16
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,368
<i>But they do happen.</i>

17
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,947
Chief, I know the hypothermia

18
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,643
is protective to
her vital organs, but...

19
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:50,428
How much longer do you think
we can go on like this?

20
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,321
I've seen people last
as long as four hours.

21
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,232
- Yeah, but you--
- No, this is not--

22
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,025
This is Ellis Grey's little girl.

23
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:58,508
- This is my--
- We're all on the same side here chief.

24
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:00,914
Sir...

25
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:07,289
Her body temp is at 86 degrees.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,845
She is not dead
until she is warm and dead.

27
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:12,605
We need to warm her up to 98.6
and start her heart.

28
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:13,638
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,908
Let's do a gastric lavage
with warm fluids.

30
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,517
- Addison.
- I have to go. I--

31
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:27,906
- It's my Jane Doe.
- Just--

32
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,259
They're waiting...

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,136
for you. So...

34
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,556
Whatever you choose to say will...

35
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,303
<i>Miracles do happen in medicine.</i>

36
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,106
<i>They happen every day.</i>

37
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,427
<i>Just not always
when we need them to happen.</i>

38
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,779
Meredith?

39
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,976
- She's freaking out.
- She's not freaking out.

40
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,126
- People tend to freak out.
- Trust me, she's fine.

41
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:13,415
Oh, okay, Mr. I been dead longer,
knows everything.

42
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,283
You know what? That's why I
don't like to be here with you,

43
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:18,128
Because you don't assess the situation.
You just dive right in.

44
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,152
I'm not the one
who got himself all blown up.

45
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:22,216
All right, you wanna do this now
or you wanna do this later?

46
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,247
- I-I wanna do this now.
- You wanna do this now?

47
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:26,478
I will kick your ass anytime.
I'm the one with a fresh heart.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,260
- You're gonna kick my--
- This is the brain thing.

49
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,596
This is the ketamine
neurotransmitter thing, right?

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,279
- No.
- No.

51
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,664
'Cause you'd think
if this were my brain

52
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,359
doing this, the first person
I'd want to see, no offense,

53
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:38,694
would be...

54
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,225
Doc!

55
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,370
What a good boy.

56
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:44,376
Hi.

57
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:46,875
Hi, buddy.

58
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:47,983
Meredith.

59
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,527
This is not your brain on drugs.

60
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,726
This is death. You are dead.

61
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,876
You're really freakin' dead.
You're dirt-nap dead.

62
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,069
No-more-you dead.

63
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,939
Way too harsh. Remember, we--

64
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,195
We're gonna take it easy.
That was not easy.

65
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,678
Meredith...

66
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,917
You drowned, in Elliott Bay.

67
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,504
You remember that?

68
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,594
Yeah, that sucked.

69
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,955
Who's a good boy?

70
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,420
Who's the best dog?

71
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,688
- Oh, this is gonna take a while.
- <i>Who's the best dog?</i>

72
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,889
- <i>Who's such a good boy?</i>
- We don't have a while.

73
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,403
She's running out of time.

74
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,901
Who's the best dog?

75
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,086
Tell me.

76
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,992
Her temp's still only 86.

77
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,339
There's still no heartbeat.

78
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,516
- We're hoping once she warms up--
- I want to go in there.

79
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,293
There's a risk of brain damage.
I need to go in.

80
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:38,520
Derek, you can't, not for
Meredith, not for anybody.

81
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,431
You're in no shape.

82
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,971
- You're in no shape.
- Is she still cyanotic?

83
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,032
What was her initial temp?

84
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,037
- I mean, what is taking so long?
- Dr. Yang...

85
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:51,564
It's not good.

86
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,689
They're doing everything they can.

87
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,384
I... You should maybe, um...

88
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:58,965
prepare yourselves.

89
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:02,995
I have to go.
Uh, my Jane Doe's awake.

90
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:04,441
I'm coming with you.

91
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,981
Iz, you'll let us know?

92
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,619
Prepare ourselves? That's...

93
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,762
That's what we tell the families
before we call time of death.

94
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:11,945
She's gonna be okay.

95
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:13,100
Sometimes you're wrong.

96
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:20,595
No.

97
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,271
- Cristina--
- I am not doing this.

98
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:23,980
Cristina.

99
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,203
She's gonna survive this.

100
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,409
She's gonna survive this.

101
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:37,391
She's gonna survive this.
She's gonna survive--

102
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,287
Meredith.

103
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:41,442
Meredith.

104
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:43,867
I don't know if you remember me.

105
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,642
I was your mother's scrub nurse.

106
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:47,661
- I died from--
- Liver cancer.

107
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,358
- Bonnie?
- She remembers me.

108
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:54,947
You remember.

109
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,339
You were a very important
patient for her.

110
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,763
What are all of you doing here?

111
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,262
- Is this--
- It's not heaven.

112
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,613
We're here because
you called us here.

113
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:02,802
I didn't. Did I?

114
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,177
Tell us about the water, Meredith.

115
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,355
You do not have the authority
to speak to me in that way.

116
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:14,975
- You are a bug. You understand?
- I need you to hold still!

117
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,315
Go ahead.

118
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,961
Burke usually writes for Lorazepam
when she's like this,

119
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,332
but I don't want to bother him.

120
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:22,196
Do it. Give it to her.

121
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,199
Who do you think you are?

122
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,453
This is a day she should sleep through.

123
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,930
Do you even know what
you're doing?

124
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,118
Get me Richard!

125
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,853
I'm Dr. Montgomery.
You need this oxygen.

126
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,356
I need you to lie back.

127
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,304
No. I'm not-- I'm not supposed

128
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:33,962
- to be here.
- This wasn't in your plan today.

129
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:36,357
I get that. But we're trying
to take care of your baby.

130
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,212
Okay. Now I need you to calm down.

131
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,040
Just-- Just tell her
you're gonna take me home.

132
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,735
Just-- Just talk to my husband.

133
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,586
Th-This is Dr. Karev.
He's my intern.

134
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,191
- What? You're not?
- You lost your I.D.

135
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,979
We don't know where
your family is yet.

136
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,163
But I-I know you.

137
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,323
- You're my--
- No, I found you on the dock.

138
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:58,511
After the accident.

139
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,705
What dock? What accident?

140
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,521
- What happened?
- You were on the ferry.

141
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,751
You don't remember?

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,828
No.

143
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:08,838
What about your name?

144
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:11,955
My name?

145
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,070
I don't know.

146
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,121
I'm having a baby.

147
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:17,037
I should know my own name.

148
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:18,755
I'm having a baby.

149
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,079
I should know my own name.

150
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:24,062
She can't remember anything
from before the accident.

151
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:25,245
It could be head trauma.

152
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,964
It could be psychological
from the shock.

153
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,022
I mean, retrograde amnesia--
It could be just...

154
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,652
- transient, right?
- Well, that's the hope,

155
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,198
but, you know, I'm worried
about her lungs, too.

156
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,273
Get a chest X-ray and an A.B.G.

157
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,738
Hey. You okay? You want
to be with your friends?

158
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,428
No, I'm-- I'm on this.

159
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:41,940
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's just,

160
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,034
I don't know, Meredith
always makes me think--

161
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,997
I don't know, screwed up
people have a chance.

162
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,463
I'm in.

163
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,575
- Start the warm fluids.
- Hold C.P.R.

164
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,254
Anything?

165
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,357
Her heart is still.

166
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,795
No movement,
no fibrillation.

167
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:04,326
Nothing?

168
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,119
Nothing.

169
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:08,721
Restarting C.P.R.

170
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,779
Stevens, get out of here.

171
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:12,812
I just...

172
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,536
Oh, my god.

173
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,654
Go back outside and wait,

174
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:17,916
with Yang and O'Malley.

175
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,906
Cr-Cristina isn't, um,

176
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:21,170
she left.

177
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,152
She left in the middle of
her shift? Where did she go?

178
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:44,856
Meredith, I need you to understand.

179
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,719
This is important.
You can't screw around.

180
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,963
All right? There's no time for that.

181
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,888
You don't have the time,
and we don't have the time.

182
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,057
I drowned. That's all.

183
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,992
- I drowned.
- Meredith, please,

184
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,025
listen to us.

185
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,240
You have to listen to us.
You have to!

186
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,729
Oh, no.

187
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,783
I can't find
the source of this bleeding!

188
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,112
I need gloves
and surgical towels.

189
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:21,699
It happens with Bonnie, baby.

190
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,788
You just gotta ride it.

191
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:23,910
I can save her.

192
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,025
- I can start an I.V.
- There's no point.

193
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:29,189
Go to the O.R. and get me
sterilized surgical instruments.

194
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,053
Go.

195
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,210
Go!

196
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,198
Meredith...

197
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,053
Are you ready
to talk about this now,

198
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,768
or you wanna waste
some more time?

199
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,585
It's been over an hour.

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,257
There's a ch--

201
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,574
We need to prepare for
the possibility that--

202
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:58,590
Look, she is young,

203
00:08:58,591 --> 00:08:59,604
she is healthy,

204
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,933
Her temp's going up,
and it's gonna keep going up

205
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,642
and her heart will start again.

206
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,947
That's the only possibility
I'm prepared for.

207
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,860
Do you use moisturizer?

208
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,174
Here. Take this.

209
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,035
Keep it behind the bar.

210
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,274
It smells like
something burning.

211
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,213
It's gingerbread.

212
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,445
You're not getting this, are you?

213
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,023
Okay, this is 99 cents.

214
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,615
Okay? You can buy anything
for 99 cents.

215
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:32,790
It's small. It's, um,

216
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:33,962
a tiny size.

217
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,879
It has, uh, cat-type creatures on it.

218
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,344
But it is a chair.

219
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,446
For 99 cents, you can buy furniture.

220
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:40,761
That is America, man.

221
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,320
That's Taiwan, man.

222
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,763
You know, this ferry
thing's pretty bad.

223
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,515
- Don't you think you should be--
- I am...

224
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:48,516
coping.

225
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,445
I'm coping.

226
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,201
So, uh, shut up

227
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,272
and, uh, look at all my crap!

228
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,281
Uh, Callie, I'm putting you
in charge of my interns.

229
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:08,501
Put 'em to work
anywhere but here.

230
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:09,998
No, we can't go anywhere.
We have to--

231
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,492
You're concerned. I understand.

232
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,027
There's been a disaster
and there's work to be done.

233
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,126
Go, now.

234
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,109
All right, they need bodies down
in the clinic. Let's go down there.

235
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,560
Hey, Bailey's right.
We can't help Meredith.

236
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,866
All we can do is sit around
and go crazy.

237
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,678
- I-I can't. I need to be here.
- Izzie...

238
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:27,632
Izzie, we're all freaked. We just
need to stay out of the way. Got it?

239
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,337
Let's go.

240
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:34,728
Do you or your immediate family
have a history of cancer?

241
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,427
I don't know.

242
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,625
How about heart disease
or high blood pressure?

243
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:42,846
How about alcohol or drug use?

244
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,314
You don't know any of this, do you?

245
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:46,761
I don't even know the sex
of my baby or if I...

246
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:48,461
married. I mean, I...

247
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,902
I have a ring line, but I don't

248
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,434
have the ring.

249
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,721
So what does that make me?

250
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,378
I-I don't know.

251
00:10:57,702 --> 00:10:58,772
Is it really bad?

252
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,732
You look... I mean, am I gonna...

253
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:03,957
No. No, no, no, no, no.
It's, uh...

254
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,582
It's a friend.
She was in the accident, too.

255
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,217
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,058
Well...

257
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,490
Things are tough all over.

258
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,811
I have no new information about
your loved ones. I'm sorry, but...

259
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,637
We are facing
a serious blood shortage.

260
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,107
So anyone eligible to
donate blood should see me.

261
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:25,148
If you're not sure, see me.

262
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,227
These need to go to the blood bank
for testing. Thanks.

263
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,271
What are those for?

264
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:32,520
Meredith is A/B.

265
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,886
She's been down a long time, but,

266
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,163
you know, she's strong.

267
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,837
- We shouldn't give up.
- I wasn't planning to, but thanks.

268
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:40,784
Okay.

269
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,043
Is this stress related,

270
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,597
or am I doing something specific
to piss you off?

271
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,221
Because believe me,
we need to pull together.

272
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,038
Not "we".

273
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,767
- What?
- You keep going on

274
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,551
about how "we"
need to do this for Meredith

275
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,542
and how strong Meredith is,
like you know her.

276
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:53,547
- I do know her.
- No.

277
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,359
George, Cristina and me, we know her.

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,018
We're her family.
We were here long before

279
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,327
- you and George started fooling around.
- He is my husband.

280
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,845
Stop saying that like it means
something. It's a piece of paper.

281
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,800
You act like it gives
you history or...

282
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,776
weight.

283
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,243
Okay, enough!

284
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:08,337
Enough. I will not be run off.

285
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,961
I am here. George wants me here.

286
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,262
And if you can accept that,
that-- That I love him, too,

287
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:14,468
Then maybe we could be,
I don't know, friends?

288
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,095
Or you can keep on the way you are

289
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,433
and be that person
that George used to know.

290
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,945
You don't get to decide that.

291
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:24,161
- George decides.
- Oh, I know what he'll decide.

292
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,135
And if I were you, I would
think about it long and hard,

293
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,200
Because you cannot afford
to lose another friend,

294
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,778
not when people
around you keep...

295
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:33,996
Keep...

296
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,442
dropping like flies.

297
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,915
Is that what you were
about to say?

298
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,218
So all of you just disappear
at will?

299
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,574
- What happened?
- I drowned.

300
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,368
- That's it.
- Really?

301
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:48,938
Then why are we here?

302
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,168
Again.

303
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:52,430
I can't do this,

304
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,182
if you're gonna keep
saying you drowned.

305
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,276
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt?

306
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,966
You know, when you
came into the E.R.,

307
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,366
you were so brave,

308
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,924
- so strong.
- I was in shock!

309
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,935
And you guys doped me up.

310
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,222
And you know what?

311
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,790
In retrospect, what happened
to me really sucked.

312
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,407
I was young and beautiful, and in love.

313
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,350
I was getting married
in four months,

314
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,815
and then I was dying.

315
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,989
And here you are,

316
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,115
all happy and perky to be dead.

317
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:20,439
You think I want to be here?

318
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,040
I swam. I fought...

319
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,833
hard. The water was cold.

320
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,403
All right, but that thing in the tub,

321
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,774
- what was that?
- It wasn't anything. It was...

322
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,840
You see me in the tub?

323
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,018
I do not see women
in the bathtub.

324
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,023
I wish I saw w--

325
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,321
We know things.

326
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,785
You had to think about it.

327
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,025
No daughter of Ellis Grey could--

328
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,545
This is so not an Ellis Grey thing.

329
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,691
Ah, it's a Derek thing.

330
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,218
- I would never--
- I would.

331
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:45,726
I know crappy things
haveappened to you,

332
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,190
but how can you be a surgeon

333
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:49,295
and have so little
respect for life?

334
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,684
How...

335
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,259
Oh, come on.

336
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:06,348
Who are you here for?

337
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:11,194
- What?
- I'm waiting on my wife.

338
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:12,669
Car hit her.

339
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,420
Can you believe that,
on the ferry?

340
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:18,436
She was run over on the ferry.

341
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:21,975
They haven't said much.

342
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:25,159
Hard as hell to get any of
these people to talk to you.

343
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,323
Yeah, I'm, uh...

344
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,492
My girlfriend was there, too.

345
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,409
And I don't know...

346
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:36,691
I don't know what's gonna happen.

347
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,264
It's out of our hands.

348
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:41,513
It's up to the doctors now.

349
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,477
Yeah.

350
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:45,176
Yeah.

351
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:49,751
What's her name?

352
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,281
Meredith.

353
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:56,502
I'll put her in my prayers.

354
00:14:58,652 --> 00:14:59,657
Thanks.

355
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:15,374
I need to get in there and find
the source of this bleeding.

356
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,304
Honestly, Mer, it's--
It's just gonna happen again.

357
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:19,511
Where is something
to wipe up this blood?

358
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:26,757
Fool me once...

359
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,432
Oh, good, yeah. Show up now,

360
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:29,493
be a smart-sss.

361
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:31,437
We have a job to do. Where are you?

362
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,370
You know, it's a waste of time.
She's either gonna get it,

363
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,472
- or she's not.
- Get what?

364
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:37,091
The way I see it, it doesn't
matter how you got here.

365
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,450
You're either in this thing
or you're not.

366
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,831
There is no in between.

367
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,887
And cowboy here
can get pissed off,

368
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,793
because for all his tough talk,

369
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,349
he's no different from Bonnie.

370
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,589
He's stuck.

371
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:48,917
- And you're not?
- No.

372
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,950
- Oh, please.
- Stop.

373
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,307
I had a good life.
I helped when I could.

374
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,432
And when that shell
went off in my hands,

375
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:55,985
I completed my task.

376
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,784
I saved you.

377
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:05,687
What about another epi?

378
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:07,903
We've been pushing epi for
an hour and a half now.

379
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,011
Check another lead.

380
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:15,140
Asystole on three leads, sir.

381
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,535
- What about her temp?
- Down to 86 degrees.

382
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:18,431
86?

383
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,560
It's 86 now? It was 89.

384
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,475
Afterdrop phenomenon.

385
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:49,514
Water. Get me some water.

386
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,403
You broke her.

387
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,638
You call her ordinary.

388
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,968
You taught her time and time again

389
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,292
that nothing she does,

390
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,198
ever, is good enough.

391
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,583
Every good thing Meredith is...

392
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,338
happened despite you.

393
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,378
She may not survive this,

394
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,153
and that's on you.

395
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:30,284
- That is on you.
- Derek.

396
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,507
- The woman is just--
- She's a black hole,

397
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,892
there's no question.
But she can't help herself,

398
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,653
And she certainly can't fix Meredith.

399
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,746
It's my fault.

400
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,660
- Don't.
- See, I knew what was going on,

401
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,659
and I wasn't there for her.

402
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,316
- You were human.
- She was pulling away from me,

403
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,161
and I just...

404
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,880
I... I just...

405
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,402
You think that she went
in the water on purpose?

406
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,280
She knows how to swim.

407
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,918
She's a good swimmer.

408
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,605
Derek, you don't know that she's...

409
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,056
No, you do not get to break down.

410
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,512
You do not get to fall apart,

411
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,080
not when there's still a chance,

412
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,005
and there still is a chance,
derek. Okay?

413
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:16,692
Okay.

414
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,195
Okay.

415
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:31,948
What are you looking for?

416
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,366
Something strong.

417
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,194
The next time Bonnie
decides to bleed out,

418
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,578
I'm gonna dope her
to high heaven and--

419
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,827
Why are we still talking about her?

420
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,344
If I can find the source--

421
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,752
She can't be saved.

422
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,048
This isn't fair.

423
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,249
I could save her.

424
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,057
If you'd just give me a chance,
I could save her.

425
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,625
What happened in that water?

426
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:50,662
I swam.

427
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,198
- I fought.
- No, you didn't.

428
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:55,040
And you can't stay here, Meredith.

429
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:56,787
I don't want to!

430
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:58,336
Yeah, you do.

431
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:01,333
It's easier.

432
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,126
But you can't,

433
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,061
because George's dad died,

434
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,488
because Izzie lost me.

435
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,605
And Cristina?

436
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,953
When she was 9, she was in
a car accident with her father,

437
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,009
and he bled out right in front of her

438
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,492
while they waited for
an ambulance to arrive.

439
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:15,497
- And Alex--
- Stop.

440
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,066
They are barely breathing.

441
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:18,663
This will break them.

442
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,264
And none of them deserves that.

443
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:23,951
And this--

444
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:25,938
This is the big one...

445
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,548
So you pay attention.

446
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:31,498
Do you know what kind
of miracle it is

447
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,024
that Derek is who he is?

448
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:37,676
Do you know how rare it is that
someone like him even exists?

449
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,906
He's still an optimist.

450
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,546
He still believes in...

451
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,668
true love and magic and...

452
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:46,180
soul mates.

453
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:47,692
He's waiting for you,

454
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,664
and if you don't
come back from this,

455
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,762
you will change who he is.

456
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,113
Oh, god.

457
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,436
Code blue.
Code blue.

458
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,552
What about a cardiopulmonary bypass?

459
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,312
Come on. We could do it here.

460
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:45,930
Page Burke and the surgical team.

461
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:46,953
Get him here now.

462
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,259
One, two, three, four...

463
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:52,490
You know, this is--
This is quality sudoku, Joe.

464
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,349
This is, like, $2 worth of sudoku.

465
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,354
Good to know.

466
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,366
No change.

467
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,657
- I thought you should know.
- No kidding.

468
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,863
Well, some do, you know,
come back from this.

469
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,380
You know what? I am not a civilian.
I know the science here.

470
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,277
- It's drinking time.
- Not yet.

471
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,166
You have a responsibility to Meredith.

472
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:14,964
I don't do this stuff.

473
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,865
I mean, you should know.
I go to great lengths.

474
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,861
- You re there when I needed you.
- After.

475
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,431
After I knew you were gonna make it.

476
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,455
Okay, I'm not proud.

477
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,093
Okay? I just...

478
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:31,288
I can't.

479
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:34,677
I can't go back there. I can't--

480
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,452
I can't go back there
and watch her...

481
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:43,017
Listen to me.

482
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,369
This is about you

483
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:48,294
and the woman you call your "person".

484
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,303
And you do know the science here.

485
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:53,805
And if she dies, and you are
sitting here when that happens,

486
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:56,049
I can't see you
coming back from that.

487
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,823
Come and say good-bye to your friend.

488
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,352
I was swimming.

489
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,446
I was fighting.

490
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,175
And then I thought--
Just for a second--

491
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:19,950
I thought...

492
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:24,017
What's the point?

493
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:28,478
And I let go.

494
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:31,895
I stopped fighting.

495
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,249
Don't tell anybody.

496
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,784
Okay.

497
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,172
What?

498
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:05,911
Izzie.

499
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,188
You can see her?

500
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:09,321
No.

501
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:12,512
Sometimes...

502
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,495
We'll be in the same place at...

503
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,087
exactly the same time.

504
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,688
And...

505
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:23,807
Oh, I can almost hear her voice.

506
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,882
It's like I'm touching her.

507
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,686
I like to believe she knows I'm there.

508
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:38,900
That's all you get,

509
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:41,416
that's it,

510
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,228
moments with the people you love.

511
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:44,590
And they'll move on.

512
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,515
And you'll want them to move on.

513
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:49,418
But still, Meredith,
that is all you get,

514
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:50,883
moments.

515
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:52,789
Is this really happening?

516
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,338
I don't know.

517
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,297
This is your afterlife, not mine.

518
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,006
Any change?

519
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:17,165
No.

520
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,686
George come on.

521
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:20,953
We can't do this today--

522
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:22,406
What the hell do you say to my wife?

523
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,617
- I didn't say anything.
- I saw her face.

524
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:24,748
- She was--
- I saw here face.

525
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:25,941
She didn't say anything, but why?

526
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,893
Why would you pick now to throw down?

527
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:28,898
I didn't.

528
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:29,950
I...

529
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,285
I can't lie about how I feel.

530
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:33,374
Actually, you can.

531
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,252
You can. People lie all the time.

532
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:37,442
They hold their tongues
and they wait.

533
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,441
You should hold your tongue
because if I'm not making a mistake,

534
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,037
you're gonna look like a jerk,
and if I am, I'm gonna need you.

535
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,594
I need you,

536
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:45,528
and you-- You keep taking that away.

537
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:55,111
Place the C02 monitor.

538
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,566
- Did you page Dr. Burke?
- He's in trauma

539
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,331
doing cardiopulmonary bypass.

540
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,160
- On Meredith Grey?
- Yes, sir.

541
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,325
All right. Okay, push 1 of atropine.

542
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,753
Billy, what's her temp?

543
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,264
We're up to 96.

544
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,641
That's good. Good. All right.

545
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,223
Now we just have to get
her heart beating.

546
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,186
Okay, draw an A.B.G.
Push 1 of epi,

547
00:25:17,187 --> 00:25:19,139
a gram of mag and an amp of calcium.

548
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:20,913
I don't want to be here.

549
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:22,087
I want to go back.

550
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,956
We were told there wasn't
a lot of time.

551
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:25,627
- I'm out of time?
- Well...

552
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,890
- We're not sure, baby.
- Oh, god.

553
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:29,036
I can't...

554
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:30,503
I w--

555
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:33,873
I-I had intimacy issues.

556
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,070
- Yeah.
- Do you know

557
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,981
how stupid that seems now?

558
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,986
- Yeah, I do.
- It's not enough.

559
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:41,793
It's not enough,
just a whiff of Derek

560
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:44,309
or just-- Or Cristina.

561
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,962
I need to go back.

562
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,380
Please.

563
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,812
I can't-- I can't...

564
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:54,460
This is not gonna happen, not today.

565
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:56,348
You're not gonna die
on me today, not today.

566
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,218
V-fib. Give me the paddles.

567
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,350
Clear.

568
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:04,802
How many epis is that?

569
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,525
- Six.
- What's the external pacer?

570
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,632
- It's not catching.
- Billy, What's her body temp?

571
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:10,313
- 98.
- So she's warm?

572
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:11,716
Yes.

573
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,467
And dead.

574
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:31,199
V-fib.

575
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,551
That looks like V-fib.

576
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,715
Shock her at 300.

577
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,480
- Charged.
- Clear.

578
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,626
You cannot give up.
You understand me?

579
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,532
Do you know how much time and...

580
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,585
effort and energy and-- And--
And resources and...

581
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,323
drugs...

582
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:55,815
You cannot give up.

583
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,080
Turning the pacer up to max.

584
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,385
If there was any ounce
of activity,

585
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,094
the pacer would've picked it up.

586
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,787
She's been on bypass for...

587
00:27:22,562 --> 00:27:23,707
almost an hour.

588
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:39,858
Cristina.

589
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,133
I can't breathe.

590
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,710
This will pass.

591
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,724
It won't.

592
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,161
It feels like...

593
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,258
Mom?

594
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,374
Go.

595
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:27,257
Go, Meredith.

596
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:52,844
Try again.

597
00:28:58,174 --> 00:28:59,404
Try again!

598
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,737
Okay, one more round
of A.C.L.S. Drugs?

599
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:15,593
One more.

600
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:27,024
Still V-fib. Okay, charge to 300.

601
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:28,864
Clear.

602
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:41,667
You shouldn't be here.

603
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:46,016
Neither should you.

604
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,059
Just keep going.

605
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,462
Don't be a damn...

606
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,438
You are...

607
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,106
You are anything
but ordinary, Meredith.

608
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,293
Now run.

609
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,201
Run.

610
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,426
- Is the lidocaine in?
- Yes.

611
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,257
Okay, holding compressions.

612
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:34,787
Come on.

613
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,572
Come on, Ellis. Come on.

614
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:37,886
Come on.

615
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,295
Sinus brady.

616
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:04,676
We got a heartbeat.

617
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:10,319
We got it.

618
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:38,681
She's breathing on her own?

619
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:39,996
She is.

620
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:45,977
She's been down a long time.

621
00:31:47,314 --> 00:31:48,741
Do we know the brain function yet?

622
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:50,169
We don't know.

623
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:53,337
- Derek, does, um--
- I haven't paged him yet.

624
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:54,469
I wanted to...

625
00:31:58,211 --> 00:31:59,910
I'm giving her more time.

626
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,349
Did you say something?
Did you just speak?

627
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,481
Oh, Meredith.

628
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,928
Okay, Mer, I don't understand you.
Okay? Try--

629
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:38,491
Try again. Try again--
Try again for me, okay?

630
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:44,527
What? I, um...

631
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:46,377
I can't...

632
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,649
Please, please don't be...

633
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,373
Your brain works. Okay?

634
00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:58,791
So all you need to do
is form a word.

635
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,213
Please.

636
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:07,708
Ouch.

637
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,530
Oh, god.

638
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,370
Hi.

639
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,156
I'm getting married to Burke.

640
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,316
Not that that should be anywhere

641
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:32,166
on your list of thoughts right now,
but just in case,

642
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,091
you slip in the hall later or...

643
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,591
You are the one person
I wanted to tell.

644
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:48,294
Thank you for not dying.

645
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,780
Hey.

646
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,577
Hey.

647
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:11,773
Meredith...

648
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,656
My mother's dead, isn't she?

649
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:19,031
Yes.

650
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:23,266
It's okay...

651
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,713
I think.

652
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:36,133
I think it's okay.

653
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,056
So she's okay?

654
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,103
Yeah.

655
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:56,666
We never had that.

656
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:58,393
He never...

657
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:00,506
felt that way about me.

658
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:05,116
I did.

659
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:11,184
You know, sometimes
I think what a waste

660
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:13,008
it is to throw away
all that history.

661
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:14,407
I'm flawed.

662
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:16,397
I'm a--

663
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,855
A wreck.

664
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,545
But you--

665
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:21,301
It wasn't a game.

666
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,690
60 days.

667
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,338
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

668
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,967
60 days cold turkey, then maybe...

669
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,229
I'll believe you.

670
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,630
So I only have sex with you.

671
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:39,493
No.

672
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,184
No sex with anyone.

673
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:43,602
Grow up, Mark.

674
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,651
Find another way
to scratch the itch.

675
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,454
Say I do. You'll give us a try,

676
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:51,077
a real try? The couple thing--
No sneaking around, No booty calls?

677
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:52,242
If you make it, yes.

678
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,186
Okay.

679
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,745
We're on.

680
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:58,413
Oh, and, Addison?

681
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,310
If I'm not having sex,
neither are you.

682
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:03,681
Who would I possibly
be having sex with?

683
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:10,046
How you doing?

684
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,098
I hurt all over.

685
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:14,072
How's your friend?

686
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,330
Well, she pulled through.

687
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,377
Good. That's great.

688
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,327
And... nobody's...

689
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:22,834
Claimed you? No. No, nothing yet.

690
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,646
So we still don't know anything?

691
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:27,031
Oh, oh, no, not so. We, uh,

692
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,648
learned a lot about you today.

693
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:31,159
Well, we know that
your heart is healthy.

694
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:34,248
We know that your blood type
is B-positive.

695
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:36,015
You probably eat pretty healthy,

696
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,578
because your cholesterol level
is excellent and you're not diabetic.

697
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,363
Your lungs don't look like
smoker's lungs,

698
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:42,917
and you don't drink alcohol
on ferries in the morning.

699
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:45,684
And you're about, uh,

700
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,383
32 years old.

701
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,461
And your baby is a girl.

702
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,024
Really?

703
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,496
A girl?

704
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,139
Yeah.

705
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:13,215
And I think I am married.
I feel married.

706
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:14,323
Yeah?

707
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:15,408
Yeah.

708
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:18,239
See, now I know more about you
than some of my closest friends.

709
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:22,528
That's pathetic.

710
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:27,516
Held it down.

711
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:28,971
Thanks.

712
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,553
What you did today
with Meredith...

713
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,686
Everybody's talking.

714
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,301
Chief resident talk.

715
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,663
Okay, I'm talking-- To myself--
But...

716
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:42,565
You're gonna give me a run
for my money.

717
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:48,377
Yeah, I am.

718
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:00,751
I let you down.

719
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,897
And I get it
if you don't trust me right now.

720
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:05,155
But...

721
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,429
Please, George.

722
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,565
It's me.

723
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:14,895
It's us.

724
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,196
Please.

725
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:28,987
<i>At the end of a day like this,</i>

726
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,931
<i>a day when so many prayers
are answered,</i>

727
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,025
<i>and so many aren't...</i>

728
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,033
You've been gone a long time.

729
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,607
I know you think died
when the Alzheimer's started.

730
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,856
I know it's a relief to you.

731
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:55,409
I know.

732
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,404
But it doesn't feel like
a relief to me.

733
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:04,801
I'm not relieved.

734
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,040
I miss the sound
of your voice.

735
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,038
I miss talking to you.

736
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:18,747
I miss you.

737
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,389
I dyed my hair...

738
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:35,060
for the ladies.

739
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,706
<i>We take our miracles
where we find them.</i>

740
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,727
<i>We reach across the gap...</i>

741
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,380
<i>And sometimes...</i>

742
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,990
<i>against all odds...</i>

743
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,187
<i>against all logic...</i>

744
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:13,591
<i>we touch.</i>

745
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:30,422
Izzie.
